rating,review
bad,I worked for this company for years.. I worked in visual and inventory and it was like slave work ... With very little pay .. ok for a teen .. no flexibility in hours  . And your job isn't secure ... My hours were cut for being out on maternity leave... I went from 10 hour days to barely 5 a day at 3 days a week no real growth potential.
bad,cannot give a review was not employed long enough to form an opinion of the company or workplace seemed alright while I was there it is like mist other hire companies
bad,"Management is very poor in knowledge. Don't like when employees buy with discount. They like to hire employees all the time, so they decrease employees hours. If you look for a job, just drop your resume at the door that they will hire you, give hours for 2 weeks, and that's it!"
bad,This is why gap is going down.there is no support to the employee.customer would call that they did not receive there package.And maybe this customer has a history package is always missing.But because supervisor don't like to take escalated calls.they just tell you send them another package.people as quit .not a good place to work at all.the stress level is so high. Its not even funny
bad,Horrible work environment long hours  low pay  short breaks and excessive amounts of work with no resting periods the production has increased tremendously to the point that the average worker can't meet basic standards. Management is the worst telling the workers to work harder and faster with no compassion that some workers have health issues.
bad,"They never let you breathe. Even if there is no work, they will keep adding work and make you stay for longer hours without extra breaks. I had a ligament injury and my foot was recovering they didn’t give me any leave and asked me to come to shift when i tried to give it away to someone who was ready to work."
bad,I was hired at the end of the summer. They were starting  their holiday prep. I am a mother four and was going to school too. At first they gave me decent hours. And then for no reason at all they started giving me only 4 hrs here and there. When I started back to class I. January they had me off the schedule for 3 weeks with no communication then when they put me back on it was on school days
bad,"MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE! Almost all of the managers that work there act like 5 year old kids. They don’t respect anyone they expect the whole store to look fantastic but only scheduled 3 people to work?? And while expecting that, there sitting in the back stuffing there faces with food"
bad,The Gap could be a good place if the management didn't treat everyone like they were ex-felons.  A typical work day was standing on your feet for 3 hours with a 20 min break just to stand on your feet for another 3 hours.  Management was horrible.  They micromanaged all the time.  The job requires a lot of standing so it puts strain on your back.  The hardest part of the job is standing with no relief.  The management wants you to work like slaves.  The most enjoyable part of the job is you might meet someone who could be a life long friend.
bad,I'm going to keep this short my time working there was short but I have to say its terrible after awhile I start to see why people come and go here its not the customers its the managers and coworkers sure the coworkers are cool but the managers don't do anything and sit on their butt while the rest of us basically where rushing to finish our work its a lot of insults being thrown around.
bad,In GAP there is discrimination with Hispanics. The manager paid me less than other people even though I knew how to do many things. I went to ask for an increase because I was already 6 months old and I saw that new people who had no experience and were earning more.
bad,"I was a cashlead at Gap for a a year and previously a regular associate for another year. I spent 2 years of my life working at this horrible job, with horrible management. Managers did not give a  Kumquat  about their employees. I called out one day because my uncle was in the hospital and the manager’s response was that I would be written up bc he wasn’t immediate family. He passed away shortly after while I was actually at work. I started crying, packed my things, told them what happened and that I was leaving. I come in my next shift and they docked me for leaving early. There is no sympathy for anyone. I had never called out of that job and anytime I was called in, I would rush to work. I would work 57-60 hours some weeks. More than the managers themselves. It was horrible, I hope they go out of business in the Dolphin mall location. :)"
bad,"The scheduling is way too inconsistent. They force you to sign up for their membership program. (be it you shop there or not) When your shift has ended they don't release you until they want to, without notifying you.I recently was let go from the company without any formal notification. I knew of my position's elimination through the app. This was done after not being scheduled for three weeks."
bad,"Don't work at this location. management sucks, was always sick from the CHUNKS of dusk there was everywhere. nasty building, break room looks like garbage, very disgusting!! (feel sorry for some guest that have to go back there go to the restroom) I'm SUREE nothing is up to code in there. management is horrible, plays favorites. WORST JOB I EVER HAD. im glad i quit when i did. the bosses are nothing but rude and disrespectful. always on your cases to sell reward cards even for STOCK employees that work 5-10am. the store doesn't even open till 10. manager quotes,"" i will make all you apply for a credit care if we don't make sales."" HAHAH got me messed up, i could go on and on. JUST DONT WORK AT SAN MARCOS. you'll regret it."
bad,"You’ll have no life. You wont be able to ever call off in an emergency, and the management makes you stay 5 pr so hours after closing on holidays just to clean. You cant have any of your own style without being yelled at. Was told by management that younger people are stupid and not worth hiring."
bad,Worst management ever! Don't work at the Chinook location. You'll regret it! Management hides in the office most of their shift bossing everyone around.  Too lazy to go up the stairs.  Treat you like garbage!!
bad,"Sadly a typical day at Gap for Help desk is rushing thru calls so that the overall call queue can be lowered. There is no focus on IT support or attempting for first call resolution or even attempting to prevent call back for issues that remain unresolved due to lack of ability to perform basic IT support. The culture here is typical of call center, keep to yourself , dont talk to others and only communicate in IM and emails, the environment is bad as the management is more focus on their social life and interaction then managing the floor. Nearly half the employee that are currently engage dont even take any inbound support calls now a day and the queue that is suppose be maintained is slow fading away as calls grow and grow as the hold times near 10 to 15 minutes per user. Hardest part about this job is listening to the management constantly say  ""Limit your after call time, Grab that Emergency line""  like we dont know the basics of our job already, we just dont have the people to operate within the standard operating procedures but that goes right over their heads as they think 25 people over the course of 24 hours can manage a call center that gets 350 to 500 calls a day. The only enjoyable experience is the co-workers , we strive to survive the stress and  sour environment as we stay aboard the sinking ship."
bad,I was promised a promotion many times and the Gap continued to bring in outside people for me to train for the position i was promised.  Most of the management do not know the jobs they are given
bad,Management is unfair with shifts given to part-timers. They make different people work 3hour shifts only per day and swap out multiple employees so that the company saves money.  They switch around ppl's designated roles while working a shift. They have unrealistic and unfair expectations for how long it takes to clean up/ fold clothes on a certain table/display/department. Managers often are overstressed and have a tendency to speak with clipped tones or a bad attitude when talking to their inferiors. Promotions are given based on favouritism. Those not in the manager's favour are seldom praised on jobs well done and rarely promoted.
bad,"Dont work there if you have bills. They dont give enough hours to pay rent or cable bill! "
bad,not so great of a place to work. lie about payroll so they dont have to give you hours and the employees signup ppl up for Credit cards even if the person says no.
bad,"They will use and abuse you "
bad,Wrk hrs sucks. GM never closes. If you wrk 5 days out of the 5 you are closing 3-4days. Not flexible with hrs and they dont have your best interest. High turnover with staff and management.
bad,"Sad place to work, no professional managers they don't teach you the work they just expect you to know how to already, managers wanna make you do there work by offering you there hours and still hit you with the your only part time worst job in retail they should close all the stores and try again I would recommend macys retail over this trash box job anyday what happened to jobs and managers who really actually cares. Smh corporate should really get involved and not just for Tuesday morning meetings. Motto mention they are very racist can't run a business properly when employees feel like slaves smdh."
bad,They will promise you things that they can’t deliver. They will also racially profile most of the customers coming into the store. Management will also lie to your face.
bad,The management are useless and so is the pay and treated like a piece of rubbish make u work all hours and never any overtime if you do any they tell u it be time owed
bad,never get benefit and other more  i not interesting their the gap store  they give us cut off hours and dont care that why i leaving they never give extra hour to work.
bad,"Working at Gap, I felt under appreciated. It was like any other retail job, however, the management were not proactive about considering the needs of the employees."
bad,The company is not the problem. It's the people that work for the company. They run the store as if it has their name outside not making it a great place to work.
bad,"I worked for Gap store in Downtown Seattle for almost 3 years, I really enjoy working for the company, I had nice supervisors. Until recently got new manager and supervisor who always stress everyone at the store if you didn't get emails, get gap card and meet money goals. We got blame for everything. Enryone has quit at this place because of management. There're better places to work than here. I didn't like the environment anymore, its really stressful and disorganize. I never got lunch and breaks on time. Lack of management, leadership and ethics its missing at this location. "
bad,This place is horrible im talking about gap roofing if osha walked in there it would take about 10 seconds to be shut down if they did it without warning the place is barely held together
bad,"the management team was the worse! The hours were okay, but the job environment was toxic. mangers were super lazy. they Favorited certain people and mistreated some."
bad,"Management is Poor"
bad,It is not a job for adults with responsibilities...the pay is min wage and the hours are the leas than 20 a week. The only perks is you could get a discount but the prices are still.so high.
bad,"You will work your hardest and accomplish so much for the company, in return they will decline your annual pay raise and block any career advancement. I trained 5 leaders that made a lot more then i did and of those 5 all left once fully trained. I applied every time one left and was told i lacked the necessary skill set to lead. After helping the company close 10 stores out of hundreds closed i decided that the time had come to abandon ship. I haven't been happier with a single choice so in my life. Stay away!"
bad,"-immature management"
bad,"Retail is what you expect. Long hours and some tough customers here and there are a given. "
bad,"The gap is an awful place to work. No time for a life or anything. You work long hours for little pay and management treats you like garbage, No one cares about you they only care about themselves cant even use the bathroom without being questioned."
bad,"- άγνοια εκπαίδευσης προσωπικού"
bad,"Don't work if you want to live off wages. ="
bad,"The Gap in Fallen Timbers Ohio is such an incredible toxic environment. People constantly feel targeted and belittled  while working here. The money isn't bad, but the environment is so terrible that it isn't worth the money."
bad,"now, this job is extremely easy, pretty slow-paced (mostly). the problem is how employees are treated. "
bad,"GAP needs to work on not overcrowding their stores with product, as there was not enough room in our store to keep up with the shipments received. Their customer base is rude, and The GAP emboldens them to act in such a way. I would never search for employment there again, not even as a last resort — I’d almost rather be homeless."
bad,GAP does not value it's associates and does not have strong management. It also does NOT foster an environment that allows for customer connections. It is not a place to work if you enjoy talking to customers and building those connections to make them repeat customers and drive sales. This is also not somewhere to work if you want to enjoy coming to work.
bad,"rubbish company back in the stone age, so archaic it is untrue. Making doors for free with no customer services and no respect for their customer. Awful place to work"
bad,"Store management is horrible, you will be treated in a poor manner not have a single ounce of positive reinforcement from your managers. If you voice to them about your concerns, you will be scolded and hours will magically be cut. You will get little to no hours and will be treated in a unprofessional manner. I have gone 3 weeks with no hours at all with full availability and this job before. If you're looking for good management and a job to pay the bills this is not it."
bad,Assistant manager at that time was not very helpful.  She was very biased towards employees.  Had personal favorites.  Was not a good environment to work in
bad,"No career advancement, part time manager positions, and under pay employees while only giving them 4 hour work shifts. Even doing all of that, they still don't give you job security. One week you'll work 35 hours and the next 2 months you'll only work 8 hours."
bad,In house software programs that operate like they were designed by someone on their first day of class or spare time. Everyday you have to hunt for a new cube to sit in. This job just sucked. I like the brands but would never advise anyone to work at the call center.
bad,The store manager at the wichita ks location was a complete joke. Laziest manager I've ever worked for. I have over 18 years in retail management  and I have never seen someone sit in the office for 8 hours a day every day. The store was a mess and had a lot of opportunities that needed attention. The store manager was a waste of payroll.. Many people have called corporate on this so called manager and no action has been done. Wouldn't work here
bad,good job for first time workers or want money while going to college but definitely not a company you need to work for more than 2 years as a young adult. get your experience and GOOOO
bad,"I worked at Gap for a [gladly] short-period of time.  I had the most horrible experience. Nobody has treated me so badly as these people had. I strongly believe that Gap Inc. is a low-key cult. This company treats its employees as if they are robots. Its mission, especially for consultants, is to listen to customers' complain of empathy. Customers complain all the time, most of the time using mean and derogatory words. In spite, managers expect employees to be nice to them; almost telling us to kiss their behind. The culture at Gap is to be nice to customers, even if they are not.  However, managers (I wish I remember their manes) are the meanest people in this company. They act as if they are God's gift. It was time for me to go!"
bad,On a regular work day it was always understaffed with heavy work load. great work go unrecognized. always had to stay over time pass work availability.
bad,Great location but management was horrible . Felt like I was in high school all over agin . Clicks and mean people . I will never work for gap in Oakland agin
bad,Staff is extremely strict and rude. The days go by extremely slow. I've never felt more insignificant in a job before in my life. Worst possible job in the market
bad,"Unavailable boss, Goals not defined, Workloads not managed or clearly delegated. Upper management that didn't act when issues came up with boss. Boss permanently changed my job role while I was recovering from an accident. Lack of Integrity. Lack of Motivation of Others and no Management of Team Relationships. Lack of coaching or development of direct reports. Not politically savvy, generally unprofessional."
bad,it was a mall job paying minimum wage like every other big box brand they expect and demand you meet high robotic quotas as a human and not suppose to feel like a human but a machine at the end of the day.
bad,great place to work . business professional . culture was great. Management style was superb. Promotions every year. Hours were flexible. fun envitoment
bad,Management at 17th and 5th will try you daily. It's horrible. The customer is even worse. No hours and slave you when you are there. Sad place to be employed. If you love vlothes and beed retail experience then its the place to apply.
bad,"Hours vary all the time. 4 Hour shifts only unless you are a favorite. Place can get very messy and loud at times. No team work, very nasty attitudes from the staff, they also ask for alot of favors and when you want an extra day they wont give it to you. By far the worst place I worked. Overnights are worse."
bad,"Firstly, according to work, money is extremely less. "
bad,"Would not have been a horrible job if upper management actually wanted to be there. The store manager is lazy and rude, and very rarely be present on the sales floor. You must be okay with constant gossip and constantly picking up others slack. Mangers and associates have constant drama, and negative comments that bring down the stores production. And make working there very unpleasant."
bad,The employees are very nice and friendly. The managers have a bit of a attitude for some reason. Your told to work faster and harder and not to talk to each other or at all in general.
bad,"They do not care about the employee, they require overtime during the holidays. Are not understanding with employee personal issues. The worst part of the job was having to be yelled at every day from customers"
bad,"Empresa focada na aprovação dos alunos para os concursos do colégio Militar, Aplicação e colégio do Recife."
bad,The pay is nice but the job isn't for everyone. Enjoyed nothing about the job but the pay. Management was horrible. Job placement was horrible. Job security was horrible. They just hire you without really looking at what your qualifications are. Constant speed walking throughout a 10 to 12 hour shift. Complaints go unheard.
bad,Working here I had the worst managers who barely give you any hours although your schedule is open. They are extremely rude and aren't carefully about how they speak to employees.
bad,"Im sure my experience would have been netter if I had a manager who was skilled in employee relations.  Initially my experience was great but unfortunately, a new manager came and changed the climate to one of tension."
bad,"Management is intimidating, uses bullying tactics. Employees are mostly students. Good for starting in retail. Each location may be different, but having worked personally at 3 stores over 5 years, I did not notice much difference."
bad,"If you are not a manager you will only work part time. You will only work about 4 hours each shift. In the beginning you will get okay hours but eventually you will start working once a week if at all. They play favorites so if you are not extra jolly at all times and screaming at the customers/ annoying them, you probably wont be on the schedule much. Expect to be micromanaged and bugged the entire time you're working. Not a company I would want to work for long term."
bad,"Working at Gap quickly became one regrettable decision. The lack of work hours for almost every individual and 40+ for others demonstrated the favoritism towards certain workers. Being consistently understaffed, workers faced unreasonable amounts of workloads coupled with very low wages making Gap Inc. a very unreliable source of income."
bad,"I was shocked when I began working here. Day to day everything is fine except for the pressure to get people to open up the gap credit cards even when it is obviously not in the clients best interest or may even harm their credit score."
bad,Upper management is completely removed from day-to-day. Lack of team work. Hostile and competitive work environment. Insubordinates are promoted within the company.
bad,"pre-season and in-season planning activities. demand forecasting. fun workplace. great co-workers,"
bad,"Wasn't there long enough to even enjoy. management wasn't the greatest, don't think I ever even spoke to any of my managers. A lot of female managers, that felt they had the right to look down on you at any given moment."
bad,it was not fun working here at all. i was just seasonal so no one there even tried to get to know me. they also check your person and your purse anytime you leave the store. Which in the end is understandable. The manager was not nice and all and when she was there (rarely) she would literally just bark orders at everyone. really boosted my work ethic...(sarcasm of course) but if you like stuck up people be my guest.
bad,I've been an employee since July 2007 and overall It's been a great working experience! I've worked at Banana Republic and Gap.  I definitely give it five STARS!
bad,its a great job start up jon for anyone without kids and has all the free time in the world or a young 21 year old looking for work.
bad,"Don't be fooled by the casual dress code. The company was very corporate and highly political. Employees are overworked. Many working 10+ hr days plus weekends with no compensation for the overtime. Management lacked training, oversight and professionalism."
bad,go to work under messy unorganized conditions not knowing if your going to have work or get sent home early or not. hours fluctuate contently. Very drama oriented with the employees management dosent like to do or tell you anything. and they very rarley hire you.
bad,I rarely ever work because the store seemingly has very little hours to spare for more recent hires.
bad,"cashier, organizing all day and night , shipment , censoring complaints , customer accounts"
bad,"The managers don't give you enough hours. It's the worst. They will let you know 2 hours before whether they need your shift for not. I waste my gas just because of that. They pay me below the minimum. The managers are not professional and make you work like a dog. They expect you to do 10 things at a time and pay you little. No matter how hard I work, I still don't get paid enough. The managers look like they care about you, but they don't. So, just fake it at work. If the store doesn't make money, the store manager will cut your hours. Plus, the bosses only care about gap cards and goal of the sales so that they get bonuses in the end of the day. Even though you're on the schedule, he/she will not use your shift. I am just being honest, not rude."
bad,"On a daily basis in store you have a miserable management team who do not communicate with each other and do not get on! You then have people being bullied and being treated unfairly. weekly rotas so nobody can plan around work and if a day off is needed you have to get somebody to cover your shift! This is the worse company I have ever worked for they do not care about there staff or customers!! staff room dirty with mould around sinks bins never changed toilets never working, air con never works so you are bound to get poorly!! "
bad,It is a retail job in a clothing store. Like fashion? Work there.
bad,Gap Distribution Center in Fishkill Ny is a sweat  shop. Management got fired for trashing hotel.lol. Supervisors think they are above everyone else.
bad,"when i worked their i was the only woman of color in the office, and the youngest so at times I felt as though i wasn't good enough for the positioon."
bad,:(  I thought that it would be a fun job after high school but it was long and hard. Very frustrating because customers would ruin a perfectly clean fitting room.
bad,"The store is a big mess. They hire inexperienced people and throw them onto the cash desk. Managers want their paychecks but aren't willing to do the work for it. Would much rather walk around looking busy, or simply go sit in the back office. Scheduling is horrible, 'sure id love to come in for 4 hours in the middle of the day and get cut after 2 hours"". They have a bad habit of calling you on your day off and asking if you can come in for a 4 hour shift. One of the managers got the position in this location as they know one of the district managers, and this person has no idea how to work in a retail store. Which in turn means everyone else working that shift has to pick up the slack."
bad,"Long hours, Pay is low, loved the managers and coworkers though.."
bad,A typicalday working at the GAP outlet was very frustrating managers had favorites and I and a few others were descriminated against by 2 of the managers.
bad,"Computer Skills"
bad,"Working at gap taught me a lot, I learned great team work the customers was my number one top priority working with my employees and mangers as even better it was a very productive workplace to work and the discounts was great"
bad,co-workers and managers are great people to work with. It like having a family
bad,Loved every minute of it. Being on the sales floor. Coaching and developing the sales team.
bad,Poor management. I loved the customers and co workers but management needs improving
bad,"poor management, long hours with no extra pay"
bad,"Everyone there is a bunch of cheaters, scammers, liars.  Management will do anything it takes to suck the life out of you."
bad,i think was the worst job i've ever hadddd. bad management skills 
bad,"a nice place to work,it was ok but hard sometime had to learn a lot plus a lot of training"
bad,it was okay only worked there for a few months... No room for advancement.
bad,"It was fun, I wasn't taught well making the job frustrating."
bad,i learned how to open credit cards. i learned how to b a go getter and challenge myself for the best
bad,"A typical day at Old Navy I am recovering the sales floor so that customers can walk into a beautiful store, greeting everyone, and giving excellent customer service."
bad,Not enough hours
bad,"Training is terrible they leave you out on the floor and yell at you because you don't know what to do. Then when you call three times to get your schedule, they say they don't have time to get it. Then you get yell at because you didn't come to work when you didn't even know you had to come to work. They call you a liar when you say you didn't know when you were supposed to come in.They told me they gave it to me the first night when I trained. And that's wrong because they left me in a department cleaning and never came back to get me to finish my training. When I went to look for someone they have locked the door and gone home.This store in tupelo mississippi is incompetent to train anyone."
bad,overall day is maintaining the fitting room and doing customer service while recovering the store.
bad,"The only thing that is good about working at Gap is 50% discount, which is not even great when the clothes get markdown and then go additional 40% off."
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal at old navy in turlock,ca I only worked one day a week maybe two with a four hour shift if that the lines in the store were crazy long but the manager did nothing to resovle the issue i even heard customers say no way that they would be waiting in line for a small purchase. I have over eleven years experience in the retail sector but was never given a chance to use my customer service skills i never was put on the register they just made most of us do all of there recovery work while they sat at the register and walked around talking and laughing very poor management team with no comunication to the seasonal help felt very okward unnappreciated love old navy but would not recomend working at the one in turlock if you need more than gas money when you get a pay check."
bad,"I worked as a Customer Service Rep at the Call Center in Grove City. The work is mind numbing boring. Your calls are monitored & 'graded', which isn't a problem. The problem is it's the same thing over & over, which is why I left."
bad,"I remember working here, two years back. Unfortunately, the hourly wage that I was promised was not what I was paid. When I asked the hiring manager about this, he told me the hourly wage that was printed on my checkstub was what was 'quoted' to me. Yeah right. I tried contacting their 1800 number to straighten out the problem, but they just kept telling me to contact my manager. I hated standing on my feet all day, the short breaks, and the constant folding and hanging clothes that customers just throw about casually."
bad,"That store has a loss prevention superviser that cant even speak proper english and always smell's like onions, tell's you a lot about there hiring at old navy.... It's very sad how there are highly quaulified people out of work ,and people like that have a job...."
bad,Nothing was wrong at this job just not in the directions of careers I wish to pursue
bad,"There is never enough coverage whether it is early in the morning, mid shifts, or closing. This is something that customers even see. Loss Prevention is something that is almost nonexistent. They are huge advocates for customer service, but if there is only one associate to cover the baby and kids section, meanwhile customers are stealing. It is all about kissing up to management and your hours will be handed to you. Strong leadership is definitely lacking from supervisors all the way up to store manager. The pay rate is definitely not worth it"
bad,"Gap is a bit of a joke really, I was there for a year and most of that we didn’t have a manager, then we finally got one and 4/5 staff members quit. Recently (December ) we were lucky if we were receiving weekly rotas more than a couple of days in advance, despite being promised it 4 weeks in advance so there’s absolutely no work life balance, partly due to that and partly due to the weird hours"
bad,"upper management and HR are no help, I felt penalized for reporting time theft by two ASM'S. No support what so ever from DM or surrounding SM'S."
bad,"The Gap Outlet was nothing special. The Gap Outlet management Team was not great, they would worry about anything other than the employees they staffed. They were very strict about the Gap Card goals and would write you up if you did not meet expectations. I was in the dressing rooms a lot and never on the register."
bad,"Management is ruthless. Total ""Devil Wears Prada"" experience. I developed anxiety working for this company and had to quit. It was probably the worst working experience of my life. They expect you to work night and day. Get ready for no life if you work here."
bad,its the perfect transition job perfect for college students and people just entering the job force company has very high turn over rate few people last over a year
bad,"-Required to complete tasks in unrealistic time frames"
bad,"Eglinton has the worst, most inexperienced General Manager I've ever encountered. She only got the position because she is friends with the Product Manager who works at head office. The individuals who are corporate based can also see her incompetence, but continue to keep her onboard."
bad,"They will not offer full time work, they will make you work overnight shifts, weekends (both days), all bank holidays. The pay is terrible, and it does not increase much as you progress. The clothes are not even worth the discount. Doing 4 hour shifts five days a week is a joke.  "
bad,I have worked for the Gap for 1 year. And I must say I have never experienced a company like this before. The turnover rate for managers is embarrassing. The District Manager is useless
bad,"The worst job experience I have had. Was constantly put in one position daily even asking for a change. I was put by myself to do nothing but “watch” a button for clothes that were stuck on the conveyer belt. 99% of my work time would involve me standing in one area for roughly 8 hours. Phones were not allowed, only for music purposes which is understandable but a person can only go so long having to stand with next to nothing st all to do"
bad,"EVERYDAY something is changing. they spend so much time enforcing a new protocol, and by the time you grasp it, they're changing it to something new. the sales change almost twice a week. no work life balance. you spend your entire life in the store from sun up to sun down. even on your off days you're getting called into the store. schedules get changed and cut every day. no consistency. they are all for themselves."
bad,My store manager in particular was competitive and made the work environment more stressful than it needed to be. Very competitive staff as well. Fast-paced environment.
bad,"Upper management cut hours every month to come in under budget due to low sales, but still expected the same amount of work to be done.   If you were a salary manager, expect to be working bell to bell with no overtime payment.  Good luck on using vacation days.  there are so many black out months, or stores are understaffed, there is no time to take off. No work life balance at all."
bad,"Too many ""higher ups"" stepping on each other to get ahead. A lot of fraternizing and nepotism. No one gets promoted, and they are not being honest with the store closing(s). This company made me get out of retail for good."
bad,"Pathetic is the first word that springs to mind. I worked in this company for years. I've seen a frequent turn over of staff due to certain horrible and vindictive memebers of the managment team who shouldn't be left in charge of dogs let alone people. These certain management members eventually make enemies of each member of staff and only develop or support people to benefit them selves and will happily throw anyone under the bus to save their own skin, even when they know they're in the wrong and haven't carried out tasks by the books (which is often). If you respect yourself you will never work for Gap Oxford."
bad,"This is not a great place to work at. You barely get hours and they always cut hours. Management is very poor. Also, it is a scandalous job. I wouldn’t recommend anyone."
bad,I entered in an internship. The manager was very mean. Always looking down on others and making comments etc. I HAVE met great coworkers. But for the most part the managers weren’t mature and treated me poorly. They expect you to work overtime and change stuff around. The pay isn’t great considering all the work you will do. Work environment was hectic and stressful (which is expected) but if not for crude comments from managers. (I’ve worked for different locations)   They expect you to compete and call your out even if you do your best. (Not talking about me. I met the standards and went above ) but others were put out. Management was poor.
bad,"On my very first day, my manager always had something passive aggressive to say to me. Every other staff member was great and never caught an attitude with me, except the manager."
bad,Stressful job.  Mangers don't help much.  The support stuff that new employees need to call for help are rude and the mangers know it and they approve the bully behavior.
bad,awful management boring place to work coworkers were very unfriendly most of the day consisted of folding clothes and getting barked at to do something someone else was supposed to do.
bad,"After years of working in the business community, I found the work environment very punitive and there was a great deal lacking in their training.  If you were not aware of something and made a mistake accordingly, you were reprimanded rather than the experience being used as a learning tool."
bad,this was a secondary job for me. it was ok but i never really got many hours. they too pick and choose their favorite employees. i eventualy left to something better
bad,They only talk to certain employees. management horrible had three different ones. no time really given. coworkers thought they were above each other. most enjoyable part was break time
bad,"Fun job with a lot of opportunity for career advancement if you are willing to work for it. GREAT benefits. Good support from upper management,"
bad,OK company no room for advancement and a lot of favoritism. Management had no clue how to run a business. They don't care if the lose good employees they rather just have people who are bodies and are not productive.
bad,"Was fun for a college student. Flexible with hours, not a great discount though."
bad,"Perfect environment if you enjoy working with emotionally unstable, belligerent and unprofessional young adults."
bad,We had to be there at 4am on Tuesdays and Fridays sometimes Wednesdays so our typical day would be early mornings. What I learned is being able to try new things and get out of my comfort zone a little. Management I liked a few but most of them I didn't because of they way they treated some of us as a group. I loved my co-workers.. to have a group of people around that makes you feel comfortable and energetic at 4 in the morning and encourage you to get the job done. Hardest part of the day would replenish and having to deal with clothes all over the place. The enjoyable would be working with the register and interacting with customers and again having people around me that just makes me want to come to work everyday.
bad,The managers are awful! They do not communicate with each other at all. And when my fiance was pregnant they were disrespectful to the fact that they tried to get me to work the same day she went into labor and a couple days after the pregnancy while my child was in the NICU.
bad,"this place does not care about their employees. Your GM may care, but not your DM."
bad,"DO NOT work for Gap at Southcentre Mall. There’s over 40+ employees and they keep hiring more, when I’ve been working for a month there already and have only gotten a total of like what, 7 shifts? And the general manager is such a rude person. Even if you’re trying your best, it’s not enough. Don’t waste your time and work some place else! Trust me."
bad,This place is s big high school.the cool kids aka management that talk about all the employees. It's a popularity contest and tha6s how positions are decided. HR is a joke they tell everyone's business to other employees or are SO rude to people that they make them to afraid to speak up if they need help. Seasonal supervisors are treated like grunts only to have their bonuses taken away and told too bad.
bad,Fast paced and changing daily.
bad,The only thing positive i would take away from this job was the expierence in picking and packing that i recieved and the salary. Nothing else stood out for me to write a review about those then those two things
bad,"Shipment of new items and processing them onto the floor, provide customer service, greet and help customers accordingly.  Cash out customers at register."
bad,No support from Quality manager when attempting to advance.
bad,ask you to do something and you would never see them again. Part timers did all the work.
bad,"A typical day at work will be standing for hours constantly folding clothes. I learned how to multitask better and deal with all types of customers. Everyday I am assigned to my own section/zone within the women's or men department in the store and required to finish organizing my section/zone by the end of the night. Most of my co-workers were fun to be around and some were just ignorant who would never help other co-workers with their duties. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the biggest section/zone by myself, including the clearance section, with no help. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure that the customers are satisfied and left the store happy."
bad,The most miserable culture I have ever worked in. The lack of communication and disrespectful communication from management were mind blowing. Supervisors have no integrity.
bad,If your looking for a this type of job for now or in school. This job will work with you. But please dont chose this job as a career. People there will never honor you as an individual.
bad,"I was hired as a customer service representative but was mostly given only overnight shifts ot before-opening shifts."
bad,"Struggling to stay afloat. Too focused on credit cards, it has lost its core values of customer service and good quality product. A company so desperately grasping to remain relevant they lost their culture. It used to be such a great company. Not anymore. General managers need to be more employee orientated and motivational."
bad,"Honestly it’s one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had. I was never trained, they literally just threw me on the floor and I had to figure it out and they always gave attitude whenever I asked a question. I literally worked for 2 months and the gm never even bothered to learn my name, he just called me the name of whatever section I was in. The environment wasn’t friendly at all and neither were the employees but the plus side is that there’s a great work/life balance cause they never give you hours!"
bad,"Culture depends on management and team. A bad manager can make or break the team. Managers and staff are advanced on favoritism and with no actual training on how to manage people. Nothing but drama and gossip. No clear job roles or duties, no back up from store management when assistant managers have trouble with associates."
bad,"People are being harassed, had a talk with HR but they did not doing anything about the person who was harassing other individuals. They are not flexible with scheduling and over time is mandatory."
bad,"Management can’t handle much, stress everywhere, employees sit around all day, no benefits at all, no place for advancement, not worth the drive to even shop for"
bad,"Salaried employees expected to breathe eat, and sleep work. The job itself not terrible except for the long hours. I learned a lot about retail, performance indicators, finance, merchandising etc..."
bad,This store is extremely horrible management staff is terrible they are racist an treat staff with no respect an very unconcerned about there needs they solicit credit card obtained for the store I quote from a present manager “No credit cards no shift for the following week” so basically your where Threatened by the management team who was Orchestrated to do so from the store manager which is a mail and was very discriminating against women employee’s
bad,"I have no complaints thus far. But working there was a hassle. Management were really unfair and some of them would lie as well. They say they're supportive, and work around your school schedule but every time I had class it's either they'll call me DURING class or purposely schedule me through my school times. Knowing they saw my school schedule or they wouldn't schedule me at all. I'm all for school but there's no need to lie or to show favoritism, or purposely make me work while I'm working on my degree."
bad,"I honestly had a terrible experience because of my store manager, therefore you might enjoy the company. I would recommend that you interview the associates in the store concerning the store manager before you accept any job, regardless the company. I did enjoy the 50% off discount and relaxed dress code."
bad,"working at this place was honestly the worst experience ever. the managers and assistant managers were so rude and they had favorites. the people who weren't favorites had to do all the work while the favorites just sat and did nothing. if you are a student, they WILL expect you to put this job before your schooling. that's why I left."
bad,"I worked at gap for a month and have worked a total of 9 hours. You're schedule is never set. I was told I was going to be getting almost 40 hours a week, some weeks I don't even work. They will send you you schedule but will call you that day to tell you they cut your shift because they didn't make enough money that day. I have been called as I was pulling into the parking lot 20 mins before my shift started."
bad,I was hired and then only given one shift in 3 months with no explanation. And the manager acts like she is a queen. The hardest part of job is talking to management because they are unavailable and act like you are not worth their time.
bad,"Good employee perks and incentives, but problems go unsolved by external high level management. Terrible in-store management, currently. Very cruel and immature. Management cuts hours of tenure employees. A sabotage-like environment. Just a really unwelcoming work environment."
bad,Terrible management!!! No training or guidance given at all. Manager and Assistant manager never on shop floor and never gave any feedback regarding performance very hypocritical with regards to standards and service. I would NEVER shop in this store let alone work for them again staff were punished for focusing on service instead of tasking. Tidying was non existent until the end of the day when it looked like a bomb site due to such poor staffing levels. No uniform given you have to buy your own and rotas given 2 days in advance of shifts. THE WORST MANAGEMENT avoid at all costs!
bad,"managers unfriendly , not treated like an adult -hier so many people dont get suffcient hours"
bad,"When I say decent money- you do have an opportunity to make great money but everything you have to put up with will make it seem like nothing."
bad,"The store in which I worked was extremely disorganized, with many a staff member refusing to pull their own weight and pointing fingers.  Horribly understaffed, which only perpetuated employee and management frustration.  It was not an enjoyable work environment."
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. They have unrealistic goals and if you're a little too 'stylish"" or classy dressed than their ""tshirt, jeans and scarf"" look they have, its a problem. If they don't like you, your schedule will reflect that. They would give you time to do your ""DOR"" but upper management will take that time to do theirs and make you miss your own, forcing you to work OFF THE CLOCK, after your shift in order to keep somewhat afloat. Miserable place. And the only job i have where I would never work for company again."
bad,Doesnt necessarily acknowledge good work ethics. A lot of favoritism. Diverse employee pool but plenty of conflict arose during work shifts. Company is only concerned with numbers and not the actuality it takes to achieve them. I was over my production numbers the whole 6 months working there and only ever received a growth check a week before I voluntarily chose not to come back. Thagesture alone  made me quit as I realized how dishonest the company was.
bad,"Most of the shift supervisors are decent. But they cancel shifts regularly, it is a very unreliable means of income. We're having trouble paying rent while upper management tries to sell us Gap stock... Outrageous!"
bad,"Working at Gap was quite interesting.  They are a large company with not a lot of growth potential.  I felt I wanted more, but wasn't afforded the opportunity."
bad,"Loved all the co-workers and the assistant managers, but the general manager is the worst boss I’ve ever had. Was incredibly rude and talked to everyone like we were stupid. Literally nobody liked her. Not one single person. Almost everyone talked bad about her which I think says a lot.Don’t work here if you don’t like being treated poorly. She made me hate the job."
bad,"-lack of training (Distract quote ""you learn as you go."""
bad,"Very tiring and boring job, managers are very judgemental and gossipy. Very cliquey type of workplace and can make you feel very uncomfortable. Customers can be friendly but when it comes to the overall staff not very friendly and very fake."
bad,"If I could have a do-over, would not have taken the position with GAP.  Was a struggle from day 1.  Thought it would get better with time, but did not.  I personally would not recommend working with them to anyone I come across."
bad,working at the gap was a pretty easy job. day went fast and jobs got done. the management wasnt so good and alot of things changed over the year to where the job wasnt enjoyable any more.
bad,"When I worked at gap there was a SUPER high turn over rate."
bad,Pay was way to low for the work you had to .always had wondering if and when they was moving the company yo other dc.after good working people put in 20-30yrs working for this company at so low of pay they decide to move company.
bad,"No breaks given, rude comments from co-workers. Constant yelling to go faster. Might be a good place when open but not before then! Aweful experience!"
bad,"Overall my experience working at the Gap was very poor. They do not care about employee - employer relationship. They do not believe in a collaborative culture and you do not feel part of a team. They provided a false description of the job during the interview. They promised a career path but did not stick to their end of their bargain for not just me, but ALL merchandise assistants. This role was absolutely menial and administrative. Please begin to value talent and stop imposing strange schooling for experienced employees."
bad,"A typical day consist of early mornings. a lot of boxes, a little chaotic when I first started but it grew on me. My co-workers as well as my managers were very kind, friendly and opened minded. I enjoyed working with them each time I did.There was'nt really any hard part to the job, our task was pretty staraight foward."
bad,"My manager was terribly self absorbed and did not care about employees or other managers. They conducted business poorly and inevitably, the store shut down earlier last year."
bad,Not a good work environment too many people in control and no ones really supervising anything. Also hate how far it is from the city or local bus stop at that.
bad,i did not like it there at all. they don't really give out hours. I might of worked maybe one day out of the week for 4 and a half hours. I guess it just didn't fit me.
bad,The gap location I am emplo9yed for has poor management with managers who base hours off of favouritism opposed to their work ethic. The environment would greatly improve if it had a more positive environment.
bad,no hours. your hours always get cut. Do not work for Gap. all they care about is making money by u selling merchandize on the phone or online
bad,This gap store the managers have favorites. Also the main manager let’s other managers talk about employees. Their really disrespectful. They ask for your opinion but then they don’t change anything
bad,The gap that i worked at shower favoritism the managers already had the people they liked and those where the people that would get all the hours they didn’t care about anyone else and those same people they would give all the hours to are the same ones that would call out everyday so no i dont recommend working at gap the employees were nice but the managers where the ones that made the job just terrible
bad,Management is an absolute mess. I was discriminated against and I was scared to go to work every day. it was horrible. I would never go back. ever. the worst job possible
bad,The company leadership is not innovative or focused on the future of the customers. They are half committed to the improving technology and stuck the past about how to make the company successful. Really needs some new leadership that can shake things up.
bad,this job and its requirements are not worth it for the pay. and if the company is not making money your hours will get cut and you barely got any to begin with.
bad,"While I worked here, three of the four managers refused to do their job and the single manager that worked as she was supposed to was let go of because the company decided to terminate her position company wide. I was there for a while, but honestly not happy. And I was not alone. May be okay for very temporary positions."
bad,"gap was a okay job, schedules were very long but I work them anyway, but the co-workers that I worked with were very nice also the supervisors were great."
bad,"It was okay working at Gap. Just not enough hours. Stayed busy all the time. Great sales on clothes."
bad,"I don't recommend this job. First off, it took a month to get me put in the employee database.  Only four hours of training is allowed for a new employee. I've never worked retail, so I don't know what I'm doing. My two training shifts were 2 weeks apart so about the time of my second training shift I forgot everything from the last shift. The 3 months I've been at Gap I've only been scheduled to work maybe 7 times. I had 3 weeks in a row of not being scheduled, then 2 weeks of 1 shift a week, then again 3 weeks without being scheduled."
bad,"Learned how to take the cars to the right location."
bad,Fast pace workplace with opportunities for growth. Typical fast food conduct.
bad,Overall the benifits are what keept me with gap inc.After years with the company I grew tired of it and wanted to start a new career.
bad,"I worked at Gap very briefly. On my interview I REALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO WORK... until my first day. I was basically shunned by the entire staff not a single person talked to me, the girl who trained me didn't really tell me much about what I should do she just kind of threw me into it. I was there for a few months and still knew no one because they refused to talk, it was like they were all in a cult and I was the outsider trying to get in on their secret. NOT WELCOMING AT ALL!"
bad,"its all a great work experience, answering phones."
bad,"I didn't like this job at all, very prejudice, not understanding of other activities and things that were going on in my life. A lot of management drama, that affect the store and employees. wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Not a good experience I had coworkers unwelcoming. If you have a good sense of fashion and love of customer service then this is great for you.
bad,"I did shipment mainly. I got hired in as seasonal but always did shipment & nothing else working from 7-10 two days a week. I thought I'd get more hours toward the holiday, but never did. Then when I moved I got transfered to Old Navy & get less hours here."
bad,"The gap at Huntington beach had great customers, but a horrible gm. She never gave sale associates breaks or lunch. She would also yell at employees on the floor infront of customers and not work with our schedules. Not only that, several of employees called the employee hotline and nothing was resolved. Till this day, she still doesn't give breaks or lunches. I should of contacted someone higher and not the hotline. Stay away from that location!!"
bad,"Upper Management is unprofessional, and rude. District Manager treats his employees as if you were a 3rd world country employee. Never, never, never gives positive feed back. His only focuses are the negative aspects and brings a very unhealthy atmosphere for the managers and its reflected on the associates. Associates are unhappy and treated unfair."
bad,"Boy was I wrong.  The minute you receive a false allegation, you feel like your a witch being hunted down.  Even with proof, documentation if you will, of said issue. still doesn't mean anything.  You cant be friendly, nice, or supportive without someone needing a safe place to cry from.  The minute someone is deciding their own scenarios in their mind, creating things that were proved not to happen. None of it matters.  Just like any other corporate industry Ive worked in.  Your career is over the min your accused. It's like everyone takes 1 side, passes judgement and THEN proceeds with everything. After drawing a biased conclusion on the first thing they hear. My GM though, was wonderful."
bad,I developed my  sales and customer service skills. I learn a lot about clothing and quality and how customer satisfaction is important in every business. I learned that a business can only be successful if it could satisfy its customer.
bad,Ok place to work. Job for high school students. Barely any hours given. 
bad,Entreprise au top salaire pas motivant  je ne retavaillerez pas la bas
bad,"Whenever we had a customer of color or someone wearing hijab some employees will mock them."
bad,"inconsistent hours, no room to move up. Management was very rude and inconsistent in directions.only available hours are during holidays the after it becomes scarce."
bad,I either helped customers on sales floor or did cashier transactions. The hardest part was dealing with managers and associates. You couldn't even ask question without being reported! Not a very positive environment.
bad,"I actually worked here for only a month. You get paid minimum wage, in CT that is 9.15/hr. They told me I would be working quite a bit, but gave me 14.5 hours over TWO WEEKS and then that was it. After a few more weeks, I quit. I wasn't working anyway, what was the point? The management doesn't really care much for new  employees, and they stick you where nobody wants to be with very little training before they just put you on your own and well bye! Good luck! I guess this technique may work for some people, but not me!! You only get 4 hour shifts, and takes a long time before you even move up to full time. One person who was training me in go backs said she just reached full time and she had been there for a couple years. Overall I think it is a very poor place to work. I even learned that Gap owns quite a few sweat shops throughout the world. I don't know about you, but I definitely would not want to be working for a company like that. DO NOT WORK HERE"
bad,"Cashier work, stockroom Work,salesperson duties. Heavy register duties, assist and help customers as they enter and shop at the store. maintain selling floor fold clothes hang items etc."
bad,I was promised 14.50 an hour for the overnight shift only to find out I was only being payed 14.00 an hour. There was very little time for lunch or bathroom breaks due to the work and eating spaces and bathrooms being so far apart.
bad,"The company clearly has something to gain by perpetually hiring new employees and discarding experienced ones.  In my last few months as a sales agent, things went down hill for me and for my peers around me.  Upper management was constantly looking for ways to disqualify us from our sales bonuses; either because we did not ask the right question the right way to the customer, or because we were short of our quota on just one of the four brands.  In that period of time nearly all, or all, of the other sales agents, including those considered to be among the best, were deprived of their sales bonuses.  At one point after I left the company, one of the senior managers decided enough is enough, and unilaterally paid out the sales bonuses to the well-deserving sales agents who remained.  The company fired that manager for that.  Meanwhile all the individuals who were my peers either resigned or were terminated.  Throughout 2017, each of us working in sales were systematically devalued.  During that time, new employees were brought on who were slovenly, prone to stealing, some straight from jail, and willing to work for meager pay because no one else would hire them.  The company lowered their standards of employee appearance and demeanor every year.  It created a depressing environment, all while the more presentable senior employees struggled to hold their job.  I believe this was all deliberate on the part of the corporate executives who were behind the scenes.  Never work here; your resume will be devalued and self-esteem will decline because they will always make you feel like"
bad,"once management is bad, the rest all crumbles. beware. cared more about getting gap cards then keeping the store need or assisting customers enough to make goal. promotions? whats that? only the people who do the bare minimum seem to get promoted. run by a bunch of children in their 30s and up."
bad,This was the least favorite job I have held. This job had the most drama and the most people stealing from it that I have ever seen. This store was labeled a target store and the manager never did anything to help better the store that we could see. The store had people constantly leaving and people being harassed in the work place.
bad,la empresa en la actulidad parte de Liverpool es dirigida como licencia de bajo estatus
bad,"I joined the Gap team due to the pay and hours promised. However, the management over staffed. There were new employees every day. And as a result, other employees weren’t getting hours. I would go two weeks before I was scheduled. When you have college tuition and bills you can’t live off of little hours"
bad,had to call every morning to get shift wasnt guranteed to get work. didnt get full weeks work either. was asked to travel to different destinations without notice.
bad,"Upper level managers will ALWAYS throw lower managers and supervisors under the bus, usually by termination, to be politically correct or look good in the eyes of the hourly employees. "
bad,"I did not like working at the Gap Outlet."
bad,"Honestly, I am still employed at the Gap, but unfortunately your hours depend on the sales of the store so if the store does not meet budget you will not get hours the next week....so basically it isnt very dependable."
bad,They dont treat you with repect the lead tell you everyday they can replace you and the pay is trash
bad,"- Typical day is fast pace"
bad,"Management is way pass poor, a lot of unethical issues are going around. You have to watch out for yourself, sneakiness is prone."
bad,This helped me to experience what it was like to work in a fast pace working environment. I also learnt how to address customers and good customer service skills.
bad,Not a lot of hours yet you still get over worked. They didn’t really hire enough people for stock and always needed assistance on the floor. Communication skills weren’t too good either
bad,"Please don’t work at the one in sawgrass nothing but Spanish speakers who aren’t willing to learn English. Always a language barrier. Management is very poor , the only way to move up on the company is if your likeable and speak Spanish other than that do not waste your time and the pay is nothing and hours is nothing only 5 hours and if you want to become a full timer you have to request it."
bad,"Don’t really enjoy there experience . Need not managers on the same page. Need more hours. Need better scheduling, days there flexible but not really."
bad,The company really did not make you feel like you were part of something big. The meetings were the only fun part about the whole job and the management did not push it's employee's for better positions
bad,"Very busy atmosphere with lots of foot traffic through the door."
bad,Not a healthy enviornment.  Very dusty and dirty place.  Not cleaned properly - in bathroom and break rooms.  Salary should be 2 dollars more for the work done.  Numbers is all they care about.  Supervisors are partial to some workers than to others - favoritism.  You are harrassed about producing production - there is no resting - you are always put to work - not complaining about the hours - that was the only way you could make a decent check - but when there is no work you work 8 hours or under.  If you do not have PTO time - no pay if you are sent home early.  Overtme is for everyone - depending on the supervisor - they may deny you from working in other departments with the overtime.  Training is hard to achieve when you want to learn a new function.  Not alot of growth potential in this company.  As I said - this could be a better place to work.
bad,"nothing to tell, worked your butt off for minimum wage.  Helped open the store, at local outlet.  From rearranging shelving units to merchandising to the floor it was a mess.  Little kid attitudes from managment didn't help matters any.  Favoritism galore"
bad,"There is more to the world - so don't fall into The Gap. I spent a lot of time with this company, only to realize that I should have moved on years ago."
bad,"Typically, all the managers are supposed to be on the same page and help provide a positive work environment for the other employees. It is unfortunate to say that such is not the case at the moment. The active managers do not get along and will visibly or verbally show their disdain for each other. The environment that they have created is toxic and unfriendly. The new general manager is doing his best to fix it, but it is hard to say how successful it would be if the current managers are uncooperative."
bad,"Over worked and under paid is their motto. Management actually violated their own policy in order to ensure that they got bonuses, but it was at the expense of valuable employees. The integrity was very low amongst management. On the up-side, I got a lot of customer service experience."
bad,"If you like to be lead by fear, then this is the place for you. Inappropriate relationships between Territory Managers and area leaders. Constant bullying by upper management, as well as, predetermined ""social groups"" and if you're not willing to step in to those roles, you're not going to do well."
bad,"They literally give you one, maybe 2 days on schedule per week, on top of that those are only 4 hour shifts. So a paycheck for me is about $80 every two weeks. Your unable to live because you do not make any money. there are no hours."
bad,"At first working here was something I was looking forward to. And I thought the holiday season was going to be the reason why I hated my job, but it wasn't. That was cake compared to dealing with management every day. I understand the purpose of management and their responsibilities on a daily basis. (drive sales, customer service, associates, scheduling, merchandising, etc.) That being said, I'm not writing this review as a bitter ignorant person. (okay, maybe a little bitter hehe)....."
bad,One of the most stupid job they have not really a good Security job more of a Walmart door greeter job this is
bad,"This job stressed me out nonstop, because of the horrible management. The Store Manager was a problem to everyone from day one. She said disgusting, rude ,unprofessional things to employees constantly and was actually guilty of yelling at other managers if something was not done exactly how she would have done it. Simply, if she didn't get her way, like someone in high school, she would give you a world of attitude and would belittle you. The proof is in the employee retention rate. Everyone that worked there with me in the beginning was gone after she showed up, even managers stepped down because they couldn't put up with her. She has no clue what she is doing. I highly suggest a secret visit from higher up. But besides the horrible choice for store manager, there is an awesome assistant manager that should have gotten the job of SM. She was fantastic. I also liked the fun, energy of the store. It was really the only thing that kept me there for so long."
bad,"I really enjoyed the time at the Gap as it helped me realize that my qualifications would be best suited in a Hotel atmosphere, and not in a retail atmosphere. Management was not up to par, and there was constant miss communication."
bad,over all it an okay company to work for.

bad,Le direction est nul evolution au plaisir des manager
bad,"From my experience working in the Gap, was good a terrible. The good part was the payment, made good money, but the bad parts was the management from supervisors and overbearing hours. I liked making good money with benefits but after a while of doing 10 hour shifts and 50 hour weeks. I just couldn't handle it and I preferred working 5 days 8 hours and 40 hours weeks."
bad,"My coworkers and I got along and a few of my managers were great, however one or two managers could be quite disrespectful towards my time and ability to work. When creating the schedule I gave my availability and they refused to agree and forced me to work more than I wanted. The customers can be quite disrespectful and I found myself fighting back tears on several occasions (and I do not cry often). The Gap I worked at did not give proper appreciation towards their employees for the amount of time they work there. For example, my friends employers gave out bonuses on holidays and for working for a year, at the gap I received nothing for the time spent working there."
bad,"I would recommend this job to people that need to build job to experience, but its not a ideal place to be working. Managers expect a lot from you. Scheduling is the worst, the managers give extra hours to their favorite people and the managers depend on a app to give people available shifts it is limited to their favorite people only."
bad,"with my time working at gap, i’ve gotten little to no shifts and my mental health was slowly decreasing. it’s not that i hated it there, it’s just sometimes it was unbearable."
bad,"This was a great place for me to work in college since the hours are flexible but the job itself is very stressful and very fast paced, it's also hard to get time off and you can get penalized with your inconsistent schedule with them showing favoritism."
bad,"A typical day at Gap is that you never know if you are going to get hours or be sent home for the day."
bad,"Gap Inc was my very first official job and I was able to stay for a month, I would've loved to stay longer however I was only scheduled two 3 hours shifts within the month I was there. When arriving to the worksite I would begin any given tasks until complete. I enjoyed the pace of the job as well as the customers that you would come across."
bad,"One of the worst places I ever worked. During peak seasons, lot of work to do. After peak season, things slowed way down. The manager had no business being in his position."
bad,.This job was awful and boring. some managers were nice others werent. very unorganized and half assed everything. Customers are nice old people. But overall alot of drama
bad,"Managers do not lead or mentor their employees. Managers enjoy the perks of the title without possessing or applying actual managerial skills. Promotion is done by favoritism, not by job performance and drive."
bad,"Would 100% recommend against working for this place in any form or fashion, especially the overnight stock associate position. People come and go on a weekly basis. Near 80% turn over. Working there for just over 6 months, I must have seen close to 100 people leave. Supervisor and others took bets on how long I'd last. No explicit training."
bad,I can say that this is a diverse company to work for! I needed more than this of course. I feel strongly that this would be a great place for someone who's looking for a second job. At least you will have a discount and make money.
bad,Didn't apply themselves in the manor I was told they would be and didn't teach the way they should've for the employees working. Forced us to get people to sign up for cards or we didn't keep our job
bad,"I worked here a year. The job was a typical retail job.The only problem is they gave no one hours. One week I had 25 hours the next week I would have 5 hours. I don't know anyone who can deal with the constant random change in work hours. On a good note I received a discount from Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta"
bad,"I already had knowledge of being a sales associate from a previous job so I didn't learn anything new. But it was a pretty easy going job. Scheduling was terrible though, there would be too many people or not enough."
bad,"Gap is a good company to work for,the problem is internal management and a very high turn over rate, which leaves management and employees overwork and under paid."
bad,"Working at The Gap was not the best experience. I often had rude customers and management was never willing to deal with it. Very rarely I would get schedule and when I did, It was on a day I previously mentioned management not to schedule me."
bad,"Just need a body in the role to do the work.   Could be an ok place to work if you are under the right management team, but if not it's extremely demoralizing."
bad,This company is not going to be around for much longer.  It is a shame the company has gone the direction it has.  It use to be a fantastic place to work and now it is just a disaster.
bad,"This was during the seasonal time (Thanksgiving). During my first day I wasn't given much training but was just told how to use the walkie talkie, how to fold certain items and which floor I was handling. I was mainly organizing clothes from the clearance floor. The hardest part of the job was to answer some of the customer's questions without knowledge of anything that was going on in the store. I didn't really enjoy this job, due to the lack of information or direction given at the times I was working. Every employee is allowed discount for purchasing items through the store, but the activation for my perks wasn't even working."
bad,"Being that I don't have children, I find it rather challenging to do my job at the Gap. Having parents ask you if the 6-9 months runs small, to having small children breaking the mannequins. This job can be stressful, but my patience is growing."
bad,"Management pushes all associates to sell credit cards. Co-workers, like with any part-time retail job that you take on while in school, make staying worthwhile."
bad,"Although Old Navy strives to remain in touch with its people, they miss the point by setting extremely high, at times unattainable expectations.  In turn leading to frustration at all levels for field employees."
bad,Wal Mart has very many pros and cons.  The pay for leaders starts off pretty decent but varies between lower levels.  I started out in college and worked my up through the organization quickly.  I received many merit raises and then the company went to once a year only and an off cycle merit increase was an act of congress.  There were many other managers who did not have great people skills and did not take accountability for their actions.  They were not trained well to leader people and to motivate them to strive for the best.  The company lacks motivational training and encouragement.  They also fly by the seat of there pants managing and don't really look into issues before they handle them.  I have seen many people scolded for things that could have been handled better or researched for the proper solution.
bad,"I enjoyed my job for the longest time, but management has just gone completely downhill and I actually despise my job now."
bad,"I have learned that more and more companies want to work their employees and not pay them for their services.  "
bad,"No set hours, some employees might get 8 hours a week some times. Only positive is the employee discount which is 50%. Not bad for high schoolers needing disounts on clothes."
bad,Managers will often gossip behind the sales assoc. back. You are treated poorly if you aren't considered anything higher than sales floor. All the keyholders do is boss people around and make you feel uncomfortable. There is no room for advancement so forget it. And if you are hoping for more than 3 hours a week then forget it! Keep looking.. not worth the stress.
bad,"I genuinely don't review things but i think people should know about Gap- Whistler before applying."
bad,Job was basically a job for a high school student who wants to earn extra cash. Management was not that good as well as staff.
bad,"The ""managers"" of this store are the worst example of store ""management"".  They are the most disorganized, unhelpful, and most times rude to the employees.  I truly don't know how they have kept their jobs for as long as they have.  The person who does the schedules, really needs to learn how to do the job."
bad,Manager cares less about employees! Rude disrespectful and EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL!
bad,"Coming into this job, I had 6 months of prior retail work history & was offered less than was I was paid at my prior retail job. On multiple occasions, I was spoken to as though I was unintelligent. In addition to being spoken to and treated like a small child. The store manager has a power/control complex that prevents her from being able to work well with new hires & the new hiring manager was let go just after I was hired on."
bad,"A work day is slow depending on the amount of orders each day. I did learn how to credit customers money online on discounted or sale items that they paid full price for. The co-workers are non-receptive to new ideas along with management. The hardest thing about the job is doing the same thing over and over again, day after day. Not being mentallay challenged will make you lose intrest in a job fast."
bad,This was a security loss prevention position for 3 south florida gap location. Gap was a great place to work however very difficult to conduct the functions of loss prevention.
bad,The company as an employer was decent for a first job experience.The managerial positions made working less enjoyable.The store in specific was not an ideal place to work.
bad,"The Gap main focus is customer service, this makes the job fun by being able to fully interact with customers. The pressure of trying to get the customers to sign up for gap credit cards is difficult in this economy but it gives the job a sense of challenge which is fun. A big issue is not being able to progress in the compant and having to wait a year to get a small wage increase if you are a sales associate. Even if you are the harding working associate, you rarely get recognition for it."
bad,"They cut your hours every week. There is no stability, your hours fluctuate constantly from week to week. Getting a full time promotion/position is close to impossible. They do not value their employees."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was the revolving management schedule.  One week you might work mornings, the next week you might work mid-day and the third week in a rotation you might work till close.  The culture of my particular store was to embrace complete work/ life goals around the store and the store comes first before self or family."
bad,I Just was seasonal and really didn't learn much...Just customer service wise but learned that from my old jobs. The most fun of it is that i got to meet awesome people.
bad,"For the first week or two the job was pretty good, but it went downhill pretty quick. They would schedule me to work and then would cancel my shift and let me know my shift was canceled AFTER I had already showed up for it. There were even a few times when they’d schedule me at 7AM and either no one would show up or they’d be about 20-30 mins late and didn’t bother texting or calling to let us know. I was also promised at least 12 hours a week when I first started (which I only got for maybe that first week), but I only get the most five hours a MONTH. I was always told that they would train me as cashier so that I’m able to get more hours, but they never bothered to actually go through with it. I never felt accepted or needed while working and felt as though my coworkers only spoke to me because they had to. The management is completely unorganized. I wouldn’t dare recommend this job to a friend."
bad,"I thought this would be a great place. But you can never get time off if your sick unless you go into work, and then request to go home ONLY if it’s slow. You could be dying and they’ll be like oh did you get approved to go home. It’s just not a great place from personal experience. It can be veryyy slow and you get to work and 10 mins after they let you go home?! It’s just inconsistent. And asking for time off like pulling teeth"
bad,"great people, but stressful work environment- but it is a new concept store. I enjoy my time at work, but i find the expections are muddy, and i have a hard time with the poor communication in my specific store."
bad,"Management is a joke...most don't do anything but sit and watch you without lending a hand..rude, and cocky..not all but most..They are truly overpaid..."
bad,"Retail is retail and like any retail store, especially in a mall, there are going to be annoying customers, lazy co-workers, and drama between managers. Overall I had a decent enough time and expanded my skillsets."
bad,Traveling was always involved for the most part of the work schedule.  Need better opportunity. Want to be closer to home and be able to come home everyday from work.
bad,Upper management is not on the same level as middle management within the stores. Hierarchy is a major thing with this company and they will never let u forget what grade you are.
bad,"its fun to work here when its busy but when its slow it gets SUPER boring, because once youre done with everything theres nothing to do, and you spend ALOT of time folding sweaters."
bad,Not what you would expect the manager was terrible  treat staff very poorly specifically towards me they also changed the lunch times around a lot so you could go with out food for 5 straight the other manager was lovely however she wasn’t there as much as the other one so it was a disappointment
bad,It was OK I never really worked retail before so I wasn't completely sure how that works I not something I look forward to doing ever again. Very stressful around the holidays.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is friendly customers and support from fellow associates. Management changes often so there is sometimes lack of dialogue, not enough support to accomplish harder tasks. Consistent expectations, but sometimes they are not realistic. The hours are incredibly flexible. Little to no recognition and no room for promotion."
bad,"Working at GAP is all about selling, doing your job and that's all. There is no care at all by any of the managers about how youre feeling or doing, and nobody is ever happy working there. All sales employees only work there because they need the money. Lack of a family community at GAP, very limited encouragements or gifts for sales workers, never get any raise no matter how good you are at sales, and managers do not care for you. On top of that, at the GAP i work at, people get titled employee of the month, but get no benefits from it (no raise, no gifts, no 50% off... just a stupid title). I honestly think if you don't care about the community and environment of your workplace, then gap is an ok place to work at but I do not recommend at all."
bad,"Go in early, place things into locker. Wait till it's time to punch in. Go and help the new hires, and find out what is required for the day. As a floor facilitator your job requires you to know the tasks and daily issues."
bad,"ive worked at this place for 6 years. enjoyed it and foresaw it as a lifelong career. however I noticed it change into a company revolving around micro managing. one example is the in stock app they've recently implemented. it is a good tool for the employees to quickly locate items in the backroom for customers as well as keep track of inventory back there. but on the other hand this app tells the employees what needs to be replenished on the floor based off of sales for that day and what is ""out of stock"" my issue with that is its never 100% percent accurate with the out of stock items and the dm gets a report every day as to how out of stock your store is. so this tool is another way for those in the positions of district manager and above to tell you ""you're doing it wrong."" I am a stock lead which is a highly under paid and under appreciated position. I originally had no intentions on taking this role cause I knew the stuff that came with it however I was forced to since I was passed up for an assistant management position for the second time. This company would much rather take a manager that has left the company before for simply not liking his boss over someone who is willing to put in the work simply because they would have to take time out of their day to train the newbie and they don't have the patience for it. also this part is just me speculating but this company is so concerned with looking diverse that im sure they hired who they hired cause im a female and hes a male since the management team was mostly female. any company that has their priorities in the wrong"
bad,"Although the pay and benefits are very good, the planning and micromanaging from above was very depressing. Autonomous operation by an employee was treated with suspicion and I saw employees let go for false reasons and I saw the Loss Prevention team falsely accuse personnel they did not like to have them removed from the company."
bad,"I would prefer to skip this part but the system does not allow me to do that, therefore I must fill this part in for something to be included here otherwise it would be left blank."
bad,"I hated every minute working at GAP and it lasted over a year. However, it was an experience. Working with people who i did not get along with, and dealing with customers who lacked respect for the workers of the store was definitely eye opening."
bad,"I wouldn't work there if you really need hour because they give little hours. "
bad,"Personally at the establishment the customers were very exceptional and weren't the problem, the problem was the division of power among management and then upon team leaders who disrespectful to each other constantly."
bad,"have a ""certain"" (extroverted) personality type. Like most jobs introverts do not fit in well at Gap. Despite doing your job very well, even being told you're doing very well, never receiving any negative customer feedback, if you don't chit chat enough with your co-workers through the headset you might get the reputation of being stuck up or boring. How dare those darn introverts focus on their work and assisting their customers rather than pointless conversation on the headset. How dare they!"
bad,"working here was alright. I found they did not care much about their staff. They did not provide great training. I learnt that retail was fun and it was great to help others. I did learn a lot from trial and error because I had to pretty much teach myself. "
bad,It was hard to advance at this job . Being there for 4 years and not having a raise of $1 by the time I quit. The company brought in outsiders to run the business and it ended up being a bad change for that particular store.
bad,"Bad management"
bad,"Nice company and I like what it stands for. In the store I worked, management was very unprofessional and it didn't create a comfortable environment. Advancement and how an employee was treated was based on favoritism and you could see and hear in conversations that took place. I think the management could use lots of work at that particular location. I learned some things from paying attention to trends, how Gap wanted to progress as a company and a lot about clothing being that I attend The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising and I pay attention more."
bad,"A empresa precisa de funcionarios que possam ser doar integralmente a carga de trabalho, infelizmente não me adequei ,pois a carga horaria de trabalho juntamente com as viagens não me permitiam frequentar o curso de Engenharia Elétrica."
bad,"It was good, was not the best of experiences. However, it was an important one. I learnt the importance of time management and how to work under pressure."
bad,"No es tu país por lo tanto no tienes la mismas oportunidades que alguien de allí, aunque la experiencia es buena para practicar el idioma,"
bad,"The entire time everyone is say that there is an open door policy and ""you be you"", but any time you ask a question or present a problem a customer has brought to you, some of the managers get nervous and make you feel less than so they feel better."
bad,At Gap inc the managament was really bad i had such a bad experience in which i saw they don't have respect for sales associates and do not consider them as part of the people they should promote.  I learned different things such as customer service and helping my co-workers when they needed it me speaking with foreign customers or  any concerns in the registers.
bad,if the managers and supervisors had not placed themselves on such high pedestals this would be a great work environment. there is a serious communication barrier between the workers and the people who believe they should only delegate and not do the actual labor also known as the supervisors and managers.
bad,"Sales associate "
bad,Good and exciting job
bad,all I did was fold
bad,The Gap overall is great company but when someone like myself is seeking growth potential this company did not meet the standard requirements.
bad,i work for the gap for three years was late only twice called out about 6 times in three years the employee's was great to work with every one was a team player made the job fun and got work done quickly
bad,"The general manager at this Gap Factory in Tannersville, PA can be extremely rude to her employees. She is the main reason why employees don’t stay employed here for very long. Many employees have reported her but the higher ups have done nothing to correct this issue."
bad,"The managers can be unbelievably unwelcoming towards new workers, specifically those that belong to ethnic minorities. The way in which tasks must be carried out to meet their standards is not explained beforehand nor are the rules and regulations. The work environment itself can be very unhygienic. Despite a good salary, I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Στα υπέρ:"
bad,"My manager was a control freak that yelled at me and all the other employees when the smallest thing went wrong. There was no direction, no standards, and no expectations, or goals set in place that we were supposed to meet. It was chaos and such a tense and hostile work environment. Nobody knew what to do and there was no middle management to intervene and give direction. The customers are easy to deal with but are entitled and allowed to use expired coupons."
bad,The job was very stressful as you had to deal with difficult customers and the managers were inconsiderate of your life outside of work and did not understand difficult situations.
bad,"I did not feel comfortable working here as there was no way of moving up in the company, there were hardly any hours available it didn't seem well managed, everyone was all over the place. Some of the workers were pretty helpful."
bad,working at Gap is ok but i am fed up with the late shift and it seems the shift will never change for me but i have to find something else cause as a lady i can't keep up to come home late every day .
bad,it was seasonal job with long hours and little pay. The managers sometimes didn't know the correct answers to some questions asked by the employees. it was ok.
bad,"When I was interviewed and went through training, I was shown the ropes to be a floor member. What it turned out to be was a shipment member. Very different things. I was also very discouraged as I was yelled at for being color-blind and it made my tasks a bit harder, dealing with the clothes and all. My direct manager was also, very discouraging because she would not work around my disability. Not a very inviting experience."
bad,If youre a student looking for a couple of shifts a week than this job will work for you. Management refused to give out more than 3 shifts a week and would only schedule me at 6 or 7 am.
bad,Non consiglierei questa azienda  a nessuno a meno che non abbiate un contratto da 20h...in questo modo la situazione potrebbe essere sopportabile.
bad,They hire you as a temp and if work is low the temps are sent home rarely get 40 hours per week except during peak holiday season. Management not helpfull
bad,Direction only comes when problems arise.  There is no problem I am left on my own.  I feel there could be more direction from management and less from coworkers.
bad,"Management expects respect but does not give it. Lack of communication between higher management to supervisor, supervisors to associates. Some people forgot where they started from & what it takes to run a company."
bad,I was an overnight replenishment associate at Gap and they really didn't care much about us. I made some good friends but that's about it. I worked at a flagship store so it was competitive but wasn't worth it.
bad,I met about 3-4 GM's that were supposed to turn the workplace around. Instead just ruined everyone's hours and relationships. Cut me from a weekly 40 hours to 1 shift a week.
bad,Was led on thinking I was gonna be working but the manager kept putting it off for about 2 weeks and finally told me with about 30 min notice that I was going to be let go after not working for 2 weeks because of reasons I don’t know.
bad,Advancing in the company is possible if you happen to have the right leader. It is hard to work for a struggling fashion retail company that is not pivoting fast enough to stay current in the quickly changing market of fashion retail.
bad,There is no room for advancement unless you have a degree. It doesn't matter how much experience a person has or how well they preform. New hires come in making barely less than someone that has been with the company for years. The annual raise gets smaller every year and new hire pay goes up every year.
bad,Working at Gap was fun but the pay was not worth the stress. The store manager is never at the store or closes. All the assistant managers have to pick up the slack. There’s drama with in the assistant managers as well. Part time assistant managers do not get any benefits or earn PTO. District is horrible. They will not support you but will nag at you if something goes wrong. All they care about is stores making their GAP CARD GOAL. HR is non never on your side either. This company is a joke. I can see why they’re doing horrible.
bad,Very stressful. It’s good for a moment then it gives anxiety. Never knowing whether there will be work or not. Not enough hours or days. Favoritism seemed to show
bad,Gap has poor managements.They don't know how to manag with their associates.There is lack of acknowledgment .Their payroll and making cheques is also need to be manage.Cleaning is another big issue.
bad,"It was enjoyable to meet lots of interesting people at Gap, but the workplace was highly competitive, and so meetings could be unproductive as a result."
bad,"Gap Company is a very good like a normal company in a riteal i started at 7;00 and i finish at 19;00, i help my team tadding up what i lorn was is very important that every retail the store must be tadding for a costumers and for the, district Managers come visit the store, as bean part of  Management team  i lorn a lot because i was a siner  we have to control the stuff the team we have to organise the store and the team. the hardest part of the job was the Delivery but then became fun after you learn."
bad,Working at gap wasn’t as exciting as they put on. They wanted us to push credit cards in a way that I felt was too forceful. I rarely had hours. They wasn’t really supportive of actually teaching you about the job
bad,"stressful, no support constantly asked to open new gap credit cards if the goal isn't reached you're sent to a class. If the day is slow an employee can be sent home after only two hours"
bad,It was a very structured environment that required a lot from there employees with little pay . The store was very messy with little workers and hours were barely givin out
bad,"The pay was decent and it's a dream job if you enjoy fashion and clothes. However, they didn't really offer any hours. You literally had to request hours from other coworkers in order to have a decent paycheck."
bad,"A typical day at work was handling stock, managing shop floors and serving customers."
bad,A empresa é uma boa empresa mas os funcionários não ajuda a crescer
bad,The warehouse is very noisy so you have to wear ear plugs in certain locations of the building. I learned how to navigate the warehouse management system. Management tried their best to inform employees about proper procedures of the company. The culture was diverse. The Hardest part of the job was making it to and from the lunch room on time because the building was so huge. The best part was being able to communicate with people from many different backgrounds.
bad,"Gap has lost who they are at their core- great jeans, khakis' and basics.  Trying to be someone they are not.  Pricing strategy is too high with all the competition in the market now and they are steadily losing market share"
bad,New management would always come in and look for needed changes to the store. These changes would last for a few weeks and then the store would go back to its original chaotic state. RUN!
bad,"Being at a prime location that was severely understaffed was stressful. Hours were extremely sparse and would be kept past shift frequently, would never leave on time. (Ex. store closes at 9:30, leave work at 11:30)"
bad,"Nothing big to say, just another company with no care of their employees and really bad payment and no benefits, etc. etc ,etc, nothing nothing nothing nothing."
bad,fun and relaxing place to work at no complain a nice and lovely people friendly I had a lot fun working at the gap.i had to move to washinghton DC for school and better opportunities
bad,"ringed out the customers, helped them look for anything they needed, made sure the floor was looking nice, also folded any type of clothes, and always keep a positive attitude."
bad,"During my work experience at The Gap, I worked in the baby department. I would stock and fold clothes to put on display. I enjoyed working here, there was a lot of friendly faces I recognized and they loved shopping with me."
bad,A typical day consisted of fixing ruined clothing displays and dealing with customers. Managers never really seemed to care for the employees and would often mess up displays to see how fast you could fix it.
bad,"Started here as a Christmas temp, everyone was so lovely but the manager literally gave us nothing to do all day, I would just stand and fold the same shirt for 3 hours! If you want a job that is exciting and fast don’t apply here! It was the most boring job."
bad,"I have been there for 3 years and im wanting a better job. Its to competitive and the supervisors dont care. If you go them with a problem, but they dont. Im wanting to further my career at college to try to better myself"
bad,it was a great experience working in retail but it was horrible not getting paid for the hours I spent and the boss was rude to me and a lot nicer to everyone else.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at this store due to the lack of direction and the fact that often we were overstaffed. I was scheduled maybe once a week on call and often the store would look completely different from the last week, making it extremely difficult for me to assist customers. I wish I had quit working here sooner than I did."
bad,"I was Hired in Oct 2015 and since then I've only been scheduled to work twice. I honestly didn't get the full Gap Inc experience that i was told about during my interview. Upon recently asking the GM about my employment status, she assured me I was still employed there. But again I've only worked to shifts since Oct 2015 and it is now March of 2016."
bad,Beautiful stores and merchandise.  Often have to work with a skeleton crew.  Low wages for what is required to be done.  Abusive customers
bad,"i learned to use new computerize equipment to pull orders and package them.touch screen monitors,made it easy to keep track"
bad,This job was awhile ago but I have no good memories about this job. very stressful environment. break area is awful. management was awful. That's all I have to say. don't work here.
bad,"Like a Visual Supervisor in store, my responsibility is take care of the shop floor at all levels from the visual perspective, having in control all the promotions in store, product executions and windows updates and also managing my team to accomplish the best results."
bad,"Very fast paced. One must juggle customers, Gap credit cards, real selling, cash register, fitting room and maintaining the sales floor all at once. Management thinks your life revolves around Gap. Management will take advantage of you and underpay you if you are naive to pay wages. Inconsistent work hours. If you don't sell the credit card, your hours get cut and you get replaced by new/less experienced employees. Managers go back and adjust your timesheet. Gap has taught me to be assertive when dealing with managers and customers. Gap also taught me how to multi task and sell to customers."
bad,"Working here was definitely not the greatest experience. Though their training is unparalleled and they definitely care about their customers, it felt as if they cared little about their employees. I started and I was willing to work as many hours as needed around my schedule and even though I was repeatedly told I was one of the best workers, I was given no hours for months even after asking for some. I tried to get in to contact with the management team and was hung up on - so I ended up quitting through email. Besides this, the focus on what is happening in the store is very manageable and coworkers are expected to help out everyone."
bad,It was an okay place to work it was just too slow paced for me and I really enjoy working in a fast paced environment. I really did not enjoy working here at all
bad,"I had the displeasure of working here for a year. Training is non-existent. Management doesn't believe in you when it comes to training and learning new tasks. Communication between employees & management is null. You feel racist when catching shop-lifters, not to mention you cant even call the police on any of them. They schedule you as an ""on-call"" where you call two hours ahead to see if they actually need you. They hire way too many people. I will never understand how anyone could ever advance in this job into management with the amount of hours they schedule you. I once went a whole month without working; thankfully I got a second job around that time. Very scandalous work environment with catty co-workers. I was afraid to ask questions for fear of someone thinking I was incapable of doing certain tasks and directly affecting the already-non-existent hours I was getting. You have to take a 15 minute break for every 3 or 4 hours you work, any capable person should be able to stand on their feet for that long so what's the point of having such a short break in the first place. This job left a bitter taste in my mouth. I hope they can turn this job around for future employees."
bad,"It's an OK company to work for, but nearly impossible for advancement.  More of a job for someone in high school, or in between jobs."
bad,"noting special, typical chain merchandise retailer, never provided enough work hours to actually make money and a scattered work schedule"
bad,"I was never given hours even though i had open availability, management didn't appreciate hard workers, and the pay was horrible."
bad,I found myself bored on days there were no sales.  The majority of the job is folding.
bad,Very old fashioned firm. Set in their ways. Flexibility. Small firm.
bad,"Working at Gap is always fun, I learned about customer service and the fashion industry in general. The management is approachable. My co-workers are easy to get along with and are also fun. The hardest part of the job is being able to find sizes for particular customers. The most enjoyable part, however, is when you make that customer happy because you did your best to help a customer."
bad,"Coworkers are absolutely fun and give a good atmosphere, But the managers play favorites and cut people hours of the people that just started or add more hours to people that they like."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Gap. The traditional culture of being customer and employee oriented has been exchanged for producing income for the shareholders. Good managers do exist, but becoming increasingly rare."
bad,"Retail is tiring."
bad,"A typical day the The Gap Factory Store is very clean, the instructions are laid out very clearly. I learned many things from running a cash register, to folding clothes. There was a vast variety of multiculturalism within co-workers and staff, also a lot of customers from all kinds of backgrounds. I would say the hardest job was dealing with grumpy shoppers. The most enjoyable part of my job was how laid back everything was, and how simple the instructions were."
bad,a typical day at work was greeting customers. My job was to sell clothes to customers. my co workers were great. They all were very helpful with each other.
bad,they ask for alot to sign people for gapcards and try many ways to get rid of you .
bad,"Not fun environment making work stupendous with fake work performance history, squeezing culture to the last drop of lemon, peers and staff bullying, only temporary/seasonal hires/part time/ less working hours, firing on small pretext "
bad,Its not a job to begin a fashion career and the management team was not well organized.
bad,Didn't enjoy the environment. But loved helping customers throughout the store.
bad,A typical day at work involved a lot of stocking and cleaning and deal with cash registers and this was a new store when i started working here and hours were not available. As well as the location was far for the pay
bad,best part was the discounts. the hardest part is staying on your feet
bad,"Delt with retail merchandise prepared for stock, sale & customer purchasing."
bad,When I first started working there I loved it after a while I realized there was little room for advancement. I never received proper training and had to worry about managers always being in my personal life outside of work. Management was very immature and treated the job like it was a second part to their high school career. Getting hired and keeping your job is based who's backside your kissing. Don't dare speak your mind there is always consequences and threats. All in all other coworkers were wonderful we held each other up while working.
bad,Management understood my school and personal life priorities and accommodated those most of the time. But sometimes they were very unorganized and wouldn't notify me if my hours were cut or if I wasn't needed for the day.
bad,a long day of being on your feet
bad,"Managers do not communicate well with each others, don't give requested days off, not easy to schedule"
bad,didnt really work there that long but for the time being its was an okay experience .. very fast paced !
bad,"Loved the environment, but not the late hours. The work was also kind of boring, but I guess that's retail!"
bad,"While working at the specific location for 2-3 yrs, majority of equal leveled associates, as well as lower management employees, would help you understanding the ins and outs of selling, sizing, and register training. Pay was decent but treatment and handling of business operations by upper management was disappointing and disinterested of lower employees day to day needs (i.e., scheduling, shift coverage, departure time)."
bad,"The managers I had seemed to be very petty and full of drama. The other employees were really sweet! But the managers always wanted you to be doing something, even if it was just unfolding and refolding clothes. I worked in the dressing room, and when there was nothing to do there, I would have to walk around the store fixing tiny details, sometimes just arranging the sizes to the correct areas. I understand that this is a job, but it felt like I was there to just do tiny meaningless tasks. When I quit, it was because the manager gave me one shift a week, I'm guessing in hopes that I would quit. They were either indirect or passive aggressive, and always gave me looks or disappointment/regret. It was terribly boring and mindless. If you just want a job and are totally fine with not doing something fun, this is a great choice!"
bad,The retail environment is fast paced and not for everyone. Dealing with a lack of staff and over bearing amount of tasks can get to many people. Minimum wage and weekend and evening shifts not idea.
bad,"The GAP would have been a good job had the majority of the staff were not so cliquey.  They often made me feel singled out and started a lot of unnecessary gossip all the time.  In short, it is not a great work environment."
bad,"Management was fine, seemed to care about your wellbeing, but obviously put the company first. Other employees were rude and snobbish, didn't get along with them. Standard retail tasks: menial busywork."
bad,"I had worked for old navy prior to working for Athleta both GAP inc companies and Athleta's ""mission"" was to empower women. It did the complete opposite for me. They kept hiring outside the company management turnover was ridiculous the woman were vicious the sales goals were out of reach. We were required to harass customers into taking surveys and were supposed to be rewarded. I had the most surveys taken consistently and no one cared. They were not supportive of mothers hours, and you're constantly reminded that you are just ""a sales employee"" it was a nightmare. I stuck it out for 3 years hoping I could move onto a management position and set us on the right path but I couldn't take it anymore and left."
bad,"Never any sort of organization. Management, especially in the offices, never seem to know what they're doing and extremely unfriendly. Not sure if that's so you don't ask questions they won't know answers to"
bad,"Usually my typical day at work is recovery for 4 hours, sometimes I am on cashier. I've learned how to fold and work at a fast pace to close out the store."
bad,"Seasonal work was inconsistent however well enough for extra money. It is an ok ""job"" for extra money during the holiday season. It is fast paced, and non stop calls."
bad,"I don't have any hatred towards GAP, but the environment and way they manage their stores is horrific. "
bad,With all due respect at this time I don't want too. To sum up all I can say is the benefits and pay compensation don't make it a career with potential
bad,"I worked here for a little over 6 months and it was horrible. I hated getting up for work. Hours suck only got like 9 hours every two weeks. my checks were around $80. Then the customers are rude to you and the hours pass super slow. The managers and co-workers were not that bad, the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the discount."
bad,"I was a Seasonal Merchandise Processor at Gap, INC. during Fall 2014. The work was pretty easy and steady. On days where there was not too many orders, they would allow employees to go home early if they wanted. The work itself was okay."
bad,"great environment. energetic, young and a bit harried but there's a ""we're all in this together attitude"" so it works! I've made lifelong friends at GAP."
bad,"Overall a great concept for a company, but very unrealistic goals as far as reality. Company has the best of intentions but the staff was never held accountable for their actions. Management was childish and caddy.  Trust and rapport was not there either. Many had no business being in a manager's role..Clothing all over the floors. Stacked and hidden in fitting rooms. Draining place to work."
bad,I had a great store manager but a district manager that was not about growth and opportunity.  I ended up following my store manager to The Limited
bad,gap was my first ever paid job I learned work and work ethic I learned customer service and how to be a team player
bad,Typical day consist of processing boxes of merchandise during overnights. Over 100 boxes every night along with replenishment and back stock. Management was unfair and unrealistic for their expectations sometimes although my personal stock manager was helpful.
bad,"A typical day at work involved getting to work about 6am, unloading the truck, this involved unpacking boxes and dispersing shipments to various parts of the store. It had to be done quickly and efficiently. I learned that I can work best when I am tackling a task with others, without many distractions from patrons, as this occurred well before business hours. The management team was very helpful and always did what they could to ensure everyone was being accommodated. The co-workers were great, we all worked hard, and were invested in teamwork and the job. I mean, you kind of have to be to show up at six am every day. The hardest part of the job was making ends meet on 8 hours a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting out of work at 10 am and having the whole day ahead of you."
bad,"It's retail, hard work hours and the company prefers to keep people in store, promotions are minimal."
bad,"Start work at 0730. Organize the day delivery schedule. Loading Truck from viewing delivery tickets. Pick stock from warehouse, then load truck."
bad,"folding clothes, attending to the customers needs. cleaning up after the store has closed. "
bad,Best thing about working in gap is the discount manager was cool and very understanding about me going to school but not enough pay or hours
bad,"busy,bar codes,management was fun to be around great co-workers"
bad,I learned alot as I grew with The Gap.
bad,"While there is opportunity at this company, the vision is unclear leaving leadership at a loss when it comes to communication. Work life balance is poor and morale is low amongst leadership and associates."
bad,Great cultural climate and good insurance benefits. Management and corporate are out of touch with daily operations. Management and corporation have un-realistic expectations
bad,"Positive things about this job is that you get to help people with clothing decisions, and the coworkers are mostly always friendly and will help you if you need help. The atmosphere is very nice, but can get stressful at times when there are sales going on or if it is the weekend, which is typical for any establishment. The music they play isn't overplayed pop music 24/7, it is actually pretty enjoyable and doesn't give you a headache. On the negative side, this is a good job for somebody who is good at selling. The company depends on the money they make from Gap credit cards. If you don't sell enough cards or Bright rewards, they won't give you ANY hours. This is not a job for somebody who is wanting a steady source of income, or an organized work schedule. They make your schedule depending on how many gap cards or brights you sell to customers. If you are going for part-time, they will schedule you for four hours or less per each day you work and less than 20 hours a week, maybe even less than 10, and on top of that, they will most likely send you home early. They don't only have the cashiers throw their sales pitch to the customers, but they also make the employees that are on the floor try to get people to sign up for their card/rewards as well, and if you don't meet the stores goal for that day, then you're out of there."
bad,"I worked graveyard shifts in no AC because it was the mall. I didn’t know that coming in. "
bad,This company is really great. At least when you start working for them. When I first started working there I was working 5 & 6 days a week. Now I only get scheduled 1 or 2 times a week & it’s only for 3 or 4 hours. This company does not care about anything but meeting it’s goals. The managers get bonuses for meeting the goals so they are hard on you about it.
bad,The gap needs a complete managerial overhaul. Too much nepotism. No career advancement. Very short breaks. Need larger locker. Too many people accessing break area. Too many people trying to mange without authority. Overall not an idea place to work.
bad,Overall it's a job pays decent. work environment could be better. The work week vary alot there is normally too much work or not enough work. Rarely a 40 hour work week.
bad,"Bideford Store in north devon has one of the worst mangers going. "
bad,"Hours are very limited and when scheduled, shifts are slow and they drag. Management kept changing when I was there and so no one would recognize loyalty and hard work. They only care about meeting sales and opening GAP cards. The management felt impersonal and superficial."
bad,"Working at GAP had its perks..employee discounts and holidays off. Management was pretty strict, tend to expect so much out of the employee. If a certain quota was not met you would get warnings, a write up or fired."
bad,"Worked at two different locations, first in Edmonton and then in Calgary. Edmonton location was fantastic as far as co-workers and management went (the actual job part was fine, I personally loved fitting rooms and displays the most as they were the least monotonous). Calgary (larger store) was horrible. Everyone already had a clique, and if you were good with one of the higher-ups they would take you to lake louise, give you the tasks/shifts you wanted, and generally be nice. If I did a task that wasn't asked for (after completing everything I was supposed to) it would be an issue - the micromanagement was intense. I would come right after my classes finished and occasionally be 1-2 minutes late. Despite me saying I could get there no earlier, I would still be in trouble and they would never change my schedule. Management was petty and unsupportive. Customers were often rude - especially if you were unlucky enough to work in baby/kids. Overall one of the most emotionally taxing places I've ever worked."
bad,"very challenging to get sorter production with all the faulty equipment that is passed out and never replaced."
bad,"A $16 billion company still run on excel spreadsheets. Still stuck in 1969 while everyone else is leaving them behind. The design team at Gap is still a hot mess, which is a shame because it's a brand people know and love."
bad,"Out of the four managers at the Gap, only one of them treated me as their equal. I was bullied by one manager, in particular, EVERY SINGLE SHIFT, I DO NOT recommend working at this location."
bad,Υπεύθυνος του αντρικού ορόφου κατά την βάρδια μου. Έμαθα να συμπεριφέρομαι επαγγελματικά απέναντι σε συναδέλφους οι οποίοι δεν είναι.
bad,As the company manages expenses in a difficult climate.. Associates are required work around the clock to compensate for open roles and out of date systems
bad,"Great co-workers. I initially did not have good management and I wanted to develop my career however I felt I was not given this opportunity. "
bad,"Seasonal hire during the time they were adding internet order. New to every one, learned how to audit inventory and input information into database. Checked orders that were put together by the packers for accuracy/presentation. Co-worker were new and nice. Hardest part of the job was auditing inventory in back of warehouse while using opt vehicle at first how every became more enjoyable after a few days. Most enjoyable part of job was that their was a few different tasks and did not go to work doing same exact task day in and day out."
bad,"Gap's problem is Gap.  Everyone in the field has consensus of what needs to be done.  GMs and up go to conferences where we all agree on the way forward.  But none of it happens.  "
bad,"I worked for Gap for 7 years, first as a sales associate and then as a manager and it wasn't always the best experience. I originally started in the Indiana market and then transferred to the Texas market. Being in Texas was a far better experience with the company than in Indiana. The staff was more friendly, the corporate team was way more hands on and the district ran like a well oiled machine. When I returned to Indiana to continue my work as a manager at one of their top stores, I was blackballed after only 6 months of being there. I wouldn't recommend this company for someone who is trying to establish a career in retail management."
bad,"Working at The Gap was not my favorite position. I was not utilized to my potential. The very young clientele was difficult to contend with. The Gap Customer Service lines were not clearly drawn. I had a great Store Manager who tried to assist me. We both left the Company at the same time. It was not a culture of growth. The Store"
bad,I enjoyed this experience a lot. I got to learn a lot about time management. I also got a lot from learning from the associates. We had a lot of regulars so getting to build a relationship was very important.
bad,"I currently assist customers over the phone with ordering clothes in a call center. I handle three different brands, Gap, Old Navy, and Athleta. I also am trained to take Canadian calls. I track packages daily and reorder if necessary. I help customers exchange products and walk them step by step thru the return and refund process. I partner with different stores and departments to ensure customers are getting all help possible. I attain metric goals and receive achievement certificates for exceptional call quality."
bad,"Poor atmosphere, unprofessional environment. Great pay and benefits."
bad,"Take note that I can only attest to one Department and I have heard from other people throughout the organization that they love their work. However, I had a different experience. "
bad,"didnt work there very long"
bad,"I enjoyed helping people. I worked on a Cash Register. I took Checks, CC & Cash."
bad,"A Typical day at work is bad management, a lack of training employees. the only way a promotion is ever possible if you are good friends with management. Managers tend to mark items down for sale but when an employee wants to purchase them with your employee discount managers change it to full price at registers. Employees who have been with the company longer are lazy, out to get you fired because you are making them look bad by getting your job done and more. If looking for a job that have no benefits  and lack hours with no true promotions. then this may be right up your alley."
bad,"fold clothes "
bad,"This was probably the most miserable part time job I ever had. The managers are way to ""Into it"" and the employees stay overworked or underworked. The only thing that made it worth the pain is the employee discounts."
bad,"The company didn't really care must about teaching you things thoroughly, perhaps because they knew they were going to let you go. Did not feel part of a team."
bad,"Typical day at work is fast paced helping out numerous customers. I learned and currently learning new types of fashion. Co-workers for the most part are friendly to an extent. Hardest part of my job can be summed up as a the the most easiest and enjoyable part coincidentally, as far as helping a customer find their desired size to color to style. Management can be better, kind of sold me a dream in the interview process. Lack of hours and communication."
bad,"Constant bickering and fighting amoung managers. Heavy rotation in staffing, people constantly leaving the company or being terminated. A very unhappy, unsatisfying and demotivating place to work."
bad,"I was with this company for almost two year when I realized that the managers are not mature and seem to think it is okay to talk about employees and other management. As for the overall store, its a great company to work for and many beneficial compensations."
bad,"Svolgevo un part time che spesso diventava un 40 ore su disponibilità data inizialmente da me stesso e per esigenze del punto vendita,quindi avevo giornate part time(4 ore) o giornate full time (8 ore).Gestione dell'azienda e del punto vendita in particolare,a mio parere non sufficiente in quanto vi erano grossi problemi di organizzazione del lavoro mentre dal punto di vista del team dei colleghi rimasto altamente soddisfatto.Esperienza altamente formativa in quanto mi ha dato la possibilità di migliorare ampiamente l apprendimento della lingua inglese."
bad,"Like so many other companies during the economic recession, Gap Inc. was forced to cut into it's Training and Development staff. Since that time, leaders were brought into the company that have no concept of developing a highly functioning team. The retail leadership team are treated like highly skilled sales associates who can read a spread sheet. There is no succession planning and no visible attempt to grow the brand's influence by developing strong and competent leaders. Working for Gap, Inc.'s leadership team was once a marketable skill. As someone who has had previous experience working with the brand at the height of it's influence, it is a sad reintroduction to the brand."
bad,Management need to be organized and treat employees fairly.
bad,"BR is a great place to work as a part time job. I meet so many interesting people, and I enjoy helping people look their best for various events in their lives. I work with a great team of people, many of whom I have know for over 7 years."
bad,typical day varies on needs of store
bad,"A typical work day was selling to customers, seeing that the customer satisfied with their purchase. Consistingly offering the Gap brand."
bad,This would be one of my experiences in my work life that I will chalk up to an experience. I did not enjoy the work environment. The expectations of their management staff was extremely hard to meet. I am an over achiever in everything I do and I almost hurt myself trying to please upper management.
bad,"I learned how to deal with customers and in the process developed good personal communication skills in a work environment. At the time, I was proud to have a job."
bad,"I worked for Gap for a total of 7 years. First as a sales associate all through college, and then 3 years of management in both Gap Outlet and Banana Republic. I had no life outside of work, upper management is less than helpful and far too demanding for a company that is failing. The schedule is grueling and the atmosphere is intense. I’m glad to be done with that chapter of my life."
bad,"Management was great, friendly, and supportive. But working for this company overall was not an experience I enjoyed. Employees are overworked and underpaid."
bad,"Physically demanding job that pays better than avg.  Because they are counting every bit of production you complete, you are always encouraged to go faster.  Management is pretty good about training but they will be more helpful if you work hard and show an interest.  My theory is they hire so many seasonal workers, they don't have time to waste with people who are just there to ride the clock.  You never move more than a few feet (if you're packing or matching) but you're doing it for 2 to 3 hours at a time.  Full-time workers get two 20-minute breaks during an 8-hour shift.  The break-room has self-service food available or you can bring your own food as there are plenty of refrigerators and microwaves available."
bad,"The NA Outlet planning divisional  leadership functions in workplace bullying, favoritism, sexism and the list goes on!! The most unorganized mess of a corporate office I have experienced to date!! It’s no wonder Gap is a slow sinking ship with the the way it’s NYC corporate planning office is ran!!"
bad,"In six months at Gap, I worked under 3 different GMs and several AMs, all with extremely different leadership styles. Because of this, I went from loving the job to dreading most shifts. Employees are mostly college students, so turnover is high. "
bad,This organization is retail focused. The sole focus is to make money. The organization does not take into account the demographics of it's employees or customers when selling products or creating schedules.
bad,"When I was hired a year ago, the working conditions were tolerable. I enjoyed working with my supervisors and co-workers, and it was easy enough to make production on a good day. Since then, several machines have deteriorated so badly, they do not function properly anymore. maintenance has done what they can to keep the machines running, but upper management refuses to spend money on a building, currently taking the influx of 2 distribution centers. It has become nearly impossible to make and keep production standards, and yet workers are still being reprimanded, coached, even fired for lack of production. However, there are a few good things. My supervisors are good people that are doing their best to help us. They recognize and praise good work ethic, and seem to care about us as individual people. Over-all, It is a good place to start in the workforce. It promotes hard work, and the salary is very decent."
bad,"I have worked for the company for more than a decade and have witnessed firsthand all the radical changes that have taken place in order to stay a frontrunner in the retail industry.  While the company is often proactive and has a great response time to trends in the market, the workload the company expects is near impossible to execute.  There is no way to purposefully plan in this company anymore, as directives may change on less than a day's notice, and any directives issued to stores are so large in scope that there is never enough coverage or manpower to complete the tasks in a reasonable time frame.  Furthermore, the technology in the store is a joke.  The point-of-sale software and the registers themselves are hopelessly outdated and make all the complicated transactions we encounter on a daily basis impossible to complete without managerial intervention.  The chip readers in the PIN pad devices never function properly, meaning that cashiers must manually enter customer card information and obtain an imprint, a practice that, in this day and age, instills a sense of customer distrust.  Online and store discounts and promotions are never in sync; online shopping has become a ubiquitous enterprise, and the company should be striving to create a simple and streamlined customer experience."
bad,"I liked my time there while I was on work experience,"
bad,Co-workers are fun. Discounts are good. Good workplace when you are in university. Very flexible but its challenging when there are no hours.
bad,"policy states , they have a work to family balance. It is true. You can work your schedule out to your needs. Management in my store is very poor. If you can deal with irate customers all day and pick up clothes time after time throughout your day, then this place is for you. Not very safety oriented, so be careful where you step on. I am not a cashier associate nor am I a manager, but if I was, the store and operations would be ran a bit different and better."
bad,"This is a company with a ""positive"", up-beat culture.  The compensation was more than adequate.  The work-life balance was a  consistent 40 hours / week the entire time I was there."
bad,Great place to work. great co workers who turn into friends. management didnt care so much for the employees. they dont give you enough hours.
bad,"they do not really care if you'd just had a relative who past away and providing good customer service. opening OC is a priority to them. They're so inconsiderate considering that most people who you ask already have a credit card, have bad credit, do not have a SSI, or do not wish to get into more debt. They also demand you to open OCs on the sales floor. Which is ridiculous because if you were to come off too pushy to customers and you annoy them you could get in trouble. So stupid!"
bad,"it was a fun place to work for, some store management can be real shady so watch out for them, people are fun but keep it all at work, "
bad,"When I first started at Old Navy, I loved it! I thought that my staff was amazing, and I really liked my job. Not anymore."
bad,Typoical day at work is to get all the work needed done. Learned how to handle merchandise and work other functions and also how to operate an OPT forklift.
bad,While working at the gap I noticed that it was a place or people who already had a job and wanted to work minimum hours.
bad,"A typical day is working the resets and planning the next reset. moving stock and watching sales, credit, and managing all aspects of store operations and store management learned that I am a strong person and can accomplish a lot in the course of a day. i also learned better time management skills to be able to perform all of the multiple daily tasks that Gap requires. The store manager at the time was a difficult person to work with often talking down to associates to motivate performance which worked oppositely for me. The Co- workers were fun and the customers were also a lot of fun, its what kept me there at that time. The hardest parts were dealing with the store manager who was my direct supervisor, and the company not giving the training I needed to perform at my star level which is my normal performance level. Still the visual aspect of my job and watching those numbers increase was still a lot of fun."
bad,"Focus is on short-term results and lowest-common-denominator solutions. This leads to unreliable pipelines violating SOA's frequently. As a results, DevOps was interpreted to mean using developers to provide operational support. Architectural over site was non-existent."
bad,Place has gone down hill. They put in an incentive where your scores effect your monthly bonus. Destroyed teamwork. Made people fight supes about doing the hard jobs that we roate. Made people like me do them more often as a result even though it hurts my back to do all day. Co workers will screw you over in an effort to get higher scores and supes enable it. If you don't have the pto saved up to take a day off even if you have it approved you'll get a point.
bad,The best part of working for this company is the discounts. The hours were okay but because of the management team the distribution of hours wasn't equal.
bad,There was a lot of issues with this store so much so that it had to be shut down due to the rate of things customers we're steeling. It wasn't a safe environment as well. Thought I do love and appreciate the GAP product greatly
bad,I like the mall where this work place is locating.  It is a bight and warm area to work in with vivid co-workers on a busy holiday.  My job is easy  as an Associate Representative but it gets hard when the shift is given for closing of a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is for me as a fashion design major to try some new products to test to recommend to our customers.
bad,great company except for managers not doing their job instead of being on facebook and the phone
bad,It's like joining a sorority.  There are constant organizational restructurings and strategy changes.
bad,It was alright for a sesonal job but the only thing I hate it did not last long enough. But other than that it was a joy to get up and go to work everyday. The hardest was getting use to walking for ten hours a day but I really did it and enjoyed it.
bad,"I was excited to work for GAP and thought their values and goals were noble. However, once I began to work at the Auburn, WA branch, I was horrified by the mistreatment I saw on a daily basis. Co-workers spent entire shifts bad-mouthing each other and managers took sides. To me, that is unacceptable."
bad,"Since Gap is a popular place to shop for families, it tends to get hectic on really busy days. Managment likes to push you to sell gap credit cards daily."
bad,"I worked in Gap for two weeks for work experience, where I communicated with customers and collaborated with the members of my team. we worked together to make sure the customers were pleased."
bad,Wasn’t the best job I’ve had due to management but the clothing is very nice. Working with many different people at the location i was located at was always fun.
bad,"i worked here for almost a year and it wasn’t the best. it can be fun and i loved my co-workers but management is poor. hours are unpredictable. i felt like i was a good employee and i did a lot for the company and went out of my way for them and i felt under appreciated. unless you are a favorite, you will not succeed at Gap. it’s a stressful environment sometimes. they take advantage of their good employees for their benefit and don’t reward you in the end. over all, i had a poor experience here at Gap."
bad,good and very exceptional cuistomer service. handled cash register work and at the floor. tidied floor and helped with go backs. was interested in the work.
bad,"Mostly work alone and floor walk for this position, so roughly 8 hours on the floor. Very micro-managed in regards to breaks. No room if any shoplifters were apprehended."
bad,Grants good discounts and benefits but lacks recognition to its loyal employees. Force you to produce unrealistic results on minimum payroll...no overtime.
bad,"Good company to work for.  Customer service is a priority.  They cared about there staff."
bad,"I worked there some time ago, but I've noticed the music the pipe in hasn't gotten any better. You'll be expected to push credit cards whether you are at the cash wrap, or working the fitting rooms. Like I said. Typical retail"
bad,The culture was not what I excel in. It was more of a popularity contest. I did learn a lot and met a lot of great people. The travel was to spread out.
bad,"During my time there they had something called 'on call' hours, I don't know if they still do. What this meant is that you had a four hour shift but that they could ask you to stay for an eight hour shift if they wanted and saying no would like being late to work. Needless to say annoying was an understatement."
bad,Everyone loves to shop but not one lover to actually be the person working in the mall. Although the benefits of working for GAP was amazing for the amount of work you do the pay is very low
bad,Sometimes you work where you have to so the bills get paid. It was fine for what it was. The management was disconnected and treated employees poorly. The discount was generous.
bad,"When i first became an employee at Gap I was working 2-3 times a week which in my case is fine considering other commitments i contribute to in my life. It was fun working there when i first started out, but it hasn't even been a year yet and i don't get scheduled to work anymore. Sometimes i get 2 weeks off out of no where now. You kinda have compete just to work there, and that's not how any job should be. Your schedule depends on how many GCs ( Gap Cards ) you get and that's all the managers really care about. So basically if you don't enough CGs ( who even knows what enough is ) then you will not be scheduled. And employees aren't aloud to break themselves which is obviously reasonable, but now including myself, us employees are having to ask to go on break because the managers cant even remember or take time to break us their selves. I would understand if the employees were competitive for a raise or certain position. But to be competing just to at least get 12 hours a week? That's insane."
bad,It was a retail job that gave me retailing skills the hardest part was when it had rush hours it the best of the job was when i folded the clothes because its so many and you see a variety of clothing
bad,"Working at the gap included running go backs, cleaning up sales floor, and working at the register. It had a boring environment, and there was constant drama with other employees."
bad,"i have been working there since september and i’m only working 1 day a week, i have asked so many times to get scheduled more and they ignore it. i believe one of the managers has it out for me, just hates me and thinks very low of me, doesn’t give me a chance to show what i can do."
bad,"山頭主義 ,不埋堆等於完了!"
bad,"GAP is unlike a typical retail job due to management underpaying and overworking their employees, especially during holiday season. Not a place I'd recommend"
bad,"Arrogant manager who is unresponsive"
bad,fast paced daily activities with a strong focus on customer service; too many revisions to their definition of who was their shopper.
bad,They dont care about you as a person and they schedule you to work overnights without informing you. The training that they give you is not up to par and they criticize you for what they never taught you.
bad,"co-workers were great, some of the management could have been better. Most enjoyable part was focusing on and making the customers happy. Least enjoyable was getting yelled at by management if we didn't make our daily sales or credit card goals"
bad,A typical place of work you are either folding clothes and putting them back in place or working the cash register. Nothing flashy or overly ornate going on behind the scenes.
bad,I love my fellow co workers they are all very hard working people. The company is a good company but they require a lot from you.
bad,I was hired to work close to full time and all they offered all there employees was about 10 hours a week
bad,The Chicago location has poor management and probably still screws people over on hours and money but that's retail for you.
bad,"The GAP is a store where, not only myself, but my family can shop. I recommended the GAP to all my friends. I will still continue to shop here."
bad,"I spent about 2 years here, and it was a great place to meet new people, but the customer service was the only thing good about the job."
bad,"Working at The Gap for a couple of months, I realize that they hire too many people and do not give their employees enough shifts. Although I have worked there for several months,  I have only learned the very basics of folding and tending to customers in the retail world. Being given such little shifts does not give me an opportunity to grow in the company, even though they claimed that there would be lots of opportunities for each employee to advance. However, overall, working at The Gap is sometimes enjoyable if I encounter the right people"
bad,"- Standards and policies not followed by majority of employees"
bad,"I arrive at work ready to sale and work with new clients. My freedom as a regular sales associate allowed me to blossom into the stylist I am today. I learned how to and how not to deal with others, my sales style, etc."
bad,young and savvy management
bad,"good people, long hours, boring work , no commision really taught me how to talk to people"
bad,Great Place to work while you are going to school and need schedule worked with
bad,i learn at the gap help the customer with size and meet new co-woker. help with customer on the phone if we the items .
bad,"I would work from 4- 12 p.m. with an half hour lunch break in which you were not allowed to leave the premises. Work would along a assembly line, sorting boxes, packing new boxes or counting certain items."
bad,They have told me not to come in multiple times. Human Resources said my accommodations were too restricted. I was not equally treated. I loved doing the actually job but the fairness was not there.
bad,"Trying to sell something to someone who doesn't want it was to difficult for me.  Manager was rude,  but had a clean store and a friendly staff.  Hours were flexible tho"
bad,"the job itself was not poor. The issue was the managers and my fellow employees and their unkind attitude. The entire staff did not seem welcoming from the beginning of my interview to me allowing my manager to know I am giving my two-week notice. They are also not too kind to customers esp with a language barrier. I took the job hoping id get a great experience and meet new people and earn money, obviously, but the money was not well worth the poor environment I was in."
bad,As a sales associate I was part time so I primarily worked in the summer during my breaks from school. Schedule was very loose for part timers. Sometimes you worked everyday for a week and the one day the next week
bad,"active putaway of gap merchandise, picking, packing, inventory inquiry was performed almost everyday, daily tasks changed everyday by the supervisor. The hardest part of the job was when there was full time hours the long amount of time spent on your feet was a killer. The most enjoyable part about the job was the coworkers"
bad,There is always something to do. If you want to learn position yourself and they will notice your hard work. That gets you on the schedule more if you are willing to work hard.
bad,"- learned the way to fold clothes and pants"
bad,"Didnt enjoy it ."
bad,-cool co workers
bad,"You fold clothes and help people. There is not much more to it. I was just a seasonal Retail Associate, so I was in and out for summers and holidays. My time working there, all the employees were nice and fun, and they are pretty flexible about hours as long as you can work at least once on weekends."
bad,Buena experiencia en lo laboral como en lo profesional.
bad,I enjoyed my time there but time came to an end and I needed to move and the managers moved and no one was happy anymore.  I recommend this job for someone who is looking for part time work and don’t ever let anyone take at vantage if you!
bad,It was a cool job for the time being. Just really didn't have a good experience with the Visual manager. She wouldn't want to work with me on making flexible time and tried to tell me that working 35 hours was a part-time schedule. So my experience wasn't that pleasant.
bad,it okay to work there for teenagers. I feel like it could improve more. it should include benefits. that's all I have to say about it.
bad,The Gap is a great place to work if your not a student because they don't really help you with a schedule when you are in school. The management is not the greatest either they don't really care about there employes
bad,"the work day is ery slow depending the seasona sales that we have."
bad,"	Design store windows for marketing appeal"
good,First beginning they were great but as time went on and you were still learning they had insane expectations of each person. I left because it was not a positive environment or management and they didn’t schedule me for almost 2 months.
good,Depending on position it can be very stressful especially around November through January when in Seasonal mode which can depending on position and experience make it much more stressful.
good,"Most workers complain about not only the people around them but also the workload and the company itself. The manager was constantly avoiding work by staying in the back office, and assistant managers complaining to employees about the company management, employees, and tasks."
good,"No room to grow."
good,Unless you are planning a career in Retail I wouldn't recommend the position. The company does not provide much help with hiring and recruiting. Unskilled leadership that constantly changes and are always trying to show off by putting unnecessary pressure on employees.
good,A typical day at work is taking clothing out of bags and folding them for the sales floor. Refolding and hanging up clothes. Putting accessories away in boxes then in the wall so workers can find them. The most hardest part of the job is trying to put merchandise away or take out merchandises high places when I'm short.
good,"unorganised, lack of information "
good,"nothing special, just a basic retail job. Erratic managerial techniques"
good,"Worked as my first job while in school. Managers are not very competent, besides the General managers. Pay is ok, but you will not work many hours if you don't sign many people up for the store credit card."
good,"Gap is a great store to go to, but I wouldn't want to go back just because of the hours. not enough hours given, but at the same time that is an issue everywhere."
good,I used to love working there and management really cared about its employees but then management changed and everything went downhill. Last couple of months weren’t the best.
good,seasonal position just helped with seasonal rush worked for short period of time helped customers for the holiday helped out with black friday fast pace during holiday season
good,"I assisted in customer service, managed cash register, and answered phone calls."
good,Overall learned alot with this company when I first started but after awhile change of managment happened and went down hill from there. It was no longer an enjoyable place to work for me.
good,"I ended up becoming employed with the GAP in Limeridge Mall in Hamilton ON through the YMCA Summers Job for Youth Program. Instantly, without training me and my co-worker from the same program were told to complete jobs that we didn't understand at first, being that we weren't shown. We were often yelled at or shown aggressively how to do things right, where we then started to come along with completing some tasks correctly. "
good,"Receive inbound cartons, perform quality audits, update system, and palletize cartons. Locate merchandise using appropriate system, accurately complete order, and send to packing/shipping. Work with teams to prepare and move merchandise according to established safety, production, and accuracy standards and guidelines. Maintain and verify documentation to optimize the flow of merchandise through the Fishkill, New York, popup and automated distribution centers. Perform at levels that drive overall safety, cost, and service metrics."
good,"Among several retail stores I have worked at, The Gap is better than most but still needs improvement. The atmosphere was relaxed and I like the clothing styles. Although, scheduled hours were unreliable. Some weeks you would be scheduled less and some more. There was little or no room for advancement."
good,The pressure to be off calls and done with notes in a very short few minutes makes it hard to give the best service. Getting time off is like pulling teeth. In the year I've been with the company I've only had 1 day of approved. You have to work about a week to earn 8 hrs off. My last employer was much better. You got your vacation days up front. Benefits at Gap are less than impressive. Better than nothing but not great.
good,Gap IT helpdesk Store support position is the most advanced skilled and fast pacing environment. Management is very difficult to approach. Very high turn over rate of contract positions. Only one to two positions were converted to permanent employment over course of each year. Schedule is spanned over 24 hours each day and open 365 days per year.
good,"its easy money and you have your hours guaranteed,  but the supervisors only care about the customers and not what you have to say. you have to beg them to actually listen to you. they will make you work over 40 hours a week and if your late 1 minute pretty much it counts against you. deal with a lot of bs. only good thing is guaranteed hours. only receive im there.kinda feels like high school its not enough pay."
good,Constantly dealing with IT issues and putting fires out. No set seating constantly at a new outdated desk with poor operating equipment.  Mandatory overtime from November through January.
good,A fast paced retail environment. Stressful because of a struggling company - meeting sales goals. Very consumed with Gap Card goals. Upper management does not set development goals or work on development whatsoever.
good,On a typically day at the GAP I would help fold clothes and made sure that the showroom area was clean for customers to see the product. I also ran the cash register from time to time as well. The job was pretty straightforward and really didn't have anything bad about it. I learned how to sell myself better to the customer and the company that I represent.
good,"You can't work a shift at gap without coming home like you fought in a war. It's so stressful, and it's not because the job is hard, it's just the environment is so toxic."
good,"salary and management was horrible, hours were little to none. its an okay job if you're okay with dealing with psycho older women who are getting divorced and all that good stuff and want to come to work and pin it on you."
good,It was seasonal. the money was good and much needed. No communication between supervisors and employees. Training was not properly provided.
good,"no work life balance company had increased demands with changing retail environments around them, no incentives, or compensation for hard work, no incentive to grow with company"
good,Working for GAP on a regular week you can only expect one to two shifts a week. There is no good pay when they make goals then you get instead of a three hour shift a four hour shift. the work is expected to be excellent but there is no excellent pay involved in working for the company. It isn't a company I would recommend to anybody.
good,"When I first started working for the company over the Christmas season I enjoyed it very much. But as the company changed and the management team everything was different. They stressed the unnecessary such as gap cards (opening credit). The pay increased by cents, management weren't flexible with school schedules. The entire culture shifted and became uncomfortable."
good,Working here has helped me a lot more with the public. When it is holiday time of year that's the best part. You get to meet people from all over the year.
good,Hours are not flexible nor is your schedule.....they definitely only care if you make the uph if not you will be walked out.....btw they have raised the uph n keep raising them.....regular employees have a hard time reaching uphs
good,In about a year I had 5 different managers. Only 2 left for a better job. The other 3 where fired. One for breaking company policy and for stealing. Very clique driven work environment and confusing power structure/ write ups given. Manager/team lead/intern 2hrs late no reprimand. Hardworking no other issues employee 5 min late first time immediate write up. Just a hot mess of infrastructure.
good,There's a reason gaps are closing brand isn't investing in employee. If you are great than they work you harder but don't hold your equal to the same standards. Expect to be use for all you got accountability with leaders is non existent upper management instead of addressing an issue will tell you to find what a coworker passion is instead of helping
good,"The company focuses solely on loyalty programs instead of customer service. In turn, they have a very poor sense of customer service. "
good,If you are a teen or young adult looking for there first job experience and dont want to work for a fast food company then I highly recommend gap inc. However dont expect any promotions within two years. Which is why I say move on after you gain experience to work elsewhere
good,"micromanaged down to the second.  everyone breathing down your back, looking over your shoulder for every single thing.  Boring but still have to look busy refolding already folded clothes."
good,"Great place to work. I loved the discounts and knowing when things are going on sale. The thing I hated was the management. Management is terrible especially at the mall I worked for. The manager over the entire store was only worried about his Caucasian counter-parts and advancing them into higher positions than his minority workers. I worked there for 6yrs  & applied to be an assistant manager multiple times and got passed up each and every time because ""I was in school,"" but in the same time hired a co-worker who worked there less time than me, that was in school also. He was also pervy too. "
good,"The Company is severely understaffed in all branches and sales offices. The work load is so high and so busy, the working day is incredibly stressful."
good,"This job is PRIMARILY great for teenagers or students who are in college who are currently, living with their parents. If you are living alone, taking college classes, and you do not have another job, this job is not for you. Hourly pay is more than you would expect from a retail store, which is why it is perfect for people who do not have the responsibilities of paying most of their bills."
good,Working at the gap was alright. The only thing is that the hours was not steady you can be working 32 hours one week and the nest you working a 4 hour shift. For those who is solemnly relying on that one income i don't know how they do it.
good,"Overall, if you are seeking a positive work environment, then this is not the place for you. The management is ill equip, and does not take responsibility for disturbances with in the work place. They focus on favorites, and those outside of that particular circle are met with verbal abuse, condescending remarks, and unfair hours."
good,"Just as in most fields of retail, The Gap promoted a very great place to grow socially. Many of my social skills can be attributed to my employment here. The number of employees increased during the time spent but did not hinder our overall unity. Every person is always addressed on strength and weakness so striving to do better is a common goal all employees shared."
good,"This was your typical entry level sales position. Not much to it but to be tidy, quick and professional. Overall the co workers are what made this job bearable."
good,"As assistant manager, I learned to operate all aspects of the store, from managing schedules, to inventory, to cash wrap and even payroll. The hardest part was making sure all employees, including myself, had enough hours to accumulate decent pay."
good,Gap was a mess. New Management every year until the store closed.
good,"When I get to work, I enjoy it very much. However, that is rare. I am rarely scheduled for a full week and it's not because I am a bad worker. When I do work, I am praised for my hard work and detail, yet I continue to only get two shifts a week, which doesn't help someone to pay bills or save up."
good,"The company is a really good company to work for, I learned a lot in the company,"
good,"This was also another Temp job for over the holiday season. They had a very positive staff hard working and organized, everything worked well during the crazy rush of Christmas shoppers."
good,"Throughout my years, management had continuously changed and along with the loss of key leaders came the lack of support and respect between leadership roles. I did make some lasting friendships from this employer, but felt that no matter how tried I did not get the recognition or possibilities for advancement that I deserved."
good,Typical day at work is very enjoyable for the most part but can be overwhelming at times 
good,"I worked at the GAP for 4 years. It was a waste of time because you cant become full time unless you become a manager, once you become a manger you can't enjoy life because you have to be available for the JOb almost 24 hours."
good,"Good security, everyday new duties, huge store, nice merchandise."
good,This is a retail company. The operate like retail companies do. Holidays are the biggest season and making money is the most important to the company.
good,"They work you like robotics, expect to much of you, breaks are not long enough, mandatory overtime with 1 day notice. Favoritism among supervisors...."
good,Working at the GAP on 6th ave as a student is nearly impossible. They don't take into consideration other things you are committed to. The management staff was new at the time and for the most part all over the place and very sloppy.
good,"The job itself was an average ok job, but it would have been better smoothly ran if the store had better management. The employees where awesome to with. Management is rude. And don’t know how to professionally speak to their employees."
good,I have no review on working at gap. It was an okay place to work and I do not care about reviewing it. It was a winter job and it was an easy hire. Management was annoying.
good,"You get to work with some very nice individuals. "
good,Gap is a great brand that is experiencing a tough time recapturing marketshare and customers it has lost over the year. During my 2nd time there many people left the company from assistant to CEO.
good,busy...liked helping customers find clothes. i don't really have a lot to say. i hated that i had to sell the gap credit card even though people didn't want it.
good,The management belittles employees by using in store communication devices to antagonize people when they feel that it is appropriate. It is completely unprofessional.
good,A good place to find out rather retail is something your really up for. I will it is fun sometimes but other times you discover things within the company that you wish not to be apart of. I feel there are things they could do to improve but thats not my place.
good,"Not something I always looked forward to, but it was a job. There was always too much staff working at once and some weren't willing to do their job but I was always willing to pick up the slack of those around me."
good,I mainly folded the denim and took care of the fitting room. Job wasn't challenging at all. My co-workers were pretty nice. I didn't become great friends with any of them but they were nice
good,"Most of the people who worked there were really unprofessional. The scheduling manager was unfair when scheduling people, most of the employees complained about it to the general manager but nothing was done. they're excuse would be that there were no hours but yet, there were employees doing over time. "
good,The company is struggling to define a clear message and strategy and this creates havoc for store level employees. The irregular sale events make workload unmanageable but also deter the store from capitalizing on full price items.
good,i would be on the sales floor helping people or at the register or in the back stocking or in the fitting rooms
good,"Old Navy North Bergen is a chaotic high traffic store.  While the staff struggles to maintain a clean and functioning shopping environment the customers continually show lack of basic social skills.  They range from messy to flat out disgusting.  "
good,"Gap will work you hard and give you pennies. The coworker were great, some managers were great and understanding. The store manager was barely on the sales floor always in the office doing nothing. The operations manager at my store was transferred from Canada and she only gave hours to the people she liked. She would seriously give you like 5 hours for the whole week if she did not like you. The pay is disgusting, it's a shame that a company who make millions pay so little ($8.50). Then they gave me a 13 cents raised. What is 13 cents? You can not survive in NYC making $8.50 an hour. It's sad!"
good,Weekends and Holidays were very busy. Sales associates had plenty of tasks to do.
good,Typical day at work would be to greet every customer that comes in the door. I don't think I learned anything at this job. Management and co-workers i felt could care less about you. The hardest part of the job was always doing your very best but not get a little bit of recognition. Most enjoyable part of the job was putting up displays for new season trends.
good,An enjoyable workplace only let down by no job security. I enjoyed the day to day job and the people I worked with.
good,"Check the window display clean and well maintained, mannequins/props detailing and styling accurate to directive detail;the lighting and the brand standard. I've learned a proper merchandising techniques and for the management that is handling the brand I cannot say that they are perfect and for the staff they are not easy to please but some are ok, 9 working hrs a day and hardest is when the sale is come, but I love when the new collection is coming enjoying for the window display and merchandising the shop,"
good,The hardest part of my job was that sometimes my day to day was confusing due to lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of my job would happen to be my coworkers everyone there was very niceand looked out for each other.
good,"Overall I would say I enjoyed my time at Gap Outlet, I did receive support from management when going through tough times, I had the opportunity to learn lots and training is given(when asked for). The reasons I would say I left gap would include: customers - a lot of policy’s we had at gap did not have the customers best interest at heart, which lead to me having more then few, explosive, uncomfortable and unresolved situations with customers(many of which I was not paid enough to deal with) being sworn at and threatened by unhappy customers due to poor policies in place. One of the other reason would be understaffing, I worked in a large sized store, and many times would be left the only person on the shop floor, leaving me vulnerable and unable to give the  customer the experience they deserve; one example being left by my manger going on their break( the next person was due in, in 20 minutes time) while myself being the only person trained to be on the tills and only one other person in the shop floor, mix this with 15+ customers in the que all with 5+ items each as we had a major event on. Too many poorly scheduled days resulting in unnecessary high stress levels for all levels of staff. "
good,The employees are a great group of people to work with. Peak season is very demanding 6 days a week for months. Training could use a bit more hands on mock calls before going on the floor
good,Working here is okay as a first job but I did not enjoy working for this company in the long run. The management is mediocre at best and does not have the best interests of their employees in mind. I am grateful to be not working for this company anymore.
good,"As with most warehouse jobs the hours are long and physically demanding. As of late with the company there have been many drastic changes within management losing a lot of older supervisors in trade for new ones. As result the work space is very disorganized and stressful. When things are done right the supervisors take credit, when done wrong although it all falls on the employee. Breaks have also been limited to a 15 and a 25 in comparison to our old 30 and 30. Overtime is regular expect to work 6 days a week regularly. Scheduling is not very flexible you are expected to use pto at all times. Typically if you are a hard working employee you will be taking up the slack for all the less motivated co workers. There is definitely a bias within the workspace depending on who you are which will judge how much work you do. There is no room for movement upwards in the company unfortunately. Many of my peers who were well qualified applied to higher up positions within the company, only to be told the company is only looking for outside interviews. If you need a job for a year or so to get by it is perfect. If you're looking for a career although I would not recommend this."
good,"Starting at old navy was a great experience the team was excellent"
good,"This is not the job for someone who is lazy. It is very demanding. running and operating a split level store while solving a seemingly endless number of problems for hours on end with no help in sight can be daunting. You must be able to make quick and clear decisions that will impact the entire day at a moments notice. One small mistake can set you back for hours, even on some cases the entire day. You will also be overworked and underpaid. Enjoy"
good,"Nobody can live off $10.00 and especially with children. Poor management. They definitely pick favorites in this store. No matter how much cleaning or folding you do, they constantly think you do nothing."
good,"I felt belittled everyday, extreme favoritism, anything you do will not be good enough, overworked, overall just not worth the headache. I love retail just not here."
good,"A passable in between job, but management will have you pulling your hair out. If you aren't grinding your life to dust, then you aren't moving fast enough. Pay vs Labor is way off considering the amount of Labor you will do. Good for the 30% discount, bad to live a quality life."
good,"manage meant is horrible idid stock "
good,A great entry level job. Excellent for learning retail business on small scale. Focus is on driving business and of course the bottom line. could be fun at times.
good,"I love this company it's a experience working with this denim culture such great ideas ,only bad hours and bad scheduling, lots of management flaws.I worked with great teams over a 8 year span.My years hear brought me knowledge in many different career fields from merchandising to logistics to sales,and more I feel I would work for this company again. However the climb up the ladder is a power struggle and lotts of hours and hard work. If your dedicated to your job this is the place for you."
good,"This job was a personal experience that I will never forget. You'd spend a few hours folding clothes in a section only to witness one unsupervised, grubby-fingered child undo absolutely everything about your existence. Every day this happened brought about a familiar moment of existential crisis. You just get used to it after a while."
good,"Is good if you like the clothing, fashion, etc, Is very stressful because you are not allow to have initiative. When the season is slow better look for another job, when the season is good you could make good money. Many different people and cultures as a co-workers"
good,"-Management was experiencing many changes and were not fully prepared to deal with this as well as see to the needs of their employees. "
good,"It was my first job.  As a sales associate, my time was monitored very closely.  There is little down time, as we always had to be out on the floor.  Customer service is valued highly."
good,Shipment was fun and honestly the best part of working in retail. Its very fast paced and demanding. Friendly working environment for those interested .
good,A typical workday would be like folding laundry all day. Ive learned how to deal with angry costumers. Hardest part of the job is keeping  yourself entertained and having the will to continue to fold and refold.
good,"High expectations from management, Hard to live up too. Seasonal for three months unless management makes you full time."
good,"Job is an ok job, the supervisors do not seem to have it all together. Generally unorganized, and no proven advancement opportunities."
good,"A typical work day for me was just going to work walking in and walking around the store after I have clocked in to make sure that everything was picked up off the floor to make sure that there were no hangs or merchandise that was knocked down. I learned how to multi-tasks because, this work environment consisted of my doing my job and making sure the store was clean but along with that i would help any customer that was need of help. I was there for a short period of time and i was to close to many of my co-workers. I wouldn't say that there was a hard part of my job. Every part was very doable i stayed on top pf my work load. The most enjoyable part of my job getting to go to work everyday and help people."
good,For this to be a seasonal job it was a good experience in working with customers and meeting new people.  The trainers within this company was really great
good,"Good Learning experience in Old Navy. "
good,Family friendly sales that included up selling and customer service. merchandise set ups and replenishment. Store cleaniness.
good,"Low wage, non reasonable managers, OK environment. Doesn't give flexible hours, co-workers are systematic individuals. At the end of the days its work."
good,Hard to get full time. They don't manage our time very well. Part time employees are basically seasonal employees with a higher title.
good,"Folding clothes."
good,I was able to grow in this company. i became the lead cashier where i am able to train new cashiers and managers new to the company
good,it was a ok place to work at. Very little hours. The last manager I worked with was inept
good,Management was incredibly confusing here. Your manager changed on a day-to-day basis and you had to look at a posting to see who it was. Then you would have to find them and report to them to learn your job duties for the day.
good,"My typical day at GAP Kids, everything would be folded, organized, stocked up the nigh before. Open the store and I would get an assigned area to take care of so if my area needed folding or put away it was my job. Helped customers to find sizes, or colors. I also operated the register. The management was okay they were always messing around because they liked each other, it was kind of unprofessional. I would say that the hardest part of the job was if I were closing, everything had to be as neat as it can be and organized of course. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers find what they are looking for."
good,"I truly enjoy working with this company. A typical day at work would be a fast paced working environment where sales associates provide top- quality customer service to our guest. We help maintain the store by constantly replenishing merchandise, assisting customers with putting together the perfect outfit or gift, recovering the store, and helping out at the register for check out. The most enjoyable part of this job would be suggesting and helping pick outfits! This is especially fun if you spend some time with the guest and get to know a little about them or the person whom they are shopping for. You get a feel for their personality, and in return, gives you a good idea on what to suggest. I especially love talking to the first time mothers who come in to find that perfect outfit to bring their new bundle of joy home in. I am able to share my expertise and enjoy my job all in one! The hardest part of my job would be getting customers to listen to all of the wonderful benefits of being a Gap cardholder. For the most part, they just think its just a full script we give each guest to get them to spend more money and put themselves deeper in debt, but for the guest who frequent our company, the Gap card is so much more. I used to have a hard time talking about the card to the guest, as I was afraid of rejection. But now, being a Gap employee for almost two years, its become second nature to me. I am proud to say that I have opened up more than six cards this year already. This helped me to meet my personal and company goals, and for this, I enjoy my job and feel like my work"
good,"long hours, good environment. Good location in New York, New york"
good,"old navy siegan lane, remodel was great. new store manager was horrible. never cared about anyone"
good,"I’ve worked in the shipping and receiving department by unloading merchandise trucks, to  "
good,I ended up leaving this company due to starting school and they refused to work with me after my best friend passed away there was a lot of stress because of the mall it was located in and the management was never willing to listen.
good,"It was a fun place to work at."
good,Working there was not horrible but it was not the best. The management was not professional and they seemed to be more into drama then the actual high school students were. It was not a great job.
good,"GAP can be fun and challenging. You are often faced with a variety of customer inquiries and requests. However this helps to elevate your skills in customer care. The co-workers are vibrant and enthusiastic. Management can be tricky but if your performance is on target you are fine. Coming from a banking background, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction and feedback."
good,"Consistent and vigilant attention to customer needs, an upbeat and cheerful attitude, as well as knowledge of operating the 'Point of Sale' registers, are a few of the things I learned while working at Gap, Inc.."
good,"Hard to get promoted, good team work, high turn over rate with management"
good,"Working at The Gap, one has to wear and sell their products. I worked in stock, sales, and merchandising. It is a good part time job. As with any job in retail, it is about customer service. Good Luck!"
good,While working at the Gap I noticed that management would make unrealistic deadlines to satisfy corporate instead of creating realistic goals for their team. Customer happiness is valued over employee happiness.
good,"No dan ningún tipo de prestación de ley, no es una empresa formal. Lo único bueno es trabajar solo los fines de semana"
good,"An ok place to work its very slow but i wouldn't recommend to all as it an unusual place to work. Its very very top heavy, to many directors not enough staff, to many people been there too long"
good,"Hours were very unstable. After the holiday season i was told it was ""luck of the draw"" for shifts, which is quite possibly the most unprofessional thing I've ever heard. Also didn't give any extra pay for having experience."
good,"I liked the job itself, but management is HORRIBLE. You have reviews every single week. I felt like I was under a microscope 24-7, and my manager didn't really listen to what I said. He also very rarely ever returned phone calls or emails. And I found out that I was losing my job via a company wide announcement in an email. I wasn't named personally, but the announcement stated anyone hired after a certain date would be let go either on December 27 or January 7th. My manager offered no guidance as to which group I was in, only that I would receive an email from HR with which date would be my last. I never received an email and just kept showing up for work until January 7th, and all of the managers that I met during training (except my manager) came to my desk throughout the day to tell me what a great job I'd done and to say they wished I weren't leaving."
good,"I had this job in high school. It was good but very brief. No one i worked with is still there, I no longer have an opinion on how they are now. Look to other comments on this company."
good,"the warehouse is way better, more fun to work, more hours available, fun people to work with man I miss fishkill campus in New York came to Rhode Island and started working at the store"
good,"Then this is the place for you. Good benefits, mandatory overtime in peak season, some nice customers,  some raging lunatics.  Management is oftentimes seasonal, meaning they don't know what they are doing and guide you that way, ensuring failure."
good,I had stated to like this job until I noticed how far it was they surrounded me with people who were very kind and sweet I learned a lot from that job
good,"Management leaves a lot to be desired. Favoritism between managers and employees. Coworkers are usually great (racist incidents amongst employees and, unfortunately, aren’t reported by victims). Hardest part of the job are the customers. Most enjoyable are the coworkers who become friends/family."
good,"This job is for  younger  individuals, it requires a lot of walking at a fast pace, being on your feet for the entire shift except your short breaks. It was a seasonal job and didn't provide much room for stability or growth"
good,"Ambiente stimolante , si guarda molto le formalità e non si apprezza l'operato."
good,"when I started, it was great; great support, great management, great training, comparable pay (got quite the increase from previous job), 4 weeks vacation, etc. My manager left, and DM went on Maternity leave... End of an era. Downhill from there, not willing to promote me to the position, etc. WORST HOLIDAY SEASON IN RETAIL IN ALL MY YEARS EXPERIENCE. Unsupportive, unreasonable, irritating, chaos! After I wasn't ""the newest manager"" I was dirt."
good,"If you have serious bills, this isn't the job for you unless you're a manager or higher up. The company doesn't give you an opportunity for growth. If you just got out of high school or live at home, this job could be a good fit for you."
good,"Un'azienda gestita da persone giovani che da opportunità di lavoro a tutti. "
good,"It was a great company to work for for many years , leadership changes and the competition with fast fashion have ruined what made the company great. before it was about offering great  training and encouraging independent thinking. Management was actually open to ideas from the field. all changed under the new leadership. They are creating high turnover, mistrust and an overall sense of disorganization and lack of clear goals and no actual organized execution ,"
good,The company itself is good (except when they change sales last minute). The pay isn't great and you're lucky if you get more than 12 hours a week as a sales associate.
good,"its ok for a part time job-discounts on clothes are good"
good,"Pay is decent if you have the guts to ask for it. Management is protected and untouchable. If you have an issue, even if it violates company policy- it will be down played and management will always be protected. "
good,"it was an okay place to work at, It was not an ideal retail job, but it wasn't bad either. the management was not as organized as hoped, but all in all, it was alright."
good,"Working for Gap Inc was challenging yet rewarding. Chances for advancement were not as frequent as I had hoped. However, the culture was amazing and the employees were always friendly."
good,"the gap was a fun place to work, not enough hours to support cost of living or even daycare, co-worker were to nice to work with everyone worked as a team. the management was fair and easy to work for"
good,HR team is fantastic. You can be a remote agent. Its a great place to students or seniors. If you can handle the pressure stress and mandatory hours that's your place to work at.
good,Started working this job as a temp/seasonal employee.   They asked me to stay part time as I already had a full time job. 
good,I worked for the company for many years takes alot of hard work no real life balance great health care benefits you meet lots of different people which makes the job a pleasure.
good,"I started working there a little bit after they first opened, and I started out with decent hours for a part time job. I got about 18 hours a week, which was fine with me. Recently, however, we started getting, at a maximum, 13 hours. Usually, I get anywhere from 4.5 to 9 hours weekly now, as do the rest of my coworkers, even those paying rent. People are quitting left and right, don't apply!"
good,the job was quick-paced and there was a lot to do at all times. The only good thing was that there was so much work my days went by exceedingly fast .
good,"I worked for Gap for almost a year , and for the first couple months it was GREAT . I LOVED working at Gap . But after basically getting a whole new management team , everything started to go downhill and become stressful . We got a new Store Manager who came and acted like he was to good to speak to his employees , and later we got a new Asistant Manager and he had no retail experience ! Employees had to show him the ropes and he turned around and tried to tell us how to do our work that we taught him . All they care about are Gap Cards , its the most annoying thing . To the point they would threaten your job if you didnt get Gap Cards . They run the whole store with just 2-3 employees and expect everything to be done , you basically have to sneak around and pick up hours . There's no reason we close at 9 & stay and clean till 2am . Schedule more workers and that wouldnt happen . And they are also quick to accuse you of things and fire you . So watch your back . Never think a Manager or CoWorker wont turn against you to save themselves ."
good,Everyone is enthusiastic and ready to hit ort goal for the day. Work environment is fun everyone is nice especially the managers. They motivate you to reach the goal and get rewarded. I remember I got 5 credit cards in a week and I got a $10 movie gift card. That was so of the managers. Overall a fun work experience.
good,"Responsible for the shortage reduction within 3 markets in the New England region into the Upstate New York area totaling 61 Old Navy stores."
good,"Arrive at 6 am, wait for shipment to arrive, around 7:30 am unpackaged boxes for sorting of men, women, kids, toddler, baby, maternity and active fit wear. Sorted and restocked items on sales floor. Learned to be fast a thorough. Co-workers were fun and great to work with. Hardest part is when you think your doing your best and giving it your all to be told you aren't moving fast enough. The most enjoyable part was leaving because management by certain people didn't make working there fun and a pleasure."
good,Pour hours as a part-time employee. Boring whenever slow and you typically get sent home early. Credit card acquisition is annoying. Some management is hard to work with.
good,"Low rating, always a new ""how to"" do things, act, dress, be, learn when the last option was not used properly. If unwilling to advance in education, job advancement was held against you."
good,Fast paced warehouse. Nice place to work. Good employees. Normal day is getting workload complete to deliver to stores.
good,"very hard work, but great benefits. the management could use a little help, but the folks who make the cut are great hard working people."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers and onboarding new hires.  Managers are difficult to work with.  It would help if they were proactive and base events on actual facts but it's easier to blame the coordinator without reason or context than to point the finger elsewhere.  "
good,It was fun to be part of the team when Gap Inc. was at it's best.  The energy was astounding.  Brand Recognition was incredable
good,"This was my job, great with working around school schedules or a part-time position. Knowledge of products help you close out a sale to individual customers."
good,"A typical day at work, quickly read email, margin reports, sales performance and daily drivers. Quickly check the schedule for the day and upcoming days. Go out to floor. Manage and lead the floor for 60% or more of my shift. Move product to increase sales, drive daily business and lead the team."
good,"I improved my english, I learned to be multi task and I also learned the importance of a good management."
good,sometime you have too finesh late and back in on the frist shift in the morning.
good,"Worked for GAP while trying to find full time work. While being obviously overqualified, there was apparently no room to give a manager position."
good,"The employee's at the gap were nice and friendly, but the management needed a lot of work. Unorganized with the scheduling to poor hours.The hardest part of the job was the lack of communication from management."
good,This is a fun and exciting company to work for. Would recommend working for this company as a second job.
good,"I worked at GAP for five years. In those five years my pay only increased 75cents. In my particular store, I am sure we've had over a dozen managers. Each new manager is from an outside retail store. There is never a conversation with interested store associates about open positions. There is, also, never any talk on how to grow within the company. My most recent manager is the reason I am no longer with the company. Despite the sorry pay and revolving door of managers, I sincerely loved my coworkers and my customers. I, however, do not appreciate the patronizing, snarky, malicious, petty, condescending way that I was treated. I do not recommend this job for anyone who wants to grow within the company. The best way to get ahead with GAP is to gain leadership experience at another retail location and hope they accept you."
good,"This company is wasteful. All they care about are sales and talking to people so they can ""buy more"". Not everyone will care about the sales. Don't ask associates to tell men that women's jeans are on sale, they *don't* care."
good,"a typical day can range between restocking, setting new floor plans, cashiering, to shipment and reviving. I've learned the ins and outs of retail stores because of this job since they cross train you for most every position. The most enjoyable part is mastering your craft, I love knowing everything there is to know about a certain subject or item. It's in the detail! I've also learned new thing at this company, which keeps thing fresh and exciting."
good,"• Supervised staff of 40 + employees; maintain staff results by coaching, monitoring, counseling, disciplining, planning and appraising results"
good,"Enjoyed the experience of working in sales environment and being part of visuals team. The only downfall for the position was the late night/early morning hours and slow pace after the holidays, which took a toll on the pockets and prompted search for full time job."
good,Typical day at work is busy moving in & out working with customers. Making sure their needs are met best & to sale at the same time. I've learned how to be more patient. Management is so & so. Their are different attitudes in the atmosphere. My co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part is not having things that my customers look for & the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfied customers.
good,"Working for the company i have done for ten years I have learned about managment, coaching and importance of dedication and hard work to get maximum results. I Began as a sales associate as previous i was a floor manager for 7 years at McDonalds. I worked my way up from a specialist, to visual merhandiser combined with key holder skills. It has been a challanging ten years in the company in which my passion for visual merchandising, managment, sales within retail has excelled."
good,Go to work and check all pre daily logs for information and special needs and follow the day as it unfolds. I learned how loss prevention works and all other jobs in the business as I did quality control as well. I had to work close with management as I was an administrator for management information services. I had the opportunity to work with some of the most conscious employees I ever worked with. The hardest part of my job was the minute by minute changes that took place daily and the most enjoyous part of the job was learning every phase of the industry.
good,"It's a great place to work, everyone works as a team. There are great sister store discounts and customer reward systems."
good,"Very hard environment to work in, but co-workers always make up for it."
good,As an associate this is a great place to work- just clock in and clock out. However as a manager you are subjected to some brutal criticism. Anyone can call it constructive and get away with it. You'll be told to do something one way and your DM will say that it's wrong no matter what.
good,"no room for advancement. There were to many managers with their own ideas, but there was not alot of work getting done in a timely manor."
good,The Gap is a good brand to work for if you want to start in retail. It's a company that with a good mix of busy and not so busy moment. The experience depends on you.
good,"The company was great, but the location wasn't the busiest."
good,Great place to learn; the facility has the latest technology; hours are mostly reasonable; open concept offices; not a lot of opportunities for upper leadership.
good,"The company itself is great to work for (the benefits and everything are real awesome), however, my experience with moving up in the company is that it was hard. I've been there for 4-5 years and there was never an opportunity for associates. I once had an ASM transfer to our store and was appalled that I had been there so long and that he had become a manager with NO prior experience. You can imagine my face. The new Store Manager also called me insults in the break room towards the end of my time at Gap Outlet. I've never talked bad or done anything wrong to anyone during my time at Gap, I was very hard-working and put my all into that job. They never gave me Employee of the Month either, and handed it out to employees who literally were the embodiment of incompetent, so that was also frustrating. Gap overall, seems like a very casual, lenient store so you're definitely going to work harder than most, if not all, associates because they can't seem to make good judgement among new hires. That to me would be the hardest part of the job, whether it be a small or big store location, the store either has no coverage or too much coverage because either way you're picking up A LOT of the slack. The only enjoyable part of the job is the employee rewards system that is given to you in the form of points everyday for your work that you can use on a exclusive employee store to redeem."
good,The older people there really aren't welcoming to newcomers. They stick to their own and kind of give the newbies a hard time. They Switch the managers around every year and we tend to get those who have no clue what to do and instead of helping they throw them under the bus
good,"Depending on the district, Gap can be great or a rough place to work. The company is going downhill fast and the constant reminders in the news and lack of reassurance from corporate make it an un-easy place to work with extremely high expectations, but little to no support to actually get your job finished, all while wondering if your store will close next due to the poor leaders at corporate."
good,The overnight team at Gap has weak moral there is no understanding of team spirit and the environment is toxic and stressful overall. Furthermore the sorry excuse for managment is merely a byproduct of a broad broken system that encompasses all of Gap Inc. I would not recommend.
good,A lot of hours for only part time and no management and management are rude and they will keep you past midnight for clean up and they won’t let you leave when your time is up and unorganized
good,"A typical day at work would be receiving packages of clothes, (Women, Men, Babies, Kids,) and processing them to be displayed on the floor. If the clothes couldn't fit on the floor anymore, we had a method to backstock them into our stock room. I learned a lot of things working here such as management training. I met lots of friends here. I've seen lots of employees come and go, and even managers. The management here sucks. NO raise! Hot all the time! Germs all the time! No one covers their mouth when they sneeze."
good,Go to work and do your job. Don't get caught up in the mix of things. Mind your business. It is just like every job. You are not there to make friends.
good,"the pay is normal for retail but they don't give employees many hours. management only looks out for their own interests. the employee discount is really good, i recommend working just few hours a week for the discount."
good,"Separate merchandise by their bar code numbers, put in the data entry to pull up the customers information, scan each item for that order, make a shipping label and ship the order. I was also doing corrections at the end with i had to fix orders that were either missing an item or it was the wrong color/size item."
good,"The higher-ups are rude to the in-store managers, and it causes them to treat the associates the same way. They are unrealistic and not open to suggestion"
good,"You WILL be on your feet for 9 1/2 hrs when busy. But not a good place to work right now if you've got bills to pay, too much VTO, not enough work. Every minute that you are in the building you are tracked/timed, be ready to work for your money!"
good,It's full of part-time college students who are amazing and fun to hang out with. Most people are easy to get along with. It's very slow during the week and you don't get many hours but it is an easy job.
good,"There isn't too much to say about working for Gap. It wasn't a horrible job, and Black Friday was actually a lot of fun to work, but it was just decent. The management was okay, but very much in a clique and if they didn't like you, you were in for a long shift..."
good,"Coming into the job I watched training videos, but 95% of the video did not relate to the actual work I did. I was never properly trained to do the tasks of my job title, stock associate. I basically do what a sales associate does, but it took 8 months for them to teach me to use a cash register, but even then they threw me on it like I somehow knew it already but I had to keep bothering them with questions because obviously I didn't know how to do it being it was my first time ringing. The past 3 general managers were not very friendly, they always pushed for us to get cards but never gave much positive reinforcement or feedback, the other managers were nice though. The other employees were very nice as well. Overall, I had to learn what to do myself and found that this job is rather unfulfilling for me personally. The good thing with this store is that there are a lot of employees so it's easy to get time off, but of course it's unpaid time off and we get no benefits other than a discount I've hardly used."
good,"the best part of working in Gap Inc is the employee discount at Gap Outlets, Gap Brands, Old Navy, Banana Repand it's a fun place to wrok with, would have waned to re apply soon"
good,"Lack of clear direction from leadership led to lots of last minute changes. Multiple organizational restructuring and lack of consistent process. "
good,Its ok if you need the money but its a job you would not  want to have forever. I am thankful for the opportunity GAP gave me when i needed the job but I need another job with my field of study.
good,"Because GAP isn't one of the most popping stores so its slow. You really have to have your hours very open to get days. My hours consist of 4 hours and my pay is no more than $300. I would call this a side job; you have to have another job to pay bills definitely! The longer you are there, the higher you pay goes I believe. My managers are very annoying on GAPCARDS. If you get Gapcards, you get the most hours. It's pretty unfair but I guess"
good,The people were great and I enjoyed the job but because of staff being disorganized and possibly not trained enough made doing my job difficult. They was a high turn over rate so we were always training new staff. And because of that the days were more difficult to get through and hard to get tasks done by deadline
good,The coworkers were nice but the management was both unprofessional and disorganized. The managers never communicated about their subordinates schedules or when there was a schedule change. The main manager at the time talked about other coworkers behind their backs instead of just addressing the problem straight to their face
good,"worked here long enough, i miss somethings but 4 different stores i worked at and none of them beat home. also like high school all over again managers played favorite and let it be known"
good,"I was just there on the holiday season, so I could not experience a lot there."
good,At the end of the day you're selling jeans and t-shirts. Its going be low pay and minimal benefits because most of your co-workers are 16-20 year olds trying to make gas money. Not a bad company not much for a career.
good,I liked gap it was only till i went to college and i was playing basketball as well. I liked the job just wasn't many hours and the pay was poor but i enjoyed my co workers
good,"love working here, the only issue I did have was that pay raises weren't negotiable and some people were paid unfairly. managers were okay as well and the staff is friendly"
good,"On a typical day one spends 90% of the time folding clothes, which is find and understandable. It is a clothing store after all. The rest of the time is spent with customers, which is the highlight. Helping people feel their best is fulfilling. "
good,"First time working in retail and i worked in the children's section of the flagship store in downtown Manhattan. Honestly was a lot better than I expected considering the horror stores you hear about working in retail. Overall, it was the customers that made the job worth it; nothing like helping somebody find that item they're really hoping you have or don't even know they wanted until you present it to them."
good,"I come into work and it depends on what day it is, but if it was a shipment day I would get to the store at 5am, start with unloading shipment and getting it processed and out on the floor. If it a regular day, I'm either working on the signage for the store, marking items down, running items from shipment and/or just being on the floor as sales and service leader (customer servicing). I've learned so much in my 6 and half years with Gap Inc. I've learned how to handing the money, how to open and close a store, I've learned how to manage multiple people at one time. I have very good communication skills after working in retail and customer service for as long as I have. So I love asking questions. The hardest part of my job is trying to communicate with a boss that doesn't know how. I like to work with people that want to be at there job, that want to ask questions, and that want to be asked questions. The open door policy is HUGE with me. The most enjoyable part about my job is getting everything I need to get done and actually completing everything. The feeling of being so accomplished afterwards."
good,The contractors are overworked and under paid for their time.  The contracts are also quite short in duration.  The contractors also don't have a lot of input to key decisions.
good,Communication between managers and associates was questionable. Breaks could have been atleast 10 min longer for 11 hour work days
good,you're easly replaced and will find anything to complain about. If you stay on they're good side you'll be just fine. A typical day at the gap would be any other day clock in and when you're done you clock back out.
good,"I don't know much about the team because they don't seem friendly to me, I don't feel comfortable around any of them because I am the only African American during the hours I work and everyone speaks Spanish around. I don't feel I belong and disrespected."
good,The Gap was a great experience because you learn so much that helps you develop skills to help you do multiple tasking and to ensure the customer left happy
good,"Typical day at the gap it starts off slow in the mornings but as day go by it gets very busy and crazy.I learned Customer is always #1. Management is horrible, very rude. Co-workers were cool, I got along with all, some still keep in touch. Hardest part of the job is the rude customers, they do what they want, always leave a mess not just clothes.Most enjoyable part of job is actually when you have nice customers."
good,"They don't pay you enough, there is no advancements they tell you that there is but their isn't no advancement you can can switch departments and every department make the same, if you drive equipment i feel like you should make more but you make the same as everyone else."
good,"easy work. never expected to be there as long as I have. management started out well, until favoritism came into play..."
good,Many of the tenured employees are leaving this company because the culture is no longer about people and people development. The strategy has changed countless times over the last 6 years and it is still not right. They've lost who their customer base is because they keep chasing trends that are not relevant in the market and cheapen the brand and the integrity of the prices by taking markdowns too deep and too frequently. Employees and managers don't  speak up about concerns because they often go unaddressed. Many tenured managers are also placed on a salary cap however external hires are often hired above the cap and are eligible for pay increases.
good,Usually started off the day with unloading merchandise off the truck and placing them in categories to make placement easier when done. would either work on the cash registrars or on the floor dealing with clients or rearranging piles. worked alongside with good co-workers and enjoyed the work.
good,"Great place to learn and gain experience of the retail industry. Typical day is busy.  People work hard and love to keep things going.  You live, learn and grow.  New business partners are generally pleasant, the grandfathered employees tend to come off entitled and a bit presumptuous.  Unfortunately, some inexperienced managers with poor communication and management skills.  Good company benefits."
good,"bonne esprit d’équipe. "
good,"Over all the work is easy. Management tends to give hours to people they favor more. Co-workers are nice, there's no drama. Everything is easy just have to get used to it."
good,"At Gap i had some of the most amazing co-workers. I absolutely enjoyed working there because the environment was fun. My only problem was with management. There was a lot of favoritism within the store which i didn't like. The hardest part of working at Gap just like any other retail store is the rude customers. That is something i got used to, and learned how to deal with it in a respective manner."
good,"Bonne formation en alternance."
good,"La mia tipica giornata di lavoro si può descrivere brevemente così:"
good,No the best work place.  There are good benefits but the management is very pushy and expect life to revolve around work.  They have terrible on call scheduling and very inconsistent with hours per week.
good,"Regular opening and closing "
good,"discount is great, music is awesome, culture is fun. great for a college job while going to school full time."
good,"customer dealing  "
good,"If I happened to be lucky enough to get schedualed, 9/10 times my shift would be cancelled before I had the chance to get there due to budgetting and schedualing failures."
good,Gap Inc. is a good place to work.  The business is very dynamic and teams are focused on delivering results.  Good benefits.
good,"Good for a part time job, no hours at all. Sometimes you get 1-2 days per week."
good,"esssendo la responsabile mi occupavo di tutte le mansioni che ci sono da fare in un negozio, eravamo due e l'altra commessa si occupava solo di assistenza."
good,"The pay isn't well, but you do get experience in retail and they accommodate your schedule well."
good,Its a great place to work and good start in the work field. Not many benefits included with this job beside employee discount and after a year a 401K. Hours are never steady and can be only 3 hours a week to 35 depending on workflow and holidays. No pay vacations or sick leaves unless in management. Workers/managers attitudes and work ethics vary depending on location.
good,I unpacked boxes for shipment about twice a week and helped maintain the sales floor; making it look clean and neat. My management was unprofessional and did not have solid plans. My co-workers were unproductive and lazy. Which made picking up there slack the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part was getting my check on payday.
good,Was seasonal so it was fun to work and help people during the holidays.
good,There was no real form of management and they were careless about their jobs and what employees where stealing from the store.
good,"You do not want to work there as a seasonal solely because if they feel they hired to many they will le you go as it did happen to me. Great place to work, great people but management there is so unorganized. They have screwed up peoples schedules and pay. so if you can get passed all that then you are good to work there"
good,"A typical day consist of assisting 200+ customers with choice of merchandise and price, stock and assort inventory, and complete given task. I learned most from customers. I learned from the way they react to me that I was doing something right. The smile on face on a consisting basis helped me gain customer loyalty. Management was fair. Co-workers were full of energy. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with price changes that just changed that day. The most enjoyable part was customer satisfaction."
good,I had a productive work environment with the freedom to work independent on numerous tasks. Was very fun assisting the day to day customers and exploring different ways in giving outstanding service with the option of turning a customer into a client. There was limited responsibility for me and ideas I wanted to express about making a better merchandising presentations was a challenge because I was a part - time employee. Off and on management was both supportive and difficult to work with considering the individual but I focused on making it the best experience possible for me.
good,This is a great place to work part time management was great and the employees and customers were fun to work with on the day to day basis
good,Typical day consisted of meeting and greeting customers. Making sure their every want and need was met. Keeping the clothing neat and the store clean and tidy. Cashier.
good,"The company has many positive and negative qualities, but there is little to no room for advancement."
good,Management was pretty nice. I really enjoyed the seasonal position because I got to help people with things they wanted to wear for the holidays. Not a very good pay rate though. Especially not for all that I was doing there.
good,"Like most retail management jobs, it is high stress, high anxiety, and plenty of drama."
good,"I love the diversity, the people are great and the staff is great, however when it comes to moving up DM doesn't seem to want to move you up. I've been an acting assistant manager for 6months now and when the ASM position became available I wanted to apply for it and talk to the GM to talk to the DM about moving up, all they could say is that I'm not ready without giving a valid explanation to why or how I can improve. Prior to my 6month acting assistant manager period, I have been with the company for 2yrs and I had to transfer to move up the first time and now I'm stuck and I wish whoever is apply to work for the company luck unless you have a management team that has your back and wants you grow."
good,Rough beginning. The assistant manager was a bully and abusing her power but once she was gone it was a nice environment and gave you opportunities to grow
good,"Started at the Gap at a young age, got promoted within a few years, but soon became frustrated with the company. Holiday seasons are obviously tough to handle- long hours, unruly customers, tough upper management. With the rise of online shopping stores began closing rapidly, jobs were eliminated or salaries were reduced for people who remained at the stores that didn't close."
good,"I’ve worked within the company before and wanted to branch out to the other company’s, however Gap was not for me. I did not feel accepted and I often felt I was the “odd one.” I love working in retail because there are so many people you can meet and work with, however, I worked with and talked with the same people. I wish Gap would have more diversity when it comes to hiring new employees"
good,"Although I like working at this Company, the history & how the organization was formed (employees don't work cross-functionally outside of their divisions); makes it very hard to accomplish anything. Even planning meetings are a mess - no wonder the product that goes to stores isn't great."
good,"Prepare to be running all day long.  I know it's just retail, but I lost 15 lbs in the first 3 months working there.  Company is ok but they train their customers to wait for sale since there's always a sale."
good,Everyday feels like inventory when your at the gap. Keep that in mind when working in retail store.  Lots of merchandise means lots of folding! Choose your schedule wisely.
good,"We had 5 new managers when i worked there, lovley staff but not even pay for the hours and work youre putting in. The discounts are good and the quality of the clothes"
good,The Gap just doesn’t treat their employees fair when it comes to pay. There are people who work there that struggle to get a decent raise.  Then you have people that bus there but put in all the hard work every month for the whole year and still don’t get a raise based on how hard they work which is not fair.  There are people that work there including myself who have worked there for years and are just now making a certain amount and they bring in new people almost making the same amount. I feel that they should adjust the people pay for working there by at least two dollars more. Only the ones who are not maxed out to make it fair and adjust for the cost of living.
good,"Depending on what type of department you're in, you're going to have different experiences. In any department where there's clearly a high turnover rate, it's usually because there's a toxic culture there. "
good,Overall it wasn't too bad to work for until you get hurt.  Then they treat you very poorly.  They cut your health benefits off immediately and then cut you off the payroll shortly after that....making it impossible to survive.  Their compensation carrier is the WORST!!!!!
good,general manager sucks at 07173 location but other than that the job is okay it is good to do while in college i dont see it as an career necessarily but it can be for those with patience
good,"An a  holiday associate this position at Gap provided good work and school balanced."
good,Old navy was good to work for the sister company discounts were a major plus but my work environment was terrible. I was a transfer and the staff was racist and did not mind not hiding it. Was Called out my name and bullied.
good,Good first job and worth gaining the leadership experience but not worth a career. I gained a lot of customer service skills and experience here I think is sometimes forgotten about in this day and age.
good,"too much sitting and focus on placating the customers.  customers walk all over call center agents and when the call is elevated, they support the customer"
good,Atmosphere was low and management treated me like I was slow. I felt unwanted and just an extra body instead of a team. I never enjoyed coming to my shift.
good,"Good place to work but only ever focused on promoting the women in our section, manager came back from being on maternity leave and just disrupted the whole store, team did not like her but as management did, she kept the store."
good,"Dog eat dog work flow. They expect you to be cut throat everyday and cheat to get as much work done as you can daily. Their are no rules when it comes to your coworkers just rules for the warehouse and parking lot. Anything goes when it comes to getting the work done but maximum enforcement of rules when it comes to how it affects the company. They have a incentive pay program that's called ""grow"" but you'll only get it if your supervisor loves you and if he or she doesn't then they will go in and change your production numbers to make sure you never get any of the ""grow"" incentive pay. So you must be the biggest butt kisser on your team to receive any of the ""grow"" money."
good,"Retail has a unique culture, If you are looking for a company with a good culture. This is not the pace to work. It is very clicky and often the loudest voice is heard vs the person with the data to back it up. Be prepared to play politics and suck up to people who have earned their place by being the loudest voice in the room."
good,"It was a first job. Pay is low and customers are difficult. But no more than anywhere else. I ended up staying for two years because I didn't need to be anywhere else. But management, lack of pay and refusal to advance me forced me out."
good,"In the interview the manager made it seem it would be really fun to work with them and the team, good hours, 4-5 hour shifts and paid their minimum wage which was $10.00 an hour. That was not the case I asked for 30 hours and worked barely half that, I worked 12 a week. The shifts would fluctuate between 3-4 hours each day I worked, I only worked on the sales floor and never got trained on the cash register at all even though I asked for it. some of the policies aren't as clear and concise as they should be especially to new employees. I never got any ""good job"" with my work that I did even when I deal with every customer or tried to deal with every customer on the sales floor and its just me sometimes the manager or assistant helps but it was mostly me. They cared more about the profit for Corporate then care about the employees under the name and how they're doing your just another number to the system. I had to give my two week notice because all of the sudden my manager didn't give me hours for about two weeks, so I called it quits and never knew the answer as to why."
good,During the training process of gap it would have got a little difficult because I was so new to the work space and environment but after a while I learn that it takes practice and hard work and after taking my time working there it was a fun experience and getting to know what a job feels like at this age
good,"You are on your feet a lot, and for most people who are just starting in retail, it's going to be rather hard. The one I worked at never really took mine or any other associates life into matter."
good,"Working at the Gap is like working for other retail companies. You have good managers and you have managers who you have no idea how they got their position. It was fun though. I was working with people my age and also going to school (19-30). Co-workers definitely made my work day fly. The downside, getting Gap cards is a must and like any company they push push push like you can make people apply (a lot of times, people don't want another card). The discount is AWESOME!! Gap wants you to wear their clothes, so they offer a 50% discount on regular priced items, friends and family, additional 10% discount on clearance plus you get a discount at Old Navy and Banana Republic."
good,"Mangers would pick favorites, so speak up! Very flexible with availability. Great co workers. No dresscode just casual denim. Co workers is the best part"
good,"Too big to move fast.  Constant turn over from internal clients.  Legacy systems.  Technology is a an after thought.  C-level changes every few years and hence tech changes."
good,"No time restrictions on how much time you spent helping a customer, employees were empowered to offer discounts. Flexible schedule. Supervisors were not consistent with coaching."
good,Gap is a good company work. They have a generous discount. Very few full time opportunities for managers or sales associates. They do promote from within whenever possible.
good,I initially loved working at the Gap.  Part-time hours and the discount were great.  Hours are limited outside of Holiday hours but you are able to pick up shifts.
good,"With the new restructuring that has gone on, the positions just require much more work with absolutely no pay. The benefits given are decent, but the work environment along with the workload is absolutely ridiculous."
good,The job is okay if you are a part time student and you need to make decent money. As for moving up in the company is a stretch because they would rather pay for minimum wage for way more (out of sales associate job description) work. It was unfair and not worth the stress of a manager position without being a manager.
good,"I worked on the shipment team so I had to be in at 5 or 6 in the morning to spend three hours sorting and folding clothes. The people were nice, and I liked my bosses, I just did not enjoy the work. Also, because of the pay and because I could only get part time hours, I had to work a second job at night and I was exhausted all the time."
good,Did not like how they would send us home and end up working only  for a few hours. Management can be mean if u are not best friends with them. There is always something to do if your a good worker.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for a easy stress free job. Personally found it hard to move up in the company.Hardest part of the job was the 6am starts for delivery but had its benefits because you could leave earlier.
good,My day to day consisted of fashion sales for a children's clothing store. I got to meet new people everyday and was introduced to youth fashion.
good,"For myself, there was a mixed bag of positive and negative. As a Financial Analyst, you would think I would be encouraged to analyze whatever project I was working on, however, most of my time was spent being able to explain a variance without support. The work wasn't difficult, and it rarely ever needed to be worked on outside of the office, but it just wasn't what I hoped for."
good,"A typical day at work would be folding clothes and interacting with customers, finding the perfect size and giving them a head's up about the sale that is going on for that particular day."
good,"Io ho imparato sul tutto grazie a tutti del Gap, ero soddisfatto imparando veloce, preciso e attento."
good,Great place to learn customer service skills. You deal with a variety  of people daily and must deal with many personalities. My co-workers are fantastic to work with !!!
good,The gap was a good job just long hours doing hard labor. But the benefits were really good. Also we got paid every week with a raise every 30 days.
good,fun place to work but can be a bit overwhelming due to staffing needs. Staff is amazing just needs stronger management and participation.
good,"Great benefits and work life balance"
good,"Eu possuía a carteira de clientes e representantes, com as atividades comercial administrativa nesta empresa , aprendi a melhorar ainda mais a organização, focar em detalhe e registrar em planilhas tudo que solicitado e encaminhado."
good,"better pay "
good,"If you like wearing a walkie talkie then this is the place to be. The co-workers are nice but the managers can be very mean at times (depends on the location). They have On-calls, which basically means that if they scheduled you for an on-call you need to call them 2hrs before the shift starts and they'll let you know if you need to come in for work or not."
good,"Gap's slogan ""Do the right thing"" is what enticed me to join the team a year and a half ago. It is a reality for the IT group in Columbus. They believe in and forward agile principals, software craftsmanship and excellence to admirable levels.  However for some projects (such as mine) that are directed by management in San Francisco the command and control method is fully in play. They have co opted agile terminologies but run a type of waterfall process that is determined to deliver by any means necessary. The missed potential to deliver truly transformative solutions and the impact on teams that sincerely want to ""Do the right thing"" is the most disappointing aspect and why I am now looking elsewhere."
good,This job entails dealing with a variety of customers. The best part of working at gap was the people I worked with. The hardest part was the patients you were required to have for certain customers.
good,"A typical day at work involved walking the pick floor for 10 hrs. Picking orders for customer's and the store, as well as a processing customer returns, and refunding customer accounts. The hardest part of this job was keeping up with making production every month. The enjoyable part was the 3 day work schedule, and off for four days. I learned that customer satisfaction is very important to this company."
good,"The day goes by really fast and you have fun sometimes. Some of the managers have really bad attitudes and sometimes it doesn't seen like it matter how hard you work or how good of a job you do. Its always gonna be something negative at the end of the day. Which to me is bad. coworkers aren't really bad at all, you have a few here and there but it's all good. Communication can be isnt always there throughout the store that can turn into a problem most of the time."
good,"A typical day at work can be pretty stressful. Management can sometimes be a little frustrating, but its a good company. the most enjoyable part of the job is when we have events at work."
good,"The first day that I joined the team."
good,"When I worked for GAP, my responsible was to fold all (men, women, and children) clothes in the stockroom. I also did other tasks such as UPS shipments and organizing clothes in each departments. It was really enjoyable cuz I got to see whats new thats coming here. I worked from 11am to 4pm."
good,alot challenge with worker and in company gap somewhat it change something for me to something else.
good,"Great benefits and compensation, no work/life balance if you are in a high volume store."
good,"Typical day supporting a SVP & Team with day to day logistics and operational needs, calendar work, conference rooms planning, scheduling travel and completing expenses."
good,"As a manager of Gap, you must be able to multitask and have the ability to categorize tasks according to importance. There is always something to do and you are trained in all aspects of retail."
good,"This company is what you would expect from somebody looking for their first job. Hours can fit school schedule easily. If you are looking for full time employment, I recommend going elsewhere. It is very difficult to move up in this company and you are not compensated enough for the amount of stress leadership roles put you through."
good,"Typical days at the job included answering phones, helping parents interpret documentation necessary for federal funding and access to services, and observing the classrooms. The staff at GAP has been there for years and it was, at times, difficult to enter into feedback loops and pathways of communication."
good,My day begin working over night stocking and assisting inventory control. I learned that multi-tasking is essential and exercise the brain. My management staff was short but helpful when called upon. My co-workers were friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was the last few minutes before my shift was complete and keeping up the energy to clock out. What I enjoyed most was the multi-cultural atmosphere of meeting different people from different places.
good,"Start everyday at 5 am answered phones track freight all over the US and Canada."
good,"Every day starting with over view of week, with management and co workers very easy to understand. Hardest part was getting crossed trained in every department. Most enjoyable was success in all departments."
good,"Overall it was a good place to work.   Wonderful working environment.  But found out that they discriminate against you if you're over 50.   Me and 2 others were forced out because of our age.   (I was told by my manager)"
good,"I would start my day by reviewing financial reports and shipment logs to make sure there were minimal discrepancies. I would then check my email for any new information need to know for that day or that specific location. After completing all paper work and reviewing previous store audits, which are completed on a monthly basis. I would review previous LP agent logs; these logs indicate the areas of the store that need immediate attention. After tackling the issues in the store and training staff on prevention methods I would then begin floor walking. While floor walking I would apprehend any shoplifters and de-escalate any potential threats in the store. After a apprehension there is paper work that needs to be filled out immediately."
good,I loved the people that I worked with and I enjoy it very much but I rarely scheduled for a full week.
good,"As a sales associate, the best part of my job was conversing with the customer to learn their story and how we could work together to find their unique ""look"". This job really facilitated my love of quality customer service, and made me very passionate about it. The management was okay... They were understanding when conflicts came up, especially with the busy life of being a student. They didn't give quality feedback however, which leaves an associate in the dark about their performance. The breaks were fair, but the difficult part was the lack of communication between the staff."
good,"Time flies if you enjoy working with kids/infants clothing. I love making the store look great for the guests by working the merchandise out to the floor, and keeping shelves stocked. A lot of fun browsing here."
good,"Over all was a fun place to work. Love retail/ customer service and contributing to the community by working with people. The business is great and very interesting with great history. I was hired part time seasonal but was only scheduled  3 working days in the 3 month period I was employed. Small shift hours too. I was dissapointed that I never received a formal letter terminating my employment. They just stopped scheduling me hours, leaving me the assumption that I was let go. Very informal."
good,"Fold clothes, help customers. Learned a little about retail, it was seasonal so I didn't get to do much. The management was okay, but as far as scheduling went they weren't too good. My co-workers were great. There was really nothing hard about the job, it was mostly all enjoyable."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed working with GAP but as time went on there was a lot of office politics and the management team and some of the workers were being investigated and this caused a lot of bad atmosphere.
good,"my role as a VM is implementing visual guidelines to make sure that visual standards are maintained at all times.I have been working at GAP fawaz alhokair fulltime more than 5 yrs.Good people to work with, good support from manager, perfect allocation of the shops and visual for the customers.Hard to get career growth, need more support from HR department because huge company with not really good management structure. The hardest part of the job during sale event and launching the new collection."
good,"Gap and Banana Republic are two jobs which demand a high level of customer interaction and a superb amount of customer service. Attention to detail is high and expectations are always being raised. The management can be good or bad depending on the location. They don't care about employees as much as the bottom line, which is to be expected at an institution such as this. The breaks are fair, the pay could be better, and I wish they promoted more advancement within the company or even within the store. Often management would be brought in from other stores from other states, which often created friction within the store. The hours were inconsistent and often very odd. Again, non of this is surprising given the nature of retail. I did enjoy my time there and was thankful for the experience."
good,"Retail at its finest... or worst, however you may consider it."
good,"	Monitored inventory levels as a part of loss prevention to track and thwart incidents of product theft"
good,"First place I actually worked with alot of teamwork, didnt mind being flexible between departments. or working in and with children"
good,"I found my daily tasks to be fun but repetitive at times. I mainly helped as many customers as I could and folded clothes all day long. Sometimes the store would be really busy so work was fun and challenging, and my co-workers helped make it more of an enjoyable experience for me. The only issue I had was with management because the issues they had with each other really stemmed into the rest of the work, which included scheduling and duties, making it difficult to change areas or acquire more hours."
good,"i enjoyed working with this company, co workers were fair and their was always something to do to keep you busy."
good,"It you need to pay the bills, this is the job for you. They offer great discounts"
good,greeting customers and folding clothes were the main responsibility. The worse part was to fold everything by yourself in perfect order by a specific hour. Management is very hard to reach and very demanding.
good,"This job has it's ups and downs, it can be fun when you work with certain people but generally management makes it difficult to enjoy. Management are the type of employees that make everyone else push them selves to the limits while they all sit and talk in the office while eating donuts. Can be a bit frustrating, especially when you are calling for back up...Also you will barely get any hours unless you are the one full-time person (which happens to be me, thank God) but it it certainly unfair for everyone else who is only getting 1-3 shifts a week, and they aren't even 8 hour shifts."
good,"I have worked with Gap Inc for 10 years working my way up from a seasonal hire to a brand manager. I have learned many skills as in time management, great customer service skills, and how to lead an effective team."
good,"When I go to work, I always come in with an positive attitude and a big smile. I learn new things almost everyday at work like the promotions we have going on throughout the store. I love my co-workers. They always make me feel comfortable being around them. They absolutely love when I come in to work. The Hardest part of the job is basically just keeping up with all go backs. The most enjoyable part of my job is , making the customers happy and getting them what they need."
good,"I worked at Old Navy, part-time while in school. The hours were usually flexible, however I had several instances where I requested off for an exam and was scheduled anyways. The atomsphere is fun and upbeat, and with the exception of one of the managers, all of the employees were friendly. Of course, as in working retail, the pay is terrible and you have to work every holiday... just happy I found a real job related to my major!"
good,"Fast and customer focus workplace, with effort to deliver the satisfaction that customers expect with their shopping experience. A fair employer that commits to its customers and provide its employees the right tools to execute the job of services and enjoyment. Good management and great co-workers to assist in every day task. The only time the job may have been difficult to perform is when under staff during a major sales event or holiday seasons but being able to overcome is something that came with time and became very satisfying when accomplished. Will always treasure the experience gained as a major tool for any job of servicing."
good,Lots of nice people
good,"Typical day at work would be to arrive at 4am and prepare the backroom for incomming inventory supply shipment. We would then replish the sales floor, organize, set up modulers, and clean before the store opened. Once the store open we would spend the remainder of the work day allocating the remaining inventory into the warehouse/backroom, organizing, and pricing as we go. What I learned from this job was how to compare expected shipping report with inventory count of items recieved and prepare report to be analyzed by management. Coworkers all seemed to know their job roles and managed to handle them without major issues. There was not much politicing going on at the job. Everybody did their job and were not concerned about each others personal lives. The hardest part of the job was replinishing of sales floor because there was no set plan or method in place. Each new item that was recieved had to be run past management to see if it was to go out to the sales floor. It hurt efficiency. The most enjoyable part of the job was after the store opened and allocating the warehouse with remaining inventory, pricing, and organizing. It was a lot of work which could be completed at a moderate continuous pace but it was in the back of the store where one could work in peace, talk, laugh, listen to music. And the job always got done on time or earlier because everyone was doing their part. Then we would leave by 12pm"
good,"I feel I was best at the freight line. Unpacking the clothing that came in early mornings, loading it up, placing it on the floor, and cleaning duties. I also did re-stock on the floor as well as in the back. Sales on the floor was not my strongest area but I still gave it 100 percent."
good,"When a leader at the Top came back your track record did not matter. It was all about building his posse, the stores will suffer with lack of regular visits by DM's."
good,"At times management was unprepared or unenthusiastic but mostly had its priorities together. Starting the job, like other co-workers, I was given great hours, something around 40+ hours a week but than hours began to get cut rapidly. I myself was a commuter and having my hours cut to 3-4 hr shifts 2-3 times a day was not going to work so I had to quit. With commuting and going to school, my salary could not support me anymore."
good,great place to work however sales go down your hours go down.
good,Working at the GAP was one of my better retail experiences. Management let me go home on my first day of work when I had a severe allergic reaction. I was afraid I might be let go for not completing my first day of work but management sent me home for my personal safety.
good,"fast paced work on the lines you get paid pretty good but health and safety is out the window, they provide gloves and goggles but that's it, fridges are stacked and can fall on you and oil can spray in your face, they say you need equipment on but do not provide it all"
good,"This was by far the worst store I’ve worked for. I understand that it was grand opening but it’s by far the worst company they throw you to the wolves I didn’t even get complete training as an ASM, I worked over 7 days straight while the store manager was off every other day, you can reach out for help but will not receive it, we had a matter of 10-15 people quit in a month span from grand opening. Very stressful job , it could be a great company if your store is fully staffed and has low turn over"
good,"Très bonne ambiance de groupe, la formation est trés complète (même si elle est très étaler) C'est un job très formateur pour un/une étudiant(e). "
good,"-the management at Gap was not too good, they did not treat employees well"
good,"had to work cashier and fix the floor apparel, i had to work in a fast paced environment with all of my coworkers to make sure the customer was satisfied"
good,"Good if you’re just getting out of high school or need some extra cash. Not a good idea if it’s the only job you have, you don’t make much. It’s pretty easy going and nice people to work with. Management can be terrible at times though."
good,I enjoy working at Gap because of the friendly working environment. Everyone is nice and easy to get long with and the job is pretty relaxed. The only downside is how pushy management is for cashiers to open credit cards. They also judge your performance based on how many credit cards you open as well as rewards. I do not think that is fair and performance should be judged by how you help and interact with customers.
good,Job differs depending on location and management. Can be wonderful or horrible depending on these factors.While I was in role their was never a consistent Gm. This led to disarray in the store.
good,"Working at the Gap Factory has provided me with a flexible schedule to complete my college education and allow experience to work with the public.  the team at the Gap are very supportive and we collaborate as a team to ensure that we provide an excellent customer experience at retail for all the customers.  I was promoted to Lead Cashier around 2 years ago and while holding this role, I have learn many areas of the retail business and work closely with the store manager during a closing of a shift to ensure all cash drawers are up to date and balanced and the store is neat and tidy for next business day operations."
good,"I loved my job at the Gap. It was a great learning experience for me. Fast paced and great people to work with. If you get the chance to become full time, benefits are AMAZING.  That is what I miss most! But Upper management/corporate is very cliquey."
good,"Cool place to work, could pick up or switch shifts and get shifts covered. Learned how to assist a wide range of customers with what they are looking for. Management was good."
good,"Super boring brain numbing job. You stand still all day as a sorter, 1/4 of the year you work 10 hrs a day 5 days a week with an additional 6th 8 hr day so during that time you have no social life, most of the rest of the year is part time even if you're a full time employee. Great place to work if you get fired and need a job asap, but not worth it in the long run, if you have options go elsewhere."
good,"Picking and packing is laid back easy work, replenishment on the other hand should definitely get more money, they have incentive bonuses not a bad job if you need one on the fly"
good,"Nothing terrible about working here, just not a lot of hours or work to be done here.  Set lunches and breaks.  One bad thing is working retail during holidays,"
good,This job taught me a lot and also helped me to push through the hard times when it was very busy.  The managers was nice even though it was a seasonal they helped me with steps and how things should be done.
good,"It’s a fine place to work with competitive salary and benefits. The people who work for Gap tend to stay for a long time, have met multiple in stores who have worked for this company 10+ years"
good,Aprendí a tratar con clientes y a trabajar bajo presión.
good,productive work so you can get the job done. sometimes it could be hard because it was so much people. Th job itself was normal. doing the same thing everyday so you can get use to it
good,Working at the Gap Factory Store was a great learning experience for me. I was able to start as a sales associate and ended as an assistant manager. The culture is fast pace customer service with a smile. Making every customer happy by giving them a great shopping experience. Helping the customer was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I got placed on my first day at online retail working with conveyer belts"
good,The work environment was always fast-paced.  There are many duties and tasks that can be taught to the employees.  Employees that are capable to provide more duties have a higher chance of maintaining hours.  Customer traffic is never predictable and the store learns to adapt and respond.  The company is always looking for ways to improve the store and the staffs' work efficiency.  The hardest part of the job is providing the expected output in your performance.  A fast-pace environment requires multitasking and dealing with all situations efficiently while providing great customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the team members.  Majority of the time the coworkers have been a great factor in my willingness to continue working at this company.
good,"I was hired for a certain task. It was fine for a while until I started getting an earlier schedule then I was comfortable with. I felt that management didn't take the time to explain my role effectively enough for me to reach their standards. There was no positive reinforcement and felt like nothing was ever enough. The people "
good,"Working at the GAP, I met a lot of people from all over; different religions, different cultures. It was nice to see the diversity in this company, that is one thing I loved about working here."
good,"Overall, decent company to start a retail career.  Workplace culture is dependent on your specific leadership.  Not all areas demonstrate or reward Gap Inc. values."
good,It was fine ... Was able to advance to different departments... The benifits are good and the pay is competitive and they provide great support when switching to a new Department the only drawback is there is mandatory overtime pretty much all through the year and they are only closed for one holiday.
good,I did enjoy working at the Gap. The position was seasonal without any benefits except overtime. Many of the employees had criminal backgrounds Fearful
good,"Working at this company taught me to adjust to NYC retail demands, as it was the first time i was dealing with many different customers at once in a retail setting. Working at a flagship retail store, you encounter many different people and must keep up with heavy demand to avoid falling behind. Employees were expected to maintain their section while also providing information about products and finding stock for items. The workplace culture was very friendly and exciting as the employees there were a joy to work with. The managers expected a lot from the employees and constantly tried to push employees. The hardest part of the job was closing down the store as the store would be a complete mess at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part was interacting with friendly customers as you would encounter many different types of people"
good,i was part time but they would only give me 8-12 hours per week even after i would ask for more and willing ask to work more days but unfortunately they never complied
good,No work life balance . Do not respect Management input. No appreciation for hard work. Some training and onboarding... expected to do little with much.
good,"It is usually busy.  Enjoy the people I work with and the managers in Levittown are all very fair and are always there for you when you have a question. The hardest part, lately, has been learning the new IPOD for conducting certain procedures such as ordering on line and refunds of no receipt refunds.  But getting the hang of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people that like their jobs and get along and help each other in difficult situations."
good,There are sincere efforts to remake the company and get with the times but there is so much old dysfunction that many efforts are moot.  The culture can feel positive at times but it feels very superficial when the next day after an event a valued team member is re-org-ed to early retirement while truly ineffective people remain.  There is a very messed up operational aspect to the company that is endemic.
good,"I loved my coworkers because they work hard to make sure everyone is satisfied. From employer to customers. "
good,"Gap corporate office is a great place to work. None of the great culture makes it into the GapTech organization. If you are looking at a non-technical job I highly recommend Gap Inc. For a technical position make sure you are aligned with the stated directions and be ready to just be a cog in the machine. The best part of GapTech used to be the work/life balance, however, as they move deeper into DevOps that is quickly disappearing. Also they are offshoring a lot of technical positions as they move off premise and into public cloud. Costs are going up, workforce is going down."
good,When i first started working there it was a very fun environment. as time went on management and job structure changed and made the job less exciting.
good,I enjoyed my role at the complany as the Brand Experience and Visual Manager.  Allowed me to use my creativity daily.  Also gave me a sense of purpose.
good,"Mobility in the company "
good,"The job requires you to constantly attend to the same tables and walls as customers will constantly ruin everything. Management is alright, no real gripes against the managers."
good,The gap is the perfect job for college students looking to make a little extra cash. Would not recommend as a permanent place of employment. Gap is a fun fast paced environment.
good,interesting work place to have worked in. very fast paced and he customers and employees were very  friendly. There was always something new to do every single day which made it interesting
good,"My experience has been so-so, but the work ife balance is fine. Not a huge focus on learning and development, which is disappointing since I am fairly early in my career."
good,"A great place for a student to work over the summer or as a part time job. However, potential to grow is clearly limited. Would not recommend as a career unless committed to retail environment."
good,"For the most part the people at Gap Inc. were great. Directionally, the company seems confused and unsure of it's priorities and the fate of the retail business. This makes for managers who are not held accountable to drive business forward and trickles down to unhappy and uncertain employees. Lots of resistance to change."
good,Love the company. Great clothing. Work life balance wasn’t very good. Great benefits. Love the company. Tough year in retail and to much turnover throughout the company made it stressful for all.
good,Company made a lot of changes in a year. Very overwhelming. Communication of directives was all over the place and not done in a timely manner. I learned to constantly contact other stores to make sure we were on track with directives and marketing.
good,This job wasn’t the greatest pay but co-workers were friendly and the breaks were great. Hours were cut often and at random. The winter was the worse season to work.
good,"fun and the discount was the best part of the job even though a lot of people were fired for abusing the discount, like lettings friends use their discount"
good,"Very quick pace environment. The management needs a lot of work, very personal and unprofessional. The hardest part of the job is working a floor by yourself. The best part is helping customers with recommendations of what to buy."
good,"工作環境還好"
good,"It's nonstop, always something to do. Organizing is never ending but good, you stay busy the whole shift. Makes day go faster. Fun helping customers pick out outfits for gift or just for their own little ones."
good,"The best thing about working there is the people you work with. Management expects associates to do a bit too much, especially with the way the store is laid out. There are a lot of clothes to fold, a lot of customers to handle. You have to get customers to apply for a Gap Credit Card. The work is annoying and tedious, but the coworkers are great."
good,"Any retail job is going to be a challenging first job, but the experience is really awarding preparing you for a variety of jobs from customer service, etc.."
good,Visual Merchandising job can be fun. Setting up store displays and merchandising the store can be a challenge at times but its a great learning experience.
good,"Ideal pour un job etudiant et/ou une premiere experience."
good,"very fast paced environment, management works with your school schedule. "
good,"After spending 5 years with the company, I found myself at a stand still. There was no opportunity for advancement being presented to me and I was more than qualified for the positions that were available. I found myself training new hires to be my superiors. I had to move on. The workers are like a family but mismanagement makes working for this company very difficult."
good,This position has taught me how to adapt quickly and efficiently to changes. With frequent changes to promotions and marketing it requires attention to detail and urgent work ethic.
good,"A typical day at GAP Inc consists of processing merchandise throughout the store as well as cleaning up and providing excellent customer service. During my time at GAP Inc, I learned how to provide excellent customer service and manage multiple responsibilities at once. I also learned how to organize and process merchandise throughout the floor. My co-workers were all so helpful and positive as they had created the best learning/growing environment for new workers such as myself. For me, the hardest part about the job was cleaning up and seeing people make a mess of what I cleaned 2 seconds later. The most enjoyable part about the job was the working environment because all my coworkers were so friendly and outgoing."
good,"Working at Gap is a very fun place to work, the work environment is very fun and the people who work there are great. The problem comes when they schedule you. Working for retail you expect the hours to go up and down but they can really vary week to week. This job would better be suited for some one in high school or someone not looking for a serious full time job."
good,"I enjoy working with gap although the management could be improved. The hardest part about this job is being on your feet all day. Ive learned how to ring up customers, customer service, replenishment, promotions, merchandising, etc."
good,got be on your toes working to get the orders picked to keep working if your lazy the trainers know and you will not be work  hard working good attitude and productive
good,"A typical day at work would be organizing teams of employees to complete various tasks in timely manner. Getting to interact with the customers and helping them find the perfect out or present for their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.  The hardest part of the job is making sure all teams are staying on task. I learned effective communication and leadership skills."
good,Spent most of the time dealing with travelers and helping them find what they were looking for and solving any problems they had. Enjoyed the interaction with the public and tried and mostly succeeded in making their stay not only comfortable but usually without any hassles.
good,"Productive fast pace good management lack of job security, was laid off after one year of employment, because of the heavy work load and fast pace shifts flew by"
good,Great people to work around but management did not have agrip on job descriptions because at times alot of people woud do things out of there job title an pay grade
good,A development of lean in the distribution operation. The hardest challenge was change. The employees were so resistance to change even the goals were easier to reach. I learned that management really need to be on board with change for it be successful.
good,"This was a good position. However, I was only with this company for a short time and was hired along with many other new hires. The shifts were short and I was only able to work as a part time employee because of this, even though I had applied as a full-time associate."
good,"very demanding "
good,"The management group needs a lot of work. a lot of people like to do it their way, not how its really suppose to be. but the benefits are great"
good,Overall I enjoyed working for this company. The benefits and job itself was fun and proactive. The people I worked with at my store were lovely and that made going to work fun and enjoyable.
good,"During my (group) interview, it went very well. All of the people in the interview got hired. Since working there for only 3 months, i've had maybe 8-10 shifts. In the past 2 weeks I have received 0 hours. The maximum hours I have worked is 5 hours. "
good,Typical day at the gap is very busy management team work together to make shore every worker is doing there job the most fun part of the job is working with people to find what they need
good,"I only worked here for a short time, however, it seemed like a friendly environment.  Management was flexible with your schedule and the company offered a great discount."
good,"Very upbeat and fast paced environment, but it was also very comfortable and laid back.  The management team was really excellent at the making the atmosphere welcoming and comfortable."
good,"The customers come in by the boat load, try everything on and leave a mess. Often times co workers dont pick up there slack and I swear all the spanish managers and employees are buddy buddy. If you like fashion and have an interest in customer service expect Gap to kill that"
good,early start to get the drivers out also liase with the mobile fitter regarding outstanting breakdowns answering the phones and taking hires and off hires the hardest part of the job was with gap one as they tried to commit you to timed deliverysthey had just taken for that day after the drivers had allready left on there runs the most enjoyable aspect was when the customer/site phoned to thank you for your help
good,great people on the store level but management is poor. Too much politics and not enough advancement given on merit. Pretty routine day to day.
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, selling the products, cleaning, folding clothes, and working the till. I gained lots of communication skills from conversing with customers and the staff. The management is really friendly and patient in training the staff. Co-workers are easy to get along with and super friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is suggesting clothes/outfits for the customers and helping them find clothes that best suit them. The hardest part of the job is the slow times when all there is to do is clean which is tiring when standing on your feet all day. Overall, a good job."
good,"The Carbondale, Illinois Old Navy in the University Mall was my least favorite. The way the managers treated the employees was horrible. On numerous occasions I had customers say things to and about the managers tones to us. The managers picked favorites from the beginning which was not right. I loved the store, but there should have been different managers."
good,"This is a fun place to work. Always moving around and meeting new people. However, unless you are in a full time position like management the hours are little and the pay is poor. "
good,"Retail is not for me with a family.  Variable hours are very difficult with children at home,"
good,Fun workplace that provide a good environment but hours too late
good,"Cant make a living working here. 15 hours a week, 25 on a good week. have to brown nose in order to get recognition or promoted."
good,"I had learned a lot from this compay. It was a fun working environment, it enhanced my ability in dealing with different types of people. I like the incentives given to the employees."
good,"My work hours were all over the place. I would open, or close or work overnight. I was usually exhausted and so was everyone else. They would schedule you to close at 11pm and open at 6 am the next morning. Their culture was that if they gave you 8 hours from the time you clock out the night before, that was good. That is not enough time to sleep and have time away from work. Gap is very lacking on work life balance."
good,"Check the plan sheet for the day sales or stock, and then do your job with responsibility."
good,Starting with a Smile.to all ways put customers first.getting the job done.to all ways work as a team.dealing with different personality. wanting to have a smile on the customers face.
good,"More work than the average person, and a lot of above average people can handle effectively. Part of a 3 man group that is responsible for the corporate data centers and computer rooms in North America, that's right THREE MAN TEAM. Pay was good but being on call 100% of the time leads to poor personal/work mix. They respect all peoples, races, religions, and life styles except those for the average straight Anglo Saxon male... and heaven help you if you disagree with the company policies even if you follow them and enforce them."
good,Having more available hours would be beneficial but the workplace is fun and inviting.
good,"I would clean, fold clothes, hang clothes, and check out customers"
good,"Management could have been a lot better, especially for the fact that almost none of them ever worked in the factory or even for gap as a bottom end worker, just as supervisors. Stocking supervisors especially weren't the best out there. the pay was good but if your in stocking forget about trying to make any production unless you are able to work at top speed for 10 hours a day 5 days a week."
good,"management wasn't great, not really understanding to others and there personal lives, other staff where great worked well wit others"
good,"Smart and nice people to work with, company tries to cut all the cost therefore weren't as many great benefits. The upper management are not as experience and skillful."
good,"Despite the flux in hours week to week the schedule would be fairly flexible to the needs to the employee, apart from weekend availability which is unfortunately a standard requirement. People are of the younger generation ranging, generally, from about 18 to 28. The atmosphere is relaxed and at times very enjoyable (with the exception of Christmas!) I've really developed my social skills at GAP and as a result over the past 8 years, part time and full time, I've acquired many close friends from all corners of the globe. Management have always been approachable and when they can, made the effort to integrate with staff on a personal level developing a happy atmosphere. Depending on the shift time, a day could either start with processing stock delivery and replenishing the shop floor or if the shop is already open, immediate inclusion on tills or helping customers. Once the shop is closed the store would be 'closed out' ie tidying the place, cashing up and if needed setting up for the delivery scheduled the next morning. The varying shift times could be either a blessing or a curse with some weeks requiring a member of staff to work until Midnight, however these shifts would generally be scheduled for fixture moves and placing new product which was one of the more enjoyable aspects of the job as you would be encouraged to use your creative side."
good,"Store was usually messy upon coming on shift, learned a folding technique that I implemented at home!  Management was great, fair and always there to help.  Co-workers were slack and management spent a fair bit of time motivating staff rather than pleasing the customers.  The job was physical which was great, and time went by quickly, it was nice."
good,Excellent job at that time in my life but no higher role than what I was at
good,The management has minimal consideration of the employee as far as why they are performing the way they do. Learned that no matter how good you perform a job considers you easily replaceable. The co-workers that last long enough for you to know them are really nice and attentive to one another. The hardest part of the job is building the courage to clock in. The bast part is clocking out for the day.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the Customers as it helped to boost my confidence and also working on the tills and in the stock room was very enjoyable."
good,"I was in the  of the bikini department, "
good,gap is a well known company and i wouldn't have any problem except their are not a lot of hours too be worked in this slow economy. 
good,"Merchandising, Operations, and Managing employees is the day to day."
good,NO freedom of fashion expression however i did learn a lot while working there.
good,"Not bad, just not great pay and its a lot of walking and standing on concrete for 10 hour shifts."
good,"Good place to work, Lots of great benefits"
good,"Overall, co-workers were extremely helpful with my first time working in retail. However, I did not feel that I was being given equal opportunity to demonstrate my skills and felt that working my hardest and performing to the best of my abilities just wasn't good enough. As a student, having to work a late shift or on weekends doesn't bother me, but many of those shifts were not headed by a manager or assistant manager, so they were never around to evaluate my work and see the progress I made as a sales associate. Overall, I think that retail was just not a good fit for me."
good,"Not the best and not the worst place to work, but as a Visual Manager don't ever expect to have a life. There is no work/life balance."
good,Its a nice place to work Nice people but I needed a Full Time Job.
good,"It was a good place to gain retail experience. A typical day is greeting customers cleaning, and assessing clothing garments."
good,"I liked the environment, I am used to retail work and it all seems the same to me now, but out of all my exsperience ive noticed that gap was the most calm fast paced environment"
good,GAP inc m'a permise de compléter mes capacités que je prennaient pour acquises.
good,- Daily work hours are between 4-8 hours. They have on-call shifts that are very frustrating because they will most likely be cut.
good,"Auditing with the factory day to day activities like sizeset,inline ppm,intrim final audit,"
good,"Handling new factory in terms of teaching them our requirements,"
good,when there are sales is can really hectic.my co workers are very hard working people we have our good days and bad
good,"Great co-workers, understanding managers. Employees opinions are heard. Managers work with your strengths to put you in the right position to succeed."
good,"The brand is so cutting edge in technology and so far forward in fashion that makes the company such learning experience to further advance your career in management. Although it is so top heavy that people in the corporate office don;t care much about what is going on in store operations. The hardest part of my job was to work on coverage during store operating hours while still doing house of merchandising, visuals and every day day to day work load while still helping customers."
good,A very fast paced environment.Taught me about about customer service and real selling. Also taught me about team work. Great Co workers. hardest part of the job N/A. The most enjoyable assisting customers.
good,It was a ok place to work. theres a lot of people that work here and they always keep you busy.
good,Great styles for 40+ years. Large company to move around in if fashion is your field.
good,Teamwork plays a big part in loss prevention. There are not a lot of people in the department and the job can be even more demanding with call-offs and PTO requests. The schedules are difficult and are not changed up often.
good,The Gap was pretty standard retail work place that served as a place of part time and eventual full time employment for me. Never really had to many issues with management and the company made sure that if I need time off for school or any family issues that I would have it.
good,Stocking shelves early in the morning and helping customers once open. Maintain stocking product and working from the register. Worked well with college scheduling.
good,I liked working in stock a lot because it is pretty leisurely paced compared to working on the floor. the other employees were nice and i made some friends. the manager was kinda rude tho
good,Depending on how busy the store is out main focus is customer service. We try to help the customers to the best of our abilities as well as try to maintain the store up to standards. As a team we try to minimize the customers checkout time by helping out our fellow coworkers.
good,i really liked working here but some things came up with my mental health and i had to quit. They were understanding and wished me the best. i loved the company.
good,"Gap offers flexible hours and works around your requirements, however, a lot is expected from an employee besides that the jobs itself is not too bad."
good,the pay just wasn't there so I had to move on the upper management did support the members. But was hard to move up to management.The company was moving to the on-line factor to keep up with other company's
good,"There are always people standing around not doing their work. This also includes supervisors. You try to find a supervisor and it's close to impossible. It's almost as if no one cares, they're just there for the paycheck."
good,I was with the company for a number of years and enjoyed my time working for both GAP and Old Navy. A very fast paced environment led by a strong management team.
good,"Good place to work if you do not have experience or if you are in college. Mos customers are tourists. Multitasking and patience needed. Overall, it is a really friendly work place."
good,"1.) Folding clothes, organization, helping customers, cashier, fitting room. "
good,"The job is fantastic depending on the building you are placed in. CEO/TFC is extremely professional and organized, whereas other buildings aren’t and are extremely rude to people transferring over to help."
good,"Bonne ambiance ,possibilité de se déplacer pour renfort"
good,"great job for a full time student who is trying to make some money for themselves, could use more work advancement in the store i am working at, as well a pay raise for the advancement. managers are ok, they could use more discipline and structure."
good,"strong company to be employed by that has endured the ups and downs in our economy. If your going to schools part-time and need a job or you have a full-time time and want a second job, the Gap would be the company"
good,Friendly and enthusiastic Retail Sales Associate/ Operations Supervisor. Highly successful at upselling and promoting new products. Effective at multi-tasking and maintaining a friendly attitude under pressure. Responsible and mature who thrives in fast-paced environments. Enjoys working as part of a team to achieve sale goals and direct employees while also completing a variety of paperwork and meeting safety requirements.
good,"This company wanted me to approach people and sell them Gap's products. If you aren't able to sell the product you get fewer hours and less opportunities to make money."
good,It was ok kind of hard high rate. The people arent that friendly they dont care about you only about the numbers. They have overtime. They have a few different areas.
good,"I learned about the merchandising process within a large corporation."
good,"The managers are not very helpful with the new employees, they do not try very hard to make them feel welcome. Clothes are way too overpriced especially for their quality."
good,Retail isnt for me so I wasn't a fan of working here. The thought of folding clothes then to have it messed up everyday was madness and I couldn't give this place a full year.
good,Under paid for the level of expectations they have. If you are about customer service then there should not be a time limit placed on that. I liked it but thought they should let you value the customer not put a 5 minute limit on the interaction.
good,Work was simple enough and the co workers were enjoyable but management was a bit of a joke at times
good,"Gap inc is rated as a great place to work and awesome benefits, while the benefits are amazing there, just like any other retail job, job security is not there. Gap as gone through several rounds of layoffs over the years,  yet the workload doesn’t match up to the hours given and we are expected todo more with less. They also don’t understand there customers in each brand and how to Taylor that brand to them. Gap is in a position of not making money currently yet they seem to spend on useless things for the store that instead could have just given the money to the stores to give hours to employees. They also give in to their customers way to easy in a desperate attempt to keep them but the customers know this and will take advantage of the store employees"
good,I have had a long journey so it good place I'll recommend this job for my kids as well. They very flexible with hours meet your needs. It's best leave and come back because they'll pay you more which sucks.
good,I enjoyed my time at Gap. I was working in the warehouse in the packing department. I would separate and pack online orders that were sent to us. It is stressful on the body. You are on your feet 9 out of the 10 hours. You get 3 20 minute breaks that are paid.
good,"Gap Sales Associate Job Description. Gap Sales Associates love the brand, love our products, and are passionate about bringing those products to life for our customers. Sales Associates work as members of the store team to lead a positive customer and brand experience, while being BOLD, EASY, and REAL."
good,"I worked for the Gap inc/ Old navy company for 4 years, all throughout my college. I leaned great team building , however if your management team sucks, the work environment will suffer."
good,I work for the company morely during holiday season. It was great working for the company and working with some of great people. I enjoyed helping customers who needed assistance with what they were searching for.
good,This is where I learned how to operate alot of different types of forklifts. Was a good job paid decent during the time I was there. Good people to work with.
good,"Gap can be a really productive and fun place to work. They have always been flexible with my schedule and accepting when I need a day off. Gap is very strict when it comes to pushing the Gap card and our new loyalty program, Bright. It's almost overbearing. Overall though, it's not a bad place to work."
good,The job was one of those typical out of high school/ part time college student job. Nothing that you would set a career out of to make an outstanding pay check but enough to add on to whatever you already have.
good,working at gap was a good time work could be streesful sometimes unloading the trailers but palletizing was fun nd fast paced . good people great warehouse
good,Worked with a lot of great people who were good and nice and good.  I enjoye dmy work and the things i did. compensation was fair to me and my peers on my team.
good,Working at Gap was fine. It was a typical customer service position that involved long hours and frequent mishaps that needed to be fixed. My biggest complaint would be the unrealistic goals on selling Gap Cards.
good,"This is a easy loving job, not many hours sadly. Many wants and needs youll hear from your mannagers; they will attack per day, if you make a little mistake. But by coworkers and customers its a very joyful place, as long as your mind sees the positive than the negative."
good,"Lots of room for advancement if you put the work in. Good place if you want to work hard. Always shorthanded, but it's good if you want to work and need the money."
good,Shipment team was cool group of people to work with but others not on the team made it hard for use to get our work done.  Would have to set up stuff be for we could even get started cause the night shift didn't do it.  Have to watch your back the store manager is cool but others members on the management team not so much.  Some days we have to stay a few hours to get the shipment done or come back the next day during close hours to get it done
good,My location and experience are significantly different from what the average Gap location is like so it is difficult for me to try and provide an accurate review of the job.
good,"I enjoyed Gap when I had the right supervisor and I wanted to stay forever, Some supervisors quickly changed my mind. Pay was too low for my role. Roles also were not really thought of when creating some policy and makes some things difficult but overall I would work here again."
good,"The Gap was based on who you know, or how long you had been working for them. I was the point man for building their entire network structure that was Novell and Compaq Server based with Cisco Routers. The Server room was configured with fiber optics, and was comparatively fifty times smaller than when I worked at Shearman & Sterling in Manhattan New York."
good,Gap trains leaders hard core. This helps to develop many skills and make you valuable to many employers. We always strived for the best and most efficient ways to do things.
good,The job is ok for highschool and college students. flexible hours. Must be able to stand alot. Management is very strict and hound you about sales and gap card enrollment.
good,"-I ended up working ONCE A WEEK due to cuts in hours that happen every couple of months. THIS JOB IS NOT STABLE!"
good,Working as a sales associate at gap provided consistent work for me as I transitioned between higher career goals. There were opportunities for growth and an encouraging environment.
good,"Fast Pace , helping customers, and friendly atmosphere. This was a temporary job, a good starter to learn the basic skills in customer service. I enjoyed learning all the departments."
good,"Fun and fast-paced work environment, hours can be extremely unstable (no hours one week, then 30 hours the next week), pay is a bit low for the amount of responsibility given to more senior employees v. new hires. Overall I would recommend as a part-time job during school, however not as a future career. Most managers I've worked with do not plan on staying with the company and wish to move on to other careers but are waiting for an opportunity. Same with the employees, most are simply using the job as spare cash during school or to build work experience to negotiate higher pay somewhere else."
good,nice to work and people are like my family and they are helpful. nice to work people and they are giving opportunities to grow and they will groom you.
good,"Fun, energetic place to work, flexible hours and good benefits. It’s pretty difficult to move up given many hoops to go through before finally getting a minor promotion."
good,"You think you're going in to sell jeans, but there's more there.  They push all the reps to get customers to open up Gap credit cards. Not the best environment for friendly banter that eventually leads to the question of ""Would you like to open up another line of credit?""  Many people are annoyed and uninterested and 90% of the customers who need Gap Cards already have them...."
good,"This was a seasonal job so only worked the Christmas season"
good,"Hours aren't great, they seem to hide pay or not play fully, movement within warehouse is a must, often times doing other people's work. Micromanaged."
good,This was a great first job. Worked with my hours for school even in my first year in college. The work environment was amazing and everyone was friendly.
good,"While working at the Gap as a seasonal employee it was a bittersweet experience. One because the place is layback, nobody is really behind you on your tail all the time. The job is really easy and simple. On the other hand I was discouraged when they cut my hours slowly, also my work days were decreasing little by little. Employees play cut throat with the gap cards leaving no room for others who want have not sold 1 yet. Overall I recommend this job to somebody who has another job on the side."
good,its okay the job was okay. hours were kind of iffy. took me off a whole week off the schedule which ended me to quit. overall its an okay experience there.
good,"Every day focused on retail execution, as Gap operated over 3K stores across the US, and this required flawless execution, which was why I went to work for Gap."
good,"Manager was really bad at her job, rude and always late. Coworkers were nice, job was easy, everything was really slow-paced and boring. Manager quit and so did my job."
good,make surfe you get to work on time to accept the delifvery of your inventory. Stock all you shelves anfd then make sure you stock the store before you open for the day.
good,"I started off as a seasonal worker. Got less than 20 hours a week. Management wasn't that great. They had their favorites at work. I wasn't allowed to do cash wrap (I was taught how to do it). I was mostly stuck on doing clearance or dressing rooms. I promised to learn how to do stocking and signing up customers for the Gap credit card, but never learned. Some of my co-workers were lazy to clean up their zones they were assign to."
good,"Not enough hours. They also, had favoritism. I was working as seasonal but was not pleasant. The full time employees were chit chatting all the time while the seasonal employees were working."
good,Getting hours for retail jobs in my opinion are really dependent on getting management to like you because if you are not well liked you will not get any hours and will be forced on on-call which is the most annoying thing in the world.
good,"Depends on the team that you work for. It could be a great place to work. "
good,Fair work environment! I learned alot about style and other products and services; management was great! Culture was on-point! Job was easy as you were providing excellent customer service to all customers; I enjoyed bonding with my customers the most!
good,"The job is relatively easy, other than dealing with some weird things customers do it's easy. Management is quite rude and petty over mistakes and will make fun of you."
good,"Working at Old Navy offered a fun workplace, an energetic team, and a varied work schedule.  If you're looking for a job to perfect your customer service skills, this is a great choice!"
good,"Load trucks from conveyors with a production goal. Too much moving around, changing production is difficult to maintain. Co-workers lack cooperation and do not follow direct which again affects production."
good,i mostly dont remember but it was alright for a first job. I guess it just depends on who works with them and where as it can be different from place to place.
good,"Very busy and fast paced environment however depending on who you work with determines on how your day will go. Lots of relatively rude customers due to confusing the American email coupons with the email Canadian ones, be prepared for that. Managers were pretty understanding of situations but mostly wanted you to devote your life to the company. Unfortunately, there was a lot of gossip that happened and everyone knew everything that was going on with one person. Unfortunately as well, if you have another job or are in school, your hours get cut significantly. On the bright side there were a lot of potluck lunches for all the holidays and other fun celebrations."
good,Gap was a great job while in High School. I learned a lot about sales and how to interact with customers. We were all about our customers needs first and a team established company.
good,Gap was a slow paced but doable job. It’s not for those of you who are looking for shifts that go by quickly. I would recommend this job for someone very patient.
good,It was a Fast pace job and competitive at times but it was nice for what it was. A temporary gig. The environment was nice during the holidays. It got really busy.
good,was ok place freindly peole but managers wasnt comuncating wasnt really well in that part only thing good about is how happy the customer is when you help them
good,It an event company one of the top event company in Nigeria. We work to satisfy our client in any conditions convinced or not we just have to make them happy
good,"I worked for Gap for over seven years and both the company and my store changed a lot throughout that time. It would be difficult to access that time specifically. In general, it was a great place to work during high school with flexible hours perfect for extra curricular activities."
good,"Great place to work, but don't expect to move up fast or at all. I have held multiple seasonal management positions and was part of the management team to relocate one of the brands to it's new home in NY.  I stayed onsite in NY to train the ops team there to ensure a successful relocation. Prior to coming home to ohio I was offered a ops supervisor position,  in which case I had to decline. Once home I applied for this same position and was denied an interview."
good,Great place to gain retail experience.  Small format store in which you do get a hand in most/all processes of ruining a store... usually understaffed.
good,The company is not a bad company.  The benefits are great and the discounts.  Theres a disconnect with how much a store needs and what its given. Very unrealistic expectation.
good,"The Gap seems to sell the same tired product over and over. overpriced and overworked. I did not like pushing credit card to my customers, I felt it was inappropiate"
good,Every day was pretty much the same thing. You were always expected to open gap card even if customers didn't wanted them. It was sometimes hard to please your managers unsell you were on a team that didn't have a quota. for the most part everyone was very nice to work with. It was very hard to move up in this company. I was told you can't advance without a degree. I worked very hard and for a long time and was never really given a lot of opportunity to advance.
good,"Meh, it’s retail. If you could invision a standard retail job, this would be that. The hours are lousy, people are terrible, and you know what? After a few hours you’re ready to get off of register. But it’s retail, and after a while you start to get a little leeway with things. So, not terrible."
good,"You get what you expect from retail. I wont pay the bills, but its good if you need a little extra cash to save up. Very flexible with your school schedule if you are enrolled in school. Managers play favoritism, but as long as you meet their goals, their satisfied with your performance."
good,Gap est une entreprise assez cool les produits qu’elle propose sont assez causal a bon prix. Bonne ambiance entre collègue avec des personnes ambitieuses je noterais juste  manque d’organisation au seins de la boîte
good,"retail jobs are very annoying, they have really high expectations for such little pay. but able to get some decent discount and getting nice clothes. it's a decent place"
good,Not many hours are given nonetheless days you can work three days one week and the next only one day. Loosely trained. But has nice perks for working there.
good,"Part time job , paid school expenses. Very fast paced, as expected for retail, overtime opportunities during the holidays of course. Flexible hours , discount on product as well ."
good,I enjoyed working at GAP . The holidays were a bit difficult since customers tend to leave things all over the fitting room and were a bit rude. The best part of working there at the time were some of the employees.
good,Alright at first but then the job gets old real fasst. Specially if you hate doing other people jobs every single day. My manager was pretty cool I liked her but the GM I guess he was didn't know what he was doing at all.
good,"The Gap was a great place to work. I was able to utilize my skills on Windows, Excel and Access. I was also able to Talk with people from all over the country and help with shopping tips and advise on discounts."
good,"I was repeatedly told to ensure I knew which product was offered and to improve my selling techniques, but would then only be scheduled for 3 hours a month, regardless of my wide-open availability. This began from my second month in the position."
good,"Good place to work as a contractor, SAS and SQL programmer. My duties included:"
good,"Gap Inc is a very challenging company to be successful in given the current demands of the retail industry, but also the lack of strong leadership and vision at the highest levels.  It is very difficult to progress in your career and I while I enjoyed a lot of autonomy, I never had a strong manager to help guide and coach me in my career development there.  It is a very meeting heavy culture (6-8 30 minute meetings/daily) with very poor internal tools and infrastructure to make getting work done easier. There are a lot of very talented, hard working people across Gap Inc. but groups tend to be insular, which breeds contempt and competition across the brands and departments."
good,I liked the job for the pay and it was straightforward but retail was a job I found very dull as it consisted of folding clothes and running up the stairs to the stock room to constantly search for customer's sizes that we did not have 70-80% of the time.
good,"This was one of my first jobs, intense, worked late hours and very far. My experience was always trying to figure what was next. However, the the work environment was friendly."
good,Great Place too work for work life balance. Management excellent to work for. Travel is required for management positions. I have worked at Gap over ten years an it is a great company to work for.
good,My topical day at GAP consists of interacting and assisting customers along with cashiering and keeping the floor organized. I get along with most associates and managers. I learned more from trial and error and fellow employees than the actual managers and from insufficient training.
good,"It's good for first jobs. The managers are nice and understanding, but the hours are not as guaranteed as one would want. But it's still a really good place to work."
good,Fast paced work place that requires you to be productive and meet certain requirements throughout the day. Lunch/Dinner breaks were a good amount of time with food available to purchase in the break room.
good,"員工制度相當完善，或者說是非常的符合勞基法，但是有時候會超時工作。"
good,"Working for the Gap prepared me for the rest of my time working in retail.  The hours can feel long at times, as the typical shift begins with sales floor prep and then constant upkeep of displays...."
good,none this was in Atlanta so nothing like new York. didn't transfer over to work here because didn't want to deal with what u ahs to in Atlanta. but overall it was a nice experience
good,"A typical day at work consists of folding clothes, running ""go backs"" , processing costumer transactions. Hours vary by season. During Holiday seasons hours increase."
good,"Worked too many long shifts, some managers were extremely kind while others were annoying. Breaks were too short for amount of hours worked. Did not have time for school work. Did not follow my availability schedule. Unorganized. Only pro was discounts and my co workers who were extremely cool."
good,Fun place to work while in school. Fast paced and nice co-workers and management. Would definitely recommend to high-school students looking for after school work.
good,always increasing production output. never enough bins to finish orders. alway waiting for items to finish order. production standards alway changing ..
good,Honestly great experience but its not a source of income. It is a great job just for extra money in your pocket and they were also so strict on their policies.
good,why do you keep making me write out reviews if it's anonymous and no one is going to see it. this is annoying indeed. annoying as heck and i'd really like you to stop
good,"busy"
good,"For someone looking for part-time work I think the GAP is a great place to start. Hours a flexabile. Staff, from what I can remember, were very nice. Good Place to start"
good,"I enjoyed my time at GAP, typical day included setting up displays and singing up sales. what i enjoyed about the job was being around great coworkers and for the most part the customers."
good,Used outdated systems to finalize allocations and identify opportunities by location. Had to manually enter thousands of sku's into a system that takes ridiculously long. Created financial plans for pre-season and in-season forecasts.
good,the gap is a very fun company to work for. i felt like my individuality mattered. they also cared greatly about their employees. we felt human rather than disposable.
good,This job only had me folding clothes and greeting people unless they were the to ones to offer you a job and interview otherwise you shouldn't take this job through a program because they won't hire you
good,"a warehouse job, with nice people. everyone works hard. people are nice. the pay is great. and also their are many ways to make more money within the company"
good,Work at GAP is flexable  and for the most part pretty easy.  The employees like to have fun and there is the opportunity to serve the community through volunteer events outside of the store on a regular basis
good,I applied for a Stock Associate but for Gap they don't consider a Stock Associate as one it's pretty much a Sales Associate combined with stock. But you would usually always need to get a number of credit cards in or else you would have a meeting to get the number to the max. It felt slow paced at times as well.
good,"It was okay in the beginning, but it gets very stressful especially during the holidays. Management can sometimes be insensitive to your needs and put you in places that may not benefit the store as other place might. The coworkers are cool depending on who you are and where you are located in the store. Being in retail sucks, but being in Gap retail during the holidays is the worst."
good,"I enjoy working for this company, but the compensation for all the work done is not enough to survive. They don't really take care of their employees."
good,"At the Gap I got a chance to be able to learn how to sale products, while in retail sales change so often that your mind is continually trying to keep up with the sale of the day or the sale of the week."
good,"The company is always about doing what is right for its people. There is a high level of transparency with leaders and large number of opportunities for talents to move from one brand to another, as well as to corporate level. With a strong culture, there are long-tenured leaders who continues to add value and drive business to success."
good,"i worked here for a bit and kind of took it for granted now that i think about it. my coworkers were all easy to talk to and helped me whenever i needed them. all you do here is fold clothes for hours and make the store pretty, for a closing shift that is. yes it is painfully boring but you can talk to your coworkers. cashiering is much quicker and selling their credit card kind of hurts your soul but that's business and they had cute little competitions for it. hopefully no one went into debt on my watch. my boss was a total sweetheart, intelligent, bilingual. yeah, work here if you don't know what your passion is yet."
good,"A typical work day at  Gap is fast pace, helping multiple customers, tasking and completing projects.  I learned that you have to have people skill and really want to meet the customers needs."
good,This was a job without a career path and that is why I didn't stay with the Company very long. It was a very busy and hectic store. I didn't see my future staying in the same hourly position. I wanted a full time job with Benefits.
good,"Please be ready to help people that is what you are here for!"
good,"30-40 calls a day all around the United States"
good,"At Gap the people I worked with were enjoyable to work along with. Business was somewhat busy, but for the store I was in, it was understaffed. The management was fair for the most part. I started off as a sales associate and a year later I got promoted to Loss Prevention, but with the same pay unfortunately even though I was promised more."
good,After working here I discovered retail was not for me. I didn't enjoy it but I gained a lot of sales experience and how stores are run along with promotions and sales quotas.
good,"Our busy office is interested in hiring an experienced and reliable Clerk who can assist with general office duties, including answering phones, copying and scanning documents, filing, responding to emails and performing additional administrative duties as required. The successful applicant will be the front-end representative of our firm, so he or she must have a polite and friendly disposition, and be readily available to greet guests and direct them as necessary."
good,"Always a nice atmosphere and lots of training opportunities are provided, working hours can be segmented and has early starts and late finishes to meet business needs."
good,Good company to work for as a HS student.  I likes the clothes and the company for what I knew at age 16-18.  working retail definitely taught be good skills for later in life:)
good,"since I was a visual lead, a typical day for me at the Gap included shipment, restocking product, visual moves, keeping up with visual product, and recovering the store. But of course my number one priority was helping the customer. We were a pretty small store in the downtown area with not a lot of hours to give so we had minimal managers (including me). With that, I wore many hats."
good,Which is a  great company. I learned a lot if skill in this company.There have a good workplace culture and i enjoy to  work in this company. It was a good experience.
good,"A pesar de que no hay prestaciones y el trabajo es solo por fines de semana, aprendes mucho ahí sobre alimentos, productos entre otras cosas así como la buena atención al cliente."
good,"Work at the Gap is very chill, but it can get boring because the usually isn't much to do. I love the people that I work with, they make work so much more enjoyable."
good,A typical day at work was trying to keep the store clean. I learned that you can't keep the store cleaned at all times when the store is open. Management was great. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep customers from stealing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Always had something for me to do"
good,"Gap is a place where individuals can experiment with fashion while building the customer service skills."
good,I loved this company and still do but they seem to have been in a fashion rut for at least a decade at this point. And with companies such as H&M they are over priced and certainly dated.
good,The Gap can get very busy. It is a nice place to work but not a place to make a career out of. Good Luck with everything! aaa aaa a a a a a a a a a a a
good,"Executed daily operations of scanning merchant and non-merchant invoices"
good,worked 6-4 shift in returns was nice place could listen to mp3 while working to help cover sounds of misc warehouse. had decent sized breakrooms and multiple bathrooms close and had easy access to water anytime
good,"I don't feel like writing a review for this company! It was a great experience, the training is great, pay is good. Learned a lot about retail."
good,"It's just a survival job. It's really a matter of selling clothes. Nothing to it. They're flexible with hours, but, they don't have many hours to divid amongst the employees."
good,I had this as a part time job and it was okay. Good pay for retail but the hours you get depend on if the store is making money. Therefore i did not receive a lot of hours. Great discount though.
good,"You have to learn to roll with the punches, work with your employee, respect, and enjoy what you do, Management needs to understand some situations especially when they come from a different store. Or out of the military life."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with.  It was enjoyable to work with the customers and also help set the store up for new items.
good,Great place to work for college or high school student. Very easy to work with management when a day off is needed or scheduling needs to be adjusted due to an unforeseen circumstance.
good,"Its a great company, but retail is not for me. If you enjoy customer service and talking to many different types of people then this is the job for you."
good,"Overall it's a great high school job, but not for the long run. Very little room for advancement. The hours are short and not worth the headache you get from all the ungrateful customers."
good,really cool place to work for but the hours are horrible and so is the pay you cant survive on it great for teenagers though.
good,Old Navy is a great place to work at especially if you are a student. The employers are extremely friendly and cooperative.The only downfall is that there isn't much room for growth.Since they only offer part-time positions and hours per shift correlate with if the store is making its daily or weekly goal. Overall it a a nice place.
good,"•	Oversaw the applicant/hiring experience and supported the leadership team by ensuring they had a complete, fully trained, high quality staff."
good,GAP was a summer job to make some extra money. My hours were long and the people around me were regularly in bad moods. I would not return to this job.
good,Gap provided experience to grow as a leader and to be part of a team. You were able to try new thigns and learn by mistakes. Gap supports diversity and celebrates in each of their stores throught all the brand that they own
good,"You can learn a lot about the basics of the field, and how to communicate and carry yourself, but as far as promotions, you'd probably be better off going elsewhere."
good,Each Old Navy is different at Gap Inc. The one I'm working at would not be the ideal place to work. No chance of advancement. Work is placed above personal life and we usually have to work holidays.
good,I was part of the inventory stock crew. I had early morning work shifts on days when the store was receiving inventory shipments. Sometimes it was about twice a week. Closer to the holidays it was maybe up to four times a week. I was taking online classes at the time and the early mornings were fine. I could not continue working there because my class schedule was going to change. Over the holidays I was registering for classes for the upcoming spring semester. I was planning on taking a few classes starting around 9-10am. It would have conflicted with the schedule for Gap.
good,"Thrown on the sales floor without training.  Must be customer service oriented always, even when a customer is openly disrespectful"
good,Fun place to work with great pay. Management did not acknowledge achievements or hard work of employees other than a select few. Hard-work went unnoticed while employees who slacked off were disciplined or given less hours.
good,I loved working for the Gap. I meet a lot of interesting people . i learned a lot about customer survive and to provide a good consumer experience to each person.
good,A typical day at work involved fast expectations of unrealistic processing shipment. I learned the importance of freight and stock and maintaing organization throughout the entire store. The hardest part of the job was not finishing the expected within a 3 hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working through the holidays.
good,"Dealt with clothing, but I was did not like how the management would treat some of the employees during the time that I worked there. Employees would get along and help one another and help customers."
good,"Overall this was a great first job, but I struggled with work/life balance. I went from covering 4 stores, to covering the entire market which is 20 stores."
good,"Everymorning we must come in to clean up from the night before, replenish the floor, and make sure everything is neat and organized. My managers make it easy for the staff to follow procedures and we are in cosntant communication though our walkies. My co workers are energetic and fun to be around making it a great atmosphere to work in. The hardest part of the job is its usually one employee per store so for instance im always alone in the Baby department doing costumer service, cashiering, cleaning up, and merchandising, but i have learned to be independent. I can balance all of that and still have a great smile on my face even when it gets tough at times."
good,"- Performed head cashier activities such as opening and closing of the registers."
good,"It's encompassed in thre chill environment of Town Square in Las Vegas.  Very townsy, they get deccent traffic for their location, and they have deals for the entire family to enjoy which I love.  The work is not bad, it's pretty easy' you just have to be quick on your feet and meet those deadlines andsale goals and you're golden."
good,"This place is fun to work at. There is a lot of work to be done, but your cowokers help you pass the time. I think that they management could be a little more organized"
good,Excellent company. They have a great team and always care about their employees and their needs. Never had an issue with supervisors or any coworker.
good,"Good place to work, friendly staff and ever-changing environment; worked here from 1998-2004 and returned because I have been unable to find employment"
good,"- great for your first retail job"
good,"Great place to work and shop, benefits are good. Very supportive management team. Hours are all right but sometimes very confusing."
good,Employees were too good. They were cooperative and helpful. They always worked for each other. They never questioned or complained
good,"Typical day was customers coming in and shopping, I learned how to make the place look presentable, the managers were nice, co-workers were friendly, hardest part was approaching the customers, and the most enjoyable part was keeping busy."
good,Not a bad place if you didn't work 3 days a week for 10 hours. Supervisors aren't bad either. People are friendly and help you if you need it
good,"It was an okay job, but wouldn't go back if i ever had to. The managers were two face. That's my experience based on the GAP at the Outlet mall."
good,"I did like working there most days, the busy work was fine, my co-workers were fun and the customers were, well customers! "
good,"I always had something to do. Either folding clothes, dressing the maniacs or organizing the back stock.The customers and co-workers were excellent people to be around."
good,Best place to work the co- workers was the best. The manager was so understanding and she took time out to work with you one on one. I would tell everyone if you need a part time job in the summer this will be the place to go.
good,bonne expérience tant sur le plan humain que professionnel.
good,It was overall a great experience. Learned some good helpful things that i can apply to a better job and really helped me grasp the customer service aspect.
good,"Nice place to work for your first job. Same routine. Not many opportunities to advance in the company but I still enjoyed working for this company , everyone gets along."
good,fun work place but extremely demanding.  I hardly have any home time but compensation is awesome. I have learned a lot about the retail business and also our management is great
good,"My co-workers are lovely and great to work with everyday and i have learned a lot from them and the day to day running of our store."
good,Pay sucked. The management and employees were great. I was just not cut out for retail sales. I only worked here for a short time. Discount on clothing was great.
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and managers who show favoritism. But the job is easy overall, you can choose to do other things besides just working on the floor (cashiering, fitting rooms, etc.). Holidays are the best time there, but other than that very slow business and you lose your hours a lot."
good,"Great place to work, you will immediately feel welcomed. Typical retail job where your biggest struggles come from dealing with customer personalities but you learn to really appreciate them. Love the management although sometimes I feel they can all be on different pages which can cause mis-communication."
good,I worked here to get through High School and some college. It has good benefits with the discounts. The pay was okay but they gave you more hours if you asked.
good,A lot of back and forth about asking for ownership from leaders mixed with micro management of leaders. Typical Retail environment overall. Push and pull with payroll and credit card goals.
good,picking/packing customer orders.co-workers were friendly. management was friendly. nothing hard about the job. they allowed you to listen to music while you worked.
good,I learned to always pay attention and give my all when I work. Working in a retail store isn't what I want to do ever again. I wish I could of gotten more hours when i was working there. The managers are great and the workers are really nice.
good,It was my first job out of state i wasnt used to the people but overall it wasnt bad. As usual with other jobs most of the work gets done at night even things were not responsible for.
good,"This company like many is full of potential, accomplishments, and the inherent strengths and weaknesses that can both benefit and plague a very large organization.  The technology department has had some major successes but also has had difficulties with frequent reorganizations and high turnover."
good,Love the order in the store but I worked in a college town so managers took favor over their friends in terms of moving up in the company.
good,Gap is and good job I just wish that our operation managers didn't leave so often. It's pretty hard going from one manager to one manager and adjusting to all of the different personalities.
good,"Learned to"
good,Hours are short and when you do get a long shift its usually overnight. Everyone keeps to themselves pretty much so there isn't much friendship going on.
good,"A typical day at work was very task oriented, everything and everyone had to operate as a cohesive unit. I learned the ins and outs of sales, how to interact with customers, respecting and helping customers, money management and advertising. My co-workers were very helpful and were more then willing to show me how to properly perform certain tasks. The hardest part of the job was ensuring that all the money was accounted for and that everything was organized properly for sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer get what they were looking for, which ensured that I did my job correctly."
good,"It was fun to work here, just as a part-time job while in school. Hours were sometime crummy but overall it was a pretty fun place to work."
good,"A typical day at work for me was, just observing customers looking out for shoplifters. i learned a lot from working at Gap such as what it takes to run a store, how to balance payroll and making sure you have enough employees working in the store, all of management duties."
good,"I worked at Gap as contractor (1 year)"
good,"Courteous managers, but workload can be too much. Customers are really rude sometimes, but you must learn to have patience."
good,Typical day started at 1 in the morning with a very good supervisor who made sure you were up for the task ahead. It was a very fast paced job which i loved.
good,working hear wasn't as good as any other stocking position i have had.the people were nice but the pay sucked.i wouldn't work here again.this is a good job for a school kids maybe.
good,"I had to Influence customer buying decisions, by communicating information about the quality, value and style of Gap products including style, fit, fabric, price, and care instructions. Also set the example by role modeling our selling culture to provide outstanding customer service. I positively and proactively helped solve problems for our customers and balanced multiple customers in a fast paced retail environment."
good,The custmers are the worst at time. The co workers are great. Management is angry and alwayts underpressure but you will get use to them.
good,The hours there were terrible sometimes only averaging about 16 hours a week. The manager was by far the best manager I have ever experienced because she was so understanding.
good,"Fun workplace, but they weren't willing to work with my school schedule. A typical day at work would be making sure the sales floor  was presentable, assist customers, and manage the cash registers. The hardest thing I had to deal with was the fact that the manager was not understanding in regards to scheduling. They would ask us what days worked best for us and what days we weren't available, but they would still schedule me for all the days that I said I wasn't available due to school and child care issues."
good,"This is a fun place to work. A normal day consists of a few hours of folding clothes and helping the occasional customer find a style of denim that is right for them. Their is occasional cleaning involved for those who open/close the store but other that that the job is fairly simple in that you just make sure the store is clean, and organized. Managers are usually fairly nice, however the District Managers and General Managers usually place way to much pressure on sales associates to get GAP Cards of the company. So much to the point where some stores will give, or not give, you work hours depending on how many gap cards you get during the week. This job is for those who have a lot of free time to be called in at the last minute, and who can either come in early or work late. Pay usually stays at or around minimum wage for non-managers. It's a great job for those over 18 yrs of age that need spending money. Not great for grown adults who need to pay bills."
good,"While working for GAP Kids I had the best chance at obtaining more customer service skills, became very familiar with shoppers and staff."
good,"Management is wonderful, easy to talk to.  The co-workers are lovely people.  You meet a lot of fun people both in reference to customers and as well as the employees."
good,"This place was one of the best place's to work for, until you get uncombfortable with how management treats employees. I personally have had years upon years of leadership training and the system has a crack when it comes to communication. Overall the pay was great and you made friends and enemies. Somewhat like being back in high school, doing whatever the teacher tells you as they don't listen to a suggestion."
good,"Answering the phones to assist customers.  I learned how to use there program and improved on my invoicing skills.  The management were good, but were not forthcoming with certain info unless you asked a specific question.  My co-workers were a good resource for information.  "
good,"A typical work day would be clock in, be prep for the day by a manager. Go out onto the sales floor and complete your tasks. The management was nice, and so were the co-workers. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to please everyone at once. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help people and put a smile on their face. I learned from this job, that you can't always please everyone, and that customer service is always the key."
good,cool place love the hours work firstshift three days a week and had lots of overtime and co-workers were very friendly managment was their when you need them to be
good,Your growth depends on the management you are under. It makes all the difference in whether or not you will be able to advance and grow within the company.
good,"Hardest part of the job is working with upper management."
good,"Handle transactions and adding on more for buyers"
good,"Enjoyable place to work and gain valuable skills in patience, multitasking and communication. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the diverse groups of people that would come in and shop."
good,"the store leadership needs to be on before they an lead, Hopefully the store culture can change but overall associates are great!"
good,"Typical day includes reviewing documents sent from corporate office and executing visual merchandising. Responsibilities include windows, product placement and mannequin design."
good,Learn a lot about logistics operation and customs clearance. Very fast working environment and long work hours as well as weekend shifts but very helpful as a first job opportunity.
good,"The pay, especially overtime, was good.  Other than that; when the warehouse is not busy you're kept in the dark about whether you're working or not.  Also, terminations when it slows down come unexpectedly."
good,The management staff aggressively pushes sales and GapCard acquisition. The company is also not immune to the effects of high turnover.
good,"I didn't really like the GAP too much...  As with anything, it's all about who you know in order for your experience to be great here..."
good,"High on safety, but low on how to proceed with work. I used a PTV for 10 hours a day 4 days a week. Picking and pull boxes of shelves."
good,"Job revolves around how much you can sell. Employees need to be focused on all the customers needs and wants at all times, making them feel special. Must be able to juggle multiple tasks and customers at once. The dresses are heavy and you need some upper body strength to lift them."
good,"There was nothing bad about my time there besides that it was really busy, which did help the day to go by faster."
good,Ho imparato a far stare i clienti a proprio agio  e i colleghi di lavoro erano molto gentili e cordiali.
good,"Working at this store you must be fast paced and enjoy helping others, We usually had to be on our toes and made sure the store was tidy at all times. "
good,I think that being a stock replenisher was very tiring for me being that you had to be at work at 5 or 6. Other than that my day went by pretty fast and i think after a while you get used to it. Mornings just aren't good for me
good,"Working in retail is not a walk in the park, that being said working at Gap was not the easiest job. At times it can become very stressful during the holidays, not to mention the over stressed managers."
good,coming into wok is fun I come in get my one minute and start my day. I have learned how to work a cash register and help customers. management is up and down for me they are tough on me but they have taught me a lot. the hardest part of my job is holiday because its fast pasted but at the same time its enjoyable because that's when there's a lot of fun and I love merchandising it just makes me feel like I'm really doing things for the company.
good,Worked here during my early 20's. Gave me the ability to embrace my creativity in the visuals dept.
good,"My feet hurt and I don't like the hours, that's the only thing that I don't like about the job. When I applied it was for 30 hrs. that 3 days a week with 10 hr. shift but know they have added a extra hour and its killing my feet and seems to drag on at the end of the day."
good,"My co workers at work are amazing, the management staff is very nice and supporting. The hardest part of my job would have to be the long hours but the most rewarding would be knowing how much work I got done."
good,"Gap INC has some really wonderful employees. However, there is not enough hours to go around. Part timers end up fighting for shifts that are only about 4 hours long. Management is quite disorganized."
good,A typical day would being taking inbound calls from customers about orders. I learned how to make decisions with out the assistance from a supervisor or manager. Nothing was hard about the job very enjoyable.
good,GAP has incredible employee relations and an energizing work environment.
good,"I don't really enjoy working at Gap. It may just be the management at the specific store that I work at, but it's just not enjoyable. I work by myself most of the time in either Gap Kids or Baby Gap, and the work day is long staying in the same store for 4+ hours with no coworkers to talk to and not much to do."
good,worked with other employees folded clothes rung the cash register attended the fitting room processed returns
good,"Typical day would include clocking in and going to management to find where your area would be that day. If on the sales floor, you would greet customers and let them know of any sales going on. If a customer had a question you would assist them to the best of your abilities. You may have also had to cover breaksand organizing your area to look presentable as needed."
good,its alright good work place for teens. raises are weak. good people
good,It was a pleasure working with my colleagues at The Gap.  The discount was nice and management generally cared about the well-being of the staff.
good,"I started at Old Navy in June. I was drawn to the energy and positivity of a few members of the management. They tend to reward seniority with generous pay raises, as I have discovered through talking with co-workers that have worked for them longer than myself. The standard for execution and completion of tasks are extremely high so if you are a lazy worker this is not the place for you. My biggest discrepancy is the shortage of hours or the overstaffing of workers. It is most likely the reason I will not stay with the company."
good,"Nice working environment which offers a work life balance. Gave an opportunity to learn and work on new technologies.  Though not fast paced, there were occasional challenges which involved supporting the critical systems. Overall it has been joyous fun ride"
good,Animación botarguero gio demostración de productos organización de concursos y eventos aborde de clientes etc.
good,Everyday brings new challenges and everyday you handle each problem differently. I enjoy interacting with all of the customers.
good,The GAP in a fun place to work with nice people including the customers however there was a shortage of hours when i was employed.
good,"retail"
good,"Trained store employee on proper returned policies and loss of merchandise."
good,"I enjoyed my job at the Gap Distribution Center for the first nine years that I worked there in the inventory control department. The work was interesting, something new every day.  Eventually the department was downsized and I was moved to the operations department. The work in operations was very physically strenuous and repetetive. I was bored with this type of work. When business got slow they offered a buyout to the employees. I decided this was my chance to go back to school. I had always wanted to be a teacher and I decided to take the buyout and go back to school. I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given to start over."
good,"Aprendi a trabajar bajo presion, y entender la importancia de formar un buen equipo"
good,There are always customers coming and going with lots of question which keeps you busy.
good,"Management was ok, co workers were fun. Some of the customers were pleasant. Hardest part about the job was at the end of a big sale the store was completely ruined. We had to completely refold and rehang everything before the next morning."
good,Working at the Gap is a very rewarding experience.  The staff is very friendly and easy to get along with.  The hours stay reasonable (except for Black Friday) and the management is very good about maintaining your specific needs with scheduling.
good,"great benefits "
good,"A Typical day at work is pretty fast paced, and when it's not, there is always work to do around the store. I assist customers from getting them the right size they need to ringing them up at the register. Sometimes, I even convince a customer to open a line of credit (Gap Card) with the store. I learned from this job that I have to move fast, and be sharp on my toes. I also learned that you have to adapt to changes in the store as far as the ever-changing merchandise, store set-up and sales promotions.The management is great and they really take the time to get to know you and and train you for the multiple roles of the job. I enjoy my coworkers, they are fun, energetic and most have been there for years so they show longevity in the company. The hardest part of the job is the stability with the schedules. One week you may have to work everyday, the next you may be on call all week. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I see customer's smiling face because they were satisfied with their experience in the store."
good,"The company is great and you have a lot of pride working at Gap Inc and Old Navy, however upper management at Old Navy doesn't value people and people make a company and people make a positive culture. Until they realize this i'm afraid things won't change."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"Management was respectable and kind.  Employees were hardworking.  Overall it was a fair working experience, however there weren't many opportunities for growth or promotions within the company."
good,Learned about retail and the very basic components of sales. Management wasn't organized enough for me to grow.
good,"Easy to sell Gap Products"
good,"The best part of this job was my co-workers, You do the same job every day. They train you in all job functions and it is a safe place to work."
good,On a typical day I would work on the sales flood and help customers meet their needs. I've learned how to use the cash and work with the computers. Our management team was pleasant to work with - but shifts were very difficult to figure out and were not fair to the sales representatives as they were not consistent. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers reach their needs.
good,Good job experience. Exposes you the retail environment. Working hours require flexibility.
good,"Good company, benefits are great, and vacation time is great."
good,The reason I have stayed with this company for 7 year is because of the wonderful people I got to work with. What I have learned from working here is how to manage multiple tacks. I've also learned how to communicate with different types of people.
good,"I begin my day at work by organizing the dressing room and running clothes from the dressing room to back onto the floor. When I'm done with this task I then start to organize the clothing on the floor, and I occasionally tend to cashier duties if needed. "
good,Good Company to work for was able to move up in the company fairly quickly.
good,"Its steady,not demanding ,and some over time sometimes.I learned a lot of things since i ve been working at the Gap.I learned to drive the fork lift,the cherry picker,pallet jack and the reach truck.The Employees there are friendly and fun to work with."
good,"learn new things"
good,"A lot of team work, must wok well with a team and well with others."
good,"This job is good for college students, but hard if you have some children."
good,nice people to work with...decent hours and a good staff discount on decent clothing.
good,"The Gap was an enjoyable experience. I learned in great detail about retail service, interactions with customers, and how to be a professional during a work setting."
good,"Working at GAP was all right. The pay wasn't the best, but okay for a student. The hours where short 4 hour shifts and it was quite easy to move up in the company. My co workers where quite fun and some of the management where easy to speak to about anything."
good,"great and creative place to work, fun and caring associates, new and cute clothes and products, flexible work schedule"
good,"Typical retail store, service the customers. Learned to customer service more. Great management. Hardest part you work for every dime, you be on you feet all day."
good,I learned what it means to be able to work with and assist all types of people.  It was a fun place to work that would allow you to meet many type of individuals as well as employers.  It was difficult to have the management change as frequent over the period of time that I worked there.
good,"Typically we worked 10 hour days, 4 days a week... I learned that if you want a permanent position there, you have to work hard and pace yourself.. Management was a little shaky, but decent.. My co-workers were a blast to be around when we had down time.. The hardest part of the job was keeping your % in the 90 or 100's everyday.. The most enjoyable part were the many discounts we received from working there.."
good,Fast Paced store . Employees received a discount. Management was very nice . Co workers were nice too. The hardest part of the job was folding. It was very enjoyable helping customers.
good,Audit customer orders for errors and fix the errors before package/box is shipped out.
good,"I stay in this position for the amazing people that work here. The employees are fun, the culture is pretty relaxed as well and the management team is laid back like the schedule. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is helping the costumers and have them come back to the store and ask for you specifically. Also the discount is pretty good. A typical day at work is clocking in and making sure i'm prepared for the day. meeting with a manager to be told what the goals are for the day. Maintaining a clean work area, assisting the costumers. Working the register when needed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the unruly costumers who come in daily with attitudes."
good,"Overall, A good company to work for, but leadership is non-existent."
good,"great place if you love retail, keep up on latest fashion. workload heavy not good enough pay for amount of work crammed in 8hr work day"
good,"- Typical dat at work, never any down time."
good,"Walking into work at Gap, you're always going to see new faces. Shoppers love to shop at Gap and the employees and management make it a very enjoyable experience for them. I learned how to handle angry customers to the point where they left satisfied. One of the most enjoyable parts of working at Gap was the inviting environment. Everyone is friendly and offers help to the customers. The hardest part of working at Gap for me was the long nights of staying late to count money after a long day on the sales floor."
good,"At Gap I answered calls from Customers regarding using the Gap.com website.  I assisted them with shopping, placing new orders, how to navigate on the website and on how to fully grasp placing orders from beginning to end.  Working on a team of about 10 others, we averaged 50-75 calls per day each.  We also assisted with billing, complaints, and just about anything the customer needed help with while building a good rapport with each and every customer along the way.  "
good,"Typical work days were smooth a ice for me because i was good at what I was required to do as far as the job description entailed. However, that place also was something of a crutch so i had to walk away."
good,Greeting great customers while doing visual displays. Management was great and the atmosphere is very easy going. Co-workers may have not been the best to work with but the hours were great.
good,i worked in packing logging on the computer scanning in items and packing them out in an presentable manner.
good,"Working at the company started great, I loved it. After a while, the company started cancelling a lot of shifts, thus leading to our store always being understaffed. This required me to do more work, I would work fitting rooms, cash, and sales floor all in one six hour shift, not fun when you're running around everywhere to get everything done. Average shift was around 5 hours. I never got the days I scheduled off. The customers were overwhelming, most of them either complaining about the store or trying to haggle for lower prices and always left a mess. This location required a lot of cleaning, closing took 2 hours, often extending shifts to stay and clean the store. Schedules never came on time and didn't matter anyway because when I came into work they would ask me to stay longer and I would end up missing a break because of the shift change. I ended up coming home everyday feeling like a did a 12 hour day when I worked 6. The only reason I liked coming into work is because you become friends with a lot of your coworkers and they make your shifts bearable."
good,"I worked for the Gap ""back in the day"" when they were the big dog on the block. High traffic, high turnover of merchandise each day, and lots of energy flowing through the store."
good,"Very energetic atmosphere, always something to do in addition to a wide range customer base."
good,Needs to be more for the work that is done. Great employee discount
good,"A day at the Gap was to clock in , get assigned a section , get your box and start filling it with the stores orders. We had to do so many boxes in an hour. Management was always helpful and nice. The hardest part of the job was waiting for the person in front of you. Sometimes they would be slower than you."
good,"As you leave work for break or end of shift if you take a purse or coat they will search you. Old Navy believes employee theft is a bigger problem than customer theft. I have worked retail many years and never been treated this way. They searched my purse and coat (as part of a company policy, they didn't think I actually stole something) at the entrance/exit in front of customers. Oh, I did get a discount of 20%."
good,"I have worked under multiple managers for Gap Inc. Depending on who you work for will make a huge difference in your experience with the company. As a whole, the company does not provide enough staffing to accomodate the workload, which can lead to stressful days if you are a store leader. The culture of the company is absolutely outstanding: they are diverse, emphasize respect, and provide a fun environment. Once again, depending on how skilled your direct supervisors are can change your experience with the company drastically. I currently struggle with the lack of work/life balance, which is solely a result of poor scheduling."
good,It has been a long time since I have worked there. I don't remember a lot about working at GAP.
good,"I held this job for almost six years.  I started out at Banana Republic and worked for all of the GAP, Inc. stores (Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic). I learned a great deal as it was my first job and developed interpersonal skills that have excelled me through my development as an employee. Overall the management was okay, towards the end of my time with this company the management took a turn for the worst which is why I left the company."
good,I work in a small store so my job duties vary.  I do a little bit of everything in my store from stock duties to merchandising and new flow of merchandise.
good,I had more good days than bad. But it can be a little political at times. In NYC you're constantly under pressure of visits. But it is very gratifying when you are helping customers.
good,Gap inc is a good company to work for the most enjoyable part for me is helping the costumers find clothes that suit their style.
good,There were benefits but overall the job took up a lot of time and they did not even pay enough or offer enough hours to pay my bills.
good,This job is alright if you don't have a lot of bills. Management sucks. The work is taxing on the body and raises are not good. No chance to move up in the company.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of ""rally"" to start the day, which is like a briefing from supervisors to employees on the days goals, expectations, duties, etc. I learned mostly about denim, the difference between good denim & bad, you'd be surprised how big of a difference it is. Co-workers weren't the most pleasant, very up tight, very moody, not the best environment. The hardest part of the job was staying focused, there was always some sort of side issues affecting tasks at hand. The most enjoyable would be the discount, 50% off all merchandise."
good,"The hours are long and the pay doesn't match up to the amount of effort you are required to put forth. Management placed alot of their responsibilities on lower level employees, often doing little to nothing during a work day.The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
good,"I loved working for the Gap.  Despite the place I worked at closing down, it was decent."
good,Ok place to work if you dont mind only working 12 to 16 hours a week . except for the holidays. good place to start as a first job. 
good,Well organized company. Great place to develop managers. Love the culture .
good,"Working at Gap Inc. in retail is like any other retail job. You gel customers, work with your team to deliver results and with retail its all about being able to deliver. You try to reach daily goals while trying to exceed last years results. while its a ok job it isnt something you can live off an it should be something just while you are in school or as a way to make some kind of extra money."
good,"I started working at the Gap which was first specified as a full time job. A typical day at work started early in the morning, usually 5 or 6 am. When I started this job there were a lot of employees - all working to put this store together. The main objective was to get the store put together and in tip top shape before its grand opening. Days were long and grueling, and most of the managers were nice. My main complaint was that there were SO MANY of them. You could get told what to do by three different people and it was all mindless and silly. One of the managers I dealt with was very crude and unprofessional, so I tended to try and work with the one that was nice. Most of my co-workers were nice as well, but a bit stuck up. I wasn't quite sure if it is because we were doing so much work, but I covered a few people's shifts for them and was treated pretty badly either way. I learned a bit how brutal retail is. The hardest part about this job was keeping all the managers satisfied."
good,Cool co workers. was able to get the money I needed to assist with my wedding.
good,"Due to a high volume of turnover, there was little training provided which made things challenging"
good,"A typical day at work is really simple,I go in process shipment with my shipment manager and co-workers,the hardest part of the job is getting all the shipment boxes done at a certain time and the most enjoyable part of the job is when my team get recognize for our hard work."
good,"Learn how to handle guests and handle responsiblities, and how to work as a team."
good,This is a great place to work if your goal to achieve a significant amount of expertise in the performance culture vs. people culture.
good,It was located in Robson street so was a very fast environment and we were always so busy withe costumers as I also worked during the christmas. It was fun and friendly and I could improve my multi tasking skill. I also had tough time enagaging with all the costumers at the same time. The best part was that I worked most of the time in baby gap. I enjoyed helping the pregnant mom or mom with their little babies coming to the store. 
good,Great company with great managers that worked around my busy school schedule.
good,"The people i work with are good people for the most part. The pay is pathetic (ive been working there for two years, have gotten one raise which leaves me currently getting 7.95 an hour) BUT they are almost too forgiving of other employees' slack and attendance records. I imagine this is due to the over-all nature of the work - its almost incomprehensible to take the business seriously. Leaves me with a low self-worth everyday i leave there."
good,"A typical day was highly unscheduled/unorganized"
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning the store, stocking the store, helping customers find clothes, working the cash register, and helping customers in the fitting room. I learned how to stock. The management was very upbeat and positive. My co workers were very diverse and I enjoyed getting to know different people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. Although there was only few it taught me how to handle myself in that type of situation. The most enjoyable part was helping each customer find what they were looking for and driving sales  up!"
good,"Gap had normal distribution work."
good,"Its a lot more bending, folding, lifting then I thought it would be. If you work early mornings you will be doing shipment. There is always a lot of products. I wanted more customer service & cash register training. However, no one would even train me on cash register for almost 6 months. I was strictly working product flow, which some enjoy that I personally did not. They push a lot to get gap cards. It gets old real fast. I do really like one of my managers who has always had my back. When I first got hired, the GM was unbearable. She put in her 2 week notice after about 6 months of working with her. Out of 10 I'd give it a 6.5 If it was my one manager I do like, I'd give her a 7-8 stars."
good,"The Gap is a good company. Fast-paced, steady, physically demanding. "
good,"I think this is a great job for teenagers, young adults or adults who want to learn customer service, retail and clerical skills. If you love Gap Inc then it is the right place for you. If you do not love Gap Inc then it is not the place for you. "
good,"A typical day was steady, with lots of folding, stacking, and sorting. I learned basic information about retail work, and customer relations. Management was fun to be around, but had their share of drama. Coworkers were ok, but because I was older, we didn't have much in common. Hardest part of the job was the constant cleaning and rearranging merchandise. The most enjoyable part was working in the mall, but Gap has since relocated."
good,- work place was competitive
good,"You deal with customers alot and fold alot. you dont get benefits unless your in management. you get a 20% discount at all the gap inc stores, your the first ones to special deals. The co works were alot od fun to work with alot of them in the 20s in school. The worse part was in the winter time and around tyhe holidays I couldn't get anytime off you worked really late and early in the morning."
good,"Processed orders for retail stores, performed accuracy counts, shipped product and recently completed training on two types of forklifts. Being a production based job was the challenging part, and the employees were like family. Learned multiple computer programs and computer functions as part of the daily responsiblities."
good,"Making sure store appearance was excellent. Opening up store cards, assisting others."
good,"it is an easy job and there are rises every so often, but this was just a job I had in high school to have some extra money."
good,this job was fun kept me on my toes. but i had to start school and left it behind.
good,"This company had a lot of teenagers working for a reason; the hours were horrible, and unless one of the older people left, only managers and associates who have been there for a minimum of 4 years got the most hours. So if you're looking for a good job that will get your bills paid and you lived comfortably, please continue looking."
good,I love working at GAP!!! I mean what could you not like about it!! My favorite times in the store was when the seasons would change and we had to change all displays and marketing pictures. All the employees would get together to get the store ready for the next day and it was exciting to see the customers faces the next morning once everything was complete
good,"Hardest part of the job would be how slow it can get because you eventually run out of stuff to do. But other than that, it's really relaxed and fun place to work."
good,"it wasnt for me. boring, not much for you to do, not much room to grow"
good,"The hardest part of this job was watching other associates (and managers) not great customers and see what they really need, and thinking it was ok to stand around and talk for the whole shift. I how to help customers when it came to kids clothes.I enjoyed working on kids gap because it was new to me and so much fun to see all the cute babies and kids!"
good,Customers always kept you on your toes. Staff members are like family.
good,When I first started there I enjoyed it but since we got a new general manger she made the Gap very unemployable for a lot of the employees working there hiring more people when we barley had hours to begin with which left a lot of us working 1 day. I did enjoy working on store visuals and customer service
good,La dote acquisita maggiormente è chiaramente la facilità nel rapportarmi con le persone
good,"It was an okay place to work, but hardly got any hours since the store itself barely gets any people to begin with. Management also schedules mostly their female employees since they have Gap Body within the store which is mostly lingerie and female apparel. Management was always on top of their employees about the store credit card, which by the way employees received no incentives for. Consequences would be write ups, less hours, etc. Just not a good place to work!"
good,"Gap is a great company, but it is currently struggling with revolving leadership and changing priorities."
good,"Good work environment, is not much of a hard or difficult job; the only thing was the pressure to get ONC and also the hours given a week which were not enough to make a living and pay bills."
good,"My typical day involved interacting with and providing services to customers, doing cash transactions, and maintaining merchandise. The management and co-workers of Gap were very productive, fast paced and customer based. They worked to make sure that the customer was satisifed with their purchased. The hardest part of my job was my problem with interpersonal communication with the public but I have overcome this issue by watching other employees and management interacting with customers and used some of their factors with my little knowledge of customer services. When working, I enjoyed making sure customers was satified with their purchases and the sales floor looked presentable. From working at Gap, I have learned to overcome my problem with interpersonal communication and to be productive in a fast paced environment."
good,"a typical day at work involves me coming in and clocking in. from there we report to the manager on duty, that informs us of our daily goals and what we are responsible for that day. over time you have a greater understanding of how to work closely with customers, what to do or not to do and are able to become proficient in interacting with co workers, customers and money handling."
good,My day consisted of pulling orders to be shipped to the stores; checking the orders that are being shipped to the stores; counting inventory to be sure it is correct.
good,worked part-time for 2 yrs all though pay was reasonable your overworked and under appreciated for your accomplishments.
good,I learned a lot of things in Gap. I manage my time. To work well with my co-workers. To finish my task on time.
good,A Typical Workday There Was a Bit Challenging because you had to make a certain amount of sales for the month but i enjoyed it because it made me work harder and therefor i had something to look forward to everyday after clocking in and it made it somewhat competitive for me and co-workers on who gets the most sales
good,Assisiting customers with trying on clothes and finding the proper sizes they need. I also assist customers with their checking out process.
good,"Processed incoming shipments, built in store visual displays. Having worked for other gap inc retailers before, It was disappointing to realize that the job i originally applied for,(direct customer service) was not the job i was moved into."
good,I am seasonal and they have bad communication skills communicating the fact that they require mandatory overtime
good,"J'arrive sur mon lieu de travail bien sur très ponctuel et présentable,je commence ma journée par les tâches a accomplir,"
good,"Gap is just like any other retail job. Little hours and little pay but it was fun to work for. If you love Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy then get a job at any of the 3 and you will receive a discount to all 3."
good,Easy to get along with co-workers. You learn how to satisfy customers. The hardest part of the job is standing all day and the most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team making sure customers are satisfied.
good,"good management team, supportive relationships, fast pace environment."
good,Learning the clothing industry selling trending fashions for women and men. Working and training large staff of employees to work different shifts to ensure smooth functionality of the store
good,"Being a store manager is a very fulfilling job. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to train, develop and promote people."
good,on a ordinary day of work we come in pick a section to replenish unload a truck in the middle of the day and stock up from kids clothing to adults management was cool co-workers was good team players there wasnt to much of a hard part of the day and i enjoyed it because everybody stayed focus and enjoyed the workplace
good,"you definitely stay busy at the gap,never a dull moment got to work in different departments on a daily basis. I learned to work in the receiving office and take incoming merchandise orders, setup days for trucks to be delivered, setup work loads for the day according to the delivers. I learned how to driver power equipment. the co-workers I worked with were great we always helped one another out,"" Team- Work"" that's what it's all about. The hardest part about the job was having to leave it and the people that I grew to love and respect. the most enjoyable was the company sales."
good,"Great place to work . Moral was always high, never ending. Management pushed you to grow."
good,i would go to my stop that i was assigned for the night and grab things off the shelves for an order and put then into the boxes and ship them
good,Very progressive in technology and standards but a behemoth in size.
good,Mediocre pay. Good employee discounts. Ok environment. Unstable hours.
good,I learned a lot. Was like one of my first real jobs. The management team was nice.
good,great jobs for students. It was very flexible hours. I liked the employee discount to buy the close.
good,Good place to begin a working career. Many great co-workers to meet and keep as friends for years.
good,Love the clothes and everything that I have to do my job with but I don't get to do my job more than 50% of the week. Most other time is spent doing things sales associates should be doing because of the lack of payroll hours the stores are given.
good,"I actually loved my job, it was the management that was unbearable. Our store manager was.....the worst manager I have ever had the displeasure of working with. She did not know how to have genuine interactions with staff everything was superficial. Her presence cause tension more often then not."
good,"Upper management sucks. Can't find good employees. It was a nice company to work for years ago but, they lost their way."
good,Friendly environment and get incentives for increasing store sales
good,I learned alot about myself and the people around me everyday.
good,"Working for the Gap required me to pick, pack, clean, stocking, and QA."
good,"It was a part time job to help me while I was studying at university. I learned to deal with hard customers and handle money. I worked as part of a team and also on my own. Co-workers very friendly, the hardest part of the job was the hard customers."
good,Each day I would start out by setting up the payroll and the sales goal for the day as well as checking email and correlating with our district manager and other store managers. I would then set each employee up with their duties and positions for the day. I was also in charge of merchandising and would handle customer issues as they would arise. I worked with many different types of people on each management team I was on and the thing that I learned the most was how to treat and work with others because this can be the hardest part of the job if you don't stay open-minded and diplomatic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction I got when we would exceed our goals as a direct result of our hard work and determination to make things work.
good,"Sales Associate- Helping customers with sales, discounts, & fitting rooms. I also have experience working as a cashier. It is fun yet challanging job."
good,"I believe being a sales associate in this company is excellent for part time employees. Personally my football schedule blended well with gap's extremely flexible schedule. I love the environment although you have to get to know the people around you to keep the time going. The pay is really low and although I really enjoy the job I won't be able to keep up with the bills i have when i move out. Even if I was provided with the promotion, management looks too stressful to even desire. Overall for a first sales job this is perfect oppertunity to learn how to be outgoing and people friendly."
good,"flexible for working students. It is not ideal for career advancement, innovation or fast, quick adjustments made in other business environments like a startup"
good,Some of the more experienced employees still didn't quick know how to do there jobs. Some employees skip there task or let other do it for them.
good,"The Gap Inc is great and a fun enviornment but I am one of those people that is used for everything from windows to answering phones. The management is really pushy, my co- workers are great. Hardest part of the job is being one of the few that knows how to do everything in the store. I learned how to deal with customers under pressure and sti make them happy."
good,"Upon moving to Vegas in 2007, I was fortunate to have an opportunity to work at GAP as seasonal stock clerk. However, the opportunity sadly didn't last past the holiday. Only a few were able to advance from seasonal to regular & I was unable to join the group"
good,"Great place to work, the supervisor care about your needs and help you if you need something. I learned how to cope in difficult situations. There are some situations that are not the best like they cut hours or that you have to be stand up for 5 or 6 hours with just 15 minutes breaks."
good,"Selling to and helping customers is the main part of the job. When I was not helping customers I was cleaning and folding the sales area and dressing rooms. Some days when new merchandise would arrive I would reallocate the old merchandise to make way for the new shipment. After about a year management, let me train new workers, and take over more complicated transactions. I learned a great deal about the retail industry, having never worked in the i prior to my time here. The hardest part of the job is selling the Gap Card to customers when credit card debt was prevalent. My favorite part of the job is trying on new clothes and helping customers find what they are looking for. I also like the feeling of building a relationship with customers, and I can more easily help them find what they are looking for."
good,*A typical day at work is moderate to heavy traffic of customers.
good,The ecommerce portion of Gap Inc. has kept them afloat in this recession. The direct to consumer piece was taking off as retail Gap DC's were being shut down. The DTC aspect of GID is a huge strength for Gap as a whole.
good,"sales and marketing executive working on vacation, launched the tooth-paste afterv thorough research. meeting targets"
good,"I worked for this company in order to make a little money during college. It had great people, and the management was friendly, but there was little room to grow."
good,"There are alot of rules to follow but that comes with any job, love the dress code you get t wear pretty much whatever you want. The people that work there are nice I just hate working retail."
good,Good place to work part time. Offers growth within the company if interested. My work is appreciated by management.
good,"Working at Gap Inc was definitely an experience. They pride themselves on individualism, which few companies do. They allow you to be yourself, yet expect you to follow a universal set of guidelines. This was a great opportunity for a full time college student. Like many other companies, there were discrepancies amongst colleagues, but that's a frequent occurrence in any environment."
good,"Friendly workers and customers. Special events and promotions were always fun.Not enough hours were given, which persuaded me to leave."
good,"The environment was great, as were the people and they do recognize effort. If you express the desire to move up they will train and provide opportunity to do so, however compensation is poor. when you express that you need adequate pay for your role or the amount of responsibility you are given they are reluctant to provide and come up with even more for you to do to warrant a raise that you may never get. At the end of the day we work for money, to pay bills, to have fun and some resemblance of quality of life. No amount of good people, passion for a  role or the work that you do will change that."
good,"Working at Gap factory is a lot of physical work for not a lot of money. Another downside is that we do not receive any sort of commission for hitting our goal as a Team. If we had, then doing so much physical work would make more sense, but It doesn't make any sense for the amount of money we're getting paid. Another downside is that you can be knowledgeable about the company and give great customer service, but, if you're not getting enough Gap cards, then you're pretty much unimportant from a business point of view. Meaning, no raise and no opportunity for growth. I wish these flaws hadn't existed because I would've stayed at Gap. The work culture is great and it's not so strict working here, compared to other jobs I've worked."
good,"Not many hours, No bonus, wage increase, progression, you're micro managed, no flexibility for working mothers."
good,"GAP was my first retail job I had. It served its purpose for a first job, but management did not treat their younger associates as well as they did their older ones."
good,Working at gap as a call center associate requires a lot of patience with customers. The way they determine your “schedule adherence” can be frustrating when calls run long which is out of your control.
good,The job was good they helped turn workers into great movers I worked Overnights & it was great but to get layed off for no reason makes the company questionable .
good,"There needs to be better communication of expectations here. Overall, they expect you todo well, but specifics would be nice. Management needs to work on this."
good,"My coworkers were super nice, we had the best time together. It made the environment pleasant to work in"
good,Not much room for growth unless you work at Global HQ.  Everyone is pretty miserable about their lives but do nothing about it.  They all fit a certain mold.
good,"good for young people, easy to get on with people there however there is some drama"
good,Hard physical work. On my feet all day. Can be rewarding. Get to choose work schedule for the most part. May need to cover to work weekends. Always do early mornings.
good,The Gap is a box big box store so be ready to work hard. There is shipment every week. The stores are continuously being re-merchandised. They have flexible hours perfect for students.
good,"Very fast paced environment. If you don't do what you have to quick, managers get on you. Co workers were cool, never had a problem. Managers were okay for the most part as well. Was terrible having to pack up a pile after you just fixed it all because a customer messed it up."
good,good job for someone who is still in school but the job does not have enough hour. Most times you can have a big check sometimes your check might be enough for a phone bill an thats it.
good,Overall it was a nice job just hours were super long and breaks were too short. What was different working there the employees were able to listen to music while we worked which help the day go by quicker. Also I left due to the fact it was seasonal.
good,"Clothing retail was a little hard personally to get accustomed to from cashier work at a grocery store. A couple team members didn't seem to welxoming to new team members, felt intimated by for a couple of the first days on the job."
good,"it is a fun place to work, i learned a lot working for the company and i would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a first job or part time job."
good,"Working at Gap is not a hard job. Gap Stores are always a mess, which will always give you something to do, but other than that, it's a very slow-paced, relaxing job. When the store wasn't open, you could clean while wearing headphones and listening to music, which was nice."
good,"You start early and end late, but leaves time for other things. Therea a taco truck at lunch that's pretty good. When it is slow you get sent home so that's cool."
good,"Great pay and RRSP matching program during my time with Gap"
good,Enjoyable place to work but the hours flucuate from week to week.The store management are fair. The schedule gets changed to night before your shift which makes it hard to plan your day.
good,"I learned that I never want to work a job like that ever again. It wasn't for me and It was a mistake to ever take the job. Although, I gained retail experience and everything happens for a reason."
good,"Working there honestly stunk because it was all cement walls and no way to even see outside, the money wasnt good and they were not in any way flexible with my schedule as a then high school student."
good,"Very fast paced during the holiday seasons"
good,"I loved working at this job. I loved my coworkers, because they'd always lend a helping hand whenever needed. The only issue I had with this job was the distance, and also one of the managers I felt as if she wasn't considerate of personal emergencies or issues that you had."
good,"Far too much to talk about in a summary, but the place has changed way too much over the years.  Too metrics-centric, more and more overtime required each week, way too stressful.  Like I said in the tagline..................just look elsewhere."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Gap, it was a fast paced fun environment with excellent coworkers.  A typical day started off counting out the tills and the safe, getting the cashiers ready and making sure the store was clean and tidy for the customers.  Next I would let the workers know who would be on which register, the dressing rooms and the floor.  Finally we would open the store and the hectic pace would begin."
good,"Nice people and working place. friendly team and managers."
good,"I loved working at the Gap. Unfortunately, my store closed and there were no opportunities for Management in the District to transfer into.  I was sad to leave the company."
good,GAP was an enjoyable place to work and the staff there were great and was on hand to help with any unsure questions. I met some amazing people working here.
good,"I enjoyed working at GAP. A typical day at work was busy, I was nonstop working whether it was folding clothes or working at the tills I was always doing something. I learnt how to reprice items of clothing and how to tag items of clothing. the hardest part of the job was when not everyone was working on a busy day as there is a lot to do and a lot of areas to manage and keep presentable. I loved seeing what new clothing came in with the orders."
good,"I worked for the GAP starting as a stock employee and moved up to the management level in a short period of time.  I learned the retail world and began my education in how to provide excellent customer service.  At the time I worked for the GAP, the culture was all about providing an experience for the customer and the training sessions were great.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the various people and meeting new clients daily."
good,Gap is a lovely place to work very laid back and chill for a first job but my time spent wasn’t very great i wasn’t able to get many hours and i was laid off due to the fact i missed work because of my child being in the hospital i wasn’t able to show prof of a Doctors excuse it’s not a bad place just needs better management
good,"it feels like the company doesn't know where it is headed. many unnecessary changes. ""fixing"" things that weren't broken and not addressing real problems"
good,"I like the job it was a fun work place, everybody was friendly & it a fast pace job with i love. The gap is a good place to work especially if its your first job"
good,"During a typical work day I am in charge of altering product displays in ways that make it easiest for the customer to shop and to add on items to their purchases. I am also in charge of taking care of the check out process and making sure that everything goes smoothly throughout the customers entire experience in the store."
good,"The Gap was a good retail job around busy holiday hours, but once the new year came around i was not being given any more shifts."
good,"They always would put me on-call for whole weeks, never giving me a chance to have a life outside of work, let alone manage school."
good,Multinacional con códigos muy estrictos orientada a la venta
good,Gap inc. Has been a good job. I am forced to leave due to the fact I am moving to Florida soon to better fit my family. Typical work day could be anywhere from doing conveyor pm's . To doing work orders that where handed out . To repairs . Anything that needed done.
good,Near the end there was a lot of pressure about selling cards and capturing emails. A lot of other people didn't like the managers because of this pressure and didn't like the job because of the pressures as well. I was good at selling cards and therefore none of this mattered to me
good,"A typical day at work can be so unorganized because the managers are not good at checking the calendar. "
good,"Retail is hard in itself, but when you have hormonal managers, it makes it all the worst. When I was first hired as a high school student I loved it! It didn't bother me that my schedule was always different from week to week or that I didn't know what shift I was working until the day before the work week started. At that point i didn't care about paying bills so the ridiculously low $ per hour became an issue."
good,"I got hired fairly quickly through an interview process that was not too challenging. I worked as a season worker. The management did not train me, and I had to figure things out on my own. I worked over the black Friday/Christmas season so the workload was somewhat hectic. Overall, it was not too bad of a job"
good,It was okay the first couple months then with people started to leave as they figured out that the job is just a regular part time gig.
good,working here was very fun and friendly. People always smile and spoke when you walk pass. I love the shift because it still gave you that personal time off.
good,Unload the shipment truck and stock the items in the store. Help assist customers with questions and clothing apperal. Run the cash register to check out customers.
good,"Poor work life balance. But you can build great relationships with the people. If you can work here, you can work anywhere."
good,"I would typically walk the floors with the absence of camera systems in the location. I have learned what to look for within Criminal activity when it comes to shrink awareness. My management team was ok. I say this because I rarely seen or heard from them. The Pro to that was that I was not micro-managed, but the con was that I felt that I could have learned more during my tenure. The hardest part of my job came when I had to follow certain rules to apprehend shoplifters. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we held events for the children at the store."
good,"Even though Gap Inc. is a great company that takes care of it's employees with great benefits, they are completely unorganized at times, and create unrealistic workload expectations and hold their employees accountable for not achieving them."
good,I was hired seasonally and I like the people I worked with and the management. They communicated well. A major downside was that I only worked weekly or biweekly. I had the availability to work 3-4 days/wk for 5-8hrs/shift and they only gave 1-2 days/wk working 2-4 hrs/ shift. This could be a result of seasonal over staffing or the newness of the store and lack of business. I was also not trained on cash wrap during my 3 months there which was unfortunate because I wanted to learn how to do it. The pay was good and there were a lot of promotions going on for employees to earn extra things on the side.
good,I learned alot from other stylist to perfect my skills as a visual merchandiser
good,Mes horaires sont de 7h à 15h (avec une heure de pause). Je passe la journée à déballer les cartons pour les ranger dans les différents rayons. Je m'occupe aussi parfois de la vente et je renseigne la clientèle sur les différents type de marchandise. L'ambiance entre collègues et avec le manger est bonne.
good,In the past few months i've learned a lot. My recovery skills are amazing and i can multi-task like never before. I also learned the importance of customer service and the strength of confidence behind a sales pitch. The management isn't the best but they are working to get better. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unruly customers.
good,Fun and accommodating with schedules. Poor management and zero compensation for sales.
good,Salary cap is to low & management does not care. They have one answer to all problems (terminate).
good,"I love working with people and i like the customer service aspect of it.You get to meet a lot of interesting people. But the hours are never consistent. You may work 30-40 hrs a week on holidays or special weeks but on average it may be 15-20 which may not be enough to support a decent lifestyle, especially one with debt. "
good,A typical day on the job always included heavy recovery due to the high volume of customers coming in and out of the store daily. The job was very manageable when you were put on the schedule but it was a good place to work for.
good,Overall the company has a great set of core values.  At this time the leadership team is in flux and has not been able to provide a stable strategic direction as the company restructures.
good,"A typical day at work included restocking shelves, helping customers with questions and problems, and working the fitting rooms. It's a perfect job for anyone needing extra money. Everyone there is really nice and the management tries hard to create a good work relationship with their employees. The hardest part of the job was working holidays because the store got really busy. It's the second busiest Gap Outlet in the United States."
good,"Merchandise Processor"
good,I learn very much at this company. I developed skills adquired in my degree.
good,Typical Day Included: Replenishing Sales Floor & Assisting Customers.
good,lots of opportunity within this company for advancement. fast paced retail enviornment. great peers and managers. friendly enviorment.
good,Its a nice place to work but the only rsason.i stopped working there is becuase they just cut my hours down to one day a week for six hours. Who can live on that ?
good,Gap Inc is great place to work most of the time. Sometimes you feel like the people in corporate have never set foot in a store in their life because of the things they come up with but you just get on with it and it is a pretty good environment overall.
good,Good opportunity to start a career. Learned work life. Good support from the manager
good,Able to learn to develop for future fields. Able to work with availability.
good,"Banana Republic was a fun place to work at times. I learned how to sale items to customers, set up displays and sale BR cards. The hardest part was the BR cards. In order to get hours we had to sale a certain amount. I would sale at the least 3 BR cards every shift but it wasn't enough. In a months time, I would have worked maybe 3 shifts. I had enough of it and that's when I joined Target."
good,"management is inconsistant, I have learned alot about customer service and how to properly address customers as well as raise the CES scores. My most enjoyable part of the job is customers and finding out what they are shopping for and finding the perfect outfit."
good,"I only worked here in a seasonal position so my review won't accurately reflect how it is to work here full-time. "
good,"The management needs some TLC but the benefits are amazing. Also, the advancement opportunities are slim to none."
good,"Hours are not guaranteed and definitely not stable. Only get about 4 hours a day (if even that). Great company, but management is confused about their positions and do not know how to direct employees. "
good,It was a god company to work for. The work / life balance was challenging.
good,"very low pay, very busy weekend which was a plus, most management was very nice, too much pressure to try and have people sign up for credit cards, co-workers were all friendly, the best part of the job was interacting with customers and occasionally being able to travel to assist surrounding stores!"
good,"Modern day slavery. Early morings, short breaks, low raises. Hard to advance within the company. Good health care!"
good,"it was a very fun place to work, however managment could be a problem at times, they make u open a certain amount of store credit cards per month and it could be competative."
good,- extremely disorganized company
good,A typical day at work is consistantly staying busy and using your body.
good,"I actively promote the Gap Mailing list, meeting personal targets of obtaining emails from customers to join. I deal with customers on the shop floor, approaching and greeting them, and ensuring they can find what find what they need, along with explaining the American sizing differences. I also deal with cash handling, recovery and replenishment and marketing promotions. I enjoy working as part of a team and helping customers."
good,"Retrieve sales stats from day prior, share new promotions or policies with staff, complete weekly schedules, interview potential associates, go through employee orientation."
good,At the gap i learn different kind thing like promoter on clothes and our sale . i help customer with sale and help on the fun .
good,Great company discount and decent hourly pay. Not allowed to interact with peers making the work envirnment dull and down.
good,a typical day at work is me getting everybody on track with whats the duties for the day and if theres any new styles of clothing that they need to review its my job to make sure that its done. learing how to be pasent everyone learns on a differnt pace i had a great team of employees they made sure everything got done when it needed the hardest part was trying to keep all customers happy well some just cant seem to get get it i love to help women n men with putting together outfits or if they were starting a new wordobe
good,A typical day at work would have me rinking up customer at the cash register and folding clothes all over the store.
good,enjoyed listening to the music at the stroe.assiting customers with items. great atmopshere
good,Very busy work environment dealing with different customers. I have learnt patience when dealing with people and how to successfully work as a team to get things done effectively. The hardest part of my job is making a difficult customer happy and the most enjoyable part of my job is making that customer happy because then everyone is happy.
good,It was a lot of favoring going on there. If you sucked up to the bosses you where able yo do what you wanted. They also barely followed your schedule to your availability. I always got calls when I was at school asking to come in. They really under valued those who came and actually did they job. The manager was also rude and very judgemental.
good,good job to interact with people. They always had great sales and treated the employess very well
good,"Most is nice clothing, good discount, good environment if you can up-sell, good for multi tasters"
good,"I loved the division exposure that I was given at Gap Inc. In the three years I worked there, I worked in three different divisions which were body,baby/kids and adult. Having tried all of these divisions I was able to learn the ends and outs of the divisions. Ultimately, this made it easier for me to assist customers."
good,Having great customer service is essential to be successful.
good,"Awesome company to work but the advancement takes a long time. Different company from what it was, now work life balance does not apply"
good,The job was pretty cool to have. I had fun coworkers and cool assistant managers. You have to be willing to move around ALOT during your shift or work won't get done. I learned so much during my time there. I know the experiences I had at Gap will help me with any other company I work at.
good,The people that work at Gap Kids and Baby Outlet are among the friendliest. All customers that come into our store are greeted and taken care of to best of their capacity. Many remark on what an inviting atmosphere GK&B provide.
good,I loved working for this company but needed to leave in order to make more money.
good,"Gap Kids and Baby is a really fun job if you enjoy children and a sales associate type of job. There is always something to do, from straightening the floor to shipment. Fun overall, however these types of jobs can't pay the bills. Awesome job for a secondary job or first time job seeker."
good,"I have worked at gap since i was 16. i managed to play highschool sports as well as be in high school while working here. They are very flexible with hours, and offer fun benefits and games for good work. (starbucks cards, treats)"
good,"My time with Gap began over summer as a TWA intern which allowed me to become a part time sales associate. I got trained for about 1-2 days where I was familiarized with the layout of the store and how to process clothing. Overall simple tasks such as folding, greeting customers and running go back items. The negatives begin at the register. While ringing up customers is an easy task, management seems to only care about signing people up for unwanted rewards programs such as the gap card or bright rewards. Many customers do not want to sign up for a credit card, so that affects the employee because they want an employee who can sign up as many people for a card rather than the best service. However, management is overall nice and understanding and no drama with any coworkers at my store. This is a great first retail job aside from the rewards program."
good,Great culture great people very understanding management style composition plan it is pretty aggressive compared to other competitors time spent working versus the time spent at home is very comparable
good,You’re a sales associate working the sales floor so you have to keep your head up and help customers and keep and eye out for anyone trying to rob the store.
good,I worked at Gap for almost 2 months but I had to quit due to non reliable transportation. Overall it was a good job but they didn’t do a good job at training me. The employees were often friendly and the managers were nice.
good,The Gap gave me the chance to learn how to work in different departments learn how to drive and be certified on all equipment overtime available at times
good,Okay this could be a Good job for those going to school or just want the extra money. I am not an expert in marketing but i believe they can do so much better in advertising the crazy coupon sales.
good,"This job gave the opportunity to work with powered industrial vehicles and the ability to train others on many functions. I was working 5 days of the week with the occasional sixth day. The difficult part of the job was the drive and the traffic. Management gave me the opportunity to become proficient in most, if not all, departments of the building."
good,I want to be more professionnel in this work sales...and go to big company in marketing to be like manger or something like that ..finally thank you .
good,"not easy to move up "
good,Good people working with you but not to go up in position benefits and insurance can be better good management and helpful most of the time don't give enough money for the job
good,At this place you make the best out of what you can. They give hours based off relative work skills and willingness to work hours. It was a great place to work because of the flexibility to work in other departments. If you are willing to work you can attain a lot of valuable skills. Also the discounts you can get on clothing is worth the effort. Although the pay should be increased based on performance.
good,"No work life balance......only"
good,"On any given day you can expect to be active on the sales floor, assisting guests as the come in to shop. For the majority, it is a laid back atmosphere where management and associates work together, sharing friendly relationships."
good,The first store I worked at was awesome! Everything was organized and very team oriented. That store closed unfortunately. The new store is horrible. It is the opposite of the first store. Nothing is organized. The store is not family oriented and management couldn't be any worse. I have had THE worst experience at the recent store. That's why my overall rating is a 3 star out of 5 because my first year with them was an extremely great experience opposed to my last 6 months with the recent store.
good,"Productive, fun workplace just keep yourself busy and work together. On a normal day, you are either a cashier or working on the floor folding clothes and organizing dressing rooms."
good,"It’s a fun place to work because the coworkers make it worth it. There is some opportunity for advancement but very rarely. Management can overwork you and expect you to get things done when they are not possible. Raises are almost impossible to get, no matter how hard you do your job."
good,Good place to work if you are just looking for a temporary job. Very fast paced on the weekends but expect slow days on the weekdays. Fun environment!
good,"If you are looking to advance up the ranks of a retail company, gap is the place for you. They have multiple companies under the same parent, and they mainly hire internally for promotions so there are many advancement opportunities. For those seeking rewarding short term retail experience, this is not the company for you. Each employee is expected to sign up a minimum number of customers per month for a company credit card. However, the only incentive to do so was typically a $5 gift card for one employee or getting entered in a raffle. The management were constantly pushing us to achieve sales goals, but we didn't make commission so it was hard to be motivated to do so only making $12/hr. They had us competing against other stores in the state, but different stores get different amounts of traffic so it wasn't something we could easily control as sales associates."
good,"pick, pack, process orders in a timely manner, check in order to be sent out the work place is a great place to work for making sure to make your production."
good,"- Managers almost never know what the others are doing. There have been times I was scheduled to work for 6AM, only for a manager to cancel that shift at 9PM the night before when I was in bed. Another time, a manager called to see if I could pick up a shift, to which I said yeah. Come that day, I show up at 6AM (when I was supposed to be there) only for another manager to tell me I wasn't scheduled and to go home"
good,"Turnover is high so workload is demanding but exciting."
good,"I was properly trained from the beginning so I felt comfortable working the sales floor and register. You'll mess up a few times, but managers and coworkers are sometimes always there to help. Managers were cool just except for the fact that there was some miscommunication between them causing confusion for employees. Once they get used to you doing a specific job (ie...register, kids section, stock room work ), they will keep you there for what seems like forever. However, they will offer chances of advancement and more freedom on the register if you show them your ability to work hard and efficient. Biggest annoyance was some customers who held up lines when not getting their way (happened often), but someone is always there to help in these situations. The constant nagging about getting Gap Cards becomes irritating as well. But overall, it's a good job culture with fun coworkers, managers and customers alike."
good,"I learned a lot here. I didn't like the hours at all, and sometimes things seemed to be very political at times. The work was very mundane, and I felt like I hit the ceiling quickly."
good,I love working there and some people where nice at the gap and very cool sweet kind very helpful at sometimes but most likely I’m gonna miss working with the good people I worked with
good,"average retail working environment"
good,"TYPICAL DAY: On the floor informing customers of ongoing c promotions, maintaining the appearance of the store, managing store returns or helping customers in the fitting room. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of complete unprofessionalism. we learned how to fold clothes and greet customers correctly when trying to sell. The management would relax and eat food
good,i am currently working at the gap once a week for four hours and I like the 50% discount that I get for working there. The hardest part of working at the gap is the ability to stand for long periods of time. Gap is a okay workplace
good,Overall it was a great first place to work with amazing opportunities for profession although too many hours were demanded for my personal situation which eventually led to me leaving.
good,It was a great place to work while finishing up my last semester of high school. Considering there were a lot of young people working there sometimes I felt like management was too strict considering our jobs were most often temporary.
good,"In my experience, working at gap factory has been easy, my co-workers are nice. Yet the only problem I have is that I didn't get the hours for the amount of availability I have, I'm available almost 24/7 and I only got 4-8 hours per week. The worst thing was that they put put up a hiring sign like every 2 months."
good,The Gap is a culturally diverse place to work nut the lack of consistency for part-timers may deter those who are reluctant about moving on to a managerial position within the company.
good,"Benefits are usually pretty good but only if you're full-time, schedules are pretty flexible. Great for a part-time job."
good,"It was fast paced at times, there was always something to do. At the beginning of working there it was fun and it was a placed i loved to go to but a couple months later management had changed and it felt like i didn't belong, or didn't want to work there anymore. The reason why i had quit was because of poor management and a lack of action put forth for reasons that are personal. I learned how to deal with a variety of customers, and a way of speaking when trying to give opinions or selling products. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting coworkers that ended up being my closest friends."
good,"A lot of people steal, because the clothing is too expensive to be affordable! The management said they would train me in all sections of the store, but then they only put me in Baby Gap for every single shift I had. Upper management is very pushy to the workers to try to get customers to sign up for the Gap credit card. Other sales associates were generally fun to be around."
good,"It was a great experience, I was with the compnay for ten years and the company."
good,"A typical day at work."
good,If you are fast at what there is to do and know where thing is at then your day will go by fast. You have to be talkative and have a lot of energy to work with the people there.
good,"Deux équipe sont au travail tous les jours. Les associés du stock sont responsable de la marchandise et du changement de promotions. Les associés des ventes sont responsables des achats à la caisse, des salles d'essayages, du bon service à la clientèle dans ces deux environnements et du nettoyage quotidien. "
good,"I learned to cope with high work volume as the management was constantly adding new tasks.  My co-workers constantly changed, so I did not get to know many of them other than the ones who had been there for over twenty years; I truly enjoyed the times I worked with these lifers.  The most difficult part of my job was that the the store was being changed around several times per week, and one of my duties was to make sure items went back to the right spot when customers had the freedom to try on as many items as the wanted.  The most enjoyable part of my job was selling the GAP Card which I was consistently the top in sales for."
good,"Fast and busy environment but relaxed."
good,4 weeks of PTO and 6 holidays definitely make it a better than average place to work.  Management is good depending on which building you work in (DC).  Work life balance is good for supervisors but you will work your tail off during peak season and every day is max OT for four weeks or more during this time.  Benefits are acceptable.  ESPP is nice but 401k match is less than previous employers have offered.  There is a lot of great people here.
good,"To begin with the shifts in a retail job are not long at all, because the hours mostly depended on how well the store was doing on a weekly bases. The first thing that every employee must go through before every shift was the 1 minute meeting. In this 1 minute meeting the manager/team lead would tell the employee the new promotions and sells as well as minimum price goal for day. The best part about the job was the co-workers as well as the managers. I had the privilege to work with some amazing people. My managers were not only promotional but also nice and down to earth. As for my co-workers, all of them seemed way to nice. In my short time at the gap I learned how to properly make a sale using the promotions and discounts offered daily."
good,"Hours were very sparse and inconsistent. Shifts that you did work were also very short."
good,Gap inc is great if you enjoy retail. Its more of a family feel working with co workers and management. Hrs are a plus depending on season
good,"Since it's retail, you're not guaranteed many hours a week, but hard work will get you noticed. The work wasn't too difficult and that people I worked with were great. The only real problem I had was managers that were competent, yet seemingly always in a bad mood. Their negative energy had an adverse effect on staff morale."
good,"Depending on where in the store you were assigned, it was an easy job whether you're folding or ringing up customers. Management was easy going, my co workers were fun and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was probably the constant bending up and down while organizing the store. The most enjoyable was getting to work with the co workers you got along with the best."
good,Typically I would go in and help unload boxes with new merchandise. Then I would help put the merchandise around the store. I learned how the shipping and receiving department worked. Management was nice and the coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job was convincing people to sign up for credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people.
good,"I learned to provide better customer service, learned the store system, learned to be a better team player. there was nothing difficult at the gap. the best part of the job was helping the customer find exactly what they were looking for."
good,This job was fun. We were able to wear the clothing right down to shorts and flip flops.
good,"Hard to advance.  When your shift is over, you leave.  Family friendly, good work/life balance.  Shift flexibility, but pay isn't great."
good,As a sales associate you out out product and deal with customers
good,learning people and understanding how to make completing tasks smooth as well as productive
good,"Es una buena empresa, buen ambiente de trabajo, comprensiva, da oportunidad para trabajar a muchas personas."
good,"Sales work in retail clothing. Selling, folding, and setting up mods to help advertise new and upcoming products. Working with a team to help reach a common goal."
good,"During the time I worked at the Gap Outlet, I learned how to efficiently and quickly execute tasks assigned to me. Most of the time, I ran the fitting room and helped keep one section of the store neat and organized. On days when we were short-staffed, I often ended up keeping multiple store zones organized along with running the fitting room. I had to learn how to balance keeping my zone presentable, running unwanted items back to where they belong, and assisting customers in and out of the fitting room. It is a lot to juggle at once, but I managed to get the hang of it. I did my best to make sure I provided good customer service, and I always made it a goal to make sure my zone was completely organized before I clocked out, whether I helped close the store or not. "
good,"This is a very fast paced job. It was my first official job when I was sixteen years old. I did a lot of multitasking and learning. I went to the register, to the fitting room, stock, floor supervising. It is a neat store and there is always something to do. I worked with great staff and made wonderful friends. A lot of people complained about the lack of hours as they preferred to hire many people at one time than give a fewer crew more hours."
good,"visual associate/sales associate did windows, salesfloor"
good,"Repetitive working hours with the same tasks"
good,"learned alot about customer service here , the people were friendly , at times it got a lil stressful but we worked as a team and made it through"
good,good benefits. great coworkers. the hardest part of the job is balancing customer service with job tasking.
good,"I worked for Gap for 8 years as the Customer Experience Manager. During that time I worked at a variety of locations. My daily duties included opening/closing store, training employees, store's daily/weekly/monthly performance, assisting customers, weekly schedule, interviewing/hiring/training new employees, resolving any customer issues, product management, all while managing payroll."
good,A typical work day depended on if I worked the shipment crew or opening shift. I usually worked a variety of shifts during the school year but favored the shipment crew.
good,"I am constantly greeting new people and helping them with their every need, I learned that you can make someones day with the littlest gesture, my management team is always enthusiastic and full of life making sure all their employees are safe and happy during their shifts, the hardest part of my job would have to be product knowledge seeing as we get new clothing in twice a week every week, and the most enjoyable part of working at the gap is getting to work with my fellow employees who make every shift fun and exciting, I also love meeting new people on a daily basis!"
good,A typical day is folding and restocking merchandise and making sales. You are encouraged to sign customers up for credits and promote sales.
good,I was apart of the leadership team that management the day-to-day warehouse operations. I learned a lot about developing and fostering others in a shared-decision making team environment. Gap was awesome about developing it's leadership team in an attempt to create the right culture to achieve desired productivity results.
good,As I was younger when I worked at the Gap I felt that I was somewhat of an outcast and paid little attention to both by management and other staff members. With questions or when in need of assistance I was regarded with condescension and given little help or encouragement.  
good,"Gap is a good company work with.  The bond between managers and associates is stronger and more genuine than any other retail company I've worked with so far.  As a manager, we are responsible for opening and closing the store, as well as running the business, while we're open.  This involves customer engagement, while ensuring that associates follow our example.  We also focus on tasking our associates to ensure that visual presentations, fitting rooms, and bathrooms are meeting the company standards.  The hardest part of the job is ensuring that we meet/exceed our sales goals everyday.  I truly enjoy working with the team in my store and having a great day, explaining current promotions to our customers, not to mention ensuring they have a great experience in our store."
good,"4 days on 3 off, 6 till 4, it was very repeative work which required good team work in order to hit the targets, i also had to drive the couterbalance fork lift truck,"
good,"As a brand logistics expert I worked primarily with the brand and product side in store. I would delegate tasks and coach the team to meet KPIs. The management style here is great, with an emphasis on work like balance. Very customer and sales focused."
good,Good place to work for recent graduates looking to get their foot in the door.
good,As a store manager each day presented different opportunities and challenges. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to train and develop my people. It was the most rewarding part of my job.
good,"Fast, fun, LONG, Heavy. Learned how to deal with multiple customers at once working in a hectic environment. The team was amazing, give it to Gap for always being WELL diverse!"
good,The staff was friendly but the customers were spoiled and rude.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you don't mind the Warehouse business and duties. I'm a seasonal employee so often I don't get to work a full 8 hours and a few times they have cancelled work all together because it's the slow season. I work from 7am-3pm. Overtime is before the shift and they never call you in for more than two hours of OT so worst (or best) case scenario is two extra hours of work starting at 5am. Although I've never gone in at 5, I've gone in at 6 a few times but usually when that happens we end up leaving early around 1pm. The job itself is easy and the coworkers are all nice people and help you out if you need assistance. It's nearly impossible to make a mistake because all work is done with computer wearable devices. If it paid more per hour I'd consider staying longer. The starting base pay is $10 an hour but you can earn up to $2 more an hour based on your production which is easy to obtain. The supervisors in my department are nice guys who aren't on a power trip. They also encourage growth and development; they post new job openings in house. To become a supervisor they prefer you have a 4 year degree but it's not required, if you have some college credits to your name you can move up. Many of the supervisors were regular associates at one point."
good,Customer Service
good,"I actually enjoyed working at the Gap. I enjoyed dealing with customers, I made good friends and I actually learned a lot while I was there."
good,"Working on the job was a lot of fun, The atmosphere was very cool,calm and collective."
good,"I had the job for a few months before corporate decided to close the store down. Work was great, I had a wonderful manager, and I loved who I worked with."
good,When I first applied at gap I was 16. This was my first job and I was really excited to work there. Kind of nervous because it was my first job. They assured me that they will train me on my first day of work. My first day of work was on Black Friday. I got there they told me to sign in and go on the floor. I told them it was my first day but they still didn’t bother to train me. I wasn’t the only one . There were many others. You kind of have to ask around or figure it out on your own
good,"I work at the cash register and/or floor. I help customers seek the best fit and bring in loyalty to gap as best as I can, but I am not suited for the work position anymore."
good,"The management here was great, they were very lenient with my schedule and I was able to switch up my availability with every new semester/school schedule. "
good,"Worked here on and off and had a great experience with the management. Although, sometimes the customers were difficult to deal with, the job was fair"
good,"The workplace was an enjoyable place to work in terms of colleagues, and the customers were typically perfectly fine. The pay was excellent (for my age at the time, as it paid the full adult minimum wage across all employees, giving me over £7 an hour at the age of 17-18). However, management left a lot to be desired, as despite being perfectly competent managers in terms of the store, their treatment of staff and general management of people versus store-related issues was poor. Whilst not overtly hostile, the managers were obstructive and distant, and unapproachable which ultimately contributed to my decision to resign."
good,"I worked in gap outlet for 2 months I only worked part time 4 hours on a Saturday and 4 hours on a Sunday. The job itself is easy to get the hang of basic retail stuff tidying shop floor, managing the till, fittings room etc. I enjoyed my first couple of shifts there but found the management not very understanding when it comes to mental health problems. I told them I didn’t want over time due to my mental health they didn’t seem to see why even though I had letters from my doctor stating why I couldn’t and then started talking about what I discussed with them in private to other members of staff!  I felt like whenever I was in work when I came across them in the staff room or shop floor  they seemed to be talking to other members of staff about me. I found the store very two faced and management had there favourites. I did meet a few lovely members of staff whilst working there they have since left due to same reasons I left. The company it’s self is great to work for shame managers don’t know what the meaning of confidentiality is."
good,Really enjoyed my coworkers at my location besides the out of touch general manager. Daily goals can be too high and a lot of pressure is put on getting customers to apply for company credit cards which can be frustrating
good,I learned how to work smarter interacting with customers while handling store inventory. The hardest part of the job was working in the fitting rooms while the most enjoyable part was interacting with my employees and customers.
good,"Great work environment, great people on the floor, very understanding management. Very good shifts, never slow always learning something new. A lot of different functions easy that are to learn."
good,"Busy place... apply the saying "" Do want you can and make it work "" To much merchandise on the floor , too many that its hard to organize with the space they have."
good,"I worked at the gap for the summer season, management was not that great and they did not show any care except for the general manager. Most of my coworkers were very nice though."
good,"Won't schedule you if you aren't full time."
good,"I loved the people that I was working with, and grew to be great friends with them, except for the managers. When I left the job, the managers were very unprofessional about it the whole thing. They didn't really give me a lot of feedback as to where I was going wrong, and sometimes just told me I was doing something wrong without any follow up feedback.I could tell they were being very two faced about the whole thing towards the end. "
good,The people is this job are the best part. Working overnight shipments is definitely hard and employees are paid the same rate as day shift - which in my opinion is totally unfair. Pay is definitely a downfall of the job.
good,"My day could have me on the sales floor, cashiering, fitting room, price change, or shipment team. As a Loss Prevention Expert, I evaluate employees daily including management on loss prevent techniques and company policies.  I enjoy the management team and my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers, who believe they are right and think we can do whatever they want us to do to make them happy.  I learned to be extremely flexible, patient, and persistent to fulfill customer inquiries."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the reactions of the costumers when they see how much discount an item has. I love seeing a smile on their face because it lets me know that they had a good experience at the store.
good,My typical day at work depends on the job management gives me for the day. For example I may be put as cashier or floor recovery. Since working for Gap I have learned of some employee rights. Management is fair to all employees and treat us good. The hardest part sometimes is gaining patience with customers. Its not easy to see a customer unfolding while you are folding and trying to organize. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that everyone gets along at work and help each other when the other needs help.
good,"Excellent experience to grow, learn and develop. Challenging and rewarding for Management roles."
good,It was alright but everybody I worked with seemed to be a sort of mindless drone.
good,"cash handling, and making sure to provide customer service to shoppers at all times. Fitting room attendant. Cleaning. Stocking."
good,"A typical day at work changed from day to day, upon being hired I was cross trained in various sub departments of the women's departments so it would be very easy to fill in for anyone at any given time. Coworkers are fun and I've created lasting friendships with many of them."
good,Stock staff arrived at 5 AM to open and sort all boxes delivered from the warehouse. We would stock the sales floor as much as possible and then sort all overflow and put it in the back stock or up stock. We were responsible for displays and excellent customer service once the store opened to the public.
good,"as a sales associate, i did most of my job doing shipment, store maintenance and merchandising. work shifts vary between 3-4 hour shifts and management are fair and friendly."
good,when I join job and learn what to do follow who had experience have any position then know what to do follow their way and find other way then used to faster to become to leader.. Enjoy to help each other as team.
good,A typical day at work was to got to a start up meeting to see what floor you was to pick on. After the meeting you would sign into your RF gun and go to the floor get labels and a trash bag then start picking wherever the RF gun tells you to go. You pick the clothes scan the labels and put them into a tote once the tote is full it goes onto a covert belt and you start all over. I learned that I love to work but I didn't like that it was a really fast pace. we hade to have 18 full tours done by each day. each tour included 140 pieces of clothing and each tote held 25 pieces. I enjoyed that there was a lot  of welcoming people and everyone was very nice. I loved talking to everyone.
good,"Learned customer service and gained cash experience while selling clothing. Management started out well then became mediocre. There wasn't a hard part of the job, however, at times it did get busy, but other times it was not buy at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the vast customers."
good,"I loved the people that I worked with, but the upper management do not care about the employees that work for them. Production is way out of hand. Employees are basically killing themselves to try to make the production. Production use to be realistic, but not anymore."
good,"A typical day consisted of folding, assisting customers and working the resgister. I would also work in the stock room and replenish what was needed on the floor.  During the holiday season i would work 15 hour days which was great. Unfortunately, once January rolled around the hours would be cut. "
good,I'm writing as a consultant who had a 6 month contract that ended at the 6 month mark.  Too bad - I was just getting into a groove.  Most the full timers are nice with an occasional one overtly classist.  The water view from the Old Navy building is lovely.
good,"first off let me start off with saying loss prevention isn't for me. i don't like following people around. i didn't mind stopping career criminals but i didn't like getting teenagers arrested and entering them in a database that doesn't allow then to be employed by any retailers. i did enjoy working with management, training associates and completing all the paperwork. i enjoyed reading and learning all about policies and procedures. a big part of my job was getting cases that's why i wasn't too successful in that aspect but when it came to training and completing the proper paperwork and writing reports i enjoyed it."
good,"I love this job. However, there is not enough opportunity for advancement."
good,"Working in retail it is a fast paced environment. Quality customer care for each patron is a must. Answering questions, finding items and/or locating/ordering merchandise for customers, offering/opening accounts and closing each transaction with confidence. Becoming knowledgeable in marketing strategies, door to floor merchandising, cash handling, loss prevention techniques and a host of other valuable training experiences have been obtained. The management team is supportive and approachable as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job is wanting to accomplish more within the time frame of your shift and the best part is feeling great when a customer is satisfied with their shopping experience."
good,"A lot of folding, cleaning, and helping people to find what they need/ want."
good,"     the days at Gap were fun and cheery for the most part, everyone was extremely good at working together to get the job done, it was motivating and I never felt pressure."
good,"I enjoyed working retail, a typical day would consist of me greeting customers, informing them of all sales, deals, or special offers, as well as working in a fast paced manner when on the floor. Here, I also learned how to work a cash register. I learned how to manage the fitting rooms alone, with a knowledge of what was on the sales floor. My co-workers were very nice and always had a positive attitude. Management was little all over the place and hectic, but never managed to show it when dealing with customers. "
good,My co workers and managers are very friendly. I enjoyed doing signage as well as maintaining a neat store. 
good,"Overall, I enjoy my job when given the time to fully do it. Multitasks and working quickly is a must to get any task accomplished. Other managers must complete their daily tasks as well or else it gets added on to your overall work or daily to do list."
good,"A typical day at GAP would be tidying the shop floor and serving customers on the tills. Working here i ave learned how to give good customer service, how to prevent loss on the shop floor through stock and how to operate the tills. The management is good but with me being at college they dont understand that i cant do a lot of hours as my college work takes priority. My co-workers are amazing, you can easily get along with all of them. the hardest part of the job is trying to sort through the fitting rooms as they take up alot of time trting to clear them. The job on a whole is enjoyable."
good,Its fine as apart time job put wont make this a permant job. The store is always a mess.
good,"wish they would just pay a little more than they do, great place to work with flexibility"
good,i have liked working at the gap but i don't get scheduled enough. i need more than 8 hours a week to get on my feet. Other than that the employees are all very trustworthy and they make my days better.
good,"I am currently employed with the gap for almost 3 years. They have great benefits, the pay is good and you earn a bonuses on top of your check every 2nd week of the month. Co workers are all good people. Managers could work be more considerate to other."
good,"very diverse environment, always meeting new faces/friends. typical night would be ...shipment comes in ..then process the boxes (merchandise), replenish the sales floor and backstock."
good,"Fun place to work at. The people are great. Customers not so much."
good,It is a great place to work Wonderful starter job. Great pay. Lots of community support. Stores run like clock work.  Management can be understanding in helping developing your skills to make sure you get better at your job for upcoming jobs.
good,"Outstanding inventory management"
good,Felt that I was just there to babysit the staff with to many Head managers getting involved.If they Regionals and Area sales managers let the depot mangers run the depot then more results would happen within sales and less staff turn over.
good,"Gap is a good place to get your start on retail, learn quickly on the job, and to get a grip on customer service. Management could be a little better, but is still good."
good,It was understaffed. There was favoritism. work load was a bit much for one person. Did not quite enjoy working there. Some of the supervisors had attitudes
good,Gap mağazasında çalıştığım süre içerinde hep eğlenceli bir çalışma ortamı vardı. mağaza içerisinde yapılan eğitimlerimiz merkez ofiste olan eğitimlerimiz güzel bir şekilde çalışma ortamı oluşmuştur. bunu yanı sıra her zamanda üretken bir çalışma ekibimiz vardı. her zaman  herkez fikirlerini söylerlerdi.
good,"Greet and help customers with a smile while learning different types of culture coming in to the store. Most of my co-workers are very friendly and helpful when needed, my most hardest part of my job is getting a customer to apply for a Gap card."
good,"I worked with some great people and had some great experiences here."
good,"The pay is alright and the job is good but all company cares about is GAP CARD and people get in trouble if they don't have customers get a credit card, which is really hard."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to start with meeting with the supervisor to find out where would be for the shift. Whether it is in fittings, cash, etc. Management is great and are easy to work with. I find that they make work fun. My co-workers are easy going. We are basically one big family. The hardest part about working here is there there are too many people working here and not enough hours to go around. I'd like a job where I can work 15hours a week minimum. And the most enjoyable part about my job is interacting with the customers. I love meeting new people and hope that I can make a great impression so that they will want to come back."
good,Training goes a long way. Promote fast if you know what you are doing.
good,"Great place to have my first retail experience."
good,Working here at first will seem very calm and relaxed and this is for the beginning of the holiday season. After a couple of weeks expect to be on call a lot more as well as meeting higher expectations for selling GAP cards and sales. Like every other job there will be that one bad apple that has poor communication skills managing employees but there is quite a lot of opportunities for growth if you are passionate for retail and if you work hard. The GAP lifestyle is definitely like no other. The hours here are very flexible but depending on your location the availability of hours may vary. Employees and managers look out for one another while working towards company and store expectations. After working for this company you will learn how to be more hands on with customer service as well as being able to sell products daily.
good,"Typical day is answering 40-50 calls a day"
good,Overall work environment was great. However after working here I found out that retail is not something I am extremely interested in. Management and co workers were very bubbly and fun to be around. The hardest part of this job was trying to persuade customers into opening credit cards.
good,"I actually really do like working here, it is just that they do not supply me with the necessary hours to make ends meet, so it is almost impossible to live off of just this job."
good,Very busy always have something to do from the sales floor to back of the store. I have learned a lot from this company and its how to value and appreciate our customers that come in and shop our products. Management is pretty well when you need their help they are there to help us all out. When it comes to co workers its like a big family everybody gets along so well and respect each other as well. Its going to be hard to believe but there is nothing hard about my job that I can not hadle or achieve on time. Getting to meet all type of different people and know that they had great customer service provided to them is a great feeling. 
good,"Very friendly workplace! Coworkers and management create a small family. Discounts were great (6x a year 50% off one item, unlimited 20% discount including gift cards). Loyal customers who are generally in a great mood. "
good,fastpaced a little to much gossip for me job is not realy layed out
good,There are always different things to do at a clothing store depending what time is your shift. I learned everything! From folding to inventory to replanishment and customer service and usuing the cash register. Also visual merchandising which was my personal favorite. Co workers are usually very nice and helpful.
good,"Was a mind opening and active experience, when learning how to deal with customers! Some co-workers were friendly, I learned how to apply myself professionally to my task! The hardest part of the job was busy rush hours and moving quickly to help the customers."
good,- A typical day at work is busy
good,Management lacks compassion
good,Gap was a very fun and producted company with some friendly coworkers.
good,You have to build your way to make good money. Very nice management and staff big wearhouse and nice lunch break time.  Different schedule times and lots of overtime
good,"Great place to start retail career, there is growth for you if you would like to move up within the company. The only down side is there is no work life balance within management."
good,"good hours, sometimes would get tiring working long shifts, 10+ hours per day. good pay as well, and a welcoming and friendly environment to be working in."
good,Gap is a good company to work for however they do have their flaws. The working environment is good for the most part but you do tend to work long hours. The management team is all over the place as none of them are on the same page when it comes to leadership.
good,"Very nice place to learn, nice team spirit. You have time to learn a lot of different tasks ."
good,"Fun company, staff was friendly. I learned a great deal about clothing and work ethic. I also learned how sales work. It was a fun place to work and I learned a lot."
good,"Gap has great educations and clear paths to promotion, but some departments  seem to lack an initiative and innovation."
good,"From Staff Development and Training, to customer concerns and merchandising, you'll be placed in every possible scenario and learn everything you need to be successful in any management position."
good,"I love Gap Inc, but they keep most of their workforce as contractors."
good,"The place was a fun atmostphere to work for for the most time I was there. Plus, the co workers were good there and stuff."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"This job is very easy, I do think there are more bosses then employee and that causes a problem."
good,I'm not into retail but this is a decent place to work. Pay was ok for the position but it's not something you would be able to making a living from. People were nice.
good,Every day you would go into the store to start a shift all the workers were so friendly. The co workers would also bring in food each and every shift for everyone to eat
good,"I was assigned to the children's section in the store. Because this was an area in deep Manhattan, not a lot of people were to it. Business was usually slow and employees instructed me to keep looking busy. I had a problem doing that because I like being active, and  I had to keep refolding the same clothes."
good,Clock in have a group meeting see what is in house and what has to be done get to work as fast as I can. Then work at a steady pace threw out the day.
good,"Each day is kind of the same and you deal with the same issues as well. Its super easy, but not much change as each day comes. I do enjoy the people and some of the customers I work with."
good,People within the workplace are amazing and friendly. The store manager is a great person and easy to get along with. As a full-timer I was on a 24H contract. Well paid. 12H contract for part-timers.
good,start work @ 5am and end @ 9:30am. open new merchandise and replenish sales floor. throw out trash before clocking out. rearrange merchandise on the sales floor as needed and keep the sales floor presentable and professional
good,"This company offered a lot of benefits. We received an employee discount not only at Baby Gap but also, Banana Republic, Gap, & Old Navy too. I really thought that was amazing. I learned a lot about customer service, organizing, and how to coexist with co-workers. This was the first real job I'd say I ever had. The hardest part of the job was the customers, because of the location and it being an ""outlet Baby Gap"" store. We received a lot of different types of races, nothing wrong with that, however, the minority was definitely Caucasian people. My co-workers were nice & professional. I never had any problems with them. Management was very professional as well as understanding too. The most enjoyable part of this job is the great discounts you get at all the different branches of Gap corporation."
good,"Usually 5 am  or 6 am. Always checking pricing ,promotional sales and marketing.Responsible for sign printing and proper placement.Also ordering of Marketing and communicating with Corporate in San Francisco..Always enjoyed training new employees."
good,Answering calls and learning new product everyday. my co workers were very helpful. talking to different customer was the highlight of my day.
good,"I came here through my aunts co-worker her daughter. After awhile, I started to hate it, because one of the assistant managers started to annoy me. She was very rude. I loved two of the managers there, the workers were cool and thats how I met my best friend"
good,"It was nice to work with other young people. It have a good environment and I practiced my English. Also, I learned cashier position and do shipment. They have flexible hours."
good,I hated that the main manger. she gives you the worst hours ever and even schedules you on the days that you cant come in.  she favors a lot of people especially the who open up GAP Cards its not worth working there.
good,"The few months that I've work there as a tem, I enjoyed doing my job. The hours were excellent. Learned a great deal of being a Quality Inspector. Great supervisor and co-workers. Didn't have benefits because the job was temp. The hardest part of the job is the cooling and the heating (warehouse)."
good,If you get hired as a seasonal associate be prepared to work like a dog. You are expected to work throughout the holidays with only Christmas day and new years day off
good,"Support of management was poor, money wasnt worth the promotion but wanted to develop my skills and get as much knowledge as possible to help with future jobs."
good,"This was my very first job and I was thrilled to start working and gain experience with customers and working as a team. However, I was very new to the process and barely got any training. I was taught everything in the span of four hours on my first day. After some time there was noticeable favoritism towards certain employees and  my hours were often cut by way of text. I left the GAP without being told I was let go and never looked back."
good,The company really cares about diversity and their employees. Upper Management supports promoting from within and works hard to cultivate great talent.
good,"Gone through many phases with this company. Countless rotation through management, revolving door sort of work place. Learnt a lot, overall good experience. Time to grow."
good,i helped customers at work made sure my job duties where done. my co workers where friendly. i enjoyed helping and meeting new people. i learned to be patient. my managers were friendly and helpful. nothing was really hard about my job 
good,Working at Gap during the holiday season is fun but very tiring. You are on your feet all the time and folding clothing almost nonstop. The training for using the computers for checkout was inadequate. The people were nice to work with.
good,"great people, relaxed environment during off season, managers are super nice, i would be on cash wrap or be on the floor, I have made a lot of friends working here."
good,"Was not too fond of the job, had a lot of things that could of changed; like the pay and scheduling. Customers were rude but all customers everywhere are rude."
good,It was only a temporary job it was ok I got there at 9 and left at 5 I was only 18 it was a ok job
good,great place for younger crowd. They give great dicounts for family and friends. Whie working there i made allot of connections and many friends
good,I onlhy worked here on a seasonal basis. My co-workers were very nice and made me feel comfortable. Although I must say that I think retail may not be for me.
good,"The team of assistant manager and supervisor was amazing to work with. Upper management were hard to please and slow to acknowledge teams hard work, but gave praise to all GM."
good,Nice place to work. Very slow pace for  LP. Worked in a very slow area. Being in charge of five stores made for a very long and boring day. Working with a partner would have been nice.
good,"Ok place to work, great employee discount, mostly great people. slight mean girl culture that can be a bummer and some management issues that make it less fun of an environment to be a part of at times."
good,We had to keep clothes organized. We had to use plastic guides to fold clothes properly. I ran the register and help customers. We got bonuses for selling certain items in store. I won a very nice and exspensive sweater for selling so many in a month.
good,"Poor management, hard to work in a place with that, hardest part was balancing work life and job life, most enjoyable was with working with people...."
good,Good place to start a new career.  Negatives are that there is no opportunity for advancement and there is little autonomy given to do the job.  Micro management in certain aspects makes it difficult to feel you are making an impact.
good,"I love working here right now but after almost two years, the option of advancing in the workplace doesn't exist. I feel like I'm stuck in the same place and nobody in the company is allowing me to excel."
good,"Good working place, Teaches the value of customer service and dealing with day to day interactions, But wasn't a place where You will grow and manifest."
good,It's okay for a first job for high schoolers. Since I have been with the company for almost 5 years. I felt like I haven't moved up. I see favoritism towards certain people. Picky managers but why I go to work is for the co-workers. I feel like getting gap cards is the need just to get hours for work also.
good,"Working there was fun. There was a variety of different things to learn such as merchandising, handling cash and understanding display charts."
good,"handled items that costumers returned or needed an exchanges and I would process them . Items information would be place and any returns or exchanges would be put on the costumers card. I learned how to process cards ,how to do returns . I enjoyed the people I worked with they mostly stayed to themselves.  Hours and pay great."
good,Management was great and helped you gain knowledge but unfortunately there was not much room to advance. Atmosphere was great and everything was done fairly.
good,"My typical day at work would consist of coming in an hour before our opening time, cleaning, organizing and prepping the store. Replenishing items on the sales floor as well as cleaning the front area of the store. Once the store has opened, the music starts and we open our doors of business to the customers and assist them in the best way possible with a greeting of ""Hello, welcome to Gap Factory Outlet, may i help you find anything in particular today?"", from there on the customer service never stops. I like to try to provide as much help as I can toward our guests, especially during checkout ensuring that they received the most help possible during their visit as well as trying to get them to save a little money as well by providing to them the benefits of our Gap credit card or the benefits of signing up for our email list."
good,Worked at old navy/ management was always cut throat and condescending/ great opportunity for growth/ co-workers are down to earth/ hardest part is constantly having to service customers who are headstrong and arrogant
good,"It is usually an 8 hr day, if you like overtime then this is the place.  I learned many clerical duties, calling supervisors to get things done.  Learned a lot about logistics.  My co-workers were the best part, got to know so many people and their families that I will cherish forever.  The hardest part of the job is coming home tired and having to cook clean and take care of the stuff a mother does on a day to day basis.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being apart of something big."
good,Being a manager at the GAP trains for for so many other opportunities in life. You train your associates to GAP standards to help produce a growing margin. Whether you work on the non-sell team or the customer experience sales team every one must work together keep the store running smoothly.
good,Opening resgistars and new accounts. Selling clothes as well as cleaning and folding merchandise. Management was very good and motivating. There was opportunity for growth within the company. Benefits were afforded to full time employees with paid time off.
good,"The people that work here are great and fun to work with but the customers suck. Retail is very mundane and brain dead work, so it is not that great when it comes to that sense of fulfillment."
good,The sales associates are a very helpful part of the store. I worked with an amazing young sales associates and they made the place come together. They help a lot and are very sweet to be around.
good,"it was a good work place just the management seem like it does not know what they are doing. management switches every now and the. one week u have one manager or supervisor, the next u might have another. varies and is random sometimes. work load is okay. pay is okay"
good,Working here I have the best time of my life my first year. I made  friends and I learned so much. Being that this store is so big you are constantly moving. No time to waste except for when it’s the slow seasons. You can advance in the company but you have got to want it. They notice a hard worker and always be open to different options cause it give you more opportunities. The management is a MESS all the way to the CEO. They feel like they know how your store runs and never spent a day there. They often come in and mess up a good thing and the little guys are made to clean it. It was a good company/store to work for until things started to hit the fan.
good,"Scarico carico merce , smistamento merce, organizazzione merce"
good,"Overall the company is great. I love the merchandise, it's actually my favorite store so I was amped to work there. Only downfall was the management they were very unsupportive and wouldn't work with me when I had a family emergency causing me to put my letter of recognition in. However I would go back just to a different location."
good,"My experience at Gap will be one that I will never forget."
good,"You get to know different people and bond well with them, I enjoyed working setting up the walls and putting out new product before we opened the store."
good,"Hours are not guaranteed, you could have 40 one week and 10 the next week. Managers don't care about employees, they will make you work more then you have to, and constantly push you to get gap cards."
good,"The Gap is an overall enjoyable place of work. A typical day includes inventory management, recovering merchandise, customer service and translating. I learn a lot about different cultures and dialects from the customers that attend the store. My multilingualism is tested every day at work because not everyone speaks English, this is an invaluable asset to my future career goals and education. Management is fine they are not too strict or too overly friendly, they are firm and direct. I love my co-workers because majority of them are college students, so we have a lot of common interests and goals which is refreshing. Hardest part of the job would have to be the fact that the Gap is a small store in size but has a customer volume that rivals that of bigger stores. The volume can sometimes get overwhelming but overall it is manageable. I enjoy communicating with people the most, the different cultures gives me a perspective of life outside of the US. Also, most customers are educated and successful and that gives me the best chance to learn about different lines of work/careers and how to approach my life in terms of benefiting it from the examples and tips that I learn from others; invaluable information I have never found anywhere else."
good,Awesome place to work for the independent teenager or the struggling college student.
good,The first 5years of my GAP life were great because I was an associate. But as a Manager there was no quality of life.
good,"Stayed current on financial goals and priorities set forth by the management team, as it relates to the customer"
good,This was a great environment to work in and all the staff are so lovely and make you feel very welcome. Most of the management team were also really lovely and supportive but the store manager would barely acknowledge you mass majority of the time which made myself and other staff members feel very uncomfortable.
good,"We had vending machines and a couch in the break room. The scheduled breaks were very nice. We were allowed a 15 minute break and a 30 minute break, and we were given food on our breaks occasionally. Management was not the best, as managers were inconsistent and unkind."
good,To be all out honest management there tells you one thing when they mean an absolute Nother the people you work with most of them are nice but others are back stabbers and very disrespectful and rude.
good,"Overall, my experience at Gap was great. It was my first retail job and it taught me the importance of customer service and how to communicate with customers. It pushed me outside my comfort zone and improved my skills. My favorite part of my job was contributing to the visual merchandise and making the displays be more appealing in the store."
good,"fast pace but fun place to work"
good,"I love the Gap's nature of work and workplace, but there's no job security really, and it's more for part-time and temporary work only. Also no work benefits even if you work close to 40 hrs per week."
good,They need to recreate resumes for Management that don't adhere to Company employee equality policies and standards. Overall the onsite sub company needs a lot of work with Employee etiquette and learned work behaviors oppose to personal behaviors. Not the cleanest place to work fun environment but that solely ruins the purchase quality of the Brands name products.
good,"You only get part time hours with no benefits unless you are a manager. You can only be a manager if you are available to come in at 5am and able to work until 12am some times."
good,"Most of my time at the Gap was spent in the fitting rooms, I was never really able to get the time and experience I wanted as a cashier.  The job all around though was well managed and well staffed, I thought the store was run fairly smoothly overall, it just wasn't the job for me.  If I was up at the register more, I probably would have stayed."
good,"working at gap was a decent experience, good place for a first job not a good place to stay for long. management is good depending on which manager you are with"
good,Te employees and customers were great. I did not like that I had to call in for them to give me more hours a week. It might have been because i was only seasonal that they were hardly giving me any days to work.
good,It was a part time job to make some money to pay for college. The schedule was a little crazy since being on call. They call you when they need you to come in to work. It was a nice job but being on call for a job and no fix schedule was hard.
good,"Gap is constantly going through ""transformations"" and with that comes a lack of direction and good management. The change is sometimes good but not always. The work/life balance is the best part and makes working there bearable. A lot of employees have families so family does come first. True product management is lacking. Everything becomes urgent and vision and strategy take a backseat.  You're stuck doing tactile work to appease upper management and less on being innovative and disruptive. Lots and lots of meetings. A good place to start out but overall I don't see much career advancement for product managers."
good,The managers and employees are all very nice. During thanksgiving/Christmas time is when you will get the most hours. Yhe rest of th year you dont get much hours. I had to be honest about that. The people are awesome but the hours suck.
good,"I worked at the Gap Outlet in 125th st in Harlem through referral and part time / seasonal. The overall experience through my first sales associate job was pretty cool at first I think the employees at the time were very nice and welcoming and the atmosphere of the job was at times mostly crazy and face passed but also chill in a sense. "
good,"Access to smart, driven individuals who enjoy the fashion retail industry.  Enjoyable workplace environment in majority of the departments.   Would recommend this as a great place to begin career."
good,"it's great working there the employee are not bad to work with, every day is always a busy day so there will never be a dull moment. management could be better."
good,"You have to understand that I worked for Gap in the Late 90s, so bear with my review."
good,"i enjoyed my time at gap, typical day at work started by the manager giving us a minute, letting us know what was going on in the store at the time and telling us when our breaks were and where we were posistioned for the day"
good,advanced from a sales associate to an assistant manager. i loved the culture that my store was built around but culture is built around management and attitude and the people you hire Since new management its been going down hill.
good,My job was a part time job though it was what i could do while I was a student. The hours and days off or working were so speratic and I had no really set schedule in my life. With that some weeks I barley worked and made no money so it was just to inconsistent for me to continue working there.
good,It was a busy atomsphere and there is alot of merchandise to fold everyday. You are expected to make people apply for credit cards and I did not like that aspect of the job. Low pay and the only nice benefit was the discount.
good,Workers are helpful whenever help is needed. New comers are given extensive training to assure that the job is done as best as possible.
good,Lots of change going on in the company and many teams still figuring out how to manage.  Lots of turnover and therefore many things fall through the cracks and things become disorganized.
good,A day gap was a lot of cleaning which was fine with me . Also help customers with any thing they needed and taking care of fitting rooms .
good,"Working at Gap helped me to not only learn a lot about retail and having a role in effective customer service, but I also was able to learn a lot and develop myself in various different ways. The people that I worked with there were so supportive and helpful, even on the tough days. I really enjoyed my time there, and I was sad to see the store go when we closed in September 2015. Overall, Gap was a good company to work for, and my colleagues made it even better."
good,GAP has given me the experience of being in a retail environment and how to deal with customers. It’s given me the hands on experience I needed to boost my confidence and make me grow as an individual.
good,Managed a team of 20 to 25 employees. Focused on coach and developing staff while providing outstanding service to the customer. Most enjoyable part of my day is working with my co workers and staff. Hardest part of the day was missing sales plan and not attaining goals.
good,"Working here was okay. Acceptable as a part time job for extra money. Some of the management was great, some was difficult to work with."
good,"Worked in the company for 5 years and it was a up and down experience. I found it to be a cool job depending management,  but its fast a pace environment."
good,I enjoyed working for this company as my first job from high school. More so immediately I was entrusted to look afte the entire office whilst management was away on business.
good,"While working here at Gap Outlet, was a good first job to get experience in the retail environment. The typical day at work is either four to eight hours either being in the fitting room, be a cashier or on the sales floor. I have learned a lot in working in retail with management and having different coworkers come and go. With management there were some managers that was good and some not that great. The part that I love is the coworkers and having the experience of working at the mall. The hardest part is long hours but not enough pay for working there."
good,Typical day would be firstly helping customers.Recovery and working on getting new products from the back out on the floor. Setting visuals and changing out the posters. Whole shift is on your feet. Fitting rooms and keeping them clean. Not many hours and they are likely to get cut with no reason due to the stores way of giving an overall set number of hours. District management will not listen to what you say.
good,"good with schedules,"
good,"In any retail environment, there is a company culture and then there the culture created in each individual store by the local managers.  I worked in retail and outlet stores in 2 different states and I have to say the outlet was better.  More hours, more flexibility and more interaction with customers.  Because there are usually 10-12 people per shift, you get to meet EVERYONE you work with and there is less of an individual vibe than in the retail stores.  In the outlet you are never working by yourself because it is one big open space, whereas at the retail, I would be in baby or kids by myself, bored out of my mind when it was dead and unable to interact as much with co workers.  The only complaint I have is that this company is VERY SLOW in promoting within.  They hire externally more so than internally."
good,"Sales Associate & Stock Associate"
good,A typical day consists of receiving shipments and processing them into either our stockroom or on the salesfloor. I learned many visual merchandising techniques and how to strategically place and manipulate products to get the attention of our customers.
good,"I learned a lot about behind the scenes, being as though I was always out front with the customers. I worked the cash register a lot due to the fact I have been in retail for 12 years. I helped my coworkers in different situations and help sell different customers on different  items."
good,I had a seasonal job and I learned that helping people of other cultures can be satisfying.
good,loved the job itself and the people I worked with.  Liked working with all the customers.  Just wish it paid a little more and you were guaranteed more hours.  Hardest part about that job was selling the Gap credit cards and the less you sell the less hours you get.  They don't tell you that in your interview.
good,The Gap was the perfect job right out of high school. It gave great balance for managing College life and Work Life. The staff was great to work with and the customers were apprecitive for great assistance.
good,"While working at Gap I was able to learn and grow in the retail environment. I went from a regular sales associate to helping out with signage, shipment and fixture moves for new products. By the time I decided to leave I was the Visual Specialist. I was in charge of changing the window displays along with creating the in-store visuals. Making sure the store was presentable and fashionable at all times."
good,Every day is something different. There is a lot of positives because you are always interacting with customers & you are constantly busy. You are part of a company that is iconic and revolutionary in the fashion industry.
good,"A typical work day was working on the cash register or greeting customers at the front entrance. I learned that even in a declining economy, there's a way to make everyone happy. Management was very pleasant and encouraging. They made me feel like I was an important asset to their company. My co-workers were easy to get along with helpful. There was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people that I helped make a purchase and feel good about it."
good,"My first day was orientation, everything, they were nice to me, they were introduced to me, making the invoices, was going home at 4pm"
good,"I worked for old navy under the Gap INC company and customer service is what its all about. This company focuses on the customers satisfaction and it was great to work for a company that allowed me to be a part of that. although i was only supposed to be seasonal, i was offered to stay for a year so i was happy to comply!"
good,"Great people to work with overall, but every store is different, some are nicer than others (I have worked in 3 permanently, another 6 temporarily). In general slightly underpaid, and it's high street retail so nothing is secure in the sector."
good,"They don't offer full time opportunities. "
good,A team work based environment with daily goals to hit. Also a very friendly place to work along with the great employee discounts! Along with a flexible schedule.
good,"I work as a part-timer for Gap companies. I started at Banana Republic, then I went to Banana Factory and now I am at Gap. I love helping people get dressed for that 1st interview or find the right gift. I have been there for 3+ yrs. I wish they would offer part-timers the opportunity to pay into medical benefits, but sadly they don't. I wish they would let part-timers accrue paid time off like at least 1 day a year for each year, but they don't. I have had several Managers and some have been great and others not so much."
good,"Very physical, very demanding on time and schedule.    Requires overtime, in excessive amounts in order to be successful.   High turnover rates, Human Resources was amazing."
good,Fun and productive work place. Hardest part of the job are midnight shifts. Workplace culture is very diverse. Management are nice but very demanding.
good,A typical day would be cashiering or folding clothes. I learned how to manage my time effectively and be more flexible. The management wasn't the best at the time i felt as if one of the managers never really paye attention to me.
good,"Not a big fan of retail but I stayed because I was in need of the money, loved the interaction with the customers both at the register and working in the fitting rooms. what I didn't really like was the way the management went on within the building, the way they scheduled people and lack of effort within the management team."
good,"+ευχάριστο εργασιακό περιβάλλον"
good,The gap was a great place to work at. The discounts were the best and the staff was fun to work with. The environment was very pleasant and cozy. I loved all the latest fashions and learned a lot about clothing.
good,"fun work place horrendous workload, business has lost its way in the last 12 months with no clear structure on promos , replenishment or people with an ever increasing workload"
good,Overall I enjoyed working for Gap.  At times I felt unfairly looked over for advancement opportunities.  I was with the company 9 years and would have to help train new managers all the time while I remained part-time.  The management staff was very selective in who they promoted.
good,Great place to work. Easy work. Standard Retail Job. Very much wants your opinion on the clothes. You will be the first to try out the clothes and buy the clothes. They encourage it as we are basically brand ambassadors.
good,"The best part about the job is the dress code. You can be as comfy or as professional as you want."
good,Working at old navy changes on a regular basis. As a Part time employee hours can range from 4 or 8 up to 25/30 depending on the time of year and needs of the store. Management is overworked and stressed with not enough employees at their disposal. Moving up is hard as people tend to stay for a long time.
good,"I had the pleasure of working at all of the locations in Arizona. This company is great to work for, they are very loyal to their employees. The workplace is fun and collaborative."
good,The hours were very long and tiring. I learned social and communication skills. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the disrespectful customers and cleaning the mess they would make sometimes. The most enjoyable part was the discounts on clothing I would get.
good,"A day of work was usually hectic, which is good because it gets the day going. You have to be able to be moving in fast pace when it gets very busy and also know how to keep yourself calm. Overall, the environment was pretty good but the pay and benefits were not great for a part-timer and it is pretty hard to become a full-time employee, unless you are a manager."
good,"The general manager compared to my other two retail jobs was a little sub par, but the job isn't very difficult and there is always something to do to occupy you time- whether its refolding clothing or putting go backs up."
good,"It was a good place to work while I was in college. Flexible hours, Understanding managers. I made some of my closest friends here."
good,"Great environment fun workers, refreshing team work great customers, schedule is pretty consistent and moderate individual customer goals"
good,"usually busy from Monday - Saturday. Sundays  may be a little quite."
good,I enjoyed working with Gap and learning everything that I could to be prepared to sell the company and its backstory with many that would ask me how it was to work for them. Laid back environment and the staff was very knowledgeable and welcoming.
good,"Gap was the reason I have the skills I do today, and why I have been successful in my career.  I was with the company for a very long time, and learned a great deal from memorable leaders.  The company is always looking out for the best for their employees, even through some harder times, the culture still maintained."
good,Was a seasonal worker. Was never told when their holiday season staff were going to be let go. Was never officially let go. All the seasonal workers just stop getting scheduled. It was unprofessional and a surprise because they didn't give us a warning so we could get another job. It was a fun place to work. You were able to kid around with coworkers. I learned some very valuable skills
good,Productive workplace that was very goal-oriented and sales driven.  High pressure to reach sales numbers weekly.  Enjoyable atmosphere with fellow employees.
good,"Nell' arco di tempo che ho lavorato come cameriere per questa azienda mi sono trovato abbastanza bene, apparte il fatto di fare 9/10 ore al giorno e un massimo di 15/20 minuti di pausa pranzo."
good,"Its a standard retail job. Nothing special. I learned how to deal with pesky customers, and co-workers. The management team is usefully on top of their game. The co-workers make going into each shift fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job has to be getting a shift scheduled. Many of the employee's complain about only receiving a maximum of one shift per week. (This is very location specific) The most enjoyable part is, interacting with the customers to help them with what they need."
good,"I managed two employees while supporting an independent free standing store with approximately 350 employees which grew to over 400 during the holidays. I learned that there are several people throughout the bay area that are excellent workers, very conscientious who make below the poverty threshold. This position was very complex as I was not only expected to handle HR but I was also supposed to help manage the floor as a sales manager. While I have strong HR knowledge, I needed to learn both a new industry and new culture. I was also not used to working at a company where the majority of the employees were non-exempt. When I expressed the need for support to my manager it was suggested I work with my two co-workers in CA.  Unfortunately neither one of them ever returned my calls. I was disappointed as my manager then told me to reach out to my counterpart in Chicago versus having her CA team support me."
good,"The typical day at work varies from slow to fast, I learned to give great customer service. The management could have been better but over all it was good. Co workers were up friendly. The job itself wasn't hard, there was always someone around in case something came up. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a customer really appreciated all the help you gave them."
good,Working at Gap for almost 4 years allowed me to hone my skills in customer service as well as being a leader. I had a tremendous amount of fun leading my team on making our sales goal for the day/week. I highly enjoyed working with my team because we became a big family. I think the hardest part of the job for me was the lack of professionalism among the upper management team. I just did my job as best as possible and enjoyed my time with the company.
good,great place to work pack clothes in a bag and send them down the line
good,I enjoy working for this brand. The work life balance is fair for the industry and the opportunity for advancement is high.
good,Had a good time working for this company. Met great people and gained a good connection with them. Everyone helped each other out as a team.
good,"Every day is busy and keeping up with changes can consume a good portion of most workdays.  Just when you think all the loose ends are tie up, here come more changes.  Would be great if management can be more supportive.  Other than that, Gap Inc. is a great place to work.  Generous compensations and benefits.  Having ROWE is another great benefit."
good,"Great people you meet, whether customers or associates. Just so unpredictable. One week you're over worked next week you're only getting 4 hrs a week."
good,"Good environment"
good,My co-workers were great itwas just some managers on the management team that didn't know how to talk to their employees like adults.
good,"I love working in a fast paced enviorment, Ive learned alot as dealing with people, handling the cash rep and growing as one."
good,maintained presentable floor displays. displayed customer service to the general public.
good,"Lot's of folding"
good,"While working there for almost four years, it was hard to get along with certain managers who did not respect the associates hired.  The environment was extremely hostile during the holidays when no one was receiving hours to work, except the brand new hires (who usually did not stay long because of one specific manager)."
good,Loved working in the fast lane in Aurora at the outlet. The co workers were great and friendly. Management another story. Started out good but as time went on the training slacked and I was advised to find stuff out on my own and finish training while being the MOD. Which made it very difficult and when brought to the attention of the other managers they pointed fingers at one an other instead of coming together as a team. Which would of allowed time to complete training and not put all the pressure on store manager.
good,"Working at the GAP teaches you how to deal with all kinds of personalities and attitudes. Teaches you patience and customer service and how to neatly fold your clothes (lol). You learn how to multitask with customers and fellow employees."
good,"At 4: 45 am I would be ready to start my work day, I would begin by sorting the different price points which i would need in order to accurately price merchandise. Operating the Mobile POS software was the most important thing I learned while working for this employer. Often, technicalities would make things difficult, which would result in rebooting the system and establishing a connection. Managment showed intrest in revenue of the company but little, attention to employees and their actions. The hardest part of being employed by Gap was the lack of advancement managment would grant to employees."
good,"Provide previous day production to all employees and discuss with those not meeting production what obstacles they have so I can offer suggestions, recommendations and/or more training. "
good,"This job taught me a lot about advancement through hard work and essentially how the workforce operates. Co-workers were from a wide variety of backgrounds, but the management left a bit to be desired."
good,I think this was one of the better jobs I had. They gave you as many hours as you needed. They worked with you around school. The staff were nice. And they pay you ok for being in retail. 
good,"I really did not like this job at all because the manager tried to compare me to the other workers who had been working there for a lot longer than I had, and it was only my first job.  My co-workers were awesome though, very helpful and friendly."
good,"I did picking, packing, shipping and returns. I enjoyed the fast pace work enviroment. It was a good place to work."
good,"Worked in the warehouse and and on the shop floor, Put the cloths in order they should be in. learnt  to interact with the customers in a friendly way and help them when required to do so. The management was ok but they weren't that effective."
good,I work here part time. The employee discounts are great! There is a good management team at this location!
good,"visual merchandising is fun, very busy but challenging, learned visual standards, running the sales floor, hours are really early some overnights"
good,"If your young and want to get your foot into the retail industry,the gap outlet is a good start."
good,The work environment is great. The job is fun and engaging. However the problem I've come to realize is that you won't usually get more than 10 hours/week.

good,A lot of hard work and long hours. management is great. hardest part is the hours.
good,Unpacking and placement of stock onto store shelves. I learned how to follow guidelines on the placement of merchandise. The management were a great group of people. My coworkers were some great people. Had to start work early in the morning. Getting to look at the new clothes that came into the store.
good,"excellent, gained experience on sales floors, worked hand in hand ew\with customers on fashion advice and prefrence"
good,"I worked at the flag ship location at The Grove. I was exposed to visual merchandising which I loved...it was also the job that showed me that retail wasnt really my ""thing""."
good,there was a fun retail store to work at. sold amazing cloths the employees were always nice and the managers were great
good,"Maintained knowledge of current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, provided customer assistance, displayed and arranged merchandise to promote sales, took inventory, reordered or replenished merchandise"
good,I learned a lot from the company on how to deal with differnet types people in a fast pace environment always experience giving great customer service no matter the situation.
good,"*opens cash registers, greet customers, fold clothes, receive merchandise, and stock."
good,"Typical work day included customer contact, replenishment. For each shift worked management would communicate with each individual of any promotions, or sales on merchandise. Also, were made aware of sales and credit card goals for each day. Co-workers were very easy to get along with, it was a small store so everyone got along and communicated well. The hardest part of the job was opening credit cards. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know each customer, gaining their trust, and loyalty."
good,"Culture is the environment that surrounds us all the time. A workplace culture is the shared values, belief systems, attitudes and the set of assumptions that people in a workplace share. This is shaped by individual upbringing, social and cultural context. In a workplace, however, the leadership and the strategic organizational directions and management influence the workplace culture to a huge extent. A positive workplace cultur"
good,I have enjoyed my time working at Gap so much. I went from a sales associate to a keyholder in just the matter of months and it has helped my leadership skills tremendously.
good,"a typical day would include checking in with the boss to see what the main goal is for the day and then recover the different parts of the store, also making sure to watch the register to help any customers."
good,"Pay great "
good,"The company itself is really unorganized and needs work in the communication department between managers, supervisors, and employees. However the job is super easy and very well paid for what you are doing, with great benefits. Overall I really enjoyed working here."
good,"Management where very temperamental at times."
good,the customers are the worst but with a good team behind you it is a fun place to work part time or seasonally! I learned how a corporate retail store usually runs day to day.
good,"Compañía proyectada al servicio al cliente, dirige al crecimiento de sus empleados al desarrollo de sus habilidades."
good,"I enjoyed my experience working as a sales associate at Gap. I worked at a Gap Outlet in the Chicagoland area, where a lot of international travelers came to shop."
good,This company is great if you want to work in a very fast pace environment. But the company takes care of each and employees . It has plenty of growth opportunities as well.
good,Good job if you're going to school and looking for extra income. Has slow and fast paced seasons like any other retail job. Not a good job if you intend to grow within the company in my opinion. Raises are horrible.
good,no two days are the same and its a bit up and down in there as staff are concerned its all agency and people are used as and when needed so if you want stability its not for you
good,The management at Gap Outlet Waikele is the best. One of the best management teams I have worked with. Everyone is really nice and helpful. The team is always there to help each other and to help the customers.
good,The adult store was great. A family simply put. I did everything from cashier to shipment and learned a lot there. Once i was moved to the kids store is when i started having issues. The manager was terrible. There was never anything to do and you’d get yelled at for no reason. I liked the job but the management was terrible.
good,"It's been an overall good learning experience, especially coming from a smaller company. There are opportunities to network as there's a lot of cross-functional partnerships. Depending which team/brand you're on will determine your work/life balance. Expectations are high, but leadership doesn't always tell you what they want, so it can be a guessing game."
good,"GAP was nice to work for. however there was no oppertunities for progression or even discussions of a possiblity down the line. "
good,equality has been strong with Gap Inc. since 1969.  The company has a comfortable work place.  Since they are a jean company the attire is mainly t-shirts and jeans.  Customer service and loyalty are key elements to this company.  Development of improving on everyone's individual strengths is key for this company.
good,Heavy customer service focus with suggestive selling and heavy credit card focus on opening new accounts. Great atmosphere and great company to work for.
good,I learned a lot about how to communicate to customers and give them what they need. I learned how to also offer and entice customers to join our loyalty programs (brand credit cards/rewards program). The managers and workers all get along and work together well.
good,I enjoyed working there but came to the realization that Job security is literally non-existent. The people there that work are very kind and easy to get along with.
good,It is very fun to work here. The coworkers are very friendly and energetic which makes it even more fun. It is a very competitive job I do have to say. Gap cards are a huge part of the job so really work for that.
good,Had fun working with others and experience was great nice people and great customers and service. Would recommend this job to anybody who’s looking to jumpstart there retail experience.
good,"The job was a good job, along with the interaction with the people. There was no disrespect from management. Encouraging when needed. Help each other while working."
good,working retail is what it is. as an employee they have many flexible shifts and great discounts. its a fast passed work place and a whole lot of personality.
good,working at the Gap was a great experience. I loved going downtown and seeing different types of people. great location and fast-paced. My manager was very nice.
good,"Gap is a fun workplace to be in at times with a great team of people around you, however there can sometime be tricky customers to deal with which makes the job difficult occasionally."
good,"You have to push credit cards. If you don't get customers to take out credit cards, you don't get scheduled for any hours. How are you supposed to get cards when your'e not scheduled for any hours?"
good,"A typical day entailed dispatching emergency work orders, then following up on all open work orders under my own function. There is much interaction between myself and my peers, as we work together to ensure our stores are taken care of in a timely manner. There is a team dynamic that I have not experienced anywhere else and have learned a lot while working at Gap Inc. I love my job at Gap Inc and would like to work at a place that values its employees."
good,"It is a good place to work.I have learned time management and punctuality from this job. Management was good, always listen your problems.Hardest part of the job to climb the ladder for long time"
good,Culture is upbeat.  Loved having different tasks every day that were always changing.  Enjoyed training and developing associates.  Most enjoyed seeing sell through of merchandise based on displays and floor sets.
good,"it was nice but we were always super busy. The management team was really supportive, and my coworkers were always friendly. It was a really nice experience. I learned a lot."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with the gap. The employees and management were very friendly and helpful for my first job. However when the store went to close an error happened within management and transferring employees. After being told I would be transferred a few days later I was told it was too late. Despite that, I was thankful for the opportunity with the company."
good,"Scheduling not as expected. i.e hours per work week."
good,"The coworkers were friendly and the environment was fast paced. But, there was a lot of mismanagement, and a lack of consistent hours. There was often a lack of structure."
good,Clean environment and helpful staff available. They have a lot of temporary work so if you need a job for the season it's a good place to start at. They do keep some people permanently if you are aiming to grow in the company.
good,Enjoyed the staff and learned in the work environment. from start to finish it was an interesting course that I'm personally glad to have experienced it.
good,"great company to work for out of college but have to like working in a mall and seldom seeing daylight during the winter season. go to work in dark, and leave in dark."
good,"I was lucky to work with a great mangement team my first few years."
good,"Very busy environment, due to the location, never a quiet day. Many USA visits so always needed to make sure the shop was tidy and organized. 95% of shop floor folded which meant that you constantly needed to refold items once customers touched the clothes ."
good,Be sure what you want to do and go for it. Be vocal and certain. Shine bright and work on your opportunities. Work hard and stand out. Know what your doing.
good,Gap is a great place to work. It is a mix between fast paced and slow with the different times of the year. The employees are close knit and possess great customer service.
good,okay place if youre a manager. couldn't make a living here. only given part time. low wages. no benefits. good place for a young kid to start his or her career
good,"Customers were rude at times, pay was minimum wage and they gave generous hours. Management was really considerate, its just the work itself was very boring and required repetitive tasks and standing/walking around the store."
good,constantly folding clothes and helping customers around the store thats pretty much it other than being a cashier and working the fitting room which is probably one of the easy jobs unless theirs a lot of clothes piling up
good,Working at GAP was a great experience. As being one of my first jobs it definitely was a learning experience. I was apart of the morning Brand team and was able to work on my skills as merchandising.
good,"Fine environment fine workers okay management. Merchandising was a great section to work with. The hours were great at times. "
good,"one of my best jobs, everyday is different and you get to learn on the job in a fast paced environment - plenty of opportunity to progress and experiment in different areas retail has to offer."
good,I learned how to appropriately fold and hang clothes as well as How to Properly Color coordinate By the ROYGBIV code. Worked well with the Customers. Thank You
good,"Very demanding job. high expectations. hours put in never seemed to be enough. The pay did not reflect the amount of hours, work, and dedication that was put into the position."
good,Overall a tad unorganized but it was quite busy. I would not hold it against them. If I were to offer any tips that would be to stock up the shelves more and make sure inventory has been delivered on time the night before a big sale.
good,"A typical day of work would start out with me going to the computer in the back room to clock in for my shift. Then, I would find an LOD or manager so they could give me my one minute which is a run down of how the day is going to go, what the sales plan and goals are, and how much money we are making. After that, I would go to whatever section I was told to go to recover, or the register if I was the cashier that day. Most of the day I would go back and forth from the register to the sales floor, recovering and helping customers, and greeting them at the door. Towards the end of the night, we would finish up the recovery as soon as possible, run the go backs (returns and items in the fitting room). Then if we were getting shipment, we would bring out the tables, set up the rolling racks, bakers racks, and bring out the carts, box cutters, and garbages bages for the people to come in the morning to finish shipment. "
good,"Starting at 5 in the morning opening boxes, sorting clothing/merchandise and putting them in assigned places or reorganizing to display new product just received."
good,"Worked here in high school and we got things DONE! Great managers, and flexible hours around school.  The managers set the tone and taught me a lot.  Now, I try to manage in a similar fashion."
good,Amazing and passionate team to work with. I love the leaders that I work with. The Gap has come a long way and it continues to grow and develop as a brand leader
good,"I liked the GAP, though you are set up to lose your job if you don’t plan a year in advance. You are given a plan where you cannot ever be one minute late. If so, you begin to reduce the amount of days you have left. You have 16 days total and you can turn those 16 days into a year provided you aren’t one minute late more than 16 times in a year. Factory life guys, nothing special, but the people are nice to work alongside after the cattiness is set aside. Everything is heavy except picking and packing. Picking is actually racing. Packers aren’t allowed to talk but the incentive is more pay. The benefits are worth it, too. I would work there again, but really I would like to do much better. PS the pay is 13.50 plus incentives"
good,its an ok place to work needs to offer more opportunities and better pay for work being done. it is located in groveport ohio. management could be better and they could show more appreciation to workers.
good,this job isn't too bad for a first job. not really labor intensive. the overall work atmosphere is kind of laid back. the employees are fairly nice...
good,The hours are flexible and the employees are great for the most part.  The store I worked in was extremely busy and pretty much stayed messy so the cleanup was tedious and exhausting but the pay is fair and the management is encouraging and supportive.
good,"If you have fun co workers it can be a very fun work place. "
good,I enjoyed working here. The staff is excellent. Tere is a great atmosphere there. Everyone is friendly and hardworking. The work is great too and allows me to be creative.
good,Overall my experience of GAP was positive.  The company offers room and opportunities for advancement.  The retail environment was really fun and the discounts were great.
good,Gap is really good about rewarding those who work very hard...through promotions and discounts.  Enjoyed my time with Gap Inc and would love to go back.
good,While working her during the week of the work experience from Armadale Academy i got to interact with a wide range of customers and be in a fast paced environment while restocking the shelves and keeping the shop floor clean and tidy and risk free.
good,"Okay place to work, "
good,"i worked loss prevention at 3 different locations. one was very awesome, would give it 5 starts. Another was okay. and the other one is not that great. So don't let my review stop you from applying here, just depends where you go"
good,The people I work with was awesome. I had couple of issue with the way supervisors were treating other ethnic groups but I loved working at the GAP. there's still room for improvement
good,"I worked on the kids/baby floor at Gap Bay and Bloor. My responsibilities varied from greeting customers as they entered the store and helping them find items they need. I worked as a cashier as well and checked customers out, as well as making sure all the clothing displays were neat. There was always a company supervisor available for contact on the floor. I learned to adjust to situations in which the customer is displeased and that a customer truly appreciates the help of a sales associate offering their opinion on a clothing item."
good,"I only worked here for seasonal/part time/temporary position. Simply hired to help with the holiday rush. Work was not hard, good start or introduction to the job force."
good,I had to greet and assist the customers. I also had to watch over the store and worked the cash register from time to time. I worked the baby and kids departments.
good,"GAP is moderate to heavy labor, but it is a fairly simple job. I enjoyed working there, but it was a temporary job. It is very fast pace and you turn it into a game trying to compete with your co-workers to get a better production than them. It is a very layed-back environment."
good,"Gap is a really nice company to work for. I recommend anybody who wants to work in retail start at either GAP, Old Navy, or Banana Republic considering they are the same company. They offer great discounts and there are a variety of different people you get to meet and work with."
good,"Empresa de prestação de serviços, boa para se começar a carreira e aprender um pouco de cada subsistema de RH na prestação de serviços para clientes de diferentes ramos de atuação."
good,"helped customers finding size in clothing, style and color. Maintain the store  visual prepare up to new merchandise. Met goals and helped do pay roll."
good,"I've been with Gap for a little over 4 years. I have worked in several different stores across the US, and have always had a wonderful experience. I have zero complaints."
good,The work place is hard and productive as a job or task will always continue from working on the shop floor to the stock room. The team that you work with either motivate and show you how to get better on the other hand some colleagues did not help you as much as others.
good,"I learned more about customer service.  The job taught me how to interact with customers and how to better their shopping experience.  I always tried to make customers enjoy their shopping and find everything they were looking for.  Everyone I worked with would help you in any way you needed help.  They were so polite and would help you feel comfortable.  I would say the hardest part of the job was remembering to ask the customer everything at checkout.  For example, if they had a Gap card, an email address, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to communicate with others and making customers happy."
good,"I loved working at the Gap, Inc. They have a supportive executive team and Leadership that truly takes you in as a partner in business."
good,"Gap is an ever-changing fast pace environment. Your days a filled with planning and quite a bit of reaction to the business, the people and leadership."
good,"Gap is an ever-changing fast pace environment. Your days a filled with planning and quite a bit of reaction to the business, the people and leadership."
good,"Gap is an ever-changing fast pace environment. Your days a filled with planning and quite a bit of reaction to the business, the people and leadership."
good,"i enjoyed working here, the richmond branch. manager and co-workers were friendlly and the targets were achievable. i worked for a  full year in the same store"
good,"I worked for the company for a short amount of time. There were two different managers, one who was nice and willing to help and then the other manager who was mean and made it my business to know she controlled my hours and was the reason i jad a job."
good,"A day is always same but  days r good some days are bad,"
good,Over the 14 years I was with the company i enjoyed the culture and all my peers and teams I got to work with. Leaders changed a little to often and you were always starting over. On 24/7 and keeping up with the changes where challenging.
good,I worked there for a year and had a good experience in shipment mostly. There were friendly coworkers and good hours. management was good and it was stress free.
good,I organized clothes and kept the store clean and safe. I also greeted customers and learned how to satisfy them. My coworkers were great and enthusiastic. They helped me with the understanding of how customers communicate and how I should approach an individual.
good,"Always looked forward to opening or closing the store, engaging with employees and specially customers. The growth opportunity didn't come easy if you were not in the know."
good,Amazing opportunity for those who wish to work. First job i couldn't have asked for more. Only issue was not getting enough hours and all my dedication to Gap didn't seem to pay off for me
good,GAP fosters a competitive environment for its employees which both grows sales and motivates staff to improve. The management puts energy into coaching and encouragement and it shows.
good,Really fun workplace. Very strong work family feel. Something new everyday. The schedule was the only part that I didn't like.
good,"I have gain great skills like working with irate customers on the escalation line, understanding creidt card fraud, and building relationships with my team."
good,if you can get pass the politics and do your job its a great place to work if not uh oh the problems roll in other than that its a very nice
good,"I have connected with my job  locations, where I then discuss current events, potential stories, and readability improvements for  job"
good,The Gap encountered thousands of customers per day in which the environment was very busy but very managable. Managment was always there to support all of its employees in times of need.
good,GAP est reconnu pour son management et j'ai pu bénéficier de leur formation afin de m'améliorer dans ce domaine
good,enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience on merchandising. friendly competitions and just selling the brand.
good,"ok place to work, staff was ok, employees were good to work with. Hours were good. had an exercise spot in the workplace. You are able to work early morning or later in the day and they have part time and full time employment."
good,There is always something to do in the stores. No downtime but often not enough time to complete tasks as needed. Closing shifts are not reliable. You stay in the store until you're finished which could be well after you're scheduled to go home.
good,"A typical day being a Stock Associate, is you get right to work. Shift starts regularly at 9pm (store closing) and you are required to lift, push, pull, sort out boxes of product and begin the sorting and folding of the shipment.  The hours can be long but the people you have on your team makes a big difference. Hours are steady especially through the hoidays. My manager was great. The hardest part of the job is that it is very repetitive so make sure you are prepared for that. Overall, I had a good experience working at Gap Inc."
good,Positive work environment with friendly staff and management. Great customer service is a huge focus which is rewarded when recognized.
good,"Responsible for assisting customers and maintaining outstanding customer service. Provided administrative support to managers, team leads, and sales associates."
good,This store displays a very fast paced environment. Employees are very friendly and also helpful when you need anything.
good,gap outlet was a fun place to grow an interact with customers. learning different ways to make it work for me and the company to sell the product.
good,"I enjoyed working there. They gave good hours and I was paid well. The customers that came in were mostly tourists since the store was located at an outlet mall about 15 minutes up the road from a fairly popular state beach destination, so they were all very friendly. Overall enjoyable place to work."
good,"Great work place, supportive staff, great experience learnt how to deal and interact with different people from different backgrounds and cultures"
good,This is a place for high school and college students when they need a job to work through school. Its fun sometimes and is really customer oriented.
good,What I took away the most with Gap is the leadership practices. I had excellent managers that taught me how to become a successful manager.
good,"When i worked there, it was always interesting. they had great management and a free dress code. the managers showed a lot of appreciation towards the employees"
good,"Gap Inc. has a great corporate culture. If you can get on a team that allows working remote options that is key. "
good,"It has been an honor to have been a part of a family oriented company with a long history of community service for over 15 years.  This company believes in inclusion for everyone and allows people to 'be who they are' and show their personality through fashion.  A typical day at work includes developing talent, delighting customers with the best product and service and always striving for excellence to deliver positive results.  Learning something new every day is the norm, yet I can also draw upon my vast experience in customer relationship management and I can make visual merchandising decisions to increase sales and shift units.   Creativity and hard work is applauded and rewarded.  Employees aren't just coworkers, but friends and family.  I've had the honor to see the founders in person years ago.  What rockstars they were, and how inspiring!  I was mesmerized by the passion and love for the brand they built."
good,if you are looking to make a change and not go to college and work in a very fun and professional environment this is the job for yo u
good,Truly enjoyed working with parents and their children to create outfits for special events. The hardest part of the job was trying to convince a 5 year old to wear what his mommy wants him to wear! Working at Kids Gap has taught me patience and I have also mastered the art of multitasking.
good,"The GM is easy to get along with and holds people accountable for their work.  Some of the other managers are not so great at their job.  Other sales associates tend to be younger and do not take work that seriously, which leads to those that do picking up the slack,  Deadlines set for sales associates to complete tasks seems a little ridiculous since the technology and processes are not 100% up to date."
good,love working here! everyone gets along and has fun. Gap Inc offers so many different opportunities to advance. I just wish there was more full time positions available.
good,Worked as a typically Sales Associate within the company. I enjoyed every single day I worked. I enjoyed all of the upper management and my co-workers. We always had fun.
good,i enjoyed working with this company. learned a lot of important scales to began my field. I love working for this company because you do something different every day.
good,I learned a lot at this company but as of growing that is a little difficult due to the fact the managers I worked with didn't really acknowledge my hard work and efforts
good,Store was positive and productive. Both customers and employees were met with professionalism and open ears from in-store management. Good development opportunities as well as on-trend with current political and social issues.
good,Gap was a good company to work for.  I learned about merchandising and customer servicing while practicing sales techniques.  It is fast paced and competitive but a wonderful first job experience.
good,One of the best places I have had the priviledge to work.Very supportive staff and management. You are constantly busy with all kinds of people wanting to purchase product and talking to a huge variety of individuals. Great career choice for anyone who loves retail!
good,Working at the Gap was pretty nice. I'm usually at work folding clothes in a certain section or in the fitting on the men's floor. At times I'd also get on the cash register and help customers with what they're shopping for and possibly talk then into buying more if possible. My co-workers were like family and even some of my managers were like brothers and sisters to me. They made harsh things customers do seem minuscule. The most difficult part of working there was talking with customers who didn't understand or read special terms during a promotions or sales. I learned how to appreciate style and accept others despite any differences while working at Gap because everyone had their own style and everybody was so wonderfully diverse.
good,"fun place to work, noisy all the time. music selection was hip and upbeat, cashier duties were way too demanding. Management played favorites, but the pay was decent."
good,"Upbeat atmosphere"
good,"Taking and monitoring inbound calls for online sales and quality control. All shift duties including running the floor, group motivation, responsibility in section productivity and heavy multi-tasking dealing with high stress level situations."
good,"Great place to learn and increase skills. Small opportunity for advancement due to long tenure at the senior leadership level. Strong focus on ethics, culture and change management. All brands (old navy, banana republic, etc) do well except for Gap Brand, where a massive shift in culture and execution are needed after years of flat and declining sales. Management can be inconsistent across divisions and functions but given scale that is not surprising."
good,"I worked in the Gap at 46th street in NYC.  It was pretty cool.  It's fast paced but everyone is fun to work with.  The only problem was the pressure to get the customers to apply for the cards. Not a lot of customers wanted a Gap credit card, but they wanted you to force it down their throat.  And God forbid the store didn't make the goal, at the end of the night they would have some associates apply for it."
good,Laid back friendly environment. Generally comfortable place to work. staff and customers were friendly as well. Hardest part would be to finish the shift with the original goal set in place.
good,Here I got to work with kids and it was fun. I understand what I enjoy which is teaching and learning. I got to be creative with activities and other games.
good,"This place was average, nothing awesome, nothing terrible, it was just super hectic working during the Christmas season"
good,"Very broad work environment but my main role is how to use visual marketing to affect positively sales and people, with the purpose to generate a better bossiness results."
good,"Working at Gap was a wonderful experience, every employee was friendly and bubble and easy to get along with. Everyone was happy to help and help to gain new employees knowledge. Management was very understanding and helpful."
good,"Gap Inc. is an amazing company to work for, GAP truly cares about people, whether it's customers or employees or the community, GAP's people focus is everywhere you look."
good,"I loved working at the outlets unfortunately the hours aren't quite there, if you are planning on being a sales associate there and have to take care of a family you will be living paycheck to paycheck. They hire way too many people and the people that need the hours or have been there for a while don't always get the hours. It's a great job if you are full-time there or a student attending college that doesn't need many hours."
good,"Very high energy and fashion oriented.  I just don't have the taste for what ""in"".  Great company over all, I just wish I had a little more know as to what is in style."
good,"-greet customers"
good,Great customer service is required approach and greet customers. Making the customer feel welcomed was the main priority. Processing shipment in a correct manner and presentable for customers attention.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Implement corporate strategies around operational excellence and safety compliance.  Identify and investigate fraud & theft internally and externally.  Training of personnel on daily job functions.
good,"Gap Inc. is a great company, however it would be great if the hours were consistent and employees didn't have to brown nose just to make 20 hours for the week."
good,"•	Understood the Business point of view to implement coding using Informatica Power Center 9.6/9.1"
good,"Gap Inc. always celebrates. Always stays involved with the community and they give back, a lot."
good,Good for part time but not for full time.  Management based on who you were friends with and high turnover rate as many employees are in high school.
good,"A typical day started with all associates joining the team meeting, at that point you would find out if you would be picking merchandise or packing merchandise.  The management was very upfront about all employee opportunities and they made sure we felt like a family unit."
good,It was a interesting experience. I liked it most of the time.
good,Recover assigned sections while assisting customer needs and concerns.
good,Daily day consisted of 10 hours of the same job. I learned how to use scanners and working with pods technology. my co workers were really nice hard working individuals. The hardest part of my job was the not being satisfied with the work. The work was very repetitive and never getting any recognition. The most enjoyable part was the hours I was receiving.
good,"Processing shipments"
good,"Atypical day at work would be to open the store, handle all employee relations and operations, handle all deposits and budgets for the day/week/month, all employee scheduling, district conferences and meetings, inventory control, lose prevention control, and customer service.  I learned a lot about Human Resources and Payroll while at Gap as well as how to effectively handle the public and a well balanced staff.  I also learned a lot about how to and not to handle co-workers and what makes an effective, productive working environment.  The hardest part of my job was time management and I am now an expert in efficiency and managing my time.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the busyness of it all and being able to test myself.  I also really enjoyed traveling for the company to open news stores and train their staff."
good,"The people were awesome to work with and the shop was high energy, time flew by."
good,A good place to work but too much corporate items with changes and not effective for day to day operations.
good,•	Ensured customer satisfaction through problem solving and excellent customer service
good,Very classy and fast paced environment. Very pristine.  Management is wonderful and always ready to work with you.
good,Many fun people to work with created an upbeat sales environment.
good,"I love working for this company, offers many great benefits!"
good,"The work environment can be stressful, a lot more than necessary. going up the ranks in this company is based on who you know not your based on your work ethic"
good,"Always kept busy. folding, restocking, assisting customers, dressing mannequins and creating store and window displays."
good,"The overall experience was enjoyable. The environment was challenging as the staff was from all over the world, different languages and multi cultural."
good,"I take pride in working for Gap, Inc. as a company. It's never a dull moment at work. From my General Manager to every sales associate in my team, everyone brings in their A game everyday. I provide my clients with a genuine, professional and exceptional customer experience which makes their time at Gap valuable and they become a loyal customer for years."
good,Learn new things everyday and interact with costumers on a daily basis

good,"make sure fit neat stuff"
good,First job ever. Very appreciative of the manager for taking a change on me and having patience with me.
good,"This was a fast paced working atmosphere that is demanding of detail and  timeliness. As a Merchandise Handler, you are on your feet the entire shift and you are responsible for making sure the merchandise is correct and packaged to be delivered. The hours were good and can be flexible to the employee, also they offered overtime voluntarily and mandatory which made great weekly pay checks."
good,"Work day includes setting the tone for the store--sales goals, credit card goals, and overall product goals, and developing a strategy to achieve goals.  Very up beat and supportive team that encourages risk taking and expects results.  Work-life balance is difficult due to inconsistent schedule, but the people and customers are the reason why this company is excellent to work for."

I learned a lot about selling products to a customer and how to ensure that they leave satisfied. The managers are good people and the co-workers are easy to work with.

If you love the retail industry then it'll be a good it for you. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to keep up with the customers and the store during holiday season because it gets intense.

good,"Long hours, and amazing benefits. Great management, there were able to accommodate me after my car accident. Very goal orientated."
good,"In any given day, my main responsibility is taking care of the customers that come into the store and making sure that they have a rewarding experience. My main concern is helping them find the right style for their body and making sure they look and feel fabulous at the end of the day. It is so rewarding to help someone discover their own sense of style and give them a confidence boost. I have had so many moms that have simply forgotten about themselves because they are so focused on their families. They will try on a few things and then feel like giving up, but I'm there to reassure them that they aren't too old or too overweight to be dressing with style. It really changes a person's attitude when they find the perfect fit and it's the most amazing transformation to witness. The job itself can be a little stressful due to the fact that promotions are constantly running and it's my job to make sure that people are signing up for credit cards and buying a lot of clothes. For me this is a stress factor because I know that times are tough and I don't like pushing things on people that they don't need. I enjoy helping people find the right clothes but I do not want to have to force them to buy things they don't need."

Every shift that I have worked has given me some sort of new experience that I will be able to use in other situations. My co-workers are great. If they see one of their co-workers in a difficult situation, they are willing to step up and help out. The hardest part of the job for myself is getting up at 6 am for shipment, but it is ideal for morning people. Overall, working at the gap is great and I would recommend it for anyone."

good,"In the beginning, I loved working for Gap, I even stayed longer than I intended to because of the people I worked with and the environment. However the product begin to decline in quality and corporate couldn't give definitive answers on who Gap is. Competing with fast-fashion retailers isn't going to work and the current CEO is pushing GAP where it needs to be. I hope that changes and that the in-person experience channels what it used to be/stand for: quality."
good,Gap has good structure and for the most part good work culture. Poor management was rare. If you like working retail sales floor Gap is a good place to work.

good,"Especially good for teens, understanding management, great place to work if you want to stay in retail. Pay is better than most retail jobs, gap is very generous."
good,"From my experience of working with the Gap, they offered flexible hours for my schedule during open interviews. You will receive hands on training and learn new skills, the more time you spend in your department the more tasks you will learn about and master on your own."
good,Good start for first job or college students; management sucks & often changes; not flexible sometimes. Would’ve stayed if things were better & they cooperated with me.
good,"No one bothers you. If you need help you can always ask. Management does not hassle as long as you do your job. and it is not bad, pretty easy. music, headphones are allowed"

good,"Gap offers decent benefits, more so than I've seen with other companies. I'm also very happy with the volunteering the company participates in. However, pay is not consistent among peers. People in the same position can be a $4-$5 difference, even if they have similar tenure and experience."
good,"Gap is overall a good place to work at. It's fast pace and full of innovation. Gap follows agile methodologies, so you can expect all the rituals usually associated with agile."
good,"I enjoyed working here however some employees seem to think they were part of management when they weren't, so they didn't know their role, other than that, not bad"
good,Easy and fun place to work. Typical day consists of keeping the store clean and presentable for customers. Being on time for your shifts and breaks are important. Staff and management is nice and professional for the most part.
good,"Learned a lot about customer service."
good,"Gap is a company that is good to be, has a good culture and coworkers are awesome with good management. Always work as a team and willing help on another"
good,"I enjoyed how nice everyone was to each other. The management was always willing to help fellow team members, there was no hierarchy. I learned how to balance time between helping customers and coworkers all while running the store. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays when there wasn’t enough employees to handle how busy we were."
good,Old Navy was the only entity at the time making any money for Gap. It was posting negative comps after negative comps which made the job security and moral a challenge.
good,"the hardest part of the job was the learning curve and always trying to work faster but if you stick it out its not bad, people are generally friendly and helpful if you have a problem or question"
good,I loved working at Old Navy it was a very laid back workplace except for holidays but that is anywhere when you work in retail. Management works really well with college students schedules.
good,"It has been an roller coaster. It has its ups and downs. But overall, I have made some lasting friendships over my span there. At first there was a high turn over with management. Now it seems to be more consistent."
good,"- A typical day at work includes greeting customers and making sure that they are satisfied as well as keeping the entire store clean."
good,"It was fun going to work everyday with coworkers who were nice and hard working, defiantly a great experience and I loved going to work with friends, managers were also very hardworking and understanding."
good,"I was given a moderate amount of training and hired a t15 as a sales associate. I was given sparing shifts over the summer I was hired during, and then put on an unexplained hiatus. they brought me back for a final shift, three months later, on Black Friday, where I worked until well after closing time.  a week later they let me go over the phone. they deemed I was not a good fit then brought me back two seasons later out of desperation. good experience, bad impression."
good,"In my personal opinion, I feel like working for this company should only be for those who are attending school. The age and energy should be kept fresh so I wouldn't work more than 2 years there or until you graduate college."
good,There are lots of things that you have to do it every single week which make you bored and you do not use your brain and skills to work at retails. But in total is a good place to work in retails and store field.
good,"As an employee for over 10 years, I have seen the many ups and downs of Gap Inc.  A typical day has changed over time for the store's leadership team, as they have become more of a high priced sales team, and less of a functioning group of people who all have time to get their individual jobs done.  "
good,It was a fast-paced work environment depending on the time of day and what day it was.The only downfall was that the managers wanted you to sign customers up for Old Navy Credit Cards if you didn't get any in one day you weren't reaching a goal. Overall a pretty relaxed placed to work.
good,The retail corporate culture is just like any other although they do focus on employees unlike most companies and they're up to standard when it comes to closing time and thought the day.
good,"Gap is a iconic brand that I enjoy wearing and selling. The work environment is laid-back and fun. I would recommend working here to help develop your people skills, learn from a diverse group of co-workers, and challenge your creative side with merchandising."
good,"I typical would come in before the store was open. I would do cleaning tasks ,such as, sweep the floors, dust shelves, and clean mirrors. Then the during the hours of operations I would greet customers, help customers with shopping, answer telephone calls, and fold and replenish merchandise."
good,"Working here is fun at times, but they dont give people fulltime hours unless they are promoted to a manager position. This leaves people in a situation where they might have to get a second job or find another full time job."
good,pretty busy call center with lots of employees. there is a lot of different shifts to chose from and you can get a lot of over time if you wanted. there is a big break room with lots of food to chose from. you get employee discounts at stores which is good as well. hardest part of the job is trying not to snap on rude customers lol
good,"They often make people take on the equivalent of a 3 or 4 person job with no additional compensation. "
good,"Job is fun and fast paced. Management is good. Customers can be a challenge. Always something new or changing, keeps each day interesting. Shipment and processing is easy and fun to do."
good,"They work great with your schedule, ideal place for students to work. Not much room for advancement. The culture is fun and upbeat but customers can be rude often."
good,"It's a cool place to work, however the LP program is not very good. It takes 30 days to get released but you can't really do anything. It takes some getting used to. They expect a lot but tie your hands. Otherwise, good benefits and good schedules."
good,Trabalhei como extra e adquiri experiências profissionais com ótimas pessoas que eu trabalhei
good,I like being a team player and provide good customer service. Gap offers great products to its costumers. They may need to offer employees more benefits and flexible working schedules.
good,"This is a call center. There is a training program that you need to finish to be even consider. I learned how to listen, respond to what I just heard, and give the consumer/and or employee the plan of action I was going to take. You really don't interact with your coworkers that much, since you are on the phone the whole time, but you do make friends during training. This is a part time or full time job. If you want to make a lot of money, this is not the place for you. This is good for young people going to college, our retired people that needs the health and welfare."
good,"Gap is a decent place to work, now moved to packing quotas so making sure you can keep up is a priority. Stayed for many years, just now need to move on. Summer workday outings to the zoo with free food occasionally."
good,Very laid back leadership team. Easy going work environment. No room for advancement other than learning multiple job tasks in your area.
good,"Gap is a nice work place with supportive team which is giving me the opportunity to do what I love the most."
good,Its was a nice place to work for a retail job. The hours were ok. Hated working the Holidays. Wasn't excited about having to push people to sign up for credit cards. Co-workers made the job a fun place to work.
good,The Gap is great place to work. They pay well with great full time benefits. The down side to working retail is having job/work life balance.
good,"A typical day at the Gap is very busy, never a dull moment. Very fast paced and energetic. they also have a great playlist."
good,"Lots of team work, hard coworkers, enjoyable part of the day at time of closing out for the day.... after all the drama. Management very supportive, high security."
good,Good company to work for with a good work life balance. The company shares  a very strong sense of social responsibility and giving back to the community.
good,Gap is a great company to work for when you're young and not looking for anything too serious. Management is strict but only because there is so much expectation from the higher ups. Co-workers ranged in age but they all managed to find a common bond amongst each other. The company provide us with bonuses or rewards based on our monthly performances. Something somewhat surprising to me at least was that our location took part in various different fund raisers and events to provide to our community.
good,"Greet and assist customers in finding different styles and sizes of clothing. Promoting company credit card and other promotions going on in-store. Maintaining a clean and neat work environment for the shopping convenience of the customers. I learned great communication and customer service skills with greeting and assisting customers with anything they needed. I enhanced my team work skills by working with a diverse group of colleagues. With over 100 employees, we worked together to find solutions to a variety of problems. Management was great, assisting employees in every way they could and making the working environment as fun and productive as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming in to help customers in any way possible to make their shopping experience enjoyable and convenient."
good,"For a regular day at work, I would either open, have a mid-day shift, or close. I would open with one other associate and later more staff would come in. My jobs is based off the back room where I'm responsible for shipment, damages, transfers, sensors, and the back room shelves. I usually replenish the floor daily to ensure we have the product out and the correct sizes. My co-workers are very nice and they have a good vibe coming from them. The hardest part of my job would be conquering shipment by myself when I don't have any help, especially when it's timed. The most enjoyable part of my job is personally connecting with customers to assist them in find the perfect jean, shirt, dress, or anything they may need, showing them to a fitting room and following up with them to see if they may need additional sizes or just to see if they like the fit, and also ringing them up and asking how was their experience overall."
good,"Assist customers, recover sales floor throughout the day. Monitor fitting and return fitting room and register go backs."
good,The job was fun but a handful. Cloths everywhere and not good managing skills.Managers are in and out and the young managers that are there now just steal and talk about all the workers.
good,"Typical day at work would include taking care of fitting rooms and cash registers, greeting customers and helping them find what they were looking for; the manager that hired me was really great but the general manager of the store was always very intense and critical, working without him was always way more productive and faster. I've learned a lot from my co-workers when they helped me out with cash registers and just general customer questions inquiries. The hardest part of the job was when the general manager was there. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers, making their day better by making them feel comfortable and welcome at the store, finding exactly what they came for, matching clothes, giving styling advice!"
good,"Good work environment.  Of course there will always be hectic customers, but the people at work make the day go by quick.  Great team and management"
good,Fast paced and everyone is expected to exceed expectations. Work life balance is poor due to the expectation for continuous improvement and reinvention.
good,"Great place to work, great discount, nice and clean enviroment. Co workers are always friendly and its a fun place to work."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Gap, I made a lot of friends there from different country. Everyone was nice and friendly at workplace. My work experience there was fun and exciting. The management team was amazing, they were very helpful and encouraging. I recommended this job for students who looking for a part time job with amazing work experience."
good,"I loved working for the GAP, I love the brand, I love selling clothes, helping customers find what they need, suggest outfits, and matching them up. The environment was fast paced, I love meeting new people, and this was an ideal job for that."
good,"I've worked here to supplement some income while in school and full time job being slower or just need extra cash. Great company with some good managers. Shifts are short in a general sense, 4-5 hours normally."
good,My time at GAP was always busy due to the festive season. My workdays consisted up of non-stop folding. My management were cool and understanding and so was my co-workers. I think that was due to the small sized team that worked there. The hardest part of the job was watching customers un-fold the items I spent a long while on.
good,"Gap has been a great place to work with its great pay, and employee discount!  The turnover rate for managers is pretty bad we would have good managers then bad then good!  Don't know exactly why they leave!  Associates wise is the same too!  Co-workers are great very nice people!  Daily routine would either be bring a cashier, folding close and greeting customers on the sales floor,  or back in the fitting room.  Management works very well with your school schedule!  Some cons are not consistent  hours, but management tries to give them when they can based on sales."
good,Great place to provide exceptional customer service as part of an upbeat and energetic team.
good,"I truly enjoyed my job ,just not the changing in hours and days"
good,"A typical day at work consists of unloading, and processing of shipment items (merchandise, store materials), preparing them for display on the floor, and organizing the stock room. Then I would assist customers either by suggesting deals/styles/sizes or at the cashwrap where I would process their purchase."
good,I enjoyed my time at Gap and thought it was a great first experience for me. I had wonderful co-workers who understood the importance of teamwork and management was very helpful.
good,"A very nice and fast paced work Environment."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced but not stressful. I learned lots of ins and outs of retail. For example how to be a cashier and how important versatility is. My managers are strict but understanding. They are always willing to teach you something new and help you grow. My coworkers are very friendly we became somewhat of a family. The hardest part of the job was keeping up during holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers. They know how to make the day enjoyable.
good,GAP at Easton is a fun place to work and earn a little cash. The best part about the job are the co-workers. The least enjoyable aspect at the people who come in and toss around clothes with no concern that someone has to fold them back.
good,"Good company"
good,"Global sourcing"
good,"There is a lot to do before any retail store opens in the morning. You have to check your promotions, make sure every table is filled with products, clean any debris left from the closing shift and then pay attention to your goals and the ways we can achieve them. It's not just a money goal but also how to achieve the best customer service experience. You have to smile, greet and offer assistance but at the same time you have a long list of things you must do all at the same time. You just received shipment of new items that must immediately be on the floor, you have to find a home for it and create an outfit, pleasurable to the customer's eye."
good,Great job with great people. Advancement is hard to come by and the work is repetitive. You also have to rely on others for shifts as in early morning stock/shipment days.
good,Enjoyed the work environment. After 30 days promoted to Trainer. Typical day consisted of manual pic and replenishing.
good,I love working there but the pay and pay increases are not good you don't receive benefits either
good,i actually liked working there even tho it was only for seasonal but i enjoyed every moment
good,"Overall Gap Corporate is a great place to work if one does not mind the occasional ups and downs of the retail industry."
good,"Help customers, operate cash register."
good,"employee friendly and an overall good enviornment."
good,"a typical day at work for me would be completing stocks tasks first, making sure the customers have what they needed, and helping ring up customers at the register. i learned that no matter what the customers always come first. The managemet was great. Very fair. I cant really think of what was hard about my job. Everything was really easy to do and learn. The most enjoyable part of it was being meeting new people and getting to know different cultures."
good,"After 14yrs at the Gap Inc. , I am well rounded with experience in accounting, customer service skills, communication, team player."
good,They a great company to work for and my management team is good
good,This is a good place to work at if you are going to school and/or don't have a family to go home to. If you're a parent it is very hard to work here because of the schedule changes every 6 months. This major company used to really care about their employees but the bigger they got the less they took care of their employees. Mandatory schedule changes (your choice of this or you're fired) every 6 months made family life very difficult.
good,"A good place to work in general, friendly staff, decent pay, decent management. Opportunities to advance upwards are scarce. Overall a good place to work, but only as a stopgap and not as a career choice due to the lack of opportunity to showcase ability to move upwards."
good,my first job learned lot responsabilities and rules need to follow really good environment great retail place to work at
good,"its always a fun and social work environment , managers are always very helpful and understanding of ones personal life."
good,"I learned a lot about retail, customers and mangement here at the Gap. You will learn how to be a great sales associate and about the business"
good,"A typical day of work is to understand the daily work load. Find out the part you will play that day to accomplish it, and be safe and productive while accomplishing the goal."
good,Excellent souvenir de mon expérience ventes sur le terrain
good,"I worked seasonal position, learned to upsell more then before in this field. Management was helpful and reliable. The coworkers played  a great team and support system. The hardest part would be workinng during slow hours. The most enjoyable part would be answering and assisting customers."
good,It's a great place to work but very limited growth opportunities.
good,"Gap Inc can be an exciting workplace, with un-measurable learning and career advancement opportunities."
good,"My GAP experience was definitely something to learn from.  I learned a lot about retail and as one of my first jobs, I learned a lot about people.  In the short time I was there, we went through four different managers. "
good,I greeted customers and helped them find what they were looking for.
good,"Enjoyed the work day there.  Many of others to work together with.  Very customer service oriented.  My favorite part of the job was providing that ""wow"" factor to customers through sales and promotions and just knowing how to do my job thoroughly."
good,"Greeting customers, telling customers about current promotions and sells. Encouraging customers to apply for a gap credit card. Hanging and restocking merchandise. Performing multiple cash/credit transactions."
good,"Just like any job it has its pros and cons. Some pros are the staff members everyone brings a unique personality to work that makes it a relaxed environment.  every day I work I must be prepared for that daily curve ball.  Either its dealing with a few call outs, delivery arriving late, receiving an unexpected amount of shipment, and finding where to place the large amount of stock in a small stock area."
good,"This is one of the first jobs that I learned to handle cash and customers. I juggle coupons, cash, security sensors, and customers with every transaction and still have fun at work. I have goal inspiring managers who push you to give 110% at all times. The hardest part of the job is some of the more irritated customers but with the support of good management we are able to please everyone.."
good,A typical day involves being able to assist customer as best as you can and well as being able to support your follower Co-workers and being supported when need. .
good,Good place to begin a career and move up through management with advancement possibilities.
good,"During the time when I was with Old Navy & Banana Republic which is a sector under Gap Inc a typical day at work would consist of selling merchandise, managed department inventory, promote store credit cards and maintained high standards of customer service. My co-workers were fun and enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was maintaining a consistent work schedule. Overall Gap Inc is a good place to gain sales experience!"
good,Everyday I would process returns. I worked with computers and packages that customers had returned to the company. I would inspect the merchandise they were returning and see if it had been worn or damaged. I then entered into the computer what I was returning and credit back the customer. Depending on the quality of item I would either refurbish the merchandise and repackage it or i would damage the item out. There was not anything to hard about this job .
good,"I enjoyed it while I was there, even though I was stuck doing one thing the whole time."
good,"An ok job, not exciting happening here. Some coworkers were ok, managers were not the best."
good,"A typical day in a warehouse is very simple but loud because of all the heavy machines going at once but co-workers quiet working on their own, on our own individual lines. We worked at a high speed to get everything organized, sorted, boxes and labled the right way to be shipping off to local stores."
good,"it was a good place to start off in my career in retail. they taught me the basics for clothing such as folding,price check etc."
good,"It was fast paced, great people, lots of work to keep you busy."
good,"Learned many new things, how to approach the customers."
good,On shipment days- place merchandise on Nexflex and unpack items and place on racks. Before store opens place merchandise in the correct areas.Take out trash and rearrange merchandise for sales.
good,The gap is a great place to work. Taking that extra mile for the customer and having the customers be thankful is a wonderful feeling. Customer is our first priority at all times.
good,"The Old Navy location I worked at was amazing. Like any other retail store, the experience depends on management and co-workers. We worked well together and associates had a lot of freedom in how they performed their work as long as goals were met. Everyone on the management team was caring and accommodating."
good,I worked here a couple years ago and enjoyed my time there. The management was always organized with schedules and they were very respectful of the work/life balance.
good,I love this job. A typical day at work included conversing with customers about their fashion needs and selling the merchandise. Management is very great at making the work place a fun environment. I truly enjoy this job!
good,I must say that it was a pleasure working here. Everyone would pitch in a work as a team and the hour were great.
good,"Every day at The Gap is different. The everyday challenges keeps me on my toes, motivates me and I grow as an individual as well. I enjoy the people interaction, the one on one relationships with the employees and the customers too. The new product keeps selling interesting."
good,Great place to work for during your college career. You will learn a lot about customer service and the fashion industry.
good,Gap was a great job to have while being at uni. The managers were very flexible with scheduling and giving time off. All the staff were very friendly and helpful
good,"Gap has a culture of training and developing its people to set them up for success.  If you're going work retail, Gap is the place. Good work/life balance."
good,"Lots of hours sometimes"
good,Gap Inc is a fun place to work but there is a non stop grind that is associated with it.   If you are able to handle multiple deliverable at the same time and pivoting from task to task you will succeed.
good,"great experience here, learned many new things, highlight would be working with people who are as passionate working here as well. pay could be better and so can development opportunities."
good,"In a day I would develop teachable for new styles, for garments on the model and fix the pattern sent by the factory that made the sample and write up a review of the fitting so the factory understood the corrections desired"
good,The people at the GAP are helpful and kind and will accept you as you are. It honestly is a very relaxing place once you get use to everything that you have to do.
good,"I love working for Gap.  They have a great culture and sense of community and the people make the job.  There is a bit of unknown with a split of the company currently looming and the struggles within the retail marketplace.  The hardest part about the company is they are a bit behind in technologies and innovations, so it feels like we are always two steps behind."
good,A busy work environment that allowed me to explore new skills and develop my role. Close-nit group that works cooperatively with the management team. Pay if fair for sales associate but personally Key holders do not get paid enough for the work expected.
good,"Often ringing customers at the cash register, some side tasks come along during the day. The work involves a lot of go backs and recovery. Customers are generally nice in the Seattle area but always mess up the store. It requires a lot of patience to work here since it takes a while to organize the store before closing to have it messed up in 2 seconds."
good,"Some more availability for full time hours would definitely be a great improvement, but perfect for those looking for part time commitment.  Managers are very good and easy to work for."
good,It was a fast-paced retail job. I worked it as a part-time job to make extra income and usually worked the 3-8am shift opening and placing new product.
good,"Fast pace work environment, Pay is good, management is mostly respectful, but the balance of work and life is the most steressful when it’s time for o.t, easy to learn"
good,"Gap Inc. operates six of the most recognized apparel brands in the world: Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, Athleta and Intermix. I worked as a contractor."
good,Fun place to work but no room for advancements. Some drama but nothing too much to handle. The hardest part of the job are rude customers and management.
good,This company gave me the opportunity to develop my management skills and work with many people that helped in advancing my career. This place offered me ability to advance in my career
good,"Although I would say Gap wasn't the best or most favored company I worked for, I did learn some vital skills that I've used throughout my journey of career searching. Thank you Gap!"
good,"Gap is a really progressive minded company which helped gain a footing financially after coming out as trans publicly. I will always be grateful for that. For a retail job it offered decent wages and hours too, but there is not any real path for advancement. I worked for the company for nearly 5 years and never felt any closer to stepping up the ladder."
good,I would  come in and we would get asignments for the night. I would slot inventory.answer phone calls.handle inner department problems. When we were on break there was a pool table for us to enjoy.
good,By far a great place to be if you are young and starting off with a new job. The best part is the discount and take full advantage of that cause it’s literally the best thing.
good,"Working at gap was a fun job, getting to help customers find their style and what they are looking for. Working cash wrap was also fun getting to talk to customers and make sure they had a good experience. There was drama between employees quite often from conflicting views or shift misunderstandings, which got annoying over time. The management was wonderful and fun to work with, they were very caring and flexible with their staff."
good,Good place to work but be prepared for the customers when they call in for the customers when they call in for help. A little hectic at time but can be a fun job to work.
good,"Old navy is a great place to work as a first time job, coworkers were fairly nice and management was descent. employees got a 50% discount. The hardest part of the job is getting Old navy cards, management often stress this and tend to give you less hours if you don't receive a lot of old navy cards."
good,"I’ve worked in two different Gap stores now and have always found that the people I work with are fun and friendly (for the most part) the pay is quite good (8.23) if you work in one of the central stores (e.g. Piccadilly, Oxford Street). Normally you have 8 hour shifts with an hour break in between. Most of the time stores get busy so you will always have something to do. It is very 50/50 if you get decent managers or not. As long as you just get on with your job you’ll find that the environment is far more relaxed than managers imply when you first get there. I would definitely say it’s a good first job especially for students"
good,I will always have a soft spot for gap inc as they gave me my first opportunity to grow as a lp professional.  The system is well oiled and retains several key memebers that remain fixutres of gap.  L
good,It's retail folding organizing clothes working with people recommending sizes and accessories offering promotions to people. Signing up rewords program memberships
good,"Very nice chill job, but only for a student with no kids. The pay is very low for the things you have to go through with those customers. Co workers and management are lovely though. I had so much there."
good,The amount of skills learned prepared me for many different industries.  The work schedule is not great especially if you are a single parent.  Management varies from store to store but overall good management
good,"A typical day working at Gap is, your manager telling you numbers for the day, where the team needs to drive sales and telling you the department you'll be in (You could be cashier, fitting room attendant, or recovery) then depending where you are you really just end up folding a lot and helping customers find product, you'll always have to sell the credit card too. I was there for 2 years so i learned how a retail store works.Management really depends on the store you end up in, you could have a really cool manager that teaches and trains or you could end up with a manager who literally does nothing and receives all the credit. Depending on the size of your store you could have 3-5 Managers or ""Leaders"". Workplace Culture is pretty diverse, i met different type of people every season. Hardest part of the job really depends on you and your strengths. there is usually a lot todo and not enough time todo it. The most enjoyable part of my job was all the organizing i did, and i loved constantly meeting new people and helping customers."
good,"Gap has a casual environment.  Jeans and T-shirt company.  They care about employee work and home life balance.  Open door policy, you can go straight to the top without going through the steps below first.  Zero means Zero - no harassment nor retaliation.  Great Company for which to work."
good,"This is a great place to work if you're going to school or have another source of income, but if you're trying to support yourself/others or are looking for full time hours, then this might not be the job for you. That being said, I can only speak to my own experience at my own store. I can't say whether my experience is identical to that of employees at busier locations, but from what I gathered, it's probably not very far off either."
good,lets just say the people I worked with made my experience at gap better. I've been with the company for 3 years and advanced 5 months before I quit. The hours and pay was unreasonable.
good,"This is a really good place to work at.  The breaks are 20 minutes each, you had three. They had a system of when you worked the rate of which you packed could get you a raise."
good,"busy work environment with a culture that embraces changes and is consistently trying to improve in the retail market."
good,"cashier, stock maintained floor, cleaned customer service, and satisfaction, Maintained employees breaks for my floor. trained new employees. fun dealing with the public"
good,I really enjoyed working with a younger group of kids considering I was 29 30 at the time and definitely learned alot from my younger peers. I enjoyed putting outfits together and making displays in the windowshower.  Also due to working in the kids section and being a single mom I know a bit about infant clothing.
good,A typical day at work involves a pre-start meeting with a manager and a identification of your work area and duties for the shift. I have learned to do the best job that I can and to stay in my lane. Management needs improvement. Everyone is not doing their share of the work. There are too many people employed and not enough productive work getting done. There work schedules are not planned for the time when there is high traffic in the store.  The store is never really at a comfortable working or shopping climate. It is always too hot in the store and the customers consistently complain about the inconvenience of the temperature. The hardest part of my job is when the store has added new technology and there hasn't been proper training provided to do a professional and sufficient job. I don't like to make mistakes when it causes the customer to have to wait longer or get upset enough to leave.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have assisted a customer and they are happy and then leaves with the purchases they wanted.
good,i liked working at Gap. i wish i got paid more but it was very fun. i liked the managers and my coworkers. I am still friends with them and i like to hang out with them now!
good,"I enjoyed going into work each day. The staff was very laid-back, and my co-workers made working there that much more enjoyable. This was my first job working in retail, and I really learned a lot about the variety in merchandise, etc."
good,"Typical day at gap involves looking at my ticket queue and working on tickets submitted either by my manager, or the various users we support."
good,"i loved working there. i made a lot of close friends and i moved up pretty quickly. however we have lost a good amount of people due to poor management. i think once that gets sorted out, the work place would be fun again."
good,"Good job, salary is low, but normal for sales associates, too many managers though, with some communication issues, it is not clear ho you should look for in which cases."
good,"A typical day at the gap is a morning meeting with announcements, numbers, and assignments. Then we're off to our work assignments and we usually have two and a half hours before each three 20-min breaks. At this job, I've learned to pack, pick, corrections, exceptions, trailer load, and process returned and undeliverable orders. The culture is very diverse. Management is okay, sometimes a little to strict over nothing, at least on first shift."
good,"If you ever think about making a career out of retail this company will be the best school for it. Gap was the job where I learned and became the retail manager I am today. The company and managers as well as the structure of the company will certainly shape you to be the best and strive to excellence in everything you do. I started as a part time sales person, and eventually I was promoted to Stock Supervisor where I learned so much...!!!! As the company merged all three division Baby Gap/Gap Kids and Gap I was in charge of Visual Merchandising Manager for all three. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day was after a floor set was completed..!!!"
good,"Gap provided me with a good foundation as a part-time employee. It can be fast-paced or slow throughout the day, depending on what time it was and the client's work schedule."
good,Gap is one of the few companies that seem genuinely concerned with their employees and company culture. Depending on which store you work for the difficulty of the job changes but its never impossible.
good,The GAP provides a comfortable environment for all of the associates. Management works with each individual to see what tasks their best at and works on honing those skills to provide efficiency to the store's everyday operations.
good,"It was a productive working environment, always had something to do. Management was always there to help and to give advice. Enjoyed working with coworkers."
good,"The Gap environment encourages productivity and success. It encourages employees to learn, perfect their skill, learn to work closely and collaborate with others, all the while not being overworked. The most enjoyable part of my current position is that I feel as though I am learning a lot and still building necessary experience to further my career."
good,As a co-op student working at Gap as customer service i had the chance to experience at first hand how to handle customers in various different situations
good,it was iyte i enjoyed it and the people were very nice and the hours were okay and i workd there on work experience so it was ok and the lunches were cool
good,A decent job for a working college student. Management could be better and more benefits should be provided to part time employees. Overall working in stores wasn't a bad experience decent enough for a college student.
good,"gap company have great benefits and culture. a great company to work for, with the restructure of the company. great people have to be let go during finance budget cut. during model store project week, it very stressful. they want us to drop everything we have plan for our life. we have to plan everything around them, they don't care about our life."
good,All co-workers are friendly. Feels really warm. Work made easier with such friendly and cooperative managers. Fairly an easy job. Great experience to have for a new starter in retail.
good,"Une entreprise qui m'a permis de financer mes études, dans un esprit de convivialité."
good,"I liked working at GAP, they really taught me a lot and also really helped with improving my communication skills. After the holiday seasons, hours change drastically."
good,"Overall rating is good to work in such company but only thing is that the financial improvement is not as per our workload, that I think only. As some cases our team manager's don't have their good guts to tell about their team members and always try for their own improvement based on team members performance. "
good,"Productivity is important,I work doing drifferent functions.I help orginise events.In my department i pick and ship orders."
good,Having worked within the company for almost 3 years I have worked with numerous management teams. The company has gone through several stages whilst I have worked here and I have experienced many highs and lows in my time here.
good,Its quiet and clean.  Everyone is tired keeps to themselves.  Lockers work and some hard to open.  We get free Wi-Fi.  There are free food brought when we have big events for the company and some for birthdays.  Fridge is clean and nobody takes anyone's food.  We label our food.
good,"Great foundation for retail.  I have had the opportunity to work at various boxes and brands and each was a truly unique but valuable learning experience. Gap has set a standard for me personally in how and where I work.  While I have to left to pursue personal growth and opportunities I always consider going back.  They may struggle to be number 1 in fashion, but it still owns a nice part of the market and continues to be an innovative leader."
good,"The location while rather far to travel to is for the most part excellent. The various staff including myself are all hard working though the only gripe is with corporate not properly going over their required checks on equipment. On an average day myself, my manager and potentially another associate will assess any damage or mishandling with products before securing them for purchase on the sales floor. The only truly frustrating issue with job has mostly to once again deal with corporate and how they handle the product before we're able to actually get in into our location."
good,positive work environment with friendly and encouraging management and co-workers. Fair pay. Fair amount of recognition for successes. Multiple team building activities. Employee oriented.
good,"A typical day at would start at 6 am. Unloading and organizing boxes is the first task. Then folding and placing clothing. Overall, making the store look presentable for customers."
good,Fast paced job with a very culturally diverse environment. Unfortunately there are currently little opportunities for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working here and the people were amazing as well as supportive team members. I truly just wish that I could have been considered for a more permanent position.
good,"They have a four day work week, which means 10 hour days but it also means three day weekends. The benefits are good, pay is decent."
good,Awesome place to work with great managers and employees. Wide diversity of employees from different backgrounds and age groups. Have many opportunities to learn from both managers and coworkers. Very friendly and inclusive environment. Hardest parts are sale days and keeping customers appeased and patient. Most enjoyable part is getting to meet new people every day. Didn't get as many hours once holiday season started and new employees were hired.
good,"Communication given to employees is basic but effective."
good,"Gap invest in the development of their people through classes, training programs, and off-site experiences, all sending the message that the organization is eager to facilitate a steady path to personal growth."
good,"Employees are very helpful and knowledgeable at the store, all take pride in maintaining store clean with great customers service."
good,This was a good enviornment. This job allowed me to travel and transfer to different locations. The security of this job was very stable.
good,Worked here for a summer between college semesters and I enjoyed it.  I learned how to perfect fold and was also introduced into a new side of design and fashion.  It was a good learning experience that pushed me to open up more to people and customers.
good,"Wonderful work ambience with ever smiling and cheerful colleagues. Information based decision making. "
good,"Worked part-time. Easy job, fairly nice employees, low pay, low hours, no benefits except for discount which was 50% off retail price."
good,The employees are great to work with. Managers try to find ways to make it fun. The company works great with availability.
good,"My work day is very good overall, always doing something different, the job never gets boring. I've learned about how a big retail company distributes its merchandise in a functional manner. Learned how to operate different machinery and scanning items. Management is good I enjoy working for my managers, it is a very fun environment. The hardest part of the job is the hours that I work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers."
good,Very comfortable place to work with caring managers willing to help you advance in your career. Awesome place for college students looking into fashion degrees. You will get what you get out of it
good,"Le magasin GAP au sein duquel j'ai évolué se démarque en raison notamment d'une équipe de management très professionnelle et, ainsi que des collaborateurs extrêmement agréable."
good,"A typical day at Gap includes working the cash registers, helping customers find the items they are looking for and making sure we have an assortment of sizes on the sales floor to help the customer get what they want.  I started at Gap, Inc when I was in high school and have learned so much about the retail industry since then.  I have been promoted to Acting Manager and, therefore, learned even more of the ins and outs of the retail industry.  The hardest part of my job is keeping up with all the customers needs but the most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy."
good,"I enjoyed working at GAP.  The group of people I worked with were probably the best coworkers I have ever had.  GAP made great attempts to build relationships with management outings and activities that were a blast to participate in.  Although a typical workday could be stressful, the people I worked with made it worth it. I only left due to a medical issue making it impossible for me to meet the physical demands of the job.  If not for that, I would still be there."
good,"I loved working for the GAP. I worked there for eight years. I had the pleasure of working with some really good managers, directors and coworkers.  No micro management.  I was able to work from home as long as I got my job done. I had managers and directors that believed in my abilities, they new if my systems went down I would make sure they  were fixed as quickly as possible and I would see it through until it was done."
good,The managers here were nice and helpful. Some of the workers were so easy to get along with and then there were some that just had bad attitudes.
good,"Depending on whether I'm opening or closing, a typical day starts or ends with counting all of our registers. During store hours customer service is always our number one priority. Through this philosophy I learned that, being able to help people with simple problems such as putting together an outfit or a more complex situation such as solving an issue with their brand credit card is an extremely rewarding experience."
good,"I love working at The Gap. I have fun every time i clock in. I learned how to fold clothes and many things from co workers. Managers are passive aggressive so they are easy to like. Its hard to become manger if your a straight male though. Only male managers we have had were out the closet gay, which isn't fair. Co workers are up and down like any place with over 50 employees. They all have unique personalites and some are better than others. The hardest part are the customers. Gap's core customers (spoiled house wives) are so needy and sometimes impatient. Sucks when its crowed at the cashier."
good,Gap Inc. is a relationship focused environment. Under new company leadership collaborative relationships are starting to be valued and transparency starting to be encouraged.
good,The 7 years I spent a Gap were turbulent but rewarding. I worked with intelligent and passionate people. As part of Gap Brand the it was a constant roller coaster ride of management shake ups. Some better than others
good,Its a Global brand that helps in learning across boundaries. Deals in qualitative product and work for different response channels.
good,Everyday was a challenge but always in an exciting way. Going into work everyday was a surprise in which I wasn't fully ready but never the less always prepared :).
good,Very Productive. Fast paced. Management is cooperative. Supervisors make sure you stay busy. Other employees are friendly. Picking is rather easy.
good,"I think GAP is a fantastic company to work for, unlike other big leading retail brands GAP really cares about it's staff and are always bringing in new ideas to support staff - Managers are friendly, professional and understanding. GAP understood my interest in fashion and my determination to progress and gave me the chance to learn and grow within their company and even gave me the inspiration for wanting to pursue a career in visual management eventually. It's a productive and goal-driven workplace, My co-workers were supportive, energetic and pleasurable to work with. I enjoyed every second at GAP. I now have the confidence and skills to take on new challenges, meet new people and grow within a company thanks to GAP. They offer great benefits to staff too."
good,"Restocking new products on time,and very fast pace depending on how busy it is.How to deal with customers and a lot about fashion. Management was great,they ran a great work place for everyone.The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the clothes at the end of the shift,but the co-workers made it easier because we all worked together to make it not as hard as it was.Learning about fashion was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"very diverse crowd, independent work, consistent, benefits are going done, pay wage could be better, production is high, very open job"
good,You felt that you were appreciated for the hard work that you did. It was a good part time job. I would suggest it for younger adults and students.
good,"The people were amazing, the work was hard but always worth it with a generous weekly pay. I never thought I could move non-stop for 9 hours a day (1hr to allot to breaks) and walk out the door with a smile every time. "
good,"GAP offers great retail and customer service experience. Additionally, the company has many benefits for its team members."
good,"Co-workers were great to work with. Management was good as well, but a few bumps with the constant change of a new GM from year to year. Hardest part of the job unhappy customers disappointed in Gaps quality."
good,It was great working for the Gap. Great to meet different people whether a co-worker or a customer. I learned a lot on all different areas of customer service. Management is professional but also down to earth. Hardest part of the job would have to be working the holidays but also enjoyable.
good,"Atlas Copco is one of the best company to work with. I learnt a lot on business skills & strategies, got the sufficient exposure while working on gas compressors. "
good,A typical day at work was stocking items and working cash registers. I learned how to multitask. Management was okay.co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday.
good,Working at Old Navy has been overall a really good experience. I have learned how to deal with customers very well. And I have been able to become a very well rounded employee.
good,I worked nights. So we would come in and check orders of the prior shift. Then go to our assigned area and continue with our task of getting orders together Management was pretty down to earth. No complaints about the co workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing the task for the evening before shift was over.
good,"Es una buena empresa, donde se paga bien y el trato hacia los trabajadores es muy bueno, el ambiente laboral es grato."
good,"The co-workers are fun and energetic, it is an overall good place to work."
good,"Is basic retail"
good,"Gap Inc. is a very good company to work for. They provide great service and price value for the whole family with their weekly sales and promotions. Fun place to work. My co-workers made the job enjoyable every day. Team work is a MOST. Management At the beginning was great, very on point and hands on with every day situations but thru the years has been lacking due to company structure and promoting to others stores and not giving employees opportunity for growth. they rather transfer someone new to take over the spot or hire outside the company which end up by us training them to do the job.the best was working with my team, every day we had a task to do and we knew how o do it on time and also help the store on the busiest hours of the day by providing customers service and cashier services. The worst part was the hours and scheduling. Because of the company adjusting hours, we were schedule 30 hrs. or less, lose company benefits because of it or force employees to open their availability to keep the company benefits."
good,"Its all good. We had a wonderful and hard "
good,"it was a great learning experience but I missed my family, especially during the holidays. Stores are open on Thanksgiving day."
good,"Very structured environment, worked with very dynamic team"
good,"Gap was a great company to work for, they went through hard times and that stunted growth."
good,it having fun to work here.very intersting job.everyone enjoy
good,"Working at Gap is great at its best, stressful at its worst. I started with the company part-time, which is best for students because shifts are flexible. Hours were only plentiful during peak seasons (summer, holidays). So don't expect more than 20 hours during slow times. Hard work is rewarded with more hours, but also more stress. I enjoyed my time working for gap, but I am ready to move on."
good,"Fun place to work, easy going. Not enough hours available. Management was ok but some needed more training to better lead the associates."
good,"For contractors it can vary, from small tasks to a long project. But still counts as every completed project contribute to the overall success of the team's goal."
good,Stocking shelves and greeting customers provides and enjoyable atmosphere. You are surrounded by the nicest coworkers.
good,"The best part of working for Gap is the diversity that you encounter. I come into contact with a variety of unique, passionate, independent people every day. The team mindset is ingrained into every aspect of the job, which makes it that much easier to come to work. Working  at the largest, most profitable Gap in Oklahoma City can bring about a grueling amount of work. I am physically and mentally challenged every day, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Being a member of the management staff has been enlightening and enjoyable. We work together as a team to overcome the obstacles that are thrown in our way. The most difficult part of the job is maintaining a relaxed, comfortable work and shopping environment during peak times. The store is packed during these times and can be overwhelming to most. That being said, it is during those times that the team rallies and gives all they have to make sure the business flourishes."
good,"I really do love it here, the discount is great. Just wish it paid more and that more hours were available."
good,"Gap has always been good to it's employees.  Aside from not making enough money, I loved my job there.  Retail is not really a place I expect to make a career from and earn a ton of money so I was not worried about that.  They were always flexible with my scheduling since I was a student and I would advise any young person to start there."
good,"My experience working for Gap Inc. was good. I enjoyed the amount of hours that we could potentially acquire, yet the job was very strenuous and, in my opinion, we were not given sufficient breaks to recuperate."
good,It was a great place to work! I some of the most amazing coworkers EVER and the atmosphere was never dull!
good,A typical day included working with supply chain strategist to define business requirements and relay to a team of developers via Jira stories (AAD). I also functioned as level 1-2 production support for issues related to the application and integration with other applications. This taught me to work more effectively in a team environment and to better communicate with managers. It was difficult to balance the BA and production support aspects effectively. I really enjoyed collaborating with my coworkers and team.
good,"I've worked for various brands, due to work load being on top of things. But I've always managed to find solutions to solve them. Throughout the years, I've gained a range of skills. Learning how to manage staff, stockrooms, customers, cash handling, audits and many more. My main impact would have to be on the shop floor, I bring a great deal of energy and enthusiasm. I like to socialise with customers in order to find out what it is particular they're looking for. Also, I keep track of UPT's, ATV's, customer conversion rate and a few others."
good,"scheduled maintenance of equipment, answering trouble calls"
good,"I would show up on time to work and then clock in. Then grab a headset and go out to the floor wherever they needed me; this could be any of the zones, or in the dressing room. Manager were very helpful to new employees, including myself. They were also very reliable and trustworthy. Co-workers were nice and easy to approach and helpful to all customers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping in interesting. The job was constant standing and folding for me. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to go out onto the floor and help any customer that asked me for help."
good,"Working for Gap Inc Direct has been a great experience. A typical day at work is sitting at a cubicle answering phone calls for customers placing orders, checking status and general inquires about products and policies. Management seems always available, my direct co-workers are great and very helpful if a question needs answered. My hours are very late so that would be the hardest part to my job. While some calls are hard to deal with, I do enjoy talking to people and having random conversations with people all around, that is probably my most enjoyable part to the job."
good,"A typical day at work at The Gap was very fulfilling!  I really enjoyed working with the public and the product in the company.  I gained a sense of confidence with this company that has stuck with me to this day.  I found that the type of people that the company hired were vibrant and helpful.  The management team was always growing in their skills and constantly offering their knowledge and help.  The hardest part of the job was taking in stock; however, the brand logistics were very interesting to me and I fully enjoyed learning how to execute the company's standards."
good,Loved the benefits and company as a whole. Nothing bad to say
good,Helping out all customers with their purchases. Restocking the floors with clothing items.
good,"I went from a stock boy which included shipments,merchandizing product to head window designer for the Bay area within a year. Having my main store corporate headquarters, management was cold and demanding. Co-workers were also a bit cold due to the environment we worked in but I made it work."
good,"Working for Baby Gap was fun and different. I got to see cute babies everyday and help out parents pick out little outfits for their children. I love playing with kids and get to work with pregnant moms was fun for me. I have a little brother and a goddaughter that I love to death. I worked the sales floor, stock down items, provided customer service and assist managers."
good,"Fun Place to work and interact with people. Not a very difficult job, very enjoyable.However not that many hours and many ""on call "" shifts. You have to call 2 hours ahead to see if they will be needing you. This makes it very difficult to plan ahead, really interfears with your life out side of work."
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customer as well as assisting them with the product they looking for, responsible for till transaction, stock shelves with merchandise; keep the store clean and tidy at all times. The management team always ensure the sales associates are aware of the daily target. Enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people from varies part of the world."
good,"receive the delivery and distribute through out the store   make sure the visuals were ready for store to open , also work on the shop floor as a shop assistant and cahsier"
good,"this place was a good place to work if your good at saleing, the discount you recieve is good, and its a fun place to work"
good,"- coworkers and management friendly and usually helpful"
good,"This work environment was fast paced and, at times, extremely busy due to holidays and customer visits."
good,"Great job to learn everything in sales associate and stock. Great training in cash registers, fun work place."
good,"Long hours of fast pace, goal oriented focus.  Surrounded by teams who were passionate about their work.  Driven leadership team, highly collaborative and focused on driving and improving efficiency."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant communication with customers and learning about their needs and exceeding them.
good,It is a great place to work with a great culture.  Not very many opportunities for advancement exist because of the long term employees.
good,A typical day at Gap would include day to day customer service. As a leader in this location I am responsible for daily business of opening and closing. I have learned great customer skills as well as coaching and mentoring through Gap.
good,"Typical day included working as a sales assistant as well as a lead cashier, responsible for cashing up the tills at the end of the day. Lots of team exercises within the company as well as individual sale targets. Also helping alongside the visuals team and promoting new stock."
good,"A typical day of work consists of meeting with my supervisor to discuss any tasks or goals set forth by the company."
good,I did like the staff including the management very much in this role but i couldn't bare to stand up all day the way i did. The hour journey to work was usually packed and the same went with the hour journey home so in the whole day until i got home i sat down for only half an hour in 11 hours.
good,It is a good place to work but the hours vary way too much making pay inconsistent.
good,Helping customers getting clothing that they wanted by size or style.  Also they had great opportunities for advancement.
good,I loved working with Gap inc. The Products are great quality. The Management team did a great job by making us feel like a part of the family. My overall experience at the Gap inc. was great!
good,"My work day consisted of ringing up customers, attending the fitting rooms and keeping the sales floor organized. "
good,"A typical day consisted of general upkeep of the store, greeting customers, promoting store specials and credit cards, setting and meeting sales goals, and personalizing the customer experience to give off a vibe of upscale fashion. "
good,"Typical day at work includes running stock, engaging with customers, opening fitting rooms and opening Banana Republic Brand Credit Cards. Some of the management staff exceeds while one of the key players is lacking the skill, focus, knowledge or passion that is necessary for the store to excel. The most enjoyable part of the time is the customer engagements and the friendly staff. "
good,Make sure you know retail and run a store effectively. Trying to getting Gap Credit cards is very important. Have weekly goals and if you don't make them you get in trouble.
good,"- A typical day at work can consist of one, some or all of the following roles and tasks: fulfilling customers' needs by working sales floor or fitting rooms; answering phone inquiries; mark-downs; brand/visual work consisting of dressing body forms, replenishing stock, marketing (window displays, signs in store); work in shipment line"
good,I enjoyed being a sales associate at this retail store because liked the interaction with many differnt people as well as assisting customers in sale selection. Knowing I contributed in helping a customer be happy and satisfied in their new item gave a sense of joy.
good,"I enjoyed working at Gap, and all managers and other employees were helpful and personable. The commute of 40 minutes each way however did not balance with the 4 hours a week I was being given."
good,"I love the Gap and I love working in my store. The associates are great, my fellow managers are good at what they do and the customers are a lot of fun."
good,"The Gap was a place where you can find anything to wear for any occasion, very basic clothing store. I worked in a very popular mall in Pennsylvania where the store was located so there was always traffic in and out of the store. I learned several and various techniques on how to sell, influence customers on a positive level, perfect folding, and promotional marketing. The Gap had a high turnover rate because many people couldn't handle the schedule of the retail industry so I met many people. All the co-workers were fun and enthusiastic about working for the company but mostly importantly we worked as a team, always. The most difficult part of the job was getting consumers to apply for a Gap credit card. The economy has been shaky for the past 4-5 years so many didn't want to add any extra bills to their name. Or the case may have been some didn't have any credit at all to become qualified. I enjoyed going into work everyday at The Gap being as though I love interacting with people and most certainly I love clothes."
good,"Sales Associate within the Gap Inc. company as well as organizing the new line of clothes coming in and making sure the appearance was acceptable, had to meeting certain sales goals of the day and maintain a professional appearance and attitude"
good,In my experience at the Gap I encountered a variety of circumstances and scenarios that shaped my managerial experience and development. As a Customer Experience Supervisor I learned how to deal with customers and their different needs. Many of these experienced involved finding a solution to my customers' problems.
good,"Greeting customer, folding clothes and stocking shevles. I learn that no everyone wants to help you out when you need and managament had there favorite people. Co workers were not really trust worth and really didn't help out much. Trying to get people to help you out when you need and making a customer happy."
good,"Hardest part of the job was annoying people asking them to open up cards times are hard and nobody wants to open up credit as much anymore. i learned i can be more patient with difficult people majority of them dont mean to be difficult , the most enjoyable part of the day is when i worked with the people i liked . my actual boss and the gm were great but the shift leader and assistant manager need work ."
good,"I'm actually trying to work for this retailer again. There is a culture of making every customer shopping experience excellent. You cannot deny that when you walk into this retailer, you can feel the energy."
good,Pick up a arm computer read your task and pick the forklift.You didnt really deal with anyone.Manuelly picking orders was hard but riding on the different forklifts was good.
good,FUN. Enjoyable. Gives creative people an outlet to work and gives people the chance to develope as sales people
good,"There is no typical day in retail! Anything can happen with customers, brand, and so on. As Brand Expert it is my job to maintain the visuals of Gap Kids but to also assist customers. Also, coaching my staff on brand and customer service is very important. Being a smaller store means that I can be creative when placing product and setting our walls."
good,The Gap te weert.
good,Great company but even if you have experience in a higher position you're locked into what you are hired at
good,As long as u have e great customer service your job will be easy .
good,The most enjoyable part of working for GAP was the benefits.
good,A fun place to work part time. My co workers are all in school and work here part time. I love working there because we sell beautiful baby clothes and our customers are really nice. They bring their kids and its fun to help them choose outfits for their children.
good,"My overall work experience at Gap was satisfactory. I enjoyed working with my coworker and bosses. a typical day at work would consist of getting a summary of how the day has been doing on sales. Then being sorted into the different areas of the store we would be working for the next hour. whether it was cashier or dressing room. We learned all about how to give the customer what they need, helping to make decisions easier for them.Working there was a very fast paced environment;constantly running around or standing.The hardest part of my job were the hours. I personally was getting about 10 hours a week in shifts on a minimum wage salary.Not the easiest to live on.But at the end of the day I enjoyed where I worked. I was always proud to say I worked for GAP. It was a very hard decision to leave the company but I still keep in touch with everyone I worked with."
good,"I would say to anyone just entering retail either on a sales associate level, or even management level its a good place to start. There are tons of resources from e-learning to books, and classes you can sign up for. The best part of the company is the people you work with. Those who have been there for awhile and have vested interest in the company are great to work with and will do their best to support you and your goals. The flip side is that the company in their efforts to return to our shareholders will decrease payroll which a quickness to increase profit and still expect all goals to be met. It's not fair to your employees and the customers who it affects ultimately. Overall the company is making progress, better product in store and renovation of stores, but they to reinvest in the people who run those stores and ensure they are not only able to maintain quality of life, but have a good life."
good,Wonderful and challening working in the clothing industry.
good,"My job is great!. I get along with all of my co-workers. The company is fun to work for, but it isnt steady enough for me. Sometimes management would wait until i walk into the door to tell me that they cut my shift. and once i recaived a check that was $77.00. Its great, but not for me."
good,good starter job and thats about it. dusty place to work at. really fast paste
good,"working under pressure and trouble shooting in these conditions proves what type of technician you are, that makes it fun and challenging."
good,I love working with customers and feeling like an important asset pertaining to my job and the company that I work for.
good,"Work was the same everyday, same typical work. I learned how to distribute merchandise in a fast manner, how to use computers more efficient and to communicate with co-workers better. The management was fine, they understood you as a employee. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for the whole day, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have liberty to do your job at your own pace."
good,I enjoyed working at the Gap. Gap provided a great working atmosphere. This is a good company to work for if you need a second job.
good,"Originally I was hired as a seasonal employee, though, after the holiday/seasonal ended they placed me as a ""part-time"" employee. However, though I am ""part-time,"" I am not receiving enough hours (less than 20 hours a week)."
good,I enjoyed working there very much. It took me a while to get home so that was a bit inconvenient. Overall the atmosphere was great and I have learned a lot from my time here.
good,I learned alot from working at the gap. It wasn’t very hard getting along with staff and customers. It made me way more confident in the field of jobs
good,Great time while I was there. Great employees with diverse looks on life and backgrounds. Management was great but I feel as though I outgrew my position personally. There is room for improvement but you have to want to succeed. Big on Sales and organization.
good,Not much to say .. seasonal temporary..so only there for 5 weeks but altogether...it was good. Team work was good as I was learning...all helping each other out.
good,"The general environment is very pleasant. Nothing too rigorous or demanding overall. In terms of sales associates, my location seemed to only really have girls in their teens - 20s"
good,Pay is fair for the work that is done. Employees and management friendly. 4 hour shifts for part time. My issue is the lack of days a week and or hours
good,"Faced paced work environment."
good,"I liked working there for the time being, I had good pay and some fun too. It’s a great environment to work in, sometimes really busy but manageable. And I liked it a lot."
good,"Gap Inc. Direct is a warehouse branch of Gap. It features the same usual demands by other warehouses. Your typical day will consist of clocking in, having a morning meeting with your supervisor, then you are off to your station. I was a picker so I would get a cart and stock it up with supplies before finding a ""gladiator"" device. Then you go to the locations displayed on the gladiator and tag clothes before putting them in the totes on your cart.. It involves a lot of walking and the totes can weigh up to 50 pounds after being filled. Once they are full you put them on a conveyor then get a new empty tote and repeat the process. You must maintain a level production that is a dynamic rate you won't be able to figure out. They have a system that is built to predict how long it takes for you to do certain action like taking a step or reaching into a box. They use this to determain your production which can be frustrating to deal with. But, the other aspects of the job can be very nice. You will have three 20 minute breaks throughout a 10 hour work day, but they are paid so no clocking out for lunches. Lastly, overtime is usually held for busy times of the year between November and February. During this time, especially Thanksgiving, overtime will be mandatory; stretching upwards to six days a week for 60 hours. Outside of the overtime season work can be very slow, leading to a lot of VTO (Volunteered Time Off). Like I said, the job is a good one and if you can get a hang for maintaining production you will have a very stable and secure job."
good,It was a fast paced but enjoyable workplace where time flew by because of the fast paced work environment. The work isn't too heavy but the pace keeps you going.
good,"I found it to be a place to grow. I enjoyed the variety and exposure it gave me, Gap is a very inviting culture. I think the environment makes it easier or an easier to work than  most from my experience."
good,"Very flexible scheduling, very fast-paced when the store was busy, did a good job of informing employees of current sales and promotions at the beginning of their shift"
good,"grossa responsabilità, appagante rapporto stimolante con clienti e fornitori"
good,On workplace with multiple eventsGreat experience great steppingstone Hardwork is it knowledged a great company to get your feet wet and you done your trade of merchandising or sales
good,"the store is very easy working in evnviroment that is good and suitable  to work in, your get a good long brek na dthe stre is located besude many food shops"
good,"Flexible hours of work."
good,It was a great job with great opportunities if your just getting into the workforce or don’t mind the pay. The people were nice and they accommodated me for when I was breastfeeding and needed to pump.
good,"Challenging and competitive, but sometimes interesting. the work load is very heavy, not a good place for a single mother like me. at the end of the day employees become stronger"
good,"I worked there for several years and watched a lot of managers come and go. The priorities always were shifting (based on the push from the DM): focus would change from store appearance to credit goals to email captures to merchandising back to credit etc. It was frustrating to follow the constant changes and put effort into one thing just to change it a few months later. "
good,"I like the management. I like my manager a lot although I was just a seasonal clerk. My manager was extremely providing and did the best to train us during holiday season."
good,"It's a fun place to work, the people are really nice. The workload is not very intense. The management can sometimes be hard to understand but everything can be sorted out."
good,"I love working for the company but, my location management team are very unprofessional and rude to staff and customers. They have very nasty attitudes and think they can talk to people any way they want. I cant wait to relocate to get away from the negative energy."
good,A a not so good work environment but also has its downs with chemistry of the employees not being treated fairly enough. The gap also didn't provide enough benefits to any of the employees.
good,"A typical day at work is descent. Not too heavy, not too light. 30 days safety days with no incident equals a BBQ for the employees. The enjoyable part of the job is that it is easy. The hard part of the job is that overtime hours is kinda forced upon you(10 hours). You'd have to use PTO or Edays to just work a regular 8 hours even though it was your given schedule from the start. Management is ok, but it does feel as if the rules are bent some ways so that management can get what they want out of their employees. Overall great beginning job to start with though if you want experience."
good,They choose their workers wisely. They make sure the work environment is extremely upbeat and positive. They throw out many incentives to try and keep their workers moral up.
good,I spend most of the day keeping shop floor clear while folding clothes and placing them back in to the right sections. you have to be able to stand and walk around.
good,"its good, Management was pretty good and organized on my old store. Fair hours. Good and friendly co-workers, usually younger students since it is a retail place."
good,"Overall, the company is not a terrible place to work. The pay is great and the work isn't terribly taxing. Just needs more opportunities for advancement that don't involve you moving all over the country."
good,This was an excellent company to work for when you first starting great benefits good pay Good Vibes flexible hours great discount your PTO accumulates rather quickly and they make sure that take that time for yourself they're very attentive.
good,"Gap strives to deliver exceptional customer service, and that they do every day. Its a fun place to work in, but salary is not as good as it should be."
good,"A usual day at work involved helping customers, conversing with co-workers, while also maintaining the store's image in a positive way. Some things I learned while working here are the in’s and out’s of the retail industry, dealing with irate customers, approaching different types of people in multiple ways, and how to keep up with trends to excite our buyers. The management was very friendly and will always give you tips on how to be the best employee to their customers. The hardest part of this job would have to be keeping up with our inventory and constantly having to know what we keep on our sales floor due to things rotating all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be seeing a customer leave with a smile on their face because I helped them complete the task that they came in for."
good,"Been at Gap Inc for sometime now just part time for some extra cash and I've had nothing but a good time, great friendly management and staff, Also discount is a plus! Easy and secure work place."
good,It depends what store you are hired to. For the most part it is like every other retail job. There are opportunities to grow with the company. Managers should be flexible and understanding.
good,"Très bonne expérience, horaires non contraignant, équipe agréable"
good,Great part time job for me at the time. Paid fairly for the part time job I had - cashier/cash handler/salesperson. Management was good then changed too often in the last year of my employment.
good,It's a great job but it does become super stressful when we don't make our goal such as having customer apply for our brand cards. Sometimes it is super slow and they have to cut hours they are flexible when it comes to school i like the people i work with it is just stressful if you don't make your goal on Gap cards.
good,Working at GAP was great. I learned a lot of different skills. They were very flexible with my hours and it was always easy giving away shifts/taking shifts.
good,It's hard to move up at a certain point but if you're starting as a associate/analyst Gap at the cssc is wonderful to pole vault from. I'd recommend looking at it
good,"I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive at Gap Inc.  My experiences within the company brought me across the country from Washington D.C., Hawaii, and California.  I've built relationships that will truly last a life time as well as found my passion in building and driving teams."
good,"Good place to help you with an everyday lifestyle , they have opportunities for you to level up if you'd like to remain in the retail business. great team."
good,"Working at a Gap, in my opinion, was better than Old Navy. Also, try to join a store that has a team that knows the brand. When you work for a store that has all new leaders, none of them know what they are doing."
good,Gap is a busy place to work as there are always tasks to be completed both on the shop floor and in the stockroom.The customers are always a priority and the company prides themselves on this.
good,"This is a really nice place to work at, everyone is really nice to you. The work is easy and as long as you are doing your own thing working the managers will leave you alone"
good,Gap was a pleasure to work with back when I worked for them because it was a period of growth so there were a lot of opportunities for growth and advancement.  It's great to work with a company that was a such a pioneer and has such a rich retail history.
good,I worked at a Gap Outlet as a Christmas Temp. I enjoyed getting the know how the store ran and everyone was really friendly. There were stressful times with it being a busy seasonal job but on the whole I enjoyed working here.
good,"It has been a while since I worked at this company, but while there it was a comfortable atmosphere to work in. Management were all great, very helpful and leaders by example"
good,"A friendly and fun culture. Customers form a wide range of ""walks of life"" are communicated with. Have a decent amount of fashion knowledge. Be in-tune with current trends."
good,"I enjoyed working at the GAP."
good,I worked here while I was living with my sister. The managers were amazing and so were the employees. The hours you get as a part time employee is awful. The shifts are usually 4 hours and you don’t get scheduled as often and you get paid every two weeks. This job is best for people who just need extra cash in their pockets.
good,The first several days were hard.  It took that amount of time to get used to standing on you feet for 9+ hours. It was very easy to gain employment because it was during the holidays and they needed help. Using and learning the computer system was easy for me because of past experiences. I was able to learn 4 different jobs in the short time I was employed by The Gap. The pay was excellent and the overtime was even better.
good,"Gap and Old Navy were great opportunities. Within the store you work there are certainly opportunities for growth: sales associate-manager-gm etc. however it gets much more challenging from there (i.e corporate) without some other specific skills."
good,"Manager and assistant are super flexible with schedule. It's very easy to grab and get shifts covered. Co-workers are chill, and fun to work with. It's a very busy store on weekends, but what it needs to be done usually gets done."
good,The Gap is not a bad place to work. They offer a great Benefits package and good pay after awhile. There management could improve along with the machines to help you reach your goals.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Friendly staff and easy to talk to, always busy and and interacting with customers. A typical day at work would be folding clothes constantly and helping customers."
good,"Highly recommend. Great work experience in sales, customer service, marketing. I got to interact with all types of people some of whom ranged from pleasant to difficult and this developed my ability to be flexible and patient and creative. I got to work with different managers each summer from whom I discerned good and not so good managerial styles. Working retail allowed a great variety of job and people skills."
good,"Just was nice laid back position, nice people and management.. I enjoyed some of the flexibility that the gap had as well as some of the appreciation shown."
good,"good co-workers. flexible working hours. overall people put in a lot of effort, but there were a lot of time consuming processes that were frustrating."
good,"Great motivational and visionary beliefs. Great staff, a lot of hard work. Fast paced environment as the business needs changed based on sales read per week"
good,fast paced high volume store .. high traffic - men's Women's kids and baby apparel . staff of 50 . store was part of primer stores that high expectations. great merchants and staff was open to change and challenges
good,I had an awesome work experience at theGAP. I LEARNED so much with this company honestly.  The merchandise at the time basically sold itself and the customers were very easy going.
good,"It is a fun suggestion for a weekend or part-time job, but as for a career there is a lot of competition "
good,"The staff at The Gap, Bayshore consist of great people who take the time to care about each individual that walks into the store. Great learning environment that allows a flexible work and life balance."
good,"Great hours"
good,"It usually was a cool paced time each day of work management for the most part was very understanding and catered to the employees as best as they can while maintaining solid leadership. I learned how to properly fold jeans, sale merchandise and operate tech related to stock and inventory. The hardest part of the job usually would be selling the proposed amount of cards per day and cleaning up at the end of the day. However the most enjoyable part of the job was working period for the staff and employees were very wonderful to work with."
good,Typical day at work was very fast paced and it taught me multitasking skills due to to the high volume of customers. I enjoyed my time at Gap Inc. i made a lot of great relationships.
good,A good place to work as the co-workers and management are nice and know how to get work done. Typical retail job of selling products to customers and ensureing that product is presented in ways that will encourage the customres to buy it. The work itself can be boreing and a little unfulfilling.
good,"This was a good part-time job. I consistently worked Mon-Wed, 30 hrs a week. It's very physically demanding, and the pay does not start off very high. If you go full-time, you can say goodbye to your personal life."
good,"Merchandised store according to flow plan and what is or isn't selling.  Tracked trends, planned layout if we were having a sale to showcase it up front.  Most enjoyable is shopping with the customer and helping then make outfits and add on to their purchases."
good,A good company to work for. They helped me through a tough time when most managers quit and I was the only manager left on the team. Gap's other store leaders came out to help and look after my team when I was not there. It was a good family environment feeling while working for Gap Inc.
good,"Hardly ever any work. The most you would do is Replenish which is basically refolding all the clothes and making the store look pretty. That was a fairly easy job but there was rarely any customers to help. If you like really easy jobs with a lot of lag time, this is a perfect job."
good,"I enjoyed working here for 11 months. However I would only recommend working in the Trafford Centre if you have a car or live relatively close with regular buses which ended up being the reason why I left, because of public transport. The tasks given are easy but hours can be long. However the pay is great and benefits are too."
good,"Loved my time here, I learned a lot about merchandising and sales, as well as how to relate to the customer in order to make sales. The only thing I didn't like about this location (I transferred from another store that I liked much better) was that some of the other associates don't put forth much effort or passion into their work, which really I felt hurt the whole team's moral."
good,"Gap is a laid back work place Great customers and crew just don't expect A lot of hours , the real bonus is your working in New Orleans is a wonderful city."
good,"A typical day in work is greeing customers, folding clothes and at the regester. The hardest part of the job in my opinon would be deficult rude customers. Overall I think the Gap is a fun cool job."
good,"A typical day brought comfort knowing how reliable and supportive we were as team. I learned how strategically solve problems. I enjoyed seeing our usual customers that would stop by just to say hi or even introduce us to a friend or family as if our customers thought of us(employees)as friends. The hardest I'd say is when we were under staff, it applies a lot pressure on those few who were working that day."
good,"Every morning they allow 5 minutes of ""you"" time to collect your thoughts. They give you your breaks in a orderly manner. Very supportive supervisors. They give you the resources you need to excel at your job."
good,"Very busy day to day, attended daily meetings with project managers, took minutes, held meetings with project managers regarding any resource constraints while trying to tackle an ongoing project."
good,"cashiering and inventory with stocking. Customer service, and management was excellent.  Co- workers were very friendly. The hardest part was watching theft.  I didn't have to rely on someone  to always help me."
good,"Gap Inc. is a great company to work for and I loved my team I worked with but not the upper management.   There seemed to be a lot of favoritism in the leadership and you were not allowed to have ideas or differrnce of opinion. You must drink the koolaid to get ahead and talk the talk.   Work is not awarded but rather who you know and if you don't challenge things you will get ahead.  "
good,great company with good benefits.  They really care about their employees and seem to really want to develop their associates to succeed.  The executives of the brand are down to earth and really want to know about the employees and how you feel working for them.
good,"Break room area quiet and cleaned.  Vending must give exact change.  People are tired not much talking, unless its about a complicated customer.  Lockers some do not open."
good,"Gap is a very friendly culture with a great work/life balance. Although the company isn't performing with outstanding numbers, every team is working extremely hard and collaboratively together to make our product better and make our customers happy."
good,"When at work, as a customer associate you will first have a minute meeting explaining the promotions, how the customer rates are and if we have any problems. You will be placed in a particular department, in my case it will be Kids and Babies majority of the time. On the K&B department, I would usually manage the floor myself or have one of my co-workers help me out in a busy day. "
good,I've had the privilege to work with the most talented group of people over the course of my Gap Inc. career. I think the current CEO is smart and a great leader not only for Gap Inc but also in specialty retail. However over the course of the last 18 months the entire management team has turned over and the company is focusing on the immediate rather than the long term direction of the company.
good,Like To Come In to Work and Have A project to do like to work with the people in this company well in the store that i work at there very energetic make the work fun...etc
good,Fun work environment with a diverse group of people that value your contribution and input. It is a large company with procedure and politics that make it difficult to make things move quickly.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. We try to make work fun when we can by providing food and games for staff during peak times.
good,"As an E-Commerce Analyst, my day to day is pretty mundane. Order audits, investigations into credit fraud, camera footage reviews. The Gap does provide a lot of opportunities for advancement, as long as you are not in the Loss Prevention Department.  There is very little accountability held towards Supervisors."
good,"The company has struggled to maintain it's customer base in recent years. They are trying to regain their competitive edge thru better designed product, but many stores will be closed in the process."
good,The GAP INC. was the best company I have worked for. They value hard work and flexibility from their workers. This was the most worker friendly environment I have ever worked for. How many companies can tout employee staying for 20 to 40 years?
good,"Après quelques mois passé au sein du GAP Picadilly, j'ai pu améliorer mon anglais. "
good,"Worked here for awhile,was a very inviting and fun place to work from the other locations and branches that I've worked. The management was very professional but always friendly and was there if you needed something."
good,"In both of these positions, I worked very closely with individuals that represent various areas and countries.  I also worked directly with individuals in the sourcing countries for the clothing.  I still keep in touch with all of these individuals to this day.  A typical day in these positions varied.  "
good,"Any shift was fun, good for artistic eye and love of clothing, allow you to work alone or with others.  Good team dynamics."
good,"The environment is not stressful or hostile and often times the managers are nice. However, the pay is minimum wage or sometimes below minimumwage"
good,"A normal day would include me greeting the customers as they came into the store and finding areas on the floor to replenish with clothing. If it came to it, I would become a cashier with the goal of converting regular customers into brand card holders and helping them complete their purchase."
good,Adore the company. Great leadership teams who are fully engaged in their roles. Collaborative work environment with a tremendous amount of variety from day to day. Interaction with all levels of senior management and consistently pushed to step outside of comfort zone.
good,Great working environment and culture of the organization. At the time I was unable to balance the commute and the difficulties of school since I was in my toughest semesters of college. I left this location because I secured an internship in my field of choice.
good,"Gap Inc. has a fast paced work environment, that allows workers to exercise their skills in many different functions. A typical day consists of picking orders, packing them, and shipping them to the customer."
good,"The supervisor assigns my position in the store. Sometimes it is as a cashier and other recovering the goods and assisting clients."
good,"I started at Gap Inc Direct just taking calls for the customer relations department, and quickly ascended to team lead and then supervisor. I then transferred to the technology side of the company as I had a proficiency in that field. As a CMS supervisor I was responsible for Avaya reporting, and all agent skilling company wide among 2 sites."
good,Everyone for the most part is friendly. Gap employees make a great team but  becomes like a family more than a team. The values of the company are great! How ever in some locations management dose not fully follow them.
good,"There is something special about this place. The people are incredible, flexibility is awesome, vibe is laid back. However, like any company, there are challenges. Stronger collaboration across brands and functions is needed badly."
good,"good agency to work for the rate of pay could be a bit more, but otherwise fine nice people too work for always polite when we speak on the telephone worked at many werehouses all over Wrexham."
good,"On a typical day of work at GAP, i would be in charge of the fitting rooms and in charge of taking clothes customers didn't want back to their proper place in the store. I always had something to do."
good,fun and lively place to work you do a lot of different jobs in a day and never do the same thing over and over such as tills fits replen .the management are really supportive and always there and a strong team atmosphere. we all pull together when needed  such for a sign of or new flow weeks . the hardest part is new flow weeks with over nights within retail you don't always just work shop opening hours we do nights to get the new flow into each section Sometimes theses nights can over run that's one down fall but over all a good starting job fun and lively place to work .
good,Gap Inc really adheres to its core values and they strive to celebrate diversity. The company culture permeates all members of the organization and is about having a great time while being very productive. Overall it was a great place to work.
good,"Dynamic environment"
good,"It's a nice place to work, more if you have not any previous experience working. this is the perfect place to start. supervisors and co-workers are good people always dealing to help. The most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction of knowing that you help costumers find what they were looking for."
good,"Durante mi experiencia en la empresa GAP conseguí adquirir infinidad de cosas empezando por un nuevo modelo de trabajo dentro de la rama dependiente de moda."
good,"This is a great job for a student trying to help pay some bills. Relatively low pay, but very flexible to work around your schedule, whether classes/another job/kids/etc."
good,"Loved job, hated they only gave us 3 weeks notice that our store closing. They did however offer a choice of a severance package or a job with a sister brand."
good,"I spend a lot of my time catering to customers helping them choose merchandise and helping them purchase, return or order merchandise. Working for Gap I learned patience and the ability to problem solve for customers in order to ensure they had the best customer experience in our store. The management was always helpful and fostered growth by allowing us to work through problems on our own as well as teaching us new procedures and projects."
good,"The people are great and the customers are even better. The pay is decent for the work that is done on a regular basis. The hours could be better, but depends much on availability."
good,Every day at Gap definitely provided your team with new challenges to help coordinate sales and positive customer experiences.
good,"Happy smiley faces."
good,"A typical day at work consist of opening the store."
good,A typical day is goings heads on with no exception. As a lead cashier you have to be very quick and alert. First thing is auditing drawers and knowing all of your products before going into the long run. To maintain success small tasks are essential at our store. Each customer is a sale and very important to our business. Credit card enrollment is beneficial to the company and as lead I have been known to have high sales in that department. It is very fast paced and every task is highly important to have a successful business for the day.
good,"Gap is committed to creating a team environment.  a typical day was filled with coaching, developing and ensuring the store environment was appealing to the customer.  The team was committed to supporting each other to achieve desired goals and maintain a fun environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job was transforming the environment for the customer and working with customers to get them what they needed."
good,"The work was physically hard, but my fellow associates made it fun."
good,The staff here are great and easy to work with. Management would always work with my schedule.
good,I worked for this company for 7 years and I loved every Minute of it one thing I didn't like about my job recently I wasn't able to have a work life balance .so I wanted to change into something where i can spend time with family and be able to balance between the two
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"Effective talent selection, training, coaching, motivating and recognizing"
good,"A basic day would be performing simple operational duties to open the store; registers, schedule printing and writing out goals for everyone including managers. If it was a shipment day I would be delegating and working ""hands on"" with processing new shipment. There would also be a one minute meeting with opening and mid-day associates to discuss goals and business. I would also be required to jump on a conference call once or twice a week with others in the area of business. Depending on the time of the season I would even have to draw out a map/floor plans of the sales floor to place future merchandise that was to come in the next few weeks. In the midst of all that my last but most important obligation was to make sure that the store as a whole ran in a safe and friendly environment for customers and also workers."
good,"I was sales assistant and cashier at the same time, I was working in Bond Street, so every day was full of people and I had a long queues for paying."
good,"Gap is a good company. Good core values, treats employees fairly."
good,"working at Gap is Fun especailly because i enjoy the reatil enviorment. The Mangers are always willing to help. Every month we do a pot luck, which helps with team bonding."
good,"Gap provides their GM's with excellent training and development opportunities. No day is the same, and one can always flex their planning & priortizing skills. Gap also provides the opportunity to work with incredible people who bring experience and a high skill set to the table."
good,"Retail is really a different world, but it was a fun/learning experience."
good,its additional experience for me to work to a multi culture company.
good,Its a great company to work for if you need a part time job. Plus the employee discount is the best. Most work hours are not that great.
good,i learn to organize cloth and provide great customer service to all customers who walk in the store.
good,"I loved working for this company it was a great start, to learn about a big and well known company as such, and help me build and improve my skills in the retail world, it diffidently taught how to work under and enormous amount of pressure during the holidays, the management team is okay for the most part most of the team is under a great amount of pressure, and that pressure gets to the sales associate and cashiers to earn and promote gap cards specially when the store meets its goal."
good,Gap inc has great ties to the community and is increasing its minimum wage. the discount is generous but in the end its still retail.
good,"GAP had various employee perks: raffles, dress up days, great discounts, etc. This is a great place to work if you enjoy customer service without the face to face interaction. As an agent you will receive the same type of callers; people seem to think that because they can't see your face that it's okay to yell. You get used to it, as an employee you are empowered to do what you can to make that customer happy, but some are insatiable. The training is extensive: learning the system to the different cuts and washes of denim. Regular management is awesome the seasonal staff, not so much. Great place if you're looking for a summer job."
good,"Très bonne école afin d’être formé à la vente."
good,"Lots of fun. Great people. Great products. Very talented designers and smart managers made for a productive, pleasant work environment."
good,Meet production scanning orders for customers and advance training is available after a few weeks.
good,"A typical day, I would do a little cleaning and straighten up before opening store and I learned how to give great customer service and make sure the customer get their needs and wants."
good,"Gap, Inc is a good place to work.  There are so many different job sand opportunities at the company that you can receive a well rounded business knowledge base."
good,"On my typical day I would work with the shipment team taking in new inventory and placing them on the sales floor. I would help customers with their selections and then complete their transactions."
good,It is a fast pace environment due to having to pack merchandise for shipping to store and having to change areas at any point. Management and staff were great to work with. There was to chance for advancement or benefits due to it being a seasonal job.
good,"Main responsibilities included receiving product shipment into the store's back stock and managing a team of up to 7 people to process and unload each box into our back stock. I learned how to facilitate work schedules based on availability and how to delegate various job tasks. Management, for the most part, did not interfere with our daily tasks unless it involved moving specific inventory out onto the sales floor. Hardest part of the job was avoiding strict fire marshall codes. During the holiday season shipment would exceed 5,000 boxes and figuring out a way to place those shipment boxes, processing tables, baker's racks, and processed clothing was sometimes impossible but management would provide us with extra hours or man power to get the job done. I would have to say the culture was the best part of that job because although we had the hardest physical tasks each and every one of us enjoyed the camaraderie and our diverse backgrounds."
good,"Generally, there is no typical day at the Gap. However, the customers always come first. From my time here, I have learned excellent customer service skills, communication skills, and organizational and time management skills. Although the business can get a little crazy and seem disorganized some days, the most rewarding part of the job is knowing I gave personalized help to a customer and knowing they are leaving the store happy."
good,"The people are so great and fun to work with, which means a lot if you are there quite often in the store working."
good,"Quality training and giving a good experience, friendly team and management. Improving business KPI's and keeping on top of standards."
good,"Awesome work environment and people, low pay like most retail jobs. Very flexible."
good,"Customer experience manager, provided excellent customer service to customers daily. Daily operations include anywhere from processing payroll, running the floor, merchandising, interviewing and hiring, training, office tasks, and scheduling."
good,"Working at the gap is very active you have something to do"
good,"Busy atmosphere to work in. A lot of divers people to work with, young and old. You'll learn team work helps get the job done effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 30% discount in the outlet stores. As well the 50% you receive at the retail stores."
good,"a typical day started with an enerjetic staff meeting, then opened the doors where shoppers eagerly searched for garments and asked oftenly for help in finding the perfect fit for the look that matched their personality. the days were normaly hectic and we cleaned constantly. I learned that although two people may look the same, the could have totally different body types, and clothes and great customer service can make a huge difference in a persons happiness. Management was fun, helpful, and always willing to assist. Co-workers were always fun, and knowledgable about the product. The hardest part about the job was working with customers that were indecisive. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist a customer in an outfit that pleased them."
good,Fun place to work with with great associates and friendly management. Really has a great team dynamic with so much room to learn and grow.
good,"A typical day:  Arrive 30 min prior to shift to meet with previous shift's management team and to set up for the day. Have stand up with the team and explain safety topics, production goals, success stories, and standard work questions. Attend to associates needs, questions, issues etc...  Meet with team leads to dive deeper into quarterly goals and expectations.  Drive the process, eliminate barriers and keep the shift moving.  Meet with incoming shift at the end of the day and send out the daily turnover ( performance, issues, safety incidents, barriers, etc...) "
good,"coming in to work and checking inventory and making sure the floor had what it was needed. What I learned here was coping with workings and getting along with them while getting what was needed to be done in a days work. Hardest part of the jobs was that only during Christmas it gets hard since it gets hectic, but we all learn to understand and still get through the day. Enjoyable part of the job was lunch time and working with employees that made the day fun."
good,Working here was really fun! Lots of laughs and great discounts.
good,I am a Specialist in the big boy department. My typical day is to recover and replenish the area and put out new product in a timely manner. I love to do my job because I get to interact with people and reorganized the section and make it my own. Hardest part of this job is persuading the customers to get a GAP credit card.
good,"folding, attaching price tags, steaming. Serving customers, being very polite. the hardest thing, of course, is that I had to be on my legs all day."
good,"Great place to work, if you are with the right team, you will love this job."
good,"If you're looking for a job with only 10-20 hours a week, this would be a great place for you. Staff are friendly and customer oriented. Also they reward you for doing well. They shift people to all positions, so you never get bored of doing one thing all the time."
good,GAP was a great place for me to gain a wide variety of skills.  Great product too.
good,"Strong company with a strong set of core values. Pay is above industry standard, and the company is always open to try new things. Also many of the individuals who work for the corporation are very knowledgeable and very willing to help there peers grow."
good,"I enjoy the company atmosphere. I took away great selling techniques from management. I enjoy the people that I work with, however typically there is only one sales associate working at a given time, unless it is during holiday, so there is not much interaction between us sales associates. I enjoy being able to sell the clothing with the knowledge I am given."
good,"I learned cashier handling, how to maintain a wall full of jeans and became head fitting room person. "
good,"A typical day at work, would start of with a meeting to get job assignment and updates on changes or policies.  I usually worked with a team in receiving, unloading cartons off of trailer and sorting them onto pallet boards.  We would scan the cartons, using a handheld Rf unit, into the system so that it would be added to our inventory and ready to put into the racks in the warehouse.  The hardest part of the job would be when the cartons weighed more than 25 lbs and/or would be wet or smashed.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that once you were given your assignment, you were trusted to do your job and wouldn't have anyone over your shoulder all the time.  Besides that, I worked with a lot of good people, no matter what department I was sent too."
good,"i like my job i get to help customer's and see them leave our store happy, i replenish any merchandise that is missing a size."

good,I really enjoy with my co workers and the management team at the gap.
good,I really enjoyed the hard work and labor involved in loading and unloading inventory. I liked the physical aspect of this job and would recommend anyone to try it. This job allowed me to relate to labor jobs and understand the industry
good,"Working for Gap is enjoyable because, for the most part, the employees and the customer are great. I love the environment and the values Gap has. Upper level management however can make you feel unappreciated and like there's no room for advancement or learning. "
good,A typical day at the gap starts off with our one minute meetings about our goals. We pursue our task and end our day with checking out and saying our good byes.
good,"Typical day at work started with opening store and opening registers to be ready for daily operations. We always have a great amount of customers shopping at our store. "
good,I have worked at 5 different locations and each one has  been a pleasure to work for. Management was great! The hardest part of the job was to sell the Gap card and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find an item they really wanted.
good,"* Responsible for all of the pre-production and production for Gap Europe's Women's Woven's Category "
good,"Days at the Gap are never that long for me.  They usually consist of a 3-5 hour shift with a small break.  I usually work mornings or nights doing whatever needs to be done (back stock, replenishment, sort shipment, run register...).  "
good,A typical day at work was good. I would always help out customers and be a back up at the cashier.
good,"I greatly enjoyed this job, but I could not support myself on it alone and had to seek employment elsewhere.  "
good,"Enjoyed working with others and learning new things , the companys insurance was amazing and affordable. If the desire was to move up the company, managment would set you in the right direction."
good,Picking
good,"Gap Inc is a very fun, and hard working company. Work hard, play hard."
good,"You wont make much money working retail, but you get to work with a lot of fun people on your team, do a variety of jobs, and become a shopping expert :)"
good,"Gap is a great place to work and really get involved in all aspects of what it means to be a retail manager. It's like owning your own small business, we're you're encouraged to ""run it like you own it."""
good,"I started out at Baby Gap/Gap Kids as a sales associate and was eventually promoted to management. May co-workers were great and we had some really great times together. This was many years ago, I cannot speak for how things are now."
good,"1. Open or close store payroll, Scheduling, Selling, Training and motivating team,"
good,"I only got to work for Black Friday, but I clocked in and went to the manager to see what I was to do and he put me on the Men's Shirt section, and I had to clean up the presentation and fold clothes and help customers who had questions or requests."
good,"-easy traffic during non-holiday months, but very fast-paced during the holidays"
good,clean the store before it opens and make sure all is in order before our doors open.
good,Loved working with the team members and interacting with the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is restocking the sales floor, making sure that merchandise is availible for our customers and also selling to and assisting our customers.Typicals nights at work will be opening boxes and processing shipment, and assisting with with visual or merchandising. When ther are new hires, I train or teach them the different reqirments of the stock room and how to use diffferent machines and electronicsneeded on the job. Their is nothing hard about my job. I perform my dudies very well and im a quick learner. The most enjoyable part of my job is working as a team with my employees."
good,GAP Inc. instills their vision and values in everything they do. The culture they have created within the store is unique and creates a great atmosphere for all employees.
good,I learned more about retail. the managers and co workers are friendly.The hardest part about the job is trying to hurry and get to each zone fold all the clothes before customers walk in. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know some of the customers.
good,"Great company to work for, love the work life balance. Management can be capricious."
good,"this company has many uplifting and positive morals. only draw back is you don't get paid very well for you hard work, but if your willing to work for peanuts til your promoted 6 years later. Its a good job none the less"
good,"a typical day at works include climbing ladders folding clothes, and a lot of walking. co owrkers for the most part helpful and friendly, management very strict"
good,Great Coworkers. Management tries to help you out. There is room for growth in the company if you come to work and do more than the requirements.
good,"Arrived got written pick orders, worked independently, lots of walking"
good,"A typical day at The Gap would be very slow paced during the week but during the holidays and during very big sales the store would be extremely busy with customers, asking for specific items and specific questions they might have had. The management was very easy going and easy to talk to but they handled there job well. I would say the hardest part of the job was fixing the store back and putting clothes back where they belonged at the end of the day or night."
good,"Work days at Old Navy are pretty good with tasks that are easy to manage and co-workers that are pleasant to work with. I have learned at lot about the diiferent styles of clothing that I had never knew before I worked here. All the managers are very nice and try to help you out in any way they can, both professionally and personally. My only regret is that business has been dropping and I'm not sure if I can stay. I've been here for a very long time and would like to stay, but if business does not improve, I may have to look elsewhere."
good,"A typical day at the Gap involves helping a wide variety of shoppers, folding clothes, cleaning, and organizing. The management staff makes it an easy place to work. Everyone who works there has been nothing but friendly. I have learned how to engage with customers, sell merchandise, and how to multitask! The Gap is always busy! It has been a pleasure working there! I have met lots of people who I hope to keep in touch with!"
good,"Gap was my first job in retail. I started off as a stock associate and in 3 months was promoted to Stock Manager. It was a high volume store, but while very challenging it was also a fun environment to be in. Working in GAP is what made me realize I would like to make this my career"
good,Gap Body was a concept store and at the time I was recruited only a half dozen had been opened throughout the United States.
good,"Would get my work schedule every two weeks. I would sometimes come in before the store opened, to clean the store. During the day I would rotate positions at the cash register, the fitting room, or a runner who ran clothes back onto the sales floor. After the store closed I would stay behind to clean up the store and prep it for opening the next day. Everyone got along together just fine for the most part, and the managers were very helpful in trying to work with your personal schedule."
good,Great people to work with. The job itself is hard work. Co-Workers are awesome. The constant 50 lb. lifting was the hardest part of this job.
good,"I picked up the position with Gap, do have a little extra money during the holidays. After all the hussell and bussell I decided to stay because I enjoy the environment and working there."
good,Gap is a fun fast paced work enviroment. Great people great product and never a dull moment.
good,Fun and engaging. Meet new and different people. Character builder. Teaches you how to interact with people and lead people.
good,"A typical work day at the Gap usually consists of many different things depending on the day and shift. Customer service is of course the number one priority. Being able to check customers out in a timely manner. Making sure the store looks neat and clean. Processing clothes from fitting room that were unwanted. Marking down merchandise on sale days. Changing promotion signs on days when sales change. Doing replenishment throughout the day when needed. I have a learned a lot about customer service from this job and enjoy helping people with their shopping needs. My management staff are beyond amazing. They are all great people and I respect them all very much. The hardest part of my job would be pushing sales towards credit cards, but I still make an attempt to help customers save when they can ! The part I enjoy most about working here would be my co-workers. It's such a relaxing work place and the people there are all great."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Gap Outlet. I loved my co-workers, managers and just the job. I had to leave because of moving but I hated to go. They make you feel like you are part of a team and teach skills that will benefit you in the future. It really is a team effort. Also you are able to get discounts at Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy and all the retail, outlet and factory stores. It really is a great place to work!"
good,"Great training programs, started as a sales associate and worked my way to Asst. Manager of many stores throughout Orlando area."
good,"I enjoy working at gap, everyday is challenging and exciting. It’s a work place where teamwork is a must. The people that I’m surrounded by makes it that much better. The fact that more people depend on me makes me work even harder. My only downfall about this place is the inconstancy of the hours."
good,Gap is a very welcoming environment and made me feel at home right away. Management team is awesome and it is a very upbeat and fun place to work.
good,"A typical day at work includes maintaining store cleanliness, replenishing store items, changing signages, managing fitting rooms, assisting customers and working together with other coworkers. Through this job opportunity, I was able to strengthen my communication skills, and teamwork skills. Additionally, I became familiar with the store environment,  and upholding retail employee expectations. All workers at GAP are extremely outgoing, friendly, supportive, helpful and passionate. The most difficult part of the job is managing your time wisely - you are required to prioritize customers, while working on other tasks. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to interact with various customers, and your co-workers on a daily basis."
good,"Its a great company. They work with a lot of charities and the employees are all really cool people. They got great energy and were nice. Management were always leading by example, they were great at teaching you how to be better at your job, and the workplace was very clean and organized."
good,"Must be flexible to work at Gap with constant leadership changes. Also employee moral is lacking due to low profit."
good,"I worked there for almost 2 years, it’s a great job for sales experience and customer service experience. You will learn a lot about people and performance."
good,"Working in retail is always a hit and miss. Luckily working at Gap is not so bad, the managers are very well organized and keep up with the employees. Although after the holiday season it slows down and hours get cut drastically."
good,Working at the Gap is fun. Flexible hours.  But it could be a little stressful especially if you don’t meet your goals.  The company tend to push the Gap credit card to sell to customers and also offer the Bright rewards membership.  So as a worker there you need to work on the credit card and the membership.  Make sure you are able to offer these to customers.  That is the stressful part working at the Gap.
good,"Hired here as a full time associate towards the end of July 2018 after repairing the NDC building. At first, it was a great job. The staff really made it worth sticking around. Management is fair and accommodating. I felt very valued as an employee there.Management was always ready to engage and create a pleasant work environment. Everyone was very friendly and never missed a beat. I made alot of friends during my time employed here."
good,"Banana republic is a hectic store sometimes because the line gets really long and there’s also the pressure of getting cards and emails so you have to be able to balance being a fast worker but also completing your tasks which I have no problem doing. It could be overwhelming but if you like retail and working with people with similar interests, this is the job for you"
good,"The work there was very staright forward which makes for an easy understanding of what to do and time to understand that. The manangement team was great, they let you know what you had to do and exactly when and where."
good,"Like many stalwart retailers, Gap is at a place of transition, seeking to align its business practice with its brand perception. Change is a careful process, taking more than good ideas and authentic ideals."
good,"During my time at GAP, I had a good time working there even though it can seem like a lot of work. The managers at the time were okay except for one who always said rude things about customers and act very unprofessional when it comes to treating their employees such as yelling at them, saying inappropriate things, somewhat racist remarks?, and made them feel very uncomfortable."
good,"I have never worked in a warehouse environment before. My experience working at Gap was an informative experience. I think if you enjoy fast paced, hard labor and a challenge, this is the job for you. Good luck to all!"
good,the gap was my first job experience and i just liked the fact that i was making my own money and had no debt. For a first job it is not a bad job but i do not like warehouse jobs anymore.
good,A work environment with management that cares about it's employees. Everyone always has a positive and attitude and will to help out when needed. Very low stress work environment.
good,"Great customers, leadership is open. Volunteer work was encouraged through the company, which was great — worked with some great co-workers. Scheduling could have been a little better, but it is fine."
good,"Line supervisors can be a bit overbearing but upper management is supportive in promoting self motivation and independence. The pay and benefits for full time employees is decent considering the cost of living. Very casual workplace in dress and culture, most coworkers are friendly or indifferent."
good,"I love how GAP has been flexible with hours, the management team has a very good system set up for employees. I feel that the work place is fair and everyone can be heard. There will be really good days and really bad days in terms of customer experiences. I have learned a lot about how much a good management team matters at a workplace in order to be able to create a good experience for customers within a company. My co-workers made my experience at work more enjoyable aside from how relaxing a typical work day can be when it is not on the the holidays."
good,Great benefits. Must have great customer service skills. Lots of recent changes in both corporate leadership and store level management. Some unrealistic expectations. Retail schedule can be challenging.
good,"I wish the holidays were a bit longer, and security seems sketchy but all in all its a fantastic place to work in. It pays well and there are breaks. The staff are always really nice and happy to help others within the team."
good,It was a really nice place to work at. The manger was very understanding. everyone was treated nicely and like close friends. The environment was very chill.
good,over the years i learned much about the business and met many interesting people over the years. Working for GAP is a great place to grow and build confidence
good,"GAP,INC made training very easy and great encouragement. Management were one of the best , although the pay could be better, it's a laid back company and fun to work for. I left due to personal reasons, not work related."
good,"The job was a good job. The only issue is that you have to perform like a monkey for your hours. Overall I found out me and retail no longer mix, I didn't find enjoyment out of being pressured everyday to sell credit cards to every single customer that walked in in order to get Gaps wages up for the week. I honestly cared about these people's credit and didn't want them to end up with had credit like me but I had to lie for the job. Which isn't bad if you don't like it. It was just a personal thing. Another personal thing is that I hated one of managers for dear life. She was the most infuriating person I ever met. She would badger me for not working fast enough while her good friends in another section were doing almost nothing talking to each other. Mostly the pay was horrible. You most likey worked only 2 days a week. So it was most people's second job and I don't like having 2 jobs."
good,"Work place was fine, customer care is very important. Didn't realize the effort it took in creating family friendly environment since I'm using to be the consumer and not the actual person providing a service. I would say the hardest part was signing people up for store charge cards although may people declined politely a lot of people are in debt and sometime took offense in offering what they considered to be yet ' another bill'. Co workers were great and offered to help out , mangers pitched in when needed."
good,Can be a high stress environment if you let it but you are given all the tools to be successful. Culture is a little uncertain at the moment due to some brands splitting into another company in 2020.
good,Loved working but the pay was less than expected  but was a great environment to work in I loved the people I worked with they were very embarrassing to new employees and made them feel at home
good,"Gap Outlet was a good job. The management are very supportive. There was always something to do. Ongoing training. Opportunities to learn new skills. Like with any retail work, the hours are not fixed or guaranteed. It's all driven by sales."
good,"Gap has been a good part-time job, however they employ too many part time people so getting scheduled enough is difficult. Everyone was very welcoming."
good,"The teams worked well together and assisted with all questions about the position."
good,"- It can be boring if it is early in the weekday, on Black Friday it is extremely busy"
good,For any young kid looking for a great first job this is the ideal place for your journey. Great teachers and motivated supervisors. The tools I leaned I. The gap have stuck with me all these years(the perfect fold).
good,A typical day at work was slow paced just fixing the clothes on racks and on floor. I learned fashion and how to style them. learned how to interact with customers. the hardest part of the job was cleaning it after we were done closing the store.
good,"My typical shift included greeting cutsomers, organiizing the floor and letting people know about the various sales and items we had. Since the store changed so often, and the shifta we got so spread out, it was hard to figure out where things where meant to go for even the most veteran workers."
good,Working for Gap Inc. is a great opportunity. The environment is laid back and the passion for the job is shown by the employees. We took on the role of the job and exemplified the motto. Managers were great. They were flexible and easy to talk to
good,Customer service oriented retail. Spend lots of time engaging with customers and being enthusiastic about the product of the store while also keeping to store cleaning standards. Aside from this the job is very easy going and Gap does great at making the workplace feel welcome and fun.
good,"Generally speaking, the workplace environment and culture are great if you like creative and progressive co-workers. Being fashion retail, it breeds young creative energy. The opportunities can be endless if you are ambitious. You can be promoted to some of the highest levels of management in a few years given the right timing and opportunities. The benefits are outstanding. The compensation is decent. One thing to note, this being in the competitive retail industry, be ready to work hard and put in long hours when necessary. So its imperative to like your job or career path."
good,this was my first every retail job and i worked my way up to being a cashier and at that one of the top cashier. I was one of the top performers with opening a gap card.
good,"Friendly people. Great company. Flexible hours especially with my school schedule. Hardest part may be dealing with nasty customers, like any other retail job, and keeping your cool. Your managers are always there to help though."
good,"Unloading boxes, setting up walls, changing mannequins, doing window sets, replenishing floor with product, completing sales, awesome discounts with a great management team."
good,"Easy job however the company sets impossible standards.  They don't train their employees properly, and they don't give all the tools needed to succeed."
good,"I enjoy working a Gap. This is my first job and I have learned a lot from the management. Reaching the sales goals was competitive, but the leadership was very helpful and encouraging when providing feedback to do better."
good,gap was a pretty good place to work. it was fairly slow paced and almost every manger there is super nice. its also a really good job foe someone in school because of the flexible scheduling
good,It was a very interpersonal place to work. Everyone was always friendly and inviting. Holidays are always difficult in the retail environment. Its was frustrating not know what would be arriving on shipments each day. You could never guarantee product would be arriving for a requesting customer.
good,"Working at GAP, consisted of making sure that the work area is kept contained and as tidy as possible in order to help the customers have a very smooth shop. It is also extremely important to help the customers during their shop and allowing them to know if there are any sort of discounts or sales occurring. The workplace overall in GAP, was extremely good everyone was very welcoming and it almost felt as if we were a little family. The most hardest part of the job was doing a closing shift which consisted of putting all the clothes in their designated area and making sure that the store was at a good high standard for the next day."
good,"Pending the team you're part of Gap is a flexible, enjoyable work space. I took many learning and development classes to grow and work better on my team. Gap is very supportive for getting an education and will support the endeavors you choose to work on while employed with them. Managing other teams expectations and revamping process and procedures for the company was tiresome, tedious and included our entire global team to support and brainstorm. The culture at Gap is very inclusive and supportive. My manager and director always had my best interest at heart and would support me with anything I was interested in perusing."
good,"I worked at a small store with 3 other managers, not including me and great sales associates. I came to work because of the people I met on a daily basis."
good,"Typical factory job, maybe one of the easier ones. Worst part is doing the same thing every day, but that’s factory life. ‘Peak’ season can bring some serious money if you work the extra hours offered. A steady paycheck."
good,It is a great company but forcing employees to work when they are not available got to be too much. The atmosphere is general pretty easy going except that they monitor every move you make.
good,"- best part of the job is to deal with customers with different cultural back grounds."
good,"If you love fashion, its a great place to start your career in the industry. Even as a cashier you'll learn about the business of running a store and participate in many team building exercises that will help you pursue any career you want."
good,"I believe Gap is a great place to work if you like a fast paced environment, customer engagement, and learning about fashion products. I would say that the only downside to work for Gap is the pressure to get GapCards, but that's pretty common with most big retail companies."
good,"Having been in the retail industry for 15 years, I wish I had started with Gap 15 years ago! Awesome company to work for! "
good,"Constant hours, great pay (starting at $10/hour), they will work around you, awesome work environment, great and organized management. The three short months I worked here were very enjoyable, I left to become a full-time student in architecture."
good,Very busy and multi tasking and driving the result to make the daily sale goal.  I learn to be a Leader and great Mentor and coach to educating all the employees under me.  The harder part of the job was the high numbers of credit cars to open by the daily sales goal projections.  The most enjoyable part was the interacting day by day with different persons and different culture.
good,At the location I worked at and under the manager I had at the time. Gap was a wonderful place to work. Friendly atmosphere and easy work environment.
good,"If you are a ""people person"" then this is definitely the job for you. Most of my managers were absolutely fantastic and my coworkers were even better. If you aren't a ""people person,"" needless to say, the job will be torture for you. The hours are flexible and the work is extremely easy but if you don't like people, go to another job."
good,I have worked for Gap Inc. in a freelance role for two years now and I find it to be an enjoyable company to work for. The compensation is competitive and the benefits are great.
good,The GAP call center gives their qualified employees an option to work from home. Those who do not work from home experience a positive and active atmosphere at the home office.
good,"Management at its best by boosting an employee's morale and willpower and rewarding them with various propitious incentives. "
good,GAP is a great place to work for first time retail workers. They are very relaxed and there's always something to do. You get to talk to so many people and get to know your coworkers too.
good,It was a fast paced job with many areas to focus on.  The customer is the priority of course with the focus on trying to sell them more.  There was so much to learn and not always time to learn it. I loved the people i worked with and for but not always the environment we were in.
good,GAP gave me new skills to help customers with any questions about the clothing and membership card with benefits. The management was so helpful.......
good,"A typical day at work is customer service, constant training, supervisor advise, building a better workplace for your environment.  Assistance is always there."
good,"The employees are always kind and friendly, and they are very organized. You always know what you are supposed to be doing and the leaders are never rude or demeaning."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits."
good,"Loved working at the GAP but pay is not enough. "
good,"High expectations on presentation. When you think something is good, they find something wrong in order for it to be even better. Loved working here though."
good,"Ho lavorato presso Gap Italy nel periodo invernale dei saldi, in cui l'affluenza di clientela è massima e quindi anche il lavoro è molto dinamico e piacevolmente frenetico. Le mie mansioni sono state quella di gestione del magazzino e di assistenza ai clienti, e ho avuto modo di affinare così le mie capacità organizzative e di vendita. L'azienda è molto ben strutturata e il team di lavoro mi ha accolto calorosamente fin da subito."
good,Working for the Gap was good when I was younger. The hours were very flexible. Meet great people and learned a lot about retail. Great place to work when I was there
good,Gap Inc was one of my very first jobs.  Whoever said retail sales is easy is crazy. But it taught me a lot in regards of hard work and skills I still hold dear til this day.
good,"Professional and supportive workplace. The office is quiet, and there's a strong work/life balance. There can be a frustrating lack of communication between teams, leading to workflow issues or wasted time spent on projects sent through prematurely."
good,A highly favored company  because of their ability  to know what people want . They give you a flexible schedule that helps you able to go on with every day's life example for school if you have a child or just for family and events.
good,"Great place to work, just gets a little political at times. Amazing work life balance, career growth opportunities, and people who work there that genuinely care about your well being.  Compared to other retail companies in the Bay area (trying to keep up with the tech companies), Gap underpaid."
good,"Great part - time opportunity; Gap gives you the ability to learn and grow within the company. However, direction and communication of management could be better."
good,The work life balance is the most difficult part of job. You will have to work a lot more than 40 hours consistently. The best part of job is your hard work does pay off in bonuses and Promotions.
good,"There was a lot to do, but plenty of payroll and support to ensure the job was done. The company believes in training their people. Good vacation time."
good,"I worked there as a seasonal employee during Christmas season. It was a little difficult for me to adhere to the dress code, of wearing Gap or Gap similar clothing. That was mainly due to the lack of plus size clothing(they are better now) We received discounts for Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy. There was no wait time before using the discount. We all had a undesignated, designated area in the parking garage, so all employees who closed the store could exit together, and never walk alone to their vehicles."
good,"I appreciate that I always have somewhere to work during my school breaks, which I have done for the past two years and it's a great place to get customer service experience."
good,"A typical day would be assisting customers locating items, providing customer service, cash management at the registers. "
good,GAP can be an enjoyable place to work as long as you have the right mind set. It is a decent job for a high school or college student. It teaches you how to act and be in the professional world. I enjoyed my time at GAP and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a job.
good,"If you're looking for flexible hours and a place to develop your retail skills, this is the place. Over a typical day, you'll be able to do things from cashing out customers to selling credit programs and putting fashion first."
good,"Calls consisted of customer calling in to track orders and help with styles, promotion questions or web issues. The hardest part is trying to satisfied a customer that is unhappy about rracking status."
good,Help customers find what they were looking for whether for themselves or for a gift. Day to day management of inventory and merchandising to keep store fresh
good,"Overall, Gap does help someone to grow as a person socially; however, there needs to be more training to grow within the company. The Gap is a great place to learn how to manage your emotions and be prepared for different situations. A typical day at the Gap would include reaching individual sales goals, store goals and team goals. Most of the co-workers are friendly and are willing to help out and some of the managers are willing to help out as well if needed. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a smile on your face even if the customer is not correct and is being rude. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see the smiles on the kids faces as well as the parents that are regular shoppers because you provided great customer service."
good,"A typical day working at GAP for me generally starts at 4am, I work on the Brand side of the store so we run the shipment line, sort and place products. I am in charge of back of house, keeping it neat and in order is a daily responsibility for me. Overnighters happen almost weekly, which consist of store moves, and visuals."
good,Great environment/atmosphere to work around. Supportive management and team that will always motivate you to do your best.
good,The place was relaxed environment. I had the opportunity to work extra hours when needed. I would cleaned in work spaces and neat and accurate inventory rooms
good,goood place I learned to work fast and organized. I learned how to do visuals and to cater kd any ones needs. I get to work on time every day. Although hours are not enough.
good,I give my  customer service knowledge to Gap. I learned so many things from working in the stores. I loved my co workers and still are friends with many of them. I think the hardest part of the job is not much room to grow. BLE and CSE should really be full time jobs so much to do.

good,I really enjoyed my short time at The Gap my supervisor made accomplishing my daily quota/task very simple. This was a very clean work place with very little incidents happening as a result of poor workplace clean up. The work hours were great. And the work was very fast paced to make sure that the employees stay productive.

good,"My typical day consists of merchandising of product, team leading, customer service, shipment handling and signage coordination. I've learned quite a bit about the interworkings of retail and how to operate on a budget. The management is respectful and approachable with an overall ""can-do"" attitude. Co workers are generally positive towards work and very friendly. The most challenging part of the job is performing store operations while simultaneously customer servicing with a relatively small staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is taking initiative with sales and seeing the customers respond positively."
good,"los días algo complicados son los festivos o por temporadas los cuales se trabaja bajo presión. "
good,Good pay rate for the position. There are tons of info to remember with their extensive branding outlets. The main downfall is that most of the positions are apparently seasonal

good,"Great processes and one of the best places to learn the retail business. Everyone should spend some time working for Gap, Inc., at some point in there career."
good,"I loved working at Gap, the customers always had story to tell and I had ears to listen.  I learned something different from each and every one.  There was days were I just wanted to quit such as when a customer got in my face and screamed at me and then I had days like I spend my whole shift helping a mom and her twin daughters find an outfit for Easter.  Overall, I only quit because of school but I would love to have it back."
good,"Working at Gap, I learned all of the ins and outs of retail. It is a great company to work for. Everyone else who works there in management feels the same, therefore leaving slim chance of advancement in the company."

good,"A typical day consisted of general warehouse duties such as picking and packing out going orders, helping with special projects for ""pop up"" stores, and assisting with inventory control duties. The environment was a clean warehouse setting working with hundreds of other associates, but still able to make acquaintances while meeting production requirements. The hardest part of the job was walking the four floors of stairs on certain days, and the most enjoyable part was down time which allowed casual interaction with the supervisor or new employees."
good,"I love working for the Gap inc., every store I've been to, working with them is awesome.  So much fun, however it is quite difficult to move up within the company.  Doing brand work is great, shipments are stressful but with the right group, it's a breeze.  It can be tough work but they encourage positive attitudes, which make all the difference."
good,Good company to work for. Visual merchandising was the focus and what I learned most from my 6 years with the company.  It was also my most enjoyable part along with the customer service level provided.

good,"knowledgeable about new trend and fashion , strong communication skills . Enjoy working in a team environment . Help resolve issues and balance a number of customer ."
good,Its a fun place to work. Coworkers and management are nice and it is an easy going environment. Employee discount is great and works across all the brands. One down side is having on-call shifts which ruin your entire day and they are usually not needed because the store is always over payroll hours.
good,I loved working for Gap Inc. I worked there for 2 years - the only issue I had working there was the management. The General Manager was incredibly rude and talked to you like you were stupid. I loved my coworkers but the managers were terrible.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. My managers and coworkers were friendly and lively which created a very peaceful and happy environment. Working as a sales associate within this company granted you the experience of more than one job duty. Your tasked changed daily and sometime multiple times within a day. This kept the workday interesting and it was never stagnant."
good,Great co-workers and supportive management. the hardest part of the job was the constant pressure to obtain GAP cards; the most enjoyable part was the discount and the supporitve so-workers.
good,"love it. "
good,"even if you are not in a merchandising/inventory management or store ops position the reactive nature of the business permeates the entire business. This can be stressful and fun. The atmosphere is more young, dynamic and creative. People are smart and not serious. The pace is fast. Growth is a given."
good,A great company to work for! They do whatever they can to make their employees happy. Lack of payroll can sometimes hurt business and work load.

good,"I enjoyed assisting customers and giving them insight on gap deals and promotions. Pretty steady work pace, sometimes busy, fun and laid back work environment. Management is awesome. They actually make you feel wanted. Co workers are all friendly, we all work as a team. The hardest part of the job would be to try and sell certain products but the most enjoyable part is working with the team and being able to converse with new people everyday."

The staff and management were awesome made the job very fun and easy especially when it came to dealing with all the tourist which I would have to say was the most difficult part of the job. Just working for the company was the best part of the job."
good,On a normal day I was able to learn many tasks to improve myself. I was valued for my input and able to progress in the organization.
good,"azienda dinamica e attiva, ambiente di lavoro piacevole e stimolante. team unito."
good,"As an employee of the stock team/shipment, a typical day at work (4am-1pm) my team and I take in new inventory and replenish the store. We make sure there are size runs out of every clothing item. We sensor the highest price points such as denim and logo. Management is very helpful and always willing to give a hand if needed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the working with people that I consider best friends and seeing customers smile when they find something they love."
good,Great place to work and to shop. I enjoyed working for this company.
good,A typical day at the Gap is basically a good day. As soon as you get there you will have to report to your L.O.D( Leader On Duty) so that they can tell you all the promotions that are going on. After the sales rally is time to put to work your selling skills to promote all the items. Co-workers play a big role during your shift because when you need an clothes item and you are in the cash register they go and get it. This job is based on team work without team work it would not be the Gap. The most enjoyable part of the job is by seeing the customers that I help leave the store with a smile in their face.
good,"Gap Brand is currently going through significant changes, which effect many employees negatively. Many processes are not in place. Although it is a great company to work for, there are a lot of opportunities within the brand to make life better for many."
good,This is a strong retail company. The best retail training I received throughout my career.

good,Gap has a great corporate culture.  The tenure of people that have been there shows the stability of the company add how it has succeeded for over 40 years.
good,My typical day at work included standing around waiting for someone to attempt to steal from the store. The hardest part of the job was standing around while there was little to no traffic in the store leaving less room for potential shoplifters.
good,"People are great, environment is perfect for anyone who likes fast paced work places. I learned a lot about customer service and the retail business. I enjoy coming to work, I just  wish I could work more than I am scheduled. 5 hours a week doesn't support much."
good,I love the environwement very professional. The management is very confidental and respectful.
good,"Well, I have to admit interacting with so many different types of people was pretty a interesting experience. Sometimes I had to deal with lots of grouchy people, but overall it was pretty satisfying when I was able to help most people find what they were looking for. Seeing a happy customer made me happy. The team at the store I worked in was great; everyone was really nice. Though I was only hired on contract, so I didn't really have a chance to move forward with the company. I knew it was only a short stint, but overall it was pretty great. Closings were hard since the store I worked in was huge, but in the end you learn to optimize your time and work as a team to close quickly. Overnight shifts were pretty fun too."
good,Be on the floor helping customers find anything they are looking for. If they dont know what they are looking for then I would suggest some items.
good,"My shifts there included greeting, assisting and thanking Customers. I would assist with shipment, floor and wall sets. I got along well with co-workers and management team. I worked when called in on a day off as well. I was always early. The hardest part of the job was trying to undo shipment out on the floor, working between Customers.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with and meeting new people. I do not have any issues with speaking to strangers and making them comfortable with their apparel choices. It warmed my heart to make them happy."
good,Working at the Gap I have improved my time Management Skills as well as my customer service skills. My boss Trust  that I can do my job with out him having to check on my every hour. I enjoy Making the customers happy .
good,"A typical day at work begins when I come in a few minutes early.  This allows me to hang up my coat and put my purse in my locker.  I grab an available walkie-talkie and headset, then clock in directly at the time I am due to start working.  Then, I seek out a manager or assistant manager, who then gives me the lowdown on how well we are sale-wise and promotion-wise.  They give me my basic instructions for the shift, and then send me on my way.  For the first few days I worked at Gap, I was instructed to work in our Kids and Baby section, which does not allow me to work at the register or the fitting rooms.  I mostly would straighten and sort the products on the tables, price and relocate items that come in from returns, and greet and assist customers.  "
good,This was a great company that offered excellent pay and benefits. I was also able to travel to many store openings to set up and learn from others.
good,I would've loved to stay but unfortunately I had to move. Working at Gap is so much fun. Everyone was so positive and happy like me! The only thing I can say is that I surely learned how to fold clothes better and it made me love customers more.
good,As a telephone rep for online shopping I encountered a large diversity of people. This makes for a very exciting work environment.

good,"Gap is one of the stores which is quite expensive, but still made some profits. People always went there as the clothes was a good quality and also followed the latest trends."
good,"Everyday at work is always a new experience. The best part of my current job is helping people find exactly what they're looking for or something close to it, and seeing the wonderful smiles on customers' faces when you are successful in efforts to helping them. Work is always equal among the employees, and everyone is always willing to help one another. Management is helpful and understanding. The most difficult part of my current job is developing an understanding of the different procedures in being at register other than that everything else is for the most part easy."
good,there is never a typical day at Gap Kids which I love because you can never get bored with your job.
good,"I had the most wonderful General Manager. He gave me advancement opportunities as well as consistent and frequent feedback on my performance. With his leadership he has made me a better service person and gave me the knowledge on how to grow your business and brand. Great atmosphere with workers, many had a can do attitude and a willingness to work so the store could meet goals as well as employees meeting their own personal goals. Most enjoyable part of working here was the management I was able to work hands-on with. They were like a well-oiled machine and brought success and harmony to that store."
good,"Fast paced, great atmosphere for work, possible advancement, etc"
good,"Hello, "
good,"A typical day involved a lot of assisting and recommendations towards the customer, Controlling fitting rooms and greeting as well as folding clothes. I learned more about myself and working with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was remembering clothing locations as they frequently changed things around. The most enjoyable part was seeing the new clothing they released for each season. Management was decent as the co-workers were as well."
good,fun job for single person but no real family life possible because of required hours and length of shifts
good,"I worked in our inbound department.  I would work on a team two days a week unloading and receiving merchandise.  Three days out of the week I would drive a stand up forklift to put the received merchandise away.  On occasions if inbound was slow I would volunteer to work out of department, such as shipping/picking/or stocking.  Hardest part of the job was working in a trailer during the summertime.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  almost all of us have worked together between 15-30yrs at Gap."
good,It was the best work enviorment I have really ever worked in. people were really helpful when I had questions training. a typical work day was organizing and keeping the store clean and looking its best for the customers. management was exceptional no complaints with that the enjoyable part was keeping up on all the fashions. and helping people find what they needed. hardest part of the job would probably have been fitting rooms on a really busy day. I really liked working at GAP.
good,Typical day would be interacting with customers to encourage sales of product. You would assist with opening fitting rooms and checking people out at the cash register. You were expected to encourage people to open a brand card.
good,"I enjoyed my time here. Of course Black Friday and the busy days of summer were taxing, but the fellow employees are so enjoyable to work with and the back room is like being with family. The part of the job that made leaving necessary is the inconsistency in hours. In a tourist based town summer you have more hours than your body can handle and in the late winter/early spring, I was only getting 4 hours a week."
good,Work on sales floor with customers and a staff and we work toward the common goal of good service and meeting our daily sales goal.
good,Gap attracts very talented individuals who are creative and passionate about creating a fruitful work experience.  
good,The managers are really nice and the work environment is great.  The Gap very crowded during holidays and you always have something to do so you will never be bored.
good,"Co-workers were the best part of being there as well as helping customers. Management was mostly okay except for Store Manager, did not care about work/life balance. But that depends on location."
good,"Great culture, great people. Opportunity for growth available, awesome benefits. "
good,Been here for almost 10 years. Good values and culture. Great benefits. Good work/life balance.
good,"I loved working at the Gap when I did, the staff were amazing and everyone worked as a team. Unforgettably a new manager came from a different Gap, and we lost our whole team including key holders in a matter of months. But before this occurred it was the best job I've ever had."
good,"I really Enjoyed Gap,Inc the typical work day would be servicing customers either on the floor,fitting rooms and, at the check out desk. Helping them find items that was best suited for them or the person they would be shopping for,working with my co-workers and management as a team,so that we are all on the same page with customer satisfaction. I learned different was to talk and responsed to different type of people,and how different approaches on how to increase my sales. The hardest part of my job was having a customer leave without the product they were searching for,the most enjoyable part was being able to help and provide great service."
good,"I really liked this job, but I would like to find something in the legal field, so I can use my degree I worked so hard for. I would definitely recommend this company to a friend, however it is not the job I would like to retire with. My co-workers are usually very easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would definitely be getting up at 4am to get ready for work!! The most enjoyable part of the job to me is how friendly and caring the management team is."
good,As managers we do bunch of reports. We balanced the hours based of sales. Multi-task when ever possible. We were a team even with the selling staff. Hardest part of the job was balance work and life. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. It was a great experience because if felt like we ran our own company.
good,"I would clock in and then get out on the floor or go to the fitting room, depending on where I was scheduled to be. I loved helping people! I learned how to be more outgoing. This job helped me open enough that I could say hello to almost anyone. My co-workers were wonderful. I loved this job. The hardest part was standing for 8 hours because I have back problems."
good,The GAP was my first job in retail and one that I will never forget. GAP allowed me to experience firsthand what it was like to work with customers one-on-one while developing my people skills.
good,"great place to work for holiday cash, great pay and schedule"
good,"worked 40 + hrs, learned a lot, worked with some great people. I love retail lifestyle the hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,"Everyday was straight forward. They would assign you a part of the stores. Only women were assigned to Gap Body. I learned how to help customers and engage them more. Cashiering is easy but the management stresses on selling Gap credit cards and we don't get any compensation for getting one. Just a pat on the back. The hardest part is closing at night having to fix up the store to make it look nice for the morning. If we couldn't finish an hour after we closed we usually stayed an half an hour to an hour longer during holiday times since the store was a disaster. However, the best part of the job is helping people with their needs like helping husbands pick out stuff for their wives and helping people with certain fits of clothing. Its satisfying when people choose the things you picked out for them. Most of the management team are great people. Some are stricter than others. The store manager is great. Best manager I ever had. Co-workers are all younger people and they are a great team to work with."
good,I found Gap to be a great place to work. It can be hard as a contractor and the employees tried to make me feel as much a part of the team as possible.
good,"Gap outlet is a company that concerns their employees. I learned more about the treatment with the customer. The company has a culture from friendly treatment and politeness with any client who enters at the store. The environment in the company is friendly. This job is not difficult for me. The members of the company are concerns about the employee security. The most enjoyable part of the job is to treat with the customer. For example, a client arrives to the store. This customer is a woman who looks for something for her spouse. But she does not know what her husband wants for his birthday. I ask what are his likes so, I suggest different things. After she listens me and she takes something of the store. I give to this company an overall rating of 4 starts"
good,"A typical day at work involved restocking of sales floor, answering in calls concerning store products. Maintaining records of product sales and invetory levels."
good,Flexible work Scedule
good,Usually fast paced but they typically cut hours.
good,"A typical day at Old Navy includes a ""Check in"" by one of my LOD's (leader on duty). They instruct me to either work in the Womens, Kids, Men, Fitting Room or on the cash register. Usually my typical shift is working in Womens and having a cash register. One of our main daily goals is to encourage customers to apply for the Old Navy Card. My shift usually last 3 and a half to 5 hours."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of handling all monetary transactions, helping customers with their needs, and keeping a clean and tidy workplace.I learned how to be independent while still working in a group setting. The management always did their best to accommodate the needs of their employees wether it came to the amount of hours one wanted or if there were any issues that the employee was facing. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers, being able to interact and build a relationship with the customer and the company."
good,Worked in a clean environment
good,"Was an easy going job that offered a fun enviornment and great managers to work for. Pay is pretty good, although numbers of hours available to per week to work was limited."

good,I had great managers we had a tight ran ship and it worked well. Everyone knew eachothers stringths and helped eachother out. It was great team work.

good,"A work day at gap can vary from day to day. It would consist of helping customers, replenishing missing products or various sizes or helping unload freight on shipment days. I would also work visuals on some days and nights which consisted of re-arranging the store and/or dressing manicans."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with the vendors. Resolving store issues, celebrating the team's success. The hardest part was, trying to meet or exceed the SLA when you just never knew what emergency would effect the floor."
good,"Gap inc. is a great place to work and interact with other people. There are available at most Gap stores a wide variety of styles and seasonal clothing. If you know how to be friendly and helpful, this is the place to work. Every customer is a potential shopper so putting on a smile and greeting everyone and remaining helpful at all times is the Gap inc. culture. All in all fun place to work."

good,What I really liked when I worked at gap was the flexible work schedule they offered. It really helped me balance my school and work schedule at the same time.
good,Working at Gap was quite an interesting experience where i learnt different styles of denims and how to communicate with customers about what they would like. it was a good retail experience where I met several very dedicated and motivational coworkers and managers with who i got acquainted to . My favorite section to work in was the Kids and Baby section. however my least favourite area to work in was the adult section as its more difficult to navigate through in my opinion as locations of the clothes are changed regularly.
good,"Worked only part time on shipment team, but was comfortable with my team and had fun working the back room. Was a good introduction to the retail world."
good,"There is never a dull moment! In addition to the day to day business operations, I had the opportunity to travel across the country and into Canada to open new stores and help train and on-board new store teams. That's my favorite! :)"
good,"You are taught many areas within the store, therefore, gaining experience and also the ability to work more hours. Ability to move up in the company. You can transfer or stay within your store."
good,Working at gap the biggest issue is that they don't pay enough money. The work environment was relaxed but got busy around the holidays. If they paid more money they might have more employees.
good,Gap was closer too home so it was better on the time I spent driving too and from work everyday. Gap was also good for benefits suck as eye dental and health.
good,"Fun place, good work, good people. I was lucky to be in my team. We had a close relationship with direct supervisors and coworkers, made me look forward to coming to work."
good,"I felt like I had a family working here. It was fast paced but at the end of the day, I was working with people who made it feel like I had only been there 20 minutes. It's a great atmosphere and it's an amazing starter job with plenty of room for advancement to turn a first job into a career."
good,it was a great experience to work with Gap in sourcing team as I was able to learn a lot about about the role being a buyer. also got a chance to communicate with the vendors from the various part of the globe.
good,"Just like most warehouse jobs, you work competitively. Which I feel motivated me to work better each day because the outcome would benefit me. I would only require this job if you have a great work effort."
good,"i dressed mannequins, did store windows, restocked floor, organized stock room, light sales person duties, over night shifts mostly scheduled. great discounts and friends/family coupons"
good,"I love loved loved working for gap. The culture is amazing, there was always an opportunity for growth and an amazing work family. It truly is a team setting"
good,"Everyone works together to promote one another, but strives to outdo others in sales. Friendly Competition. Opportunity to work from home, which makes commute easy."
good,We all like team work because we need to make it great for our costumers. The environment is good enough break room space.  I like working there hope the next employees also like it as much.
good,"Management will always help if you're not sure what to do. Being the new employee, everyone was kind and welcoming. I learnt a lot about the products and they were patient when I was confused."
good,Making sure the store was clean and help customers find clothes. Someone people did not help put clothes back so keeping the clothes back got annoying because not everyone would do it.
good,"A job that can be adapted to anyone fresh out of high school or looking for a good workplace in between careers. Would not recommend as a job for someone looking for significant advancement, as opportunities are low, and favouritism in management is obvious."
good,"You meet really great people and with that you fall in love. But the pay as you are beginning to advance as a supervisor or lower management is minimal. Very hard to pay your bills unless you are living at home with parents or have a roommate. I worked at a store that previously closed and we all had to find a job when they created a brand new store literally down the street from us. How horrid is that?There is a lot of favoritism when it comes to trying to advance. The current DM is horrible, he doesn’t personally care for his peers and is abnoxiously selfish."
good,"Fun, relaxed culture. Felt included. Fun position in Loss Prevention. Great benefits and company that cares about its employees. Believe in a work/life balance."
good,working at this store is great. the employees are caring and the customers are amazing. once in a while you will get one that is rude. you will learn business skills as well as learning to deal with people in a public setting. you will also learn to be more organized in the long run.
good,"A typical day at GAP would include greeting and assisting customers, folding and restocking products, open and close registers, and meeting many new people. Working at GAP was one of the best experiences I've ever had. You get to meet many new people, whether it be co-workers or customers, and engage with them or have a quick laugh. Once in a while you'd get the rude customer but as long as you have a good and assuring attitude, it should be easy to assess the problem. Management was great too. They are very understanding and work wit your schedule, as well as co-worker with covering your shifts."
good,"Fast work space like any other retailer. Work culture is very laid back and welcoming. "
good,"The company is a great place to work.  It is highly stressful and super fast paced.  There is a lot to learn, but there is training available.  They promote from within. The executives have an open door policy. They recognize hard work."
good,Worked there for 11 years just need more pay and there was really no room to move up in the company. Comfortable environment. Lots of standing and walking!

good,Quick paced & group oriented work. Very fun environment to work in & wonderful staff to work with. I will definitely be returning for the holiday season.
good,"- day to day consisted of being on time & restocking apparel "
good,"I like working here, most of the people are super nice and helpful. There is a manager that is not friendly and instead of explaining things to you, she boss you around in a rude way. Other than that it’s a nice environment. The payment is too low."
good,"Its a job."
good,Fast pace environment where you supervise and be alerted on people who are trying to steal on busy hours. Customer service is the key to selling and reaching goals.
good,Good experience very good team very helpful good first job for high school kids and young adults you get to interact with mean people and help people find what they need.
good,Competitive incentives every day to boost up sales though they try to make it a team environment. Always something to fold and very busy during the holiday season.
good,typical work day is fast paced.  I learned leadership qualities.  workplace culture depends on tenacity of employees.  would recommend to people inquiring for work.
good,good company every once here was very good with sense of humor diffintly you will enjoy if you place here all the best for you if you get jobs here good luck
good,I loved working for GAP both times i worked with them the work environment is always peaceful and very helpful with customer interactions. People are always looking for a new taste in their style and making sure that they are looking and feeling well in the lasted fashion. Most people want to stick with the normal size in clothing and style but the ones who are just becoming adults are looking to find what fits right and what fits best and just being able to relax and have the best quality.
good,"I spent my time with Gap at 3 different locations, all with different responsibilities and atmospheres. As a sales associate, I worked either 4, 6 or 9 hours, depending on the season. My duties included sales and merchandising."
good,I worked at Gap while I was in college and it was awesome. The pay was very good for it being a part time job. Management was very good about working with your school schedule and only making you work during the times that you requested to work initially. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to work retail for any reason.
good,"If you enjoy a fast-paced environment and enjoy customer service, look no further than Gap, inc (Old Navy). It would be a perfect first job for a high schooler or a flexible job for anyone with part time availability!"
good,working for a Gap company was very beneficial. the older employees welcomed me like if I was already part of the crew. everyone was super nice when it came to helping me out on the job for a newbie.
good,"At this job it was nice, the coworkers were really nice and the managers. At this job I learned that even if you not having a good day you can make the others people day better and that would make you feel good."
good,Enjoyed my time learning about the business and what is expected in the logistics career path. Opportunity to grow but must be willing to move. Great management team
good,I enjoyed working here at the Gap factory in Gallatin so much. It was very fast paced which I like because it keeps me busy and the days go by extremely quick. The managers that worked there were so good. They definitely treated me like I was their equal rather than just some subordinate.
good,I was hired on to help with seasonal sales and overall enjoyed my time at the Gap. It was fun to engage with customers and learn a little bit about retail.
good,"I enjoyed working at gap. A very inclusive environment. Supervision is excellent, they are always willing to give constructive criticism to their employees."
good,Stressful but fun! A lot of planning and execution work for the role of a VM. Teamwork and efficiency is necessary to run a new floor set and make sure coffee is handy...
good,"The first thing I do when I start my shift is pick up my ear piece and a walkie heading to the cash register. If I'm not needed to be cashier for the day, I'm placed to be a fitting room attendant or sales associate helping customers. I've learned that being friendly and having a smile on my face allows customers to feel more welcomed to ask questions and buy more product. I have about five managers who lead the store individually and are open to any issues employees have. The culture of my work place is very much like a family, we help each other when we are under staffed and communicate customer needs through the walkie to make our service faster for the customer. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store organized when there is not enough employees working for the day while customer servicing. Also, being on register while helping other cashiers who are beginners while being in a long transaction. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping an undecided customer find their perfect fit and allowing them to branch out of their comfort zone realizing that they just need someone by their side helping them choose the right outfit."
good,Gap taught me many leadership and managing skills needed to be a successful boss. Working in the busiest gap in the city of New York allowed me to communicate to countless amounts of people each day helping build and strengthen communication skills.
good,The typical day at Gap can be highly stressful especially on Monday's where there are lots of multi tasking.  I learned to be very proactive and very detailed.  The workplace culture is great.  I think that is the best part of the Company.  The hardest part of the job was trying to learn the business.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team.
good,"Nice place to work. People were friendly. I like the job and my performance was considered excellent. I had to quit because of transportation issues, however I would work for the company again."
good,"The job, was very easy can be a little ruff on your feet, but overall the job was wonderful. Nice job people are nice, mangers are great. Great holiday pay."
good,"If you are not a manager, it is a pretty typical retail job with regular benefits. It is pretty good pay, and they give access to company health insurance after a year and 401k access after 6 months."
good,"Ive worked for Gap for about a year. I love this company, its all I talk about. However, I would like to have a full time position, even without benefits. I personally Just need the hours. "
good,"Good place for retail experience. Generally good environment when it begins. Straight forward goals, friendly costumers. Sometimes tasks are scattered but a decent job overall."
good,I worked here for a shorter amount of time as it did not provide a very good balance of work life with my other commitments. Very tedious work and learned how to work retail and cash registers.
good,"Typical days at The Gap involve cleaning and preparing the store for opening. After the store is open, you will either A) be put onto ship-from-store, in which you process clothing from the store via online orders and ship them to people's houses, B) cash rep, where you are working the cash register and handle physical transactions as well as take phone calls about store inquiries for time open and if a certain item is in-store or not and if no, where they can find it."
good,"As with anything else in life, you get out of it what you put into it. It was a fulling oppertunity. I really enjoyed working there. Management was kind, understanding, and friendly."
good,Good place to work and learn about retail. The company gives you a good opportunity to learn about many aspects on the retail work while also giving a work life balance.
good,Gap allowed me to learn the differences between the artistic side of styling and the corporate reasonings for such things. My time there allowed me to become a better worker by combining my natural inclination for understanding patterns and take it to advancing them.
good,"Gap has very good management and working environment."
good,"-learned customer service, how to work well in retail, etc."
good,"Stand in front of the store and welcome customers"
good,"its a good place to work. good management. My supervisor was great and the manager is a nice guy too. workflow is fast paced but not too fast , paid break."
good,"The place was fun to work at, although the cleanliness wasn't the best. We were always understaffed and as a result, the shop floor tended to be on the messier side, especially around the fitting room and clearance sections which was never tidy."
good,"drive for restults , "
good,"Great environment, given lots of independence to do your own thing and not micromanaged, ability to gain lots of product knowledge. However, the discounting system is a real pain. There are new confusing discounts almost every day you have to learn and explain to customers. Some customers will pay full price on something that was 50% off yesterday and will be 40% off tomorrow. It's very frustrating. Also, rather than being rewarded for great customer service and smooth running of the store, you are expected to achieve email and app goals instead and rewarded on this. The 50% staff discount SEEMS good but items are often 40% off for customers anyway, and will go down to 75% off after a few weeks."
good,Un’azienda familiare nel settore della termoidraulica
good,Gap is an excellent company with great benefits and support for its staff. They offer outstanding pay and benefits. You learn a lot. Build great relationships. It is a competitive environment and constantly changing. So buckle up.
good,"Gap is a forward thinking company trying to adapt to the changes of current market trends.  Retail is constantly evolving and Gap, Inc is always finding ways to stay relevant."
good,"The job was great, it was the customers that made the environment un-enthusiastic. In retail, the customer is ""always right"", management always had to agree with the customer, that was the only frustrating pat about it."
good,I've had some fantastic bosses at Gap and have really been satisfied with my time there.  The culture values work/life balance which I really appreciate.
good,"Gap Inc. has a great work culture and commitment to doing the right thing. I left the company and came back to be rehired. There was great stability and team of talented, diverse people."
good,"When you first clock in, an LOD (leader on duty) will rally employees in about the day's goals and any promotions happening throughout the store. I've definitely improved my customer service skills working there for a little over a year now. Managers are very understanding and will distribute hours based on each individual."
good,Morning shifts are the best for me not only because i am a morning person but also because you get to get the shop together and ready for customers before it opens.
good,"aprendi costumer serves, stok, proccess organizar y llenar secciones, cash."
good,"I've worked at Old Navy and Banana Republic prior to transferring to the Gap. Its really all the same concept and process. From folding clothes, opening Gap cards, to customer service. Its all about the customer! And if you are a open, ambiguous, outgoing and love people,  this would be the perfect job for you. If you not, then this would be a great opportunity for you to find yourself, open up, feel more confident and enjoy approaching and talking with people."
good,fun place to work and one must be able and willing to work.   There is no slacking off in this environment.   Sometimes it is quite intense due to  quotas but that is to be expected in this environment.
good,Great place to work and try to advance. Keep an eye out for management but Gap has the tools for learning about products and more. Gap like the employees to be educated on how the product are made.
good,"Gap was a fun place to work. Customers were great and co-workers too.  The managers moved around from store to store for various reasons, so it was hard to really get too close to them. When I got moved into the Visual department I enjoyed that very much...I went to 4 stores in our district...a different store each day. All in all it was a great place to work."
good,"By and large, the biggest pro of my experience at Gap has been the people. Almost everyone is lovely and hardworking, not catty as one might expect from a major apparel company. "
good,One of the most understaning and compromising jobs ive ever had. To say the least somewhere id work again if I ever were in dire need of a job. Great first job
good,"Un trabajo en un  buen ambiente, aprendí a doblar ropa de forma departamental , ordenar la ropa y mantener el orden. Buen horario de comida.Descansos rolados , no fines de semana."
good,Working here was pretty awesome. Great hours. Cool management. Benefits and discount are amazing. Gap is a family like atmosphere. Everyone was a team player
good,Many different types of days working here. Some days were very slow and easy while other days were fast paced. Overall the management was very nice and considerate.
good,"Very good for starting your career in retail. Dependable brand with good traditions. The way they treat employees varies from store to store, but generally it's fine."
good,"When clocked in 5 mins early, you get a game plan from one of the LOD's on the floor. They send you to one of the stock managers on each floor and have you complete a list of tasks that'll cover your whole shift."
good,"Nice company and got a good vibe working there, people were friendly and warm. However, could tell things were a bit high stress and there was quite a bit of turnover even in the short time I was there."
good,"Trained individual for advancement, lots of work to do especially during holiday season because it a multi cultural environment any individual contribute their own delicacies, it is fun !"
good,Lots of incentives to reach goals and tons of recognition. Very much about the community and giving back. Customer feedback is of the upmost importance.
good,A typical day at the gap is pretty easy but can give you a headache as well. The customers are something i looked forward to each day because they here nice friendly and had great energy.

good,The employee there are willing to teach freshmen. They love the Gap company and the starting point always the company's benefits. I am really appreciated and attracted by this working environment. Working there makes me learn a lot.
good,Besides the great discounts on amazing clothes. the customers that usually shop at these stores tend to make the day more fun. The pay is above average .
good,Id defiantly work here again just as a part time position to make a couple extra hundred bucks at the end of the month . Would work perfect for a 16 year old or someone in that age range not needed or not able to work a 30 + hour schedule
good,"Great company to work with. Nice co-worker. Great employees discount. Nice work environment. Flexible working hours. On a typical day, you have work and sort of the clothes from fitting room."
good,"持有與東西文化並進，以及接續的潛質。"
good,Supportive staff that were happy to work around students' schedules when devising rota's for work. Smaller store provided a close knit team and a more relaxed environment.
good,"good work environment, good team. Good job for someone who is looking for part time work while attending school. Mostly consist of customer service and face to face interaction with customers"

good,"Great benefits and great company to work for. The pay is inline with work duties. Very friendly supporting teams that reward your efforts. The company is growing, a huge plus int todays market!"
good,Employees are friendly and very helpful. Learned how to become a team player. Learns different skills each day. The hardest part about this job is changing the mannequins.
good,"Fun work environment, very flexible with schedules. All managers were understanding of school schedules and made accommodations. Friendly managers and coworkers."
good,I liked working for the company. It was my first retail job. My coworkers were like one big family. Management could have been a little better. Job wasnt really hard.
good,Es buen ambiente pero es muy pesado  trabajar tantas horas pasas mucho en el trabajo
good,"I was only a Sales Associate so I don't really know about Compensation/Benefits. Working at Gap was amazing. The experience was great, managers were extremely helpful. I learned a lot with my experience at Gap and I honestly wouldn't have left, but I was focused on getting my Associate's at the time. Great company to work for but it is very challenging. I learned a lot about retail with my almost 3 years at Gap. Selling Gap cards were challenging, but accomplishing when you got a few!"
good,Great for first job experience. They do have a lot of great benefits and discounts for employees.I would recommend this place to people that are just starting a to work for the first time.
good,a typical day a gap consisted of slow mornings that quickly shift into fastpaced hours during the afternoons. Usually an enjoyable day with coworkers.
good,"the gap is a global fashion business with five brands Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and Intermix. I love the fact that it's connected which allow you to use your discount inside all the other branches."
good,Good work place fairly easy going staff and management and decent amount of hours. The staff room had a tv and couch which was pretty great to watch friends all day.
good,I enjoyed working for this company a lot because you get to help the different customers and get discounts from them. I also like how they would work around your schedule.
good,"Working at Gap can be a great first job if the store has a good manager.  I never had issues getting enough hours as long as I didn't move into full-time status as an associate. I was promoted twice within the first eight months, and I only left because I had to move away to start college."
good,"Gap, Inc offers great employee benefits but those benefits exceed the usual health, dental, and vision.  I have been fortunate to work with people that are truly passionate about their jobs.  Their training program not only helps navigate through the retail world but can be helpful in life."
good,Working at Gap was great experience. I became a top member in gap cards collections in my little time spent here. I also learned a little sales pitch.
good,"Good place to work. Good scheduling, nice managers, decent wage for the roles, good work life balance, nice perks with discounts at all related brands."
good,"I worked for Gap twice and love the corporation and the standards they support. I love the ""you do you"" mentality. Work/life balance culture has changed over the last few years as the retail market has changed. I found I was expected to be on call anytime I was not on official PTO, which is not the way the Gap used to be. Compensation was on the high end in the market I live and appreciation was always given."
good,Really nice environment.Good salary and benefits.The management was the best. The hardest part of this job was the overnight. The most enjoyable was working doing the floor set.
good,Good company to work for if you want to work in retail. Good opportunity to grow. It was a fast paced job. Good discount. Flexible hours. I learned how to pace myself and work with others.

good,I love this company the people are nice and teamwork I miss those people we share some good times and bad times provide feedback to my employees see how are they doing
good,"I love working at the gap, however I do not get enough hours per week.  that is the reason I am applying with Food Lion. The people I work for and with are awesome."
good,"This job has many responsibilities, but once you get the hang of how it works it will become easy. Meet new people, customer service experience, flexible scheduling, and positive feedback."
good,"This is a great company to work for.  They expect one to dress and be presentable, which is refreshing.  "
good,"learned managerial courage,safety, audited stores for company policy and ADA regulations made my own schedule based on bushiness needs. the hardest part of the job is learned behaviors of shop lifters and safly apprehending them."
good,"My first year of working at Gap, I was at the Factory (outlet) store and I had a blast working there. I felt my time during work hours were very productive. I was always busy and it didn't feel like my time was being wasted. But once I relocated to the retail store, hours seemed longer because there was literally nothing to do. The managers just tell you to ""keep busy"" but that's hard to do when there are hardly any customers and the store is spotless. It felt like a waste of time. There's only so much ""finger spacing"" a person could do for 5 hours! I desperately wanted to go back to the outlet store."
good,"For the most part it was a good experience. "
good,"A typical day would be contacting banks verifying customer information, canceling fraudulent orders, replace order oce customer is fully verified."
good,This is a good part time job for anyone. the duties are simple and it is not to much heavy lifting involved. team member are usually good about working together and completing goals.

Management was never too busy to spend time with me whether it be input I wanted to provide regarding processes or procedures, questions I had, or to update me on new policies coming from Corporate."
good,I was fortunate to have a great Manager who was a leader and a mentor who made my experience  a pleasurable one. Thanks to him I learned the business side of my occupation
good,"i was hired for part-time and was given flexible hours due to being in school, as well as a new parent working with this company was a fun environment and enjoyable coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Old Navy, I was seasonal help so I wasn't there for very long. "
good,I got an internship opportunity to work in The four Season hotel Hong Kong in 2017 summer. And that is the reason why I have to quit my part time job in the gap.
good,I enjoy being a retail supervisor at the Gap Outlet unfortunately there is no room for me to Advance at that time so when I left I intended on going back to school and back into nursing field
good,"Simply put, I have enjoyed customer service. However, here's my honest view of the wages that I was paid. My main concern was my hourly wages, even if I was given consistent raises. However, I had enjoyed working at the Gap Inc in the two years I was there that I saw myself moving up to corporate. I also enjoyed the ability to transfer from Fort Lauderdale to NYC in 2010. "
good,"Does not accept doctors' notes! If your spouse works there, make sure to be in a different department. They do not allow spouses to have off together in the same department. Pay is good, unless you are in Shipping. I think Shipping pay should be higher. Great benefits. Peak season in 12 days on, 2 off. 10 hour days. When it is not peak season, 8 hour days and weekends depends on volume. Most weekends off though."
good,it is a good job for a high school student or someone with no experience at all. You start as a part time with 20 hours a week and the pay rate its competitive.

good,"A typical day was working in each area of the store on slow days. However, I learned that in a fast pace setting it is better to work as a team. For the most part the Managers were easy to get along with and the culture of the store was my favorite part of this work experience because no one was ever looked down upon or judged to my knowledge. Moreover, the hardest part would have to be gaining customer loyalty, and the most enjoyable part, being appreciated after every daily achievement."
good,A very productive place of work. The colleagues are nice and the management is very understanding towards both professional and personal issues. Overall a great place of work especially for young people looking for part-time work.
good,"A typical day at work is very relaxed, the relationship with my coworkers was awesome, we would always help each other to make the costumer service very efficient. My manager would always help me improve my abilities and guide me to be a better sales associate at work. We would always get coffee in the mornings, talk with all the  coworkers and maintain a good environment. The hardest part of the job was to deal with some costumers but we would all put effort to solve any kind of problem. I really liked working there and It was such a good experience for me. I would totally recommend it."
good,folding clothes. Making sure the floor was very neat. Making sure customers were satisfied. Also handling the fitting room. It was a very good experience

good,"This location of Gap is just two blocks from the Friendship Heights Metro and is pretty big. It's one level but has an array of men's and women's clothes and a kids section. Staff are friendly and are ready to help. A parking garage is located directly between Starbucks and Banana Republic. Come into shop and receive 2 hours validation.Sales have been stellar, weekly promotions for GAP Credit card members and non members."
good,"Our day varied upon experience. I was well experienced so I enjoyed providing customer service and working with my team. Our main goal was to keep a clean store, sale merchandise, and process Gap credit cards. We also did volunteer work for shelters. The management team were easy for me to get along with. I enjoyed learning about the new styles we received on the shipment team. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with angry customers. I enjoyed making conversion go up while on the sales floor and also processing the most brand cards to receive Gap rewards."
good,"This was a great place to work until the IT was outsourced to IBM.  I would have stayed."
good,Work was apprehending shoplifter to bring down shortage for the stores as well as ensuring safety for employees and customers whenever any incident occurred.

good,My first job and learned so much from it. With those skills I will take it to future jobs. Customers really nice and employees to.
good,"A busy call center focused on maintaining over 3,000 across North America, Europe, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. Gap, Inc. is always striving to be a big player in the latest retail technologies, and the call center is the front line in supporting these new ideas as they roll out into the stores. A typical day has an analyst taking on at least 20 calls from stores describing various hardware and software problems. It is a great opportunity to learn how to provide great customer service as well as improve personal technical knowhow when supporting old hardware and the latest rollouts. The environment of the call center is one that is pretty easy-going, allowing for fellow analysts to communicate either through personal conversation between neighbors, or through chat programs to help each other with tough situations, or if an idea needs to be shared among the floor. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with upset and/or frustrated stores calling about issues that do not seem to get resolved or occur consistently.  Also, he chances to move up in the company seem to be somewhat limited, as there are not many open positions higher up. The good parts of the job are being able to constantly learn new things, so you never feel complacent on the job. It is nice coming to a job where the turnover rate is low, as it helps with maintaining friendships built within the company. The shifts are flexible, and are able to work around life occurrences, providing a good work/life balance. Also, it is encouraged to leave work at work and not bring it home. Overall, a great company to break into"
good,Always sets the bar for goals to reach on the daily basis. Goals must be met no questions ask to the best of your abilites. Learned to replenish merchandise on sales floor when needed and learned to use cash register. Management was strict but plausible.
good,"Ambiente stimolante e molto veloce, colleghi/e disponibili così come i manager."
good,A typical day at work consisted of plenty of face-to-face contact with clients while meeting their expectations and excelling in customer satisfaction. My co workers and I worked together as a team to fulfill goals of the Company. I learned that remaining  prompt and professional in a high stress enviroment is highly productive. I enjoyed meeting new clients while servicing them and building my clientele.
good,"a typical day at work included serving and helping customers with their needs such as doing size measures and helping to bring out new stock onto the shop floor, it also included doing delivery unloading boxes and making sure they went in the correct place."
good,"Great sense of teamwork, fun workplace even under pressure, high consideration of human relationships and people's needs. Overtime not required but pleasant to do if necessary"
good,"Assist customers,  balance cash drawers daily, process shipment and build loyal customer base.  Great job for starting out in work field."
good,"I got hired for summer, but my manager saw talent in me and kept me as one of his full time staff. Since I like to work with colors and I like organizing, I became great at my job."
good,"Travelled to a store I'd chosen the week previously from my submitted rota."
good,great company to work for.  still feels like a small business. benefits and vacation for all members of management. would work for them again
good,Don't plan to make this a permanent job. The hours aren't great and certainly aren't guaranteed. A typical day at work consists of helping customers and folding clothes. I learned valuable retail skills. Co workers quickly become almost like family.
good,The Gap is a wonderful company with really good benefits for full time employees. Offers flexible hours and internships for students and its base rate for all associates is $10/hr. The gap also offers an amazing discount of 50% off which can be used at all Gap. Inc stores. But you have to remember that it is still retail and management sucks!
good,"You get 50% off discount on all full price items. The clothing is really nice, and the floor set up is easy to find merchandise."
good,"Great company, great pay and benefits. Love the customers and products. Nice to work for a company that takes pride in the appearance of there stores."
good,"Fun and fast pace workplace supportive management, great place to grow a variety of of skills. A safe and productive work environment with many trades to learn as an individual as well as a team. Opportunities to make incentive such as G.R.O.W. program based on your work performance daily productivity percentage."
good,"I would come to work a bit early , just in case I'm needed and they would want me to clock in early to help out. Once I'm clocked in , customers always come first I greet and speak to everyone who crosses my path. I also ask questions to see if anyone needs help with anything, has questions about a shirt or the promotion for the day. I learned to be open and I have become an amazing listener. The management is cool for the most part, but shadowing the mangers you will see they have a lot on their shoulders. Co-workers are amazing ! especially when you have a team like i had, we all understand and learn from each other. The hardest part of the job is getting gap cards for the day. Once you get the first Gap card for the day they usually flow right after, but the hardest part is getting the first one. I loved helping people. I think that was my favorite part. Seeing the families come in with questions and interacting with the customers."
good,"They put the customer first and surely put a lot of taught into making shopping customers to be easy and enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was a fun work place with supportive management. It was a great experience and helped develop my skills."

good,"It was really nice to work for this company and also it was a great opportunity to get used to job. I had to do a lot of things but I enjoyed it, it was hard and I met a lot of new people."
good,This was my first job. I made a lot mistakes in the beginning but also at the same time learned a lot things from my supervisor and from my boss. It was part time job while I was studying in high school.

good,"When you first step onto the floor, a manager will inform you on the daily sale goals and promotions. Each sales associate is expected to provide quality customer service by greeting the customers, assisting customers in locating the products they need while maintaining a clean and safe environment for all. I have been with this company for over 10 years and I have always encountered friendly, supportive, and pleasant co-workers. The hardest part of this job is time management. I tend to spend more time with my customers because I want them to feel satisfied and confident with the items that were purchases. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a wonderful sales team and seeing my customers happy."

good,Great discounts for employees. Worked overnight mainly so it was easy because it wasn't any hustle of locating products for customers. Learned a little bit about color codes and styling. Management and coworkers will be different in ever store so can't really judge it.

good,Territory manager for the back of house product. Gained market share thru managing account with employee who developed internal relationships with store staff.
good,"It's hard to complain about working at Gap. You just have to know what you are getting into. It is a retail job so expect to work nights, weekends, and holidays. Also expect more work than you might think. But the company is nice, and usually your coworkers are too, plus the discount is great."
good,"Working for Gap Inc in the outlet division provided a very busy environment. The stores I worked in made 11-14 million a year. I learned many valuable tools while working there. I was the Operations Manager for the store. I was in charge of hiring, training, scheduling, auditing, payroll, and maintain all legal and company standards. I managed 3 managers below me along with 30-100 employees depending on the season. I was a strong resource for the district and would partner up with fellow managers and stores to provide support. Unfortunately job security became a problem. With retail there is always cut backs. My position was eliminated within my current store. After receiving this information I was fortunate that upper management came together and worked in getting me into another location within the company."
good,Really enjoyed working for the company been with them for a while. Benefits our great and discounts are helpful which allows to develop wardrobe for business
good,It is a really fun place to work. The only time that the store gets really crazy is during the holidays. They always need you during the weekend.
good,"I've always wanted to work for The Gap. A typical day for me is usually just assisting customers, helping them find what they need and making sure the store is organized."
good,"my worked day consisted of top organization and helping customers with merchandise. Coworkers were very welcoming. I believe it was fairly easy. As long as you make sure that your area is neat, clean, and you have the best attitude towards your customers, then everything runs pretty smoothly here.You work with a high volume of customers but you have your coworkers there to help you out. You have to be able to work well and efficiently in teams."

good,"Great place to work, co-workers and management are very friendly and willing to work with the employees. Great retail experience."
good,"A typical day at work involved working with a pleasant management and fellow sales associate team. Everyone was willing to help each other out, and employees were receptive to any constructive criticism that might have been received. I learned the importance of maintaining a positive attitude, and truly began to understand the importance of ""killing someone with kindness"" when it comes to difficult customers. The hardest part of the job was when customers would insist on something that the store could not accommodate for. The most enjoyable part was getting to work for a respectful company that strove to produce great products, provide accessible deals for their customers, and treated their employees with the utmost respect."
good,"The best part of my job was working with my coworkers. We saw each other outside of work hours, it was like my second family."

After that, I would go into my area and fold clothes while making sure customers were taken care of. I also rang up various transactions throughout my shift. After closing, I would continue folding clothes and set up displays. During the holiday season, I took on a temporary management position and closed the registers at night."

good,"It is a great place to work, the managers are great and the other employees are so nice.  I really enjoy working there and it's fun seeing all the new collections."
good,"Started seasonal and stayed for a part time position. Management is a little disorganized at times. They place importance on talking to customers and getting Gap cards. Hours change every week which can be frustrating. Full shift of 9 hours demands a lot of standing. Coworkers already have a developed relationship so it can be a little awkward if you're new. This job is just a routine. Managers are nice and empathetic is you're unable to come to work. It does seem that there are favorites especially if you have seniority. It doesn't seem that workers would give extra for this job; when their shift is over, even when there is an obvious lack of staff, workers will just leave."
good,"Sales Associate"
good,it was a good experience for a college student. not much fuss as long as you did what you need to. The hours are good during the holiday times but other time there is a struggle and its hard to make good money

Business was demanding at times. I was delighted to help. So were my co workers and management was friendly. There was hardly any drama.  The most enjoyable part was the customers and the volunteer services.

good,"The Gap is a high volume store that does it's very best to treat their employees better then the standard. They offer flu shots for employees, have holiday barbecues and support many local organizations and events. The hardest part about working for the GAP Inc is the same pitfalls of retail in general. Unpredictable schedules, slow winter hours and mandatory attendance on most holidays is nothing new in the industry. I did appreciate how management did their best to do more for their employees then other stores in the mall."
good,"On weekends it gets a little hectic but usually becomes a very productive day, always make our sales goals on weekend, co-workers always work together to give and provide the best customer service to our customers. To top it all off my managers are the greatest they are the ones that make it all possible at the end.The hardest part would be the amount of customers i have to deal with all at once but i always manage to help every single one out. we all work together to get the best and make the best for both the company and our customers."

I have learned lots of thing as being a cashier for the very first time to being a merchandise and promotion specialist. I haven't had any hard moments because i always paid close attention to my managers and experience co-workers. The most fun part about working at the was being to what you have a desire for in fashion.
good,I liked it there.Wasn't bad at the time I was there.Pay and benefits were good.Woking conditions were good.
good,Always felt like the company was trying to find the way...They need to stick to basics and never falter. They expect top notch work performance but few good leaders in stores!!! You are pretty much on your own to figure it out and if you don't they will let you go.
good,"I worked seasonal at Gap, it was fun. I didn't get a lot of hours but it was income. I enjoyed the people I worked with, I don't think I learned everything, which I wish they were better about teaching us what to do in different situations. I love the fact that I got to interact with people. Most of my co-workers were nice. The management positions were nice and helpful but didn't teach us everything. I loved that I got a discount, that was nice when shopping for christmas presents. Every shift was different,no day was the same.Some days were slow and some were super busy. I learned a lot about patience and how to work with angry customers."
good,"Worked while I was in college, great company to work for. They have changed a lot since I have been there though."
good,The managers there are very reasonable and very caring. If your having problems with one task they will give you a task that is suitable for you. Co workers are also very nice to all new employees and help out them whenever they ask for help.
good,Gap Inc. has a great community involvement program in which all stores around the nation are involved in.
good,great pay loved coming to work great food i worked in the office all night for 10 hours in the receiving department
good,Strong company struggling to maintain and regain leadership in the specialty retail feel. Sometimes too much effort put into getting everyone to buy into an idea while not moving forward with much needed change. Strong ethics and great people make the culture good.
good,Gap was a great place to work! I enjoyed all of my managers and all the staff that worked with me as well. Great job to have while going to college.
good,GAP Inc. has a strong focus on customer service. Their success and longevity in retail speaks for itself. Innovative with regards to processes and benefits.
good,Great starter place. Overal good company. Learned alot with working here and i have grown so much. I love the people and the atmopsher. stresfull sometimes but thats it
good,In fact I wanna go back to work morning shift because I like the place and environment. It has good and thoughtful managers with great working and friendly co- workers thanks gap
good,"By far one of the best jobs I ever held. I started as a Sales Associate and one year later, I was promoted to a Senior Sales Associate. After a few months, I applied for a Keyholder position at another location and basically was hired on the spot. You meet some really cool folks there and it's in the heart of downtown so the location was convenience. Only downside  is the pay and I needed full time"
good,"Was fun working at Gap but sometimes it got really hectic due to the workload that we were given, But it was fun working with new people, really enjoyed my time there!"
good,not too stressful but wasn't too slow either. management was friendly and it was like one big family. until we got a new manager and it went downhill. but even then the coworkers were friendly.
good,"a typical day ar work would include checking in with the manager, folding clothes, restocking items and being a cashier. the most enjoyable part of the day for me was doing in stock work."
good,"They do their best to create a fun culture at Old Navy. Most of the management is very good and you never feel left behind. If you want to move up there is always opportunity to do so. Sometimes the work-life balance was a little tough, people work very long hours, although they do allow a lot of flexibility with work from home in most of the roles which was very nice."
good,Als Freelancer ein sehr entspannter und produktiver Arbeitgeber mit exzellenter Kommunikation und Organisation.
good,I enjoyed this job a lot considering it was my first experience in customer service. The managers and coworkers were very welcoming and helpful. The little events they had for us in the break rooms were also great. I enjoyed the discounts and benefits. I like feeling like I wasn’t wasting time there and that I always had something to do
good,"I personally loved working for the GAP. The management teams really do have a passion for the company. However, at the time of my employment with Loss Prevention, most of the supervisor and management were veteran employees. Although they are very dedicated to your ""growth"" and training, there really was not much room to grow as the positions are filled with aged employees. Average pay was also not increasing with the growing minimum wage. I personally came into the company recommended and with my own experience, so I was paid more than average. If you are promoted from within, do not expect a decent pay (this is sad). It is ultimately a slap in the face to their loyal employees. This is all executive level issues and could not be controlled by the amazing teams you get to work with at the store level."
good,Gap is a good place to work. You have different shifts every week if you want. If you need the same shifts you can ask for that as well. Gap likes to promote people from within if they can. They are also great for seasonal employment that can turn into permanent employment. Full time employees get pretty good benefits too.
good,The management was okay they really don’t give you much hours when you first start and if you don’t get gap cards your hours are going to be very low. The managers are okay they are very nice but somewhat rude in a way but they will be on your a***s about everything.
good,In today's living Gap had provided a stylistic inviting and affordable fashion for all family members. Always displaying apparell ideas for easy shopping. Employees are expected to have the customers need met. With a welcoming atmosphere which give the customer the need to return to the Gap
good,"Empresa coerente com seus valores e dinâmica. Regime de horas, portanto sua flexibilidade era alta. Devidamente padronizada e rigorosa com seus valores e cultura."
good,"Promotions are always possible. Different levels of responsibilities given through tiering in staff. "
good,Loved working here. Fun and competitive pay. Management was ok. Often did management work. There was a lot of flexibility and opportunity to move around in company.
good,"I worked here when I was in culinary school and also, dog walking. The hours worked with my classes and other job responsibilities. You must be able to work with others and have great customer service skills. This job was not strenuous or stressful."
good,"Work at gap is like work with your family, because we are only one. Every body help each other with love. An d our customers are our priority always. I’m very proud of what I do."
good,"to work here you'll have to work great under pressure, respectful of co-workers and customers, and memorize where everything is located. Memorize the fabrics of clothing that matches the name and texture it describes."
good,Environment in triaining is cool but seating in the call center is bad.  You have to look for a seat with a badge number and this is why they are offering more remote positions. I love that I work remotely from home which is amazing.  Good benefits.  I work in customer support not customer service.  I think the pay rate in this position should be at least 16/hour because of what it entails.  It is not regular customer service. Managers are cool and friendly.  Mandatory over time during holiday season which is hectic.  Overall it is cool but I just think pay should be more.
good,Field level associates have unrealistic expectations from corporate level management. Team and culture of the store is great but the company at a corporate level is not giving in-store team any clear direction as the company is working on fixing itself.
good,"I think what the company stands for is great and is why I chose to work here, but need better leaders to help with support and career enhancement. I would leave based off of my manager and who I'm working for, over the company culture."
good,"I love this company and the overall working environment, but too often I have experienced shifting expectations and swinging the pendulum from management that has cause the executors to spin out of control."
good,Culture is based on values and pride in the Gap brands. Biggest challenge is constant change and organizational pivots as companies adapt to new leaders and structures.
good,"A typical day in the life as a sales associate at gap entails a briefing with your staff team , it's reminded to us throughout the day that without team work our jobs will be allot harder individually.Providing Unique customer service was the main aim and goal at gap"
good,"Have to be good a multitasking"
good,It was way to much drama working there. There isn't enough of the male population to make things balance. The managers would carry an attitude if there day was hectic.
good,"Gap is a great experience to get your feet wet in the retail industry. The training they give you helps, and you can take what they teach you any where else"
good,"es una empresa estricta en donde nos marcas objetivos a cumplir, vestimenta pero esto para mi es algo positivo."
good,Ideal for students because of the flexibility. The work environment is fun and positive. There are a lot of learning opportunities in regards to the retail industry.
good,The Gap was a great place to work.  The supervisors were very fair and it was a fast paced fun environment.  The pay was good sand the benefits great unfortunately I sustained an injury that prevented me from coming back.
good,"Working at Gap made me step out more into my comfort zone. I learned to be more outgoing, energetic, and take more pride into the everyday tasks I do in the work place. Management was very organized and responsible. Everyone was given a task and was followed correctly in order for the store to run smoothly."
good,"I worked as a contractor with GAP in the Customer Service center in Rocklin. I was the only PM there at the time and there were alot of projects to manage and the opportunity to try new things was always present. Managers and Sr. Managers were very level-headed, logical, fun. Only complaint would be the Director had little visibility for work done by the PM, and eventually wasn't sure why a PM was necessary for their department if managers and developers could agree to take on more work."
good,was a great first job kept it for four years until location closed. Met a lot of great people holiday season was my favorite. Just great times and fun experiences
good,"Great Company Culture, lovely work environment, collaborative fun team. Great flexibility and work life balance. Would highly recommend, great benefits and time off."
good,I worked for the outet and then for the retail store. The environment is great. The hours you work depends a lot on your availability. You also must advertise the credit card. Its not hard but how many applications will determine how many hours you get a week.
good,"Competitive job to sell company credit cards, job included maintenance of floor and stock. Checking out guest at register while observing shopping guest, guest in changing room and minimize shoplifting."
good,I loved working here. I worked hard and was able to advance in the company. Most of the management team was great. Fun place to work. They start everyone above minimum wage as well.
good,Highly customer focused company so you need a passion for customer service in order to succeed. Great team environment. Good benefits.You need to purchase your own uniform but if you enjoy Gap clothing then that shouldn't be an issue.
good,"I usually worked 3 days per week. Mostly closing nights on weekdays and 8 hour shifts on weekends. My typical day is cashiering first thing, then processing clothing and cleaning up the store afterwards"
good,great work environment  great hrs great management and great benefits .great work environment  good hrs great management and goodt benefits .very organized and relaxed
good,"I was very happy with my time spent working for Gap Outlet. I enjoyed the fast paced environment as well as my team. I was very sad to leave them, as after 2 years I felt like we were all family."
good,"Customer Service oriented. Cashiering, inventory control, cash control, merchandising."
good,I loved working for GAP Outlet. There was always something to do while assisting customers as well. The employee acknowledgement was rewarding as well.
good,A great place to start looking for easy money and a nice place to work. You can learn different functions and lots of different positions to choose from.
good,"It's amazing, the team at Gap is motivate and very competitive. Excellent work ethics and co workers. The hardest part about working at Gap is dealing with hard customers and shipment days, both can get difficult and if you don't ask for help then you'll never get better. Management is always there for you, the care about you and how you are doing in your social life. They are always helpful and when you don't understand something they will help you understand it. You learn a lot at Gap; you learn how to respond and handle customers, you learn how to be organize, and learn how to sell the company to the public by being a representative out in the world. A typical day at Gap is coming in asking management what you are doing and dive into it, you are dealing with customers and making sure the clothes are folded properly, and assisting at the cash registry. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to come in, in a zero tolerance work place and be your self and wear the clothes that describe you also being apart of a team that cares a lot and want the best for everybody."
good,"They will teach you a lot about customer service. They have a reasonable training system and the management team treats workers fairly.I was very lucky that all my co-workers were nice. Overall, I enjoyed working at the GAP."
good,"i found Gap to be a really enjoyable experience as i met so many different and new people, i was always kept busy but i enjoyed it."
good,"They’re never the same because  you’re dealing with different types of requirement and we can make a typical day or normal by our positive and negative attitude, a positive thinking can make a tough problem easier and wrong thinking can make a normal project tough.  I learned to listen to people, work as a team and the hardest part is we can't satisfy everyone, but we always try,the most enjoyable part is when people leave the place happy and grateful."
good,It was fun working there and getting to learn about gap and getting to know the retail word it was so much fun and oit was ammazing so  great i loved it so many benefits
good,"Gap is a great place to work, and offers a great salary and benefits! It's great to work in retail, Gap has amazing and stylish clothes."
good,"I've been working here off and on seasonal since last Christmastime and I do enjoy my coworkers and the Gap environment, but I work at one of the bigger Gap stores where we have high Gap card quotas and a lot of pressure to sell them. I always feel bad asking people to sign up for a credit card because I know how damaging they can be, but it's a part of the job. I think I've only gotten one GC thus far and my managers are consistently harping on me about it. It's not that I don't ask people, they just don't want them from me. I believe that I get less hours because of this too. I understand, but that's the only real downside to my job. The dress code is awesome and pretty non-restricting and customers are usually friendly."
good,"Gap is a great place to work. Fun people, family oriented, great benefits. No high pressure sales, but simply get to know your customers so that you can better fulfill their needs. Gap truly cares about it's employees."
good,Very supportive Management. New ideas and hard work were appreciated here. Not too much politics and a definite respect for individuals needs.
good,I worked as a customer service expert manager for nearly three years and I can honestly say this was the best company I have ever worked for.  Very understanding to unexpected life situations and lenient to those that did not take advantage.  I was unable to learn as much as I should have and taught most of the office procedures to myself through manuals because the store manager had a little bit of a control issue and did not set aside time to train us.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the hardest part of the job was inventory which still was not that hard.  I did find that the store manager seemed to have favorites that would move up in the company when it was in no way deserved by her constant snippy attitude and feeling put out by customers and actually being rude to customers..she had many complaints by customers but still moved up in the company.  However I found that working with other managers within the company to be very enjoyable.  If you are looking for a part time job and are a mother or student they really do work around a schedule and are family oriented.  I was disappointed when the store closed because I had asked a year before if our store was going to close because i heard that GAP was closing 180 stores and I was assured that with our numbers and beating regional we were not going to close.  I was not surprised when the week before the holidays the following year we were told we were closing in a couple of weeks and not to tell the associates...that was rough.  I was disappointed another year later when GAP announced they were closing
good,My co-workers are a lot of fun and positive. Work together well and the environment is fun. I folded clothes on the sales floor and also did cashier work and fitness room.
good,It is a great place to meet all kinds of people. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is opening Gap credit cards but once you get used to selling them it becomes competitive. The best part is making customers your friends and enjoying the shopping experience with them.
good,"Clock in ,get walkie and check in with LOD. Greeting every customer that comes in and if they are find every thing okay or if they need help find an item. Co-workers are friendly and will to help locate item when a associate can not find item. The most important thing I learn is Customer Service is the #1 priority in Gap."
good,"A typical day consisted of a lot of stacking, racking, folding and hurrying. The leadership was pretty chill but everyone understood the team concept."
good,"The people that work at Gap are by far the best i’ve ever had a chance to work with. The climate is very laid back and inviting and everyone is incredibly relatable. I’m transferring Gaps to my new city just so I can meet more friends and continue to enjoy working there. The management was okay. They seemed to be relatively organized and respectful to me, but i didn’t notice that other people weren’t treated as well based on nothing other than their personalities and lifestyles. It was unfair and unfortunate. With that being said, I still love the company and will continue to work for them in different stores."
good,"A day at work usually starts of by talking to management about what the goal is. Learning about the new promotions and who i am going to be working with. The environment is always a positive one. I get along with everyone, and I always go to work with a good attitude and ready to work. The hardest part would have to be preparing the store for the next day when we are closing. The most enjoyable part is helping the costumers find what they where looking for and making their experience at gap a positive one."
good,"GAP Inc, is a wonderful place to work, it has great discounts for employees. It's constantly changing atmosphere always is a breath of fresh air and it's never a dull moment."
good,I would typically clean up my area as I helped customers find what they needed and restocked as I went along.  The management was always encouraging us to do better and was very supportive of all of their employees.
good,"GAP is very flexible and considerate about schedules. A great place to work if you have school or another full time job. Yes it can be hectic at times, but very fun. Not to mention they like to take care of their employees."
good,"At Gap, I learned how to work with others as well as working in a fast paced environment. I enjoyed my management that I worked under and was glad that I had the opportunity to work there."
good,"Enthusiastic, energetic, passionate and personable Co-Workers make this fast pace environment manageable. The remote location of the work place bring local customers as well as tourists from all states and countries."
good,"Processing orders, supervising production teams"
good,"GAP is a great place to learn new things and meet amazing people. Great environment. The customers who enter the workplace are usually smiling and ready to get assistance with open arms. There are tougher days, but what job doesnt have its down falls. Overall great place."
good,Helped resolve customer issues while balancing various customers in a busy retail environment. Maintained company standards with other staff and customers. Worked efficiently with store team members to lead a positive customer experience.
good,"as we all know as companies get bigger, they become less involved with the their employes, but overall good company"
good,"Good place to work, the employers were really friendly with one another and always courteous of others feelings. I was always chosen to pick tasks that suited my skills best and that was very encouraging. I am thankful for working there."
good,"GAP has always been a staple in fashion. A wonderful entry level employer  who can also train/educate and mobilize you to the next step in your goals within customer service/fashion. A wonderful atmosphere that is fun and enjoyable to go to work everyday. A great company that puts people first, at whatever stage in their life they might be."
good,"Every day of managing daily operations.  Recruiting, interviewing, training and developing of employees. Learning a great eye for talent.  Being a part of a strong and supportive management team.  Developing a great communication relationship with all employees creating a strong team.  The hardest part of the job when we didn't meet our sales goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was training and developing great sales associates."
good," Comprehensive knowledge and experience with children in an after-school environment."
good,Gap is a great place to work all around.  They truly are dedicated to doing what is right.  My time with Gap has been the best in my career where I have grown personally and professionally from the guidance and direction of some amazing people.
good,I was able to socialize with people. I got very comfortable with speaking with customers and having a connection with them
good,The Gap is an enjoyable diverse culture which allows independence and the ability to be yourself while driving sales and ensuring customer satisfaction.
good,The gap is a very easy place to work at.the company makes it easy to learn everything you need to in order to help out customers.management is very easy to go to if help is needed and is very understanding in all situations.
good,Great Benefits and good work life balance. Management is good. Very good hierarchy.
good,"I have been with gap for 13 years now.  I am still employed and love working in such a diverse and cultural environment.  I enjoy the Customer interactions, as well as the operational side of running a store.  The job has challenged me and motivated me to become well rounded and skilled in management, administration, training and overall sense of being."
good,"This was a pilot position that varied in expectations, needs and strategy creations."
good,"I was taught much about customer service. I would have to wait on customers hand and foot. I would deal with being the fitting room attendant, cashier, and floor associate. I worked seasonal which meant it was chaos in the store. It required much cleaning in the process. The coworkers could have been friendlier but the manager was delightful. I learned much about the products and certain sales approches. The hardest part was cleaning after black friday and the most enjoyable was actually being taught of how things were ran in meetings."
good,"Working at GAP helped me in acquiring excellent customer service and cash handling experience. What I loved most about my job was being able to help people who had no clue about what they wanted, go home with something they were happy about. Hardest part of the job was having to stand for long hours. The work environment was fun and lively, and the managers were patient to teach me what I did not know."
good,Great job culture on of the best actually everyone is so friendly and wonderful. Management cares about your needs and desires. They are very flexible for scheduling. Always make sure employees know that they are appreciated. The hardest part of the job is opening Gap cards. The only bad thing about the job is compensation is not reliable on cost of living here but pay is average to other retail stores. Great company and great values.
good,"Worked under great management "
good,"Was one of the first to open the Gap-On-Line in Rocklin, CA"
good,"The world of retail is fast paced and upbeat, once I clock in I hit the ground running. The customers expect a high volume of enthusiasm. My goal is to deliver that every moment I'm there."
good,"I am a full time student so I was grateful to find a company who was willing to work with my school schedule. I worked as a floor associate as well as working on cash serving customers. My management and co-workers welcomed me in and I always felt comfortable in the environment I worked in. I very much enjoyed working for this company during the seasonal position I was hired for. This job was very easy going, during the Christmas holidays it was busy, however that made my days much more enjoyable being able to help customers find gifts for their loved ones. I enjoyed coming into work as it gave me the opportunity to use my ""people skills"" to create a happy environment for all those who entered the store."
good,"A typical day at work for me would have to be when the sore has a big sale, such as everything is 50% off in the store. It can get very busy and be overwhelming, however I learn how to maintain assisting  multiple customers at a time and making sure that the are happy and is willing to come back and shop. I also learned that sometimes customers may not like how I help them or may feel I have an attitude so therefore I will ask my co-worker for their assistances with the customers. I pretty much overall work well with my co-workers. the hardest part about working at gap outlet for me would be maintain and adjusting the clearances section. overall I love my job and the company. just being at work makes me feel better puts me in a better mood."
good,"I regret leaving The Gap, Inc. in order to go back to school at that time."
good,"If you are an out going person who enjoys helping others and loves fashion, Gap Inc. is the place for you. Must love retail environment and flexible hours.  Management is great and learning how mainstream companies merchandise their product is eye-opening."

good,Its a great place to work if employed as a full time employee. The paid time off is great. Equipment is good. Management is helpful and understanding.
good,"- When we come in, we gather for instructions on what we will be doing that day"
good,"I been with the company for 6 years and my main focus is external theft, safety, internal investigations, and operations."
good,"After doing a short daily routine, your job is to prevent theft. I don't want to divulge too many details about this job so the methods of preventing theft aren't figured out. Most co-workers were a pleasure to work with. Some in management didn't understand why we did certain things the way we did and took out frustrations on LP staff. I felt the most rewarding moments of this job were after inventories, seeing that theft had reduced under my watch."
good,"greet customers"
good,a typical day at work was fast paced and customer oriented. I learned how to master multitasking.my supervisors were very friendly and easy to communicate with my co workers just the same.The hardest part of that job was not having the merchandise the customer wanted.the most enjoyable was assisting my customers.

good,"I'm speaking about the GAP store that I worked in; a flagship in the heart of New York City."
good,A typical day at for me would be on the register and sometimes on the floor helping customers. I learned about the quality of the baby clothes we sell. The management in the store are great very helpful and my co-workers are awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all the little kids and how happy they get when they got a new out fit.
good,"As a Sales Associate, i am responsible for customer service advising customers of specials, suggestions and trends. I have learned the cash register procedures."
good,"windows and visual stuff was my absolute favorite, dressing manikins, putting up promotions in the windows for the next day is exciting. Managers are always aware of all of the employees, give feed back and make the shift fun. My co-workers are all around my age, friendly and positive. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers, and the craziness during holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing visuals and folding denim. "
good,I loved every minute I worked for The Gap Corp. Management is always awesome. I stayed with the company over 10 years.
good,"Great company, great people. Lots of work/life balance and just an overall great place to work."

good,In bound call center.
good,"Love working at a flagship location. Always busy, always changing, lots of tourists"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The people were great and the boss's were awesome. Hard part of the job was unexpected hours. I love that they worked with your schedule but was a hard to depend on when you need to pay bills. I love the atmosphere of the people and the way the store was run! I would recommend working for this company for sure!
good,"A day would start by cleaning the store and putting the clothes in their designated places, then deal with customers and help them find what they are looking for."
good,"I loved working at GAP KIDS I made great work contacts and had a flexible work schedule,"
good,"Working at the gap means to work in a busy environment. When on the sales floor, you have to constantly provide great customer service and at the cash wrap, make sure every transaction is done thoroughly. The co-workers are friendly and kind. Management is very helpful and they make it clear that their always there to help you improve your work. The hardest part of the job is closing out the store. You have to make sure every shirt or pants is folded correctly, hangers have to be faced a certain way, tags must be tucked in, and your section must be completely closed out before leaving the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with so many different kind of people. You can learn as much things from them as they can learn from you."
good,"At Gap Inc you learned about yourself and the market. The values and culture that they presents are exceptional for any type of individual that is eager to learn and work inside the market. The opportunities that they have given me led me to experience many satisfactory and lifelong situations, that has made me a better professional and person."
good,The organization is great at keeping employees on a positive career track and actually make their work culture fun.

good,I enjoyed working for GAP. It was a fun environment. The company offer so many benefits. This was my first sales job.
good,I had learned a lot from working at GAP. The management was very caring and all my co-workers excelled in what was expected of them. The hardest part would be with schedule changes when someone wasn't able to come in. We all had fun and everyday was more exciting then the next.
good,"I worked for the company for several years, it was the family like atmosphere that kept me there. No matter what store I worked in the dynamic was the same.You made friends with your co workers that made team building easy."
good,"ROWE is the future of work. No hours, no unproductive meetings. Work anywhere, any time, so long as you deliver. This may lead to misunderstandings from time to time between co-workers, but if everyone is committed to it, ROWE works really well and empowers employees to be efficient."

good,"good benefits, good company, love their close and price is good for quality"
good,Good place to work your way up. I like management and my co-workers. It is just not in my field. My wife loves the discount on clothes.
good,"I really like the environment at the GAP. The management was fair, and really easy to get along with plus they had room for advancement."
good,"- Start off clocking in and then immediately getting to work. "
good,Great place for those who are starting their working career. Great at working around schedules. Depending on location advancements can usually be quick (advancement opportunities tend to cap out at store manager) depending on the staff environment working there is generally fun.
good,"A company filled with a great cast of people, all looking to build a Gap Family. Culture first, company second, Gap excels at being itself, and cultivating an inclusive store."

good,Great place to work very friendly staff lovely hours great first job and great job for teens I loved It personally works great will high school and college schedule
good,"Gap is a good company to work for, the culture is inclusive.  However the ever-changing direction and restructuring in upper management makes it a challenging place to work as leadership."
good,As long as you meet production and come in on time you will always have a job. Production is measured so managers are not on your back. The computer keeps track of everything you scan. It's a friendly place to work. You will always get exercise there. People are friendly. Equipment scanners are a little old and some not well maintained but I believe they are working on it. Some warehouses have new forklifts. Some are old.
good,Everyone is super friendly and easy to get along with. Very low stress. Management is very easy-going but is making sure we are on task to meet sales goals and establish lasting clientele.
good,I worked my way up and put my name in for every opportunity. It taught me how to be a good manager and handle unforeseen problems ie. Customer concerns / callouts. Great benefits.
good,GAP offers a fantastic environment with great benefits. Salaried employees are given the ability to use time off without having regular schedules that require more than 40 hours per week.
good,My manager is always willing to be flexible with hours in regards to school schedules and repeatedly asks for updated schedules and availability to make sure she has the newest information
good,"easy going job, with great benefits and pto. a typical work day would always have online orders and promo glitches to resolve. can get a little crazy getting towards the holidays."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to learn new things. I was taught how to drive a forklift and a pallet jack. A typical day at work was overall smooth and enjoyable. I would recommend this job to anyone because it’s easy work and the pay is reasonable
good,it was great experience as it was my first job in America.it was a seasonal job and I still like to join it again if I would have a chance to rejoin them again as permanent employee
good,"Its great company and for working place. I am learn lot of things from this company, Working environment very good, team bonding, giving individual respect very good relation with supplier. for me one of the best working place for me in my career."
good,The environment was nice and the other people were friendly enough. It is stressful and if you are unable to talk constantly it won't work for you. Calls are basically back to back but mostly solvable problems.
good,I love the gap the gap is collaborative with other company’s such as old navy and banana republic the culture is friendly. The only Hong I didn’t like about the gap was the short 15 minute breaks
good,I loved working here. They were great with working within my availability and the discount is amazing. As a part time job with a family it was perfect.
good,Great lower level leadership. Great Training & Coaching processes in place to help every employee succeed in their job. Lots of room for advancement up until the company started to fold under previous CEO.
good,"In the right store and under the right management, Gap is a great place to work and it's a company that values its employees.  They are big on giving back and community involvement!"
good,"Gap had great employee benefits, that included PTO, medical, dental, vision and 401K.  I really enjoyed my time there with everyone.  Although a lot has changed, the benefits are still a very attractive attribute."
good,they took there time to train you on forklifts until u understood and the manager staff if they seen you was a hard worker they would work on training you to move up in company they didn't keep u down
good,"It was a fun place to work, with a great focus on employee satisfaction. There is so much that Gap offers in product, discounts, programs, that sometimes it can be a bit hard to keep up."
good,working at Gap Inc is a pretty basic job. the thing that got me was just the productivity numbers you need to meet was a bit too much.  If you like a challenge of making a quota every week than this job is perfect for you.
good,"I love working at, especially as a college student. My store is big on education and the surrounding colleges and universities. This store is a very stylish close-knit family and we love what we do!"
good,"aprendí a trabajar en contacto directo con los clientes, a hacer labor de ventas y a trabajar con los utensilios con los que se cuentan."
good,"Is a fun, organized and team work environment to be working at. There are some good team worker and service leaders that help and teach you how to perform and give a good customer service. They are flexible in days of needs."
good,Everybody is so nice. The work environment varies on the traffic of customers per day. During holidays it's non stop running around with projects or customer service.
good,It was a really nice job that allowed you to advance quickly and efficiently at your own pace. I admit that it was extremely physically demanding and I found myself exhausted after work half the time.
good,Black Friday was the worst day of my life. The day to day operations are like any other retail store. You are just a glorified sales associate with the extra responsibility of taking care of the money and a certain department.
good,"take care of customers and make it your priority to leave the customer with great views and service.  the most enjoyable part is making sure the customer had a great experience, and left more than satisfied. there was not a time where it has been difficult to handle a customer. you just learn to do your best and if you cant resolve the customers request ask for a manager to finish off the situation. allow them to know that you did your best at trying to solve the issue. i learned the importance of being in retail and how important it is to make customers your priority."
good,"I am only a seasonal worker so my job is not exactly secure which is the only bad part. Other than that they have been the only company since I've moved into this new state to really consider my work life balance of being a single parent with not alot of help. They adjusted my schedule to where it works for both myself and the company, the management team is awesome. They are always encouraging me and praising me for good work it is truly a great company to work for."
good,It was a nice environment to work in. All staff was fun and easy to work with. Always got our work done on time. Learned how to fold clothes.
good,"I love working at Gap, I've been here for almost a year now and I think that it's such an amazing place, I had never had a job before so it was so amazing being able to learn so much. Gap really pulled me out of my shell and taught me to be more outgoing and welcoming. I think probably the hardest part of the job is when you have a 9 hour shift and your 10 minutes away from being able to clock out. I really enjoy the people I get to work with everyday."
good,"friendly place to work, sociable staff however very hardworking, especially during delivery shifts, hardest part of the overall job was the extent of recovery and renovation to the shop, however this hard part was cancelled out by working with some excellent staff who worked together to complete tasks quickly and effectively"
good,"always exceeding expectations, goals and production. always hiring seasonal work. Discounts are great, when purchasing employee clothes. Nice break rooms, and good benefits."
good,"Working at Gap was fun. We had a great team and always worked well together, Being able to work with different customers from all over the world was awesome learning of the different types of languages and money was fun."
good,I earlier faced prob to take the carge and decision as it was complicated due to the loss invloved in the case here after i have checked alll the minor details and trust my gut skill and proceeded and succeeded
good,"i learned a lot of customer service. i did enjoy this job a lot. the days were long but enjoyable, your shifts did get cut a lot though."
good,"Work life is really well balanced, with the management being very understanding on any adjustments to personal life. Enough time to request holiday, but most holidays are approved, although little time over Christmas and summer sale; although odd days are not too bad. "
good,"Working here was a great experience. I learned new systems and I met great people. Customers were sometimes difficult, but I learned how to deal with them appropriately."
good,"Packing, picking, receiving and returns. I learnt to cooperate and especially working with team that is too simple for me now."
good,Placed phone orders for multiple brands while maintaining superior customer service.  Excellent training. Very supportive and helpful managers.
good,Great company to work for!! Always room for growth if you love the retail life

Supervision dans les domaines comptables, commerciales, clients fournisseurs, communication avec la presse, les élus ...plus on avance plus il faut manager l'équipe qui grossie avec l'accueil, et les employés pour le montage des manifestations. Relations avec les élus ..."
good,"No shortage of work in a global environment. There are some systems challenges. Good people and processes. Commitment to not over working and giving back to the community.  Positive coworkers- GAP hires fun, upbeat people."
good,I enjoy training new employees. It is a very good place to work and discount is also very good!! You get to be very creative!
good,"I am a assistant manager at the outlet that has been with the Gap INC for about 9 years. I started at a retail location in Mansfield OH, and transferred about 8 years ago to the Grove City Outlet location."
good,"My years at the gap have been very good to me. A typical day at work would be fulfilling my responsibilities to the customers. Getting the items that they ordered to the them asap. I learned that a honest days work was very pleasing.I also learned that not all my co-workers work the same way as I.  My upper management team is awesome. When I have ever needed anything, they have found the time to listen and walk me through my needs. The hardest part of my job is knowing that it is coming to an end.I hope my next job is as good as the Gap is.  I will really miss everything about it there. I really enjoyed all of the diverse people I have gotten to work with and got to know personally. The Gap is a great company."
good,"Very good people. Fun place to work. Most of the projects at Gap Inc are now moving to agile making the work more fun. Daily Stand up meeting, outings with co workers, a good administration all put together makes it a fantastic place to work."
good,"Excellent workplace. An atmosphere of great respect and companionship. In just 9 months of work I learned a lot. Moreover as part of my achievements in the company, the most important was that in only 4 months was selected as employee of the month."
good,I started here at 16 and over the years it has taught me so much.
good,"High demanding retail environment."
good,"- Great Co-workers"
good,"A typical day was extremely hectic filled with customers doing last minute shopping. I was assigned to be a sales associate, fold clothes, and stock clothes from inventory."
good,Loved the environment there as well as the benefits. The hours are really flexible and they always ask you what amount you can work.
good,"My typical day at work was busy and full with customers from all around the world, which showed how diverse our store was. What I've leaned was strong customer service and and communication skills. The management of the store was very reliable to us employees and especially to the customer. There one difficulty and that was getting the customers to be a continuing member at the gap but i overcame that problem because the people there was supportive. Everything about the job was enjoyable because everyday was a new experience."
good,In this position I learned many on the job skills like restocking shelves and helping customers find items. A typical day at work would usually involve helping customers in and out of change rooms and returning cloths to the rack if they did not desire to purchase them. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk and help with the customers
good,"It was a culture of its own, within the small town of Gallatin Tenn.  The workplace was exciting, the people were nice.  It really felt like you were a part of something really unique and enjoyed the years I spent there.  Unfortunately it was at the time gas was nearing $5 a gallon and it was a long commute, so I had to end my employment with such a fine company."
good,"my day starts at 0730 and finishes at 1800hrs"
good,"Great company, lots of creative freedom, still have many friends who work there."
good,"I like working here because it appeals to everyone. However, I don't like how some people are able to work better hours than I am. I also don't like working in retail. I do not get paid nearly enough for doing what I have to do at work. "
good,"In a typical day at work I talk to anywhere from ten to one hundred customers doing anything from giving style input to assisting with transactions. The management team consists of one General Manager and three Assistant Managers, and they are all friendly and helpful in their own right. My co-workers are young and lovely when it comes to personality. Some are shy, some are outgoing; I've always wanted to write a sitcom incorporating the various personalities. The hardest part of the job is carrying out a request for a customer that isn't normally carried out in other circumstances. Sometimes customers will make seemingly outlandish requests, but its important to keep in mind that accommodation is essential.    "
good,"I fit , sent out fit comments and  to created developments specs ."
good,"Gap is an excellent company.  I enjoy working with them. There is plenty of opportunity to grow, pay is good, benefits are excellent and people are amazing."
good,Processing online orders for customers. Correcting and sending online orders that were incorrect. Things I learned were how to process and correct orders online and the procedures that gap inc takes to satisfy their customers. My co-workers were nice. The most challenging part of my job would be working express orders and meeting the deadline. the most enjoyable part of my job would be the fast pace.
good,"I really enjoy working at the Gap because everyday is different. The environment is fast paced and I have learned to deal with many different situations in customer service, visuals/merchandising, and have picked up on smaller managerial tasks. My managers are incredible and make working at my store enjoyable. They are willing to work with my school schedule and are very generous with allocating me hours."
good,Clock in and meet with the group you are assigned to. Meet manager of the group and do the daily meeting. Break out of group find a station to work and begin. There are no assigned work areas just home areas for your manager. I learned how to better pack things. The management has an open door policy and are quite friendly. Most of the co-workers you meat are from mixed backgrounds and will not bother you. Great place to meet new and interesting people. When work gets slow it can be fairly boring. The easy hours and fast paced work.
good,Typical work day consist of meeting daily quotas for the Gap Credit Cards and sales.
good,awesome work atmosphere and very wonderful people to work around and create relationships with. Great management as well.
good,"Gap is a great place to work, understands work life balance and strives to keep you happy.. Pay could be better , but the great benefits take the sting out of it."
good,"Gap Inc. Direct is a nice place to work for the individual who wants a nice job with a nice, conducive atmosphere. However, the job sentiment in the LP department is that of police-like aggression and mundance, repetitive work. You are half-rewarded for intensive endeavours, such as Fire Control Panel repairs. It was a nice place to work; I would refer post-HS graduates and older individuals."
good,"At Gap , My typical day is staying in the fitting room and making sure I process everything. After I have processed everything I then run it to the appropiate areas. I am in charge of keeping up with the girls section, womens clearance, and also boys. I have learned how to look up items to see if we have them in the store.I have also learned how to call another store for a customer to buy an item from them. My coworkers are all very helpful, everyone works as a team. The hardest part of my job is running clothes because the store changes everyday.! The most enjoyable part of my day is just working with such great management, and coworkers. The managers aren't ""stuckup"" they work just like we do. They are constantly helping, and giving everyone projects that are fun but getting the job done."
good,I work 10 hr shifts 3 days a week. I know things from inbound to outbound.
good,"I loved learning the 4 groups of customers that entered the store daily.My days were never the same. I loved the challenge of being in multiple places at once and helping everyone.Teamwork was a plus, even though we were short handed on staff, we got through it together."
good,"There is always room to grow. I started out as a sales associate and developed my skills to be come a District Orientation Facilitator. I held various positions along the way, from; Customer Experience Expert, Denim Specialist, Visual Specialist, Stock Supervisor, Cashwrap Specialist, Supervisor, Manager and Recruiting."
good,It's a very energetic work environment regardless of what shift your on.
good,I love my work because i never get bored from work. Time go fast because my work is interesting. I love to work with my work team.
good,Gap always gave me independence to do the tasks they sent to you. But even if you are alone there was always someone over there just in case you need any help. Also the associates were always cool.
good,"I’ve kept gap as a part time job for many years, as long as you have a good team the work environment/culture is great. The company really does take care of its employees, I felt that at my particular location they always hired managers from outside. That was always a little disappointing. It’s good if you just need a little extra cash and need flexibility."
good,"Great place to work at because it is a fact paced position. during the time i was there I learned how to use a scan gun also how to read a work map, my manager was very patient and listened to us whenever we had an inquary"
good,A typical day of work was non problematic and straight forward with carrying out basic sales associate tasks both on and off the floor. With folding and placing fresh boxes of clothes in the back to put on the floor. Management was friendly and supportive. Hardest part was the unpacking boxes off the skids. Most enjoyable part was helping on the sales because of my deep product knowledge.
good,"It can be a lot of fun. If you work hard and have open availability, you can advance your career very easier. The possibilities are endless if you apply yourself."
good,The most difficult part of the job for me was learning how to use the cash register. I was never good with cash so don't feel frustrated that you do things slowly.
good,Working at Gap factory is a fun and easy job. You're able to meet a lot of new people. When you work at gap you have to very push when it comes to pushing the store credit card. other than that would recommend.
good,"Gap Inc. fostered an incredibly collaborative work culture. Majority of people love to be there, work hard and have fun! The company provides many opportunities to advance skills through their learning and development department. It was a wonderful place to work."
good,Everyone that worked at the store was so welcoming and always willing to help each other out when needed. My favorite part about the job was the constant encouragement from the management team to earn credit card enrollments. They were never too pushy but wanted each associate to succeed.
good,Work was always get rallied in then go to your floor and help customers or whatever they asked for you to do. I learned all my retail experience from there so a lot of things. Great managers just wants to succeed the goals good individuals. The culture of the job was cool everyone really got along and never got of element. The hard part was just dealing with a lot of traffic through the store and being under staffed. I like the area downtown and also meeting good people but most importantly the opportunity.
good,GAP in the mornings is very fast past that you have a good sense of urgency. I learned how to be organized and be very detail in the work I was doing to be very successful at the position.
good,Employees were not hired by their quality of work or..hard work .this is d only demarit point I ‘ve seen.They only hires employees on a seasonal basis.
good,"Fun place to work. They take care of their employees (benefits, discounts). Somewhat difficult to move in a leadership position full time. Many seasonal roles to try during peak. Regular role saved for end of season"
good,"I had a terrible manager at first but at our newest location, the management staff is 100x better. The scheduling is very lenient so you have a nice work/life balance (esp if you are a student) Pay is very decent imo for retail. Discount is great too on top of sales!"
good,It was good for what it was. I had to move on in my career field in order to continue progressing. good experience but couldn't afford my lifestyle. good 1st job
good,This company is great for anyone looking for a second job or just wanting to start out part time. They are willing to teach you a lot and want to grow you as an associate in hopes of helping you reach your goals.
good,this was my first job and i enjoyed it a lot they taught me a lot about retail and customer service things that I still use today.

Everyone is very motivated and driven to do what's best for the business and despite tough economic times, everyone for the most part was always in good spirits. The great work-life balance probably helped!"
good,"excellent communication skills"
good,GAP Inc. does not discriminate and it shows in their diverse employees and customers. This is the only workplace I've worked at that did not treat their employees poorly. Managers strived you to do better without being mean or rude. They were very encouraging and always made their workers feel comfortable.
good,"A typical day usually consists of retail work such as customer service, folding clothes, sensor clothes, shipping/receiving."
good,"I love the interaction with the customers, the satisfaction of assisting a customer on a daily basis on their shopping experience and shopping needs is very rewarding"

good,Gap Is A Fun Company To Work For. Very Flexiable Which Is Great For Work And Life Balance and Personal Time. Management Is Good And Understanding. Co-Workers Make Work Even Better.
good,"As a call center agent I am typically on the phone for the entire day, however everyone at the center is amazingly polite and courteous to one another. I learned so much on the job especially how to de-escalate customers and read situations much better. My managers thus far have been amazing, and we have open communication. The hardest part of the job is keeping still for 7hours a day. I believe that being active is an essential part of my life and am hoping to find a career with balanced expectations. But the hardest part of the day is is forgotten when I come to work and am met with smiling faces and working for a great company that sells an amazing product."
good,It was a fun working place with neat environment.the supervisor and co-work all get along in a team working manner toward getting the job done
good,"I have worked for this company for 20 years, and to my excitement there is always something new to learn and to be."

good,"great company to work for, have been with company for 6 years"
good,"I enjoy my current job at Banana Republic (GAP INC). I love the environment, the team i work with and the great managers I have above me. I've so far learned the importance of customer service, customer loyalty and how to always satisfy and to go to bat and back for our great customers. My management is lovely and we have a great relationship in and outside of the store. We all have a greater connection than just the work we have to get accomplished. We can discuss anything to each other at any time of the day possible and i love that. My co-workers along with the management have also turned into family. I look forward to going into work every shift even knowing how much work we might have ahead for that given day. The bond and connection we've all built is impeccable. No two days at work are the same for me, I've learned to do so many things there that I'm always on to a new task. No matter if its Shipment, Stocking, Maintenance, Janitorial, Register, Clothes Styles & Importance or even just Customer Servicing I will always be doing something new every shift and thats also a Pro to the job. I find nothing to be hard for the job, I always learned to master any task I'm given no matter how difficult or impossible it may seem, i will always  Work! Work! Work! until I feel i can stand next to the best to do it. I love my job but I feel that with me maturing and growing that it's just time I stand out and expand my skills and what the world has to offer me."
good,"Sadly corporate office decided to close many of the medium size stores. Unfortunately, ours was one of them although, we did very well going above and beyond meeting goals and keeping our store neat and orderly. We had great employee's and wonderful benefit packages! Really miss my carreer with GAP"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at The Gap, but I couldn't balance overnight shifts with the rest of my life."
good,This is a good place to work because of the people that you work directly with. The business as a whole will help the employees and the surrounding community with charitable donations. The draw back is that the upper management will take the rug out from under you if you use your PTO that you've earned too sparingly.
good,"Busy and fast paced environment, Pleasant co-workers. I learned how to operate store equipment and also appreciate the knowledge that i have gained working with the company."
good,"I enjoyed this job. Worked my way up to an assistant position, pay wasnt bad, and the people were really cool."

A lot of merchandising, customer service, folding product, etc. I learned a lot about what retail means and everything someone has to do on a daily basis. Management was very interested in the advancement of the associates. If someone shows interest, they take them and teach them what it means to be a manager. Co-workers are awesome, they make working there fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job is standing for so long and the most enjoyable part of the job is all the contests and fun the managers incorporate into everyday."
good,Fun environment and some growth opportunities to some that work hard and show potential. 
good,"Although distribution operations shut down in Northern Kentucky, Gap was a great place to work while they were there."
good,"A typical day at Gap Outlet is fast paced and dedicated to customer satisfaction. I learned how to handle disgruntled customers, how to find certain items at other Gap Outlet locations and send them to customers, and how to communicate to customers who do not speak English. The management staff is very helpful, understanding and respectful. I know they understand if I have a conflict with my work schedule, or have an issue with another employee. My co-workers are very easy to get along with and helpful if I need assistance with another customer. The hardest part of the job is the language barrier since there are a lot of visitors from other countries. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find the clothes they are looking for and knowing they are satisfied."

good,Employees and management were always helpful and great to work with. I was also able to gain more experience with customers and better my communication skills. Workplace was respectful and overall a good environment.

good,"I worked for a week from 8am to 4pm. I had to fold and arrange clothing in the correct places. I also helped customers find the right sizes for what they were looking at. There was one time when a kid was running around in the store and knocked over a rack of clothing almost on top of him, so I moved the rack and helped the child up and took to his mother. I explained what happened, then went back to clear up the mess. I learned how to use the till and communicate with people more effectively."

good,"I would get to work and clock in out back and put my stuff in the locker. I'd go up behind cash and see which department I was in, usually I was on cash. When nobody was in the line, I'd tidy and stock the front of the store. When there were long line ups at cash I would page another employee as back up. I would take my break out back and the return to the job. At the end of my shift I would go out back and clock out. I learned how to deal with unhappy customers and how to satisfy them as best as I can. I loved all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was when it was got very busy and we were short staffed. I loved the work environment and the discounts."

good,"Customer service is the big part of the day, Visual presentaion is key to success. Hiring talent is highly benificial to your success."
good,"A typical day consists of leading and motivating a large staff. Offering great customer service to all customers. I also run the women's depart, train and hire staff, make the schedule and lead community service events. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching someone something that they didn't know. Also helping customers find what they are looking for. One of the hardest parts of the job is the hours."
good,"Work in GAP was enjoyable, unfortunately it was short because of family issues."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benifits, worklife balance, and room for advancement."
good,"Very relaxed and casual atmosphere. I have improved my business acumen and learned about the P&L statements and dashboards. I know how to operate with limited payroll and resources. My staff and peers are awesome! The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet all day and closing the store to turn around and open it the next day. To add to the difficulty, I have an hour commute. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and the genuinely nice and interesting customers that I meet."
good,"nice place to work for this place i relocated and workplace familiar"
good,"By far, this is the best retail company I've worked for. The staff are super friendly. I worked in SF and Sacramento and they both are very understanding of their employees' lives outside of work. I was a student at the time I was working in both places and they were able to accommodate for my schedule changes each semester."
good,"Gap, Inc. is a great place to work. I found compensation, including annual bonus (on good years) to be competitive and rewarding.  Lots of opportunities to work in different areas (different brands) of the company while delivering IT projects."
good,"this place is nice for someone who is going to school, since they are very lenient with your schedule and also the pay is enough to get you by. co workers are cool"
good,"I loved working there, sadly it wasn't a long time, but the time there was memorable. The management was great, they were always willing to help customers and help employees."
good,This company was fun.  Lots of motivation and team work.  We had many training events and lots of celebrations.  I enjoyed working here but another opportunity came up.
good,"I've learned how to interact with customers, organize a store , how to close a store, and  maintain a store. The co-workers are very helpful and communicate with positive energy."
good,"great co workers."
good,"As a processer I feel like a very good team member. I have learned to work, communicate effectively and be very detail oriented the management is very encouraging and provides us opportunity's to learn. While working at The Gap Center I've worked with a very diverse team. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with people from all walks of life. The hardest part of my job and also my favorite part is solving problems it gives me the opportunity to actively use my imagination and help others, I encourage challenges."
good,"Good work environment, best place to work, would work there again in the future"
good,"A typical day would be helping customers find clothes, being a saleman on the sales floor just a typical store environment."
good,"A typical day at work would go by smoothly. Working at Gap Inc. would always keep you busy. The management was really nice and knew what they were doing. Co-workers were friendly and always happy. There wasn't really a hard part of the job, because you understood that you would always be busy and on your feet to keep customers happy and to do your job at best. The most enjoyable part of the job would be always being at service for customers."
good,The management at the Tulare outlets Gap is horrible the store manager doesn't do anything he's never there the assistant manager likes to talk about people. Very poor work environment
good,"It's seems like a nice job and you maybe work your hardest and do all most everything right, but once you miss up the manager will stop giving you hours and things."
good,just doing all the items open from the boxes and hang them up or put on shelf and put them away after it is all finish. they kept cutting the hours off way to far. less pay and not getting good pay as need.
good,"It was fun when I was working there.At that time we all worked together as a team.My location had a language barrier problem, customers assumed everyone spoke spanish.The management team would work with you on the sales floor,not like other stores,some managers would stay in the office and claim they're doing paper work."
good,"Working with numerous people can be more entertaining. "
good,"The Gap was an interesting company to work for my only complaint is the lack of better management within the company across the board. The Gap has a great work culture and great atmosphere to be apart of, but the lack of serious management undermines the great potential of the culture."
good,The only thing I can say is a successful Gap store only happens when management and the workers are in harmony. I've been through 3 management changes and only one was successful.
good,"It was a very very busy job, always fast-paced, and all over the place. Everyone was being micro-managed everywhere. There had to have been at least three to four managers on all floors because of how big the store is, and how many people were working there."
good,"Great job, i enjoyed customer interactions and setting up the store. I enjoyed building lasting relationships with customers. What i did not like was the constant push of gap cards and no rewards when we receive them"
good,it was a fun place to work the job was not offering that many hours typical days were fast pace alot of new people and new nationalities co workers all got along and joked around but worked hard when needed
good,"I was employed as a seasonal sales team. I provided consistent support to all the the team members, customers and completed my daily tasks. I enjoyed my time."
good,"I love working with others. I go into work with a positive attitude and do my job with pride. I greet guests and assist them with picking out clothing. I finalize their purchase at the cash wrap, replen clothing items and light cleaning of the store."
good,Cheering up and snacks for the good job being done. The happy customers and pleasant co-workers.
good,This is truly a company that cares about its employees. Although they seem to go threw many Store Managers and District Managers in the southwest Region. We had a wonderful team of employee that were determined to bring the company to top!
good,The scheduling was not the best they were able to change your schudel and not n notify you that I'd been changed so if you didn't look at it all the time we could miss the time that you should do working!
good,"loved it loads to do but was fun, great teamwork"
good,"Great place to work. Enjoyable, Great discounts, Need more hours to keep employees there. Excellent company to learn about retail.Employees are great and friendly to work with."
good,it was fun servering the customers at gap i did enjoy my job even if it was for a short time
good,"Great place to work at, very structured company"
good,"Management wasn't up to key. Things were changing for the worst and it affected my attitude at work. It affected employees and production levels for all. The three years I was there, I tried to step up but management shot me down. I was demoted to part-time but that didn't stop me from being the top performer. I went out of my way for co-workers and did my best to achieve the highest output of production. The hardest part of my job was to keep busy, my management team couldn't keep enough work/tasks to keep my production up. I always had to be on downtime or cleaning code. But all in all we had great benefits and compensation. The last few months was hard, due to a down size, mandatory shut down, and job loss. Everyone loss interest and no one had energy to work hard at their job. "
good,"Throughout my shift, I would recover and replenish the store as well as process clothes in the fitting and put them back where they go. I would also check out customers at the cash wrap and lead some of the sales associates. Some nights I would count the register drawers and make the out the store deposit. I learned great customer service skills and communication skills with strangers and coworkers. I also learned how fold clothes fast and efficiently. The management team at Old Navy is phenomenal. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work ethic you put into it when working fast and efficiently. The part I enjoyed most were my coworkers because everyone got along and worked so well together. Old Navy is a great company and I was a sales associate but I was also a leader of other sales associates and a cash handler"
good,"Greeted the customers that walk into the store and assisted them with questions, educated customers on the gap credit card, processed new shipments in the stock room, replenished clothing out on the sales floor, and processed sales and customer transactions."
good,"A typical was long, I learned how to pack customers in a timely manner. The management team was great, if you needed to speak with someone it was easy to do. The co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was working long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work overtime to make extra money."
good,The gap has been hands down the most family oriented organization I have been with. Although very small the people from with in all seem connected. Evan those from different gap locations still seem connected.

good,"Great place to work, fun staff, typical clothing store work. Just be on top of your scheduling because sometimes scheduling will get to be bad. But other than that, its a great place."
good,"When you start, you have to clock into a machine, then you would need a radio and tell the managers that you were on the floor. I mostly folded clothes and helped customers with shopping."
good,"Benefits and salary are great.   I truly enjoyed working in the Payroll department."

good,"I enjoyed working here aalot, the customers were amazing and so were the staff. Manager was always on time, and always had things done when they needed to be. Manager was leaned back for most part. definitely felt part of a family working here. Different cultures and different people, it was great getting to know everyone. working here gave me the ability to work fast but neat, Definitely gave me more courage and knowledge of the retail industry. This job also gave me a lot of patience working at a store that carries cloths for all ages does get pretty chaotic but still manageable with all the workers around."

good,"My typical day at work consist of updating myself on the sales, figuring out what goal is for the day, seeing what was left behind by others and going on to tidy up, clean out fitting rooms, ring up customers, move flow if necessary and a multitude of other things. This job is competitive and it's exactly what I needed."
good,We walked around and picked items for the stores. Then we put them in the box and shipped them out. It was a good place to work but they left Ky. The hardest part sometimes was the walking around in circles to get your tickets done.

good,"Everyone working here is very nice and very knowledgeable.  Management was behind the work being done on the project, and gave it a lot of support.  I recommend working here."

Every employee had their assigned task for the day, whether it be working the fitting rooms, folding clothes, assisting customers, or unloading and pricing inventory in the warehouse. Physically it was less demanding than some of the other jobs I have worked, however I did have to interact with customers more at this job. The most difficult aspect of this job was knowing memorizing where all the merchandise is assigned, however once one learns that, it becomes the easiest part of the job. From that point on directing customers and other employees becomes much easier and rewarding."
good,"Very different from banana republic, feels like a totally different brand. Also very creative and fun so far. Excited to learn more."

I learned a lot of physical techniques to get myself out of a dangerous situation. I was taught how to read body language in different ways that would help me identify the issues that could arise in a position like this.  Management was very helpful, I felt like I was part of family.  My co-workers were pleasant, and ready to assist whenever I needed. We were able to communicate and get the job done.  The hardest part of the job was in the beginning, the Gap location I was in was large, with multiple floors, so getting used to the location was hardest for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the excitement of the job, since everyday was different it helped keeping me engaged and focused on the tasks at hand. I loved working for this company."

good,"Still, when I started with Gap, the luxury shopping center where my store was located was a dream world for part-time employment. From a radiant and airy sales floor full of customers to the equally glowing team of fellow Gappers ready to assist them, it was a pleasure cruise through a pre-recession world seemingly unaffected by the decline of the American mall."
good,"I processed returns, purchases, monitored fitting rooms and assisted customers as needed. I also helped with the shipment process and set up product displays."

good,Worked 10 hour shifts  from 5pm to 3am. I learned how to pick and pack  for the first time and other basic work skills. Management were professional and friendly and I never had problems with them. Co-workers stayed in their own station so there was not much socializing or working with others. The long hours and constant standing were probably the hardest part of the job but it was no big deal. The different  clothing I would see kept things fresh over the long shift.
good,"Gap provides a happy work/life balance and pays well to middle and upper management.

I truly love and enjoy all of our Associates as they do great working together.  I have been a Manager at Gap during my career there and I feel I do a great job with handling day to day operations and issues that arise in every aspect of retail.  I am also the Community Leader for our company and I participate in many fund raisers throughout the year.  I host many FUN Gap events for the Associates as I feel it is important for the to play as well since they work all the weekends and holidays throughout the year and we have a blast.  The hardest part of my job would be the hours and being away from family and missing out on family holidays due to our store being open.

I learned a lot about the retail business over my 4 years there. Management was great in every store I have worked at (which is several).

After the shipment has been processed I break down the boxes and tape them together in bundles before taking them outside to be thrown away. If I've learned anything from the Gap it is to be persistent and precise. Management is very well staffed with a variety of challenging personalities who strive to get everyone involved no matter what their position in the company is. My co-workers are very easy to get along with and we enjoy giving each other feedback on the task at hand so that we can do our jobs more efficiently. The hardest part about my job is lifting the boxes, it can take its toll. The most enjoyable part of my job is having the distinct privilege of working with an amazing staff."
good,The Gap is a great company to work for.  This was one of my first jobs working in retail.  I learned everything about customer service while working for this company.  They had so many great work shops to sharpen their employees skills.  I worked for the gap for a long time and was able to really work my way up from starting as a part time sales associate until I left the company many years later as an assistant manager.  The people that I had met while employed there will be a part of my life for a very long time.

I get a real thrill out of making my store represent the brand in the best possible way. I love planning and executing each new line, and watching it all come together with visuals and marketing.

I worked at The Gap on State Street and that was the new store that was built and I was apart of the 'first' team to work there so that was exciting! I made close friendships with my coworkers and managers. By our store being brand new, we had to learn everything fast! That to me was the hard part because everything was rushed and there was a lot to learn. The enjoyable part of the job was, really, everything but mainly assisting the customers.

good,"We always started with start up meeting to find out if you would be working in an department other than your home department and, of course we all didn't like that too much. Then you log on to your wareable got to the location and get to picking and filling orders. We had 2 twenty minutes breaks daily. I just worked fast to keep my production up to keep my job.We had as much fun as hard times. For break we had pool tables, basketball goals, air hockey and corn hole games. Also two break rooms one for smokers only and then non-smokers and we had Direct TV. It was a great job and company to be a part of. The management team and HR generalist was fair."
good,It was easy to go to work and enjoy my day. Every person seemed to enjoy what they do and were enthusiastic about making it a great work environment for everyone else.
good,"Communicating with co-workers and customers on a daily basis and problem solving with both. The sales team was truly like a family, everybody helped everybody and worked as a team."
good,Gap Inc was fun place to work. Understanding management and friendly coworkers makes this place an ideal place to work at. Gap Inc believe that customers are the sole reason they exist. for this reason we worked hard to satisfy the needs of the customers.
good,It was a fun job but it all depends on the other associates who you work with as management is mostly a mess. I began working for this company in New York and assumed that the management had been wacky due to the store not having a GM. When I transferred to the store in Georgia I became aware that it was not just the New York store.
good,The Gap is a great company to work for. I learned a lot from the management staff there. Of course I was already highly educated in the customer service field. However you can never be in a place where you wouldn't receive any more knowledge.
good,"I learning had experienced overnight stock and "
good,Enjoyed my work and time at gap however was told by management the contract was 4 weeks probation and it would be extended to different hours after training was complete. I ended up working 2 months (without contract change) to be told my contract was not getting extended but if i wished i could re apply and they would re hire.
good,"A young dynamic workplace for a first job. You learn about colors, styles, sizes and fashion trends. Everyday is a new day with new customers to greet and help."
good,"It was my first job, and I loved it. They people were great and the environment was welcoming. But working in customer service kills you a bit on the inside, so kudos to the people who can do it for the long run."
good,It was a great working environment 'working there was one of my first experience from I came to this country 'is have to give it up due to the fact that I have 'to move to Brooklyn NY
good,only my both managers mans are friendly and good with the employers the other people is very rude with the news person or when you are the other culture or country they dont help you.
good,"Gap has a reputation for providing high quality, classic clothing for every member of the family. Gap produces the highest caliber of employees and people love and trust Gap for its terrific customer service."
good,"Great co-workers, hard work, management team extremely supportive. Great benefits pretending to store discounts. Open just about 24 hours a day."
good,I love my job as a sales associate. You get to help people every day and majority of the time they are very appreciative of your time.
good,Great Opportunity to be promoted. Very Family oriented. You must be passionate about the brand
good,"Working together as a team to assure all customers have a positive shopping 	experience. Assisting and supporting customers while also selling products and completing a sale 	properly.  Operating the cash drawer, organizing shipment, and floor replenishment are other tasks performed to do so."
good,working here was fun. I usually had good hours and good pay. After my daughter was born my hour started to go down to about 4 hrs a day a few times a week and it was not worth the drive to take her to sitters and go to work so me and my husband decided it would be in our best interest if I just stopped working there
good,"As a sales associate I am the front face of the company to our customers, which I take very seriously. What they think of me, they will think of Gap, Inc. I have learned so much 1st hand about corporate business vs. small business and have found it to be interesting. Working retail is not an easy job, however the atmosphere of team work makes it a much nicer environment to spend your day in. "
good,"Nice to work at.  Nice processes in place.  Very collaborative.  Relationship heavy culture.  Rewarded for contribution.  Collaborative culture.  Need to be able to navigate effectively, (like ANY large corp.) to ensure maximum success."
good,"The IT division at Gap is more forward thinking than the industry thinks. Unnecessary politics sometimes get in the way of forward progress, but show me a place where it doesn't. At the end of the day, you usually feel that you accomplished something, or are on the verge of crossing a finish line with a good team."
good,I would work any time part-time  or full-time it a place were you can learn alot about your community and how to help other around you. over all it a great place.
good,"Working at the GAP in high school and then in college was wonderful. It was flexible, educational and taught me to balance work and school."
good,"enjoyed my job, wish i would have received more hours per week."
good,The most enjoyable part was satisfying each and every customer.
good,Great place to work for college students. Management is good and discounts are great.
good,"great place to learn management work and team work. Paid fairly. Learned alot of skills of management and customer service skills."
good,"a typical day at work is not the hard honestly and is very relaxed, sales associates typically assisted customers and took care of the fitting room daily. management was very solid and never stepped on anyone's toes and had a great balance of treating their employees with care and respect and following company's policy. Workplace culture very great, real great colleagues. the hardest part of the job is honestly stock, which still is not much of anything. While at the same time the most enjoyable part of working at GAP is the inspiration and lesson gained from having doing most of the task."
good,I learned how to work in a team and work in a busy environment. I was able to learn new things every day from the people I interacted with. I learned people skills and how to communicate with many different types of people.
good,"Not as welcoming as expected, It takes the IT so long to set up the new employees. Their systems are a bit dated but very serious smart people to work with who have a high respect for employees. "
good,"Managers, as well as staff, were inviting and extremely friendly. The GAP's work environment is great as well. There are many things to learn and a lot of experience to gain while working for the company."
good,"this job was fun but it was only temporary with a potential to stay on full time however they didn't keep anyone that year, you learned to take orders and how to suggest add on and build the sale"
good,"It was a friendly work environment. a great stepping stone into a full-time job. I was able to learn how to help children pick out cool school clothing, and friends and family with new additions."
good,Great environment. Up pace & had a decent amount of hours for the week as a part time employee. Had a variety of shoppers & the customers were very easygoing and understanding. Always had great prices and sales for great quality clothing.
good,"I gained some retail work experience. It was not a huge position, I was part time and the hours were not available for me to work full-time (and sometimes not even part time)."
good,We mainly scanned units to be shipped out. Making sure items were not broken or damaged. Management made work easier by beijng of assistance if needed.i enjoyed my job it was very stress free.
good,"Reputable company, opportunities for advancement available, great atmosphere and culture. Fast paced, great leadership structure and great way to meet new people."
good,"Je n'ai pas eu le temps d'évaluer cette boutique, mais les 3 jours ont été bien mais fatiguant."
good,"The managemnet was amaizng. I loved working for GAP outlet. Easy job. The store is awlays busy when there are sales. I was in high school, and they worked with my schedule."
good,i learned how to stock different type clothing. also how to put all the clothes on the shelves before the store opens up at ten in the morning. the management is quite good fair. Work place culture is very clean and attractive. the hardest part of the job is dealing with a customer on the floor that might be pickie in about choosing what they want to buy.
good,I enjoy working in the baby section. Over in the babyGap was fast paste all the time and the customers were really demanding. Also it was easy selling gap cards in that section.
good,Working at the Gap was fine. The management overstaffed and obviously many were laid off. We had Gap cards to sell and which seemed to be impossible for myself to do until I found that many of my co-workers found it impossible to sell Gap cards as well. Unrealistic standards.
good,"I enjoyed my 11 years at Gap Inc. and feel like I got amazing training, experience and was part of a globally effective team."
good,the environment their was awesome. my manager was so cool. i loved all my coworkers a lot. i learned how to talk to people and get out of my comfort zone. the hardest part of my job was leaving because i enjoyed every second of it. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and greeting them!
good,Une culture américaine basée sur la confiance et le mérite.
good,at gap the job was enjoyable i enjoy my job very much my job is to deal with customers basically customer/sales servic job
good,"Fun Workplace with a very supportive management. "
good,"I walked or stood my whole shift. Either picking or packing, i also helped management out with a lot of different things. Gap is a great company it was just a seasonal job"
good,"Entreprise très bien gérée malgré tout le travail qu'il y a. "
good,"Working for Gap has taught me how to work in multiple different environments and with many different people. Depending on the shift I could be apart of the design team, sales team or the stock team. Sales requires the associate to understand the customer while trying to sell product and achieve Gap card goals, while design and stock team are behind the scenes and  fast pace to make store hours flow properly. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co workers, we are great at welcoming new people and making sure we work as a team."
good,Great company that values you as a person and ensures you have work life balance. Over the past few years they have restructured middle management at an alarming rate
good,Lo que más me gustó del trabajo fue la manera en que Liverpool se preocupa por los empleados. Aprendí una forma de trabajar diferente.
good,"i would come in greet everyone , fold clothes, clean make sure everything was organized. I've learned to be patient and work on register. management was very pleased of my work ethic also i loved working for such a great company. co-workers were beautiful people all around. Hardest part of the job was leaving but the most enjoyable was everyday spending time with all the people of "
good,Very great friendly fun place to work! Never hated one day there.
good,Very busy during the weekend. I learned how to handle money and my time well. Some of the managers were not as responsible.
good,"Gap Inc. is a great company to work for! I was part of the opening team, and was responsible for hiring all new associates, store planning, coordinating travel for other leaders and on-boarding all associates. Great team, co-workers and building."
good,"Meet and Greet customers"
good,"A typical day at work was always busy so I was I always doing something. I learned great working skills such as how to speak with customers and also I learned a lot about the business and responsibility. I thought the management could have been better but overall I thought it was quite professional. I was really fond of my co workers, they were very friendly. the hardest part of my job was only when I did over nights but other than that it was great. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually working and keeping busy."
good,If it were not per management I would most likely still be part of the team.
good,"Typical work day: Go to work and get my job done."
good,ability to work with many different people and meet all kinds of great friends. many daily tasks to acomplish
good,It is a great company to work for if your in college.  I did merchandising.  I was apart of shipment.
good,"Its a very easy process as far as getting in. But to earn a permanent position within the company is difficult. My production percentage was 160%, but because of a couple occurances within 6 months (leaving early when business was slow), I was not hired. But it is still a very awesome place to work, where you can meet some of the best residents of the ohio!"
good,The Gap has evolved and remained the same.
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. My co-workers have become life long friends and people that I can always turn to for help and support. While I wish this was a company I could have stayed with longer, I am very glad that I got my start here so that I could learn so much with so many good people. With a very high paced environment, a large amount of fashion and great little people to dress every day this job is a plus for the young at heart."
good,"Upon,clocking in read board with important information such as sales, sales goal, onc goal, and lost pervention information.After, clocking in report to LOD(Leader On Duty) for placment for the day . These areas worked rang form casiher, various departments,and fitting room attendent. As caisher we are to provide a quick, friendly,and accurate check out. As a worker in specific deparment worker we are to provide outstanding customer service and maintain a neat and orderly work space. As fitting room assistant we are suppose to also provide customer service will replenishing go backs and maintain up keep on the fiitting room."
good,I loved this place and even improved my self . But was not selected because I did not have a high enough production rate. Would definitely recommend for temporary
good,This job would be great for young adults trying to start off. This job was something that I would recommend for college students who may need money to get through.
good,This was my first sales job and fell in love with it! The management team was great and you learned so many new skills that will definitely help you out for a new job. You build as a person and gain more knowledge when it comes to customer service
good,Daily there is something different and opportunities to new learn things and teach new things. You come across things that are different than the day before.
good,my nights would be interesting working overnight stocking and replenishing the sales floor I learned how to communicate with different races and ethnicity I enjoyed my management team they were always pushing me to be the best
good,"it was great, super fun environment. I enjoyed it mostly because of the people I worked with. It was a lot of fun but it was very fastpaced since it was a factory outlet and the floor would get messed up very fast."
good,"Gap has been a company I have been proud to work for. Gap was created by a family that had high integrity and morals and those traits are visible in every aspect of the company. There is no cheating to get a head, only those who work hard will be asked to stay and promoted within. There is no ""juice"" to drink, just be a good person who wants challenges each day in an effort to advance the company and your own career. you manager does matter, but there are few ""bad"" managers and there is counseling and training to become a better manager company wide. I have enjoyed my time here greatly."
good,great work place to start working at after high school or while in high school.Flexible time and management is amazing. i would recommend it to any teenager looking for their first jobs.
good,The enviorment is very friendly and fun. Managment usually tells you what is needed to be done for the day and gives everyone their jobs for the shift. There’s a chance of skill growth the longer you work there; you start off on the sales floor customer servicing and recovering product and gradually get trained to do cashier or backroom stock. Only downside to this job is that there isnt really and chance at promotion.
good,Overall company was a great experience but was not good when came to my hours to be able to support my own self. Everyone is nice and helpful and United.
good,I enjoyed my time at Gap Inc. I learned so much there and made life long friends. I achieved what I wanted and just needed to move on. Management was amazing and inspiring at times others down right horrible. In that contrast you learn what type of leader you want to be.  Overall Gap inc was what I needed it to be.
good,"It was an overall team effort in the Stock Department. Our supervisors and managers made things got done on time for the day's store operations. The hardest part was dealing with the unexpected delays of shipment and surplus of shipment during shifts. But, again as a group, we put effort to accomplish as much as we can during the overnight shifts."
good,"the gap was a great place to work as they would rotate team members from different teams regularly onto projects outside of their group. the entire IT team as a whole (support, infrastructure, applications, telecom) functioned as a strong cohesive unit."
good,It was a seasonal job and of course there was always a customer who made our lives miserable. There was a problem with over hiring and our hours were cut back a lot.
good,I enjoy the team I work with.  Only big negative is not too much room for advancement once you are at the management level. There are a very limited number of upper management positions.
good,"The company itself is nice, but not much room for growth. The job becomes repetitive but is relatively enjoyable. The company does offer nice benefits."
good,Working here is nice because you get to interact with people. Not stuck in a cubical. Using RF scanners and the discounts was definitely a plus. Many location to work as well.
good,Gap is a very fun place to work. I got to know everyone very well and the pay is great for a retail job. I would highly recommend gap to anyone who is looking for a job
good,"The GAP was a great place to work. The staff are respectful and management is great. The job gets busy at time because it is an outlet GAP, but its manageable nonetheless!"
good,"This was one of my most favorite jobs. The management were not only fun, but were there to listen and were very supportive. My only qualms with this job were that there were not enough hours and compensation was significantly less than what I was looking for. I really only left because I was pregnant with my daughter, and for personal reasons could not work."
good,This company enables you to learn and grow. They teach you how to look at your business analyze it and grow it. Great benefits at all the brands and wonderful healthcare.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find the right size and telling them about the great deals. It is a fun, energetic environment anybody would enjoy working here."
good,"Work is challenging yet rewarding; daily tasks include cashwrap responsibilities and providing exceptional customer service. Love working with co-workers and management, very family orientated. Most difficult part of job is promoting BCC, while the most enjoyable part of the job is providing customers with outstanding service and working alongside co-workers and management."
good,enjoyed my time and pay there just wish I was told when seasonal would be over instead of like a day before. however the staff are great and very hands on teachers who are great to work with.
good,I love working there. I had awesome team members and supervisors. every employee had voice. The hardest part of the job was the customers.
good,"Conducted new-hire orientations which involved collecting legal documents to fill out necessary employment forms. Trained all new-hires on daily routines and store procedures including register functions and loss prevention information. Presented company history, regulations and expectations in front of 5 to 25 employees. Trained the entire staff on the store's brand credit card. Presented company work booklet along with suggested and invented role play scenarios to better sell the product."
good,"Easy to move up in the company. Went from sales to a manager, everyone was very friendly and had a lot of fun. Learned all about merchandising, something that i would of had to pay and arm and a leg for in school. The other managers were willing to teach."
good,"Gap Inc is a great company. It's rewarding to be the hiring manager, but you will be doing more than hiring, ie folding clothes. If you like a high stress environment, then this is for you."
good,This was a seasonal position.  Hardest part was standing for long periods of time.
good,"Fun typical day"
good,"A typical day at work is visiting stores, driving the business through coaching conversations with underperforming individuals/stores.  I also identify operational controls that could be negatively impacting specific stores profitability. I investigate and see to conclusion any internal theft/fraud and P&P issues.  I also lead a team of Loss Prevention agents and supervisors who are responsible for safety, recovery and apprehension of external theft activity.  I have built strong partnerships with business partners and conduct collaborative store visits for sustainable success & growth.  A main priority of mine is the development of my team for career advancement."
good,I started the day by getting up and going to work. then I learned how to use a mobility scooter. I always managed my time by putting my alarm clock on the night before. Then I help some of my co-workers how to use different microsoft packages.The hardest part of the job is that you have to make sure that your work area is clean and tidy. and the most enjouable part of the job was working with other members of staff.
good,"Atypical day in the Gap is full of energy, to make those sales, make those personal and store goals. I learned that customer service is all over, and its great to try your hardest to stay positive. My co-workers were fun and really team players. The hardest part was not taking my entire paycheck and not giving back to the company. What enjoyed the most was using my creativity to help other get dressed or even expressing my sense of style."
good,i loved working for the gap it was an exceptional experience. being at the gap give me a chance to really get to know the customers and meet many different kinds of people.
good,I really enjoyed working in this store. The hours were flexible and the company valued their employees

good,"- providing excellent customer service daily"
good,"great stepping stone, fast paced and everybody is very friendly."
good,"The greatest part about Gap is that there are all kinds of customers, of all ages and it's a great place for any Associate to gain experience.  There are also enjoyable benefits and some enjoyable events depending on your area.  Only issue anyone would have is that there is no sales commission, so if your work doesn't standout to the Managers, then your work will be seen equivalent to the laziest  employee of the store. If your work does stand-out, you may have an enjoyable future with the company or just great customer service, style, business experience."
good,I have worked her for so long I don't know my life with out the Gap.
good,"Very busy call center. team work is there and a typical day is about 100 calls or more, however the working conditions could be a lot cleaner, the cubicles are old. and the computers are very slow."
good,Days were slit between department time and Manager on Duty segments. Gap Inc always invest a lot of time and resources into developing their staff.  I enjoy mostly enjoy the structure that the company has. 
good,"A typical work day is very fast paced,no always moving around"
good,"A typical day varies on what field I'm working in, merchandising vs. sales. The merchandising team is a close knit group of creative individuals. A lot of problem solving and on the spot decisions have to be made. The management team works together closely and are all very supportive of their team. My co-workers are all wonderful people. They each have such vastly different characters that we all mesh together in one family. I enjoy the rapid pace and consistent amount of work that has to be done while at work. There is never a dull moment."
good,"typical retail , customer service, stocking and organizing, cashier, management team"

A Typical day for me was make sure that body department was stocked,cleaned and that i reached my daliy goal by the end of my day, The managers were amazing, always open to new ideas.The hardest part of my day is when i do not reach my goal or please my clients, and the best part is when i see my cllient Leaving with a smile.."
good,"It really is a decent place to work, but does not have many advancement opportunities and it is difficult for an ""average"" male to find a place in the company."
good,Overall great place to work with opportunities to grow.  Family atmosphere with lots of perks for working there.  Laid back environment with great management.
good,"I really enjoy being a CSR here. "
good,"did not work there long but loved working with the crew. Happy, and upbeat attitudes. very positive and was offered a posistion to advance that had to regreatfully be declined."
good,I enjoyed myself working at the Gap.  You need a lot of different people from all over when is especially when the cruise ships come in we get a lot of customers coming in from all over the country.
good,"The tricky part is if the scheduler does their job well it's amazing, if they do not it is a world of awful. "
good,"Enjoyed the job! The leadership and environment are great! Call center, high volume, but rep's are given the right tools and ability to assist the consumer's, without having to ask."
good,"Working at GAP INC for a year was relaxing and a healthy decision as you will be walking all day. Outstanding benifits program. Made good friends here, and the management team play fair!  Much OT available, sometimes mandatory.  They give out so many discounts, and free lunches every now and then, and excellent holiday incentives. Only left due to my phone being updated automatically,  therefore canceling my alarm. Used all my pto that day! GOOD LUCK AND BLESSINGS"
good,"Every day was productive as possible. If I needed help, my manager was always able to help me figure things out. Sometimes the customers can get testy but overall it's a great place to work."
good,A typical day at work would be going around the store helping customers and then ringing them up at the register and offering the Gap card and offering to enroll them in the Bright program. As a Cash-lead I help the manager where we should put people so that the store could get done quicker.
good,Gap has flexible hours for college and high school students. They offer great volunteer opportunity for a variety of different organizations. They promote from within.
good,"sucks "
good,"Workplace you can definitely climb quickly within the company. Ability to switch to other sister companies if better position arises. Great learning place for everything, become very well rounded in customer service, merchandising, visuals and operations"
good,"put my things in my locker. walk to my area. set up bags and shelves for work time ,even boxes as needed depending on the season sign in to the computer make sure scanners work start grabbing items from cubby and packing then in bags closing them .correctly and labeling them then putting them on to the belt we had to make sure the clothing was folded correctly and jewelry/accessories were put in the proper packing bags. I had learned how to work in a competitive environment scoring at production 300% was told I was in green and that I would possibly not be seasonal worker anymore. but the day came wear they took us in groups and said it was my last day. my manager told me to reapply. but I never went back. the work culture was a down to earth environment everybody worked as a team and got the job done because it was Christmas time there was a lot to get done.. a lot of totes. the hardest part of the job was leaving it. I enjoyed working in the environment. but I learned much form companies like they do what they have to regardless. most people do not have a say in who stays and who go's"
good,"The only issue I have ever had at Gap is that there is no work and personal life balance. I feel as if I am always stuck at work, yet I have almost no problem with that. I love my job, and I love all of my co-workers, a great environment to work in!"
good,"As a high schooler, this is an amazing first job. It was my first job and the management did a great job of getting on board and comfortable. The store managers at my location were all around cool and helpful, although the corporate part was quite the opposite. Very cool and easy job for the most part, but when it gets really busy it can be a nightmare. Some of the client base also tends to be very competitive and difficult, but that is only sometimes. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day and listening to the complaints of customers, besides that it is an amazing starting place."
good,Loved working there but when I switched teams and had different management team it was horrid. Do your research on the teams and structure of your team. Otherwise a great company overall. Just wish their comp package was more competitive.
good,Good job but no advancement or pay raise is bad. They need to offer more money and incentives to actually keep their employees longer. They do well with placement even though they sometimes lack the man power. All in all it's a great job.
good,I worked at Gap Factory for a little over a year before moving and pursuing school. Management is laid back but also keeps team on track and motivated. Breaks were reasonable and always kept me refreshed when going back on the floor. Loved working with co-workers who were all friendly. Never really had a problem with anything there. I really enjoyed my time at Gap and will definitely return if I were ever to move back!
good,"I enjoyed my time at Gap..... you get 50% off at Gap and Old Navy and 30 % off the other branches like Banana republic etc....I will def miss those discount... Pay was pretty good too, working hours wasn't enough...."
good,I learned quite a bit working for Gap. I enhanced quickly and took on a management role early on. I was trained when i first started but it got a little bit stressful during the holiday
good,"Very flexible schedules, for people who have busy lives this is a good place to work. People that work here have a great attutide and outlook on life and will give you the best customer service"
good,It was a very awesome place to work. I loved working there it was amazing. The benefits start as soon as you start working there. Climate control and much more.
good,"GAP hired IBM to come in and transition to their facilities management/systems management.  IBM said no one would be layed off.  Then, IBM said everybody would have to re-interview for their jobs.  When everyone went to interview, they were pink-slipped.  Kicked to the curb.  IBM kept the cream of the crop, but there was so much animosity going on with the remaining employees, my team had to do EVERYTHING ourselves, because there was substantial pushback for every request.  IBM could not have handled this in a worse manner.  Disgraceful!"
good,"A typical work day for me will be clocking in, having a face to face with a manager explaining deals and promotions and making sure we keep the checkout line down."
good,"At Gap, you learn good communication skills with customers, you learn how to make sales while working on projects, and you build good relationships with coworkers and managers as well"
good,"Monitored large numbers of customers to ensure risks Led The GAPs efforts and initiatives to attain more controls by partnering with external clients to eliminate financial loss to the company. "
good,"I've met a great set of people there. Management changes often, but when they find the right set of them, it makes work fun. The discount is fabulous and I love being there when I go to work."
good,"it was a great work environment, the managers cared about us and we felt like we were a vital part of the company. The only issues were that its very hard to advance."
good,I learned a lot and got to practice and make some of my skills stronger like my computer skills and working in a group to get a task done. over all I made some really great friends and learned a lot about the work that they do in the gap and advanced to other positions and learned other positions fairly quickly and did them very well so I was able to learn more and get paid more.
good,Takes care of its employees.  Paid well at every level.  Great discounts for all  and benefits for leaders.  Need to be able to balance competing priorities. Can be stressful during peak times.
good,"Great place to start your first job or to find a part time job for a little extra money. Great friendly environment that helps young adults gain experience that can push the, in their lives."
good,"Baby Gap was a fun place to work at, co-workers where very friendly and they were always helping each other out. Only thing that was hard was convincing customers to apply for the credit card."
good,"I work for Old Navy in Allentown and this store is very busy and messy. It is hard to keep up with the customers because that store as a whole is only given so many hours. With that being said we are usually always understaffed because we run out of hours quickly. That store is very popular and gets a lot of traffic hence the reason it gets ""trashed"". We try our very best to get the store back together at the end of the night but sometimes it is just impossible when we don't have the manpower that we need. We have the employees but we do not have the hours to give to those employees, so therefore they don't get scheduled."
good,Teams are given autonomy to make decisions and drive results. The management team is working together to deliver fashion that customers are excited to buy.
good,"easy job for anyone once you know what you doing"
good,overall Gap is a wonderful job and its very fun but yet fast paced. i enjoyed working there and giving my time to the customers.
good,"An iconic brand/company that has struggled to compete in the modern age of retail but, are aware of their shortcomings and are focused on being great again."
good,"My day to day work was restocking shelves, working in the stockroom, working in front of the store welcoming customers, working behind the tills."
good,Great company that truly cares about employees.  Advancement is difficult as there are just not that many open positions and it does take the company a long time to move through bottom performers.
good,A typical day at work is usually a fun and fast pace environment. Everyday is a learning experience. The coworkers are funny and full of energy. Management is hard working and devoted to the customers and employees. The hardest part of the job is getting the merchandise reorganized at the end of the day before closing out the store. The most enjoyable part for me is meeting new people everyday and interacting with the customers as much as possible.
good,"I have worked for this company for over a year and i enjoy the people i work with along with my managers. Would like to actually have a full time opportunity and full benefits, but they do not offer that. I am also a lead in the Mens/boys depertments and i enjoy the hands on experience i get with that title."
good,"i loved working here, Very easy and fun, loved interacting with all my customers every day. Got close to a lot of my customers. Learned new tasks every day and always had a great team to work with. Everyone was always so friendly."
good,Love the advancement opportunities within Gap Inc. Overall like any retail management position as far as day to day sales floor duties
good,A typical day at Gap Outlet is very fun and exciting. New customers come on a daily basis and I make sure I give them a great customer service experience. Management provides a helping hand to assist customers when needed and also motivates the team at all times. Helping the customers is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Gap Inc. It is a wonderful company to work for in retail. The people and the environment are very positive, and if you enjoy what you do, very rewarding."
good,"A typical day at work was never ""typical"".  Everyone was cross-trained in several areas so it was never boring."
good,"Working at The gap was very challenging,but it was not a bad challenge. It was a fun environment, because each day empolyees competed to see who can sell the most products and credit cards, which was why it was fun."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, though it was seasonal employment. They valued their employees and treated them with dignity and respect."
good,I was only seasonal so it was always busy and fast paced. Management did their job to help. My co-workers were all pretty fun but hard workers.
good,"The Gap is like any other job. We work hard towards our daily goals for the day, month and year. Our team is made up of strong, independent individuals who love satisfying our customers with every need. There are bad days where we may not make our day but we always bring great ideas to the table to do better, more. Working in retail gives you quite the experience to working in the fashion world or just in any business when it comes to people. The one thing we keep in mind is to work and have fun."
good,"Typical day consists of serving customers to the best of your ability with their store purchases. Placing and arranging stock on floor,making sure store is neat and presentable at all times."
good,Really enjoyed working at Gap Inc. Management is always helping the employees with training and necessary tools to excel.
good,"IVery good job this was just a seasonall position but I loved the environment, very good place to work they treat their employers very good.  The managers really get to know whom they working with, they have no problems assisting."
good,"I was with the Gap for thirteen years.  I was in Management and a Regional Recruiter.  The company offered great benefits, my manager was very supportive.  The hardes part of the job was finding talent in remote areas of my territory."
good,I enjoyed starting off as a stock person so that i could work overnights. The staff was productive and fun to work with. Dressing mannequins gave me the chance to display my own style ideas.
good,Fun work days with familiar customers. Learned the ins and outs of retail. Management is fun and very pro-active. Co-workers are positive and keep a uplifting attitude throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find out what best suits them.
good,"Because i work at Outlet/specialty i believe its very different from any average retailer.On a daily I deal with hundreds of non English speaking customers,which gave me that drive that i needed to learn different languages.Things don't flow as smooth as they should,however communication,dedication and hard work plays a big part in the success of the store. The culture is also very different compared to your regular retail store.By that i mean, working at outlet im used to dealing with $1000 transactions containing about 60 units,with ever other customer,while at the retail store you see customers buying like 10 units the most. Overall Gap is an outstanding company to work for."
good,"Through this co-op experience, I was able to acquire many skills. This experience overall was a pleasant intro to fashion retail and marketing goods."
good,"Fun environment and everyone is treated the same. There is so much to learn not only from your fellow employees, but from the customers who come in. From all walks of life and places around the world. Great to talk to them."
good,"Fold clothes, open doors, basic housecleaning"
good,"Gap Inc is a wonderful place to work however if you are a single mother with no support system it may not be for you. "
good,Gap has its own way of diversity among the work place. Great place to find yourself and long term plan with your career!
good,"I loved my time at Gap Inc. I was with the company a total of five years, between two different locations. A typical day at work  would mean; dressing in current merchandise, a quick meeting with the team and manager, goals discussed, greet and assist customers with their experience, and make sure the store made goal. Management was amazing to work for and with, communicated with upper management clearly, competently, and confidently. As a senior Sales Associate, I took the initiative to help new employees, and motivate co-workers.There was not a ""hardest part"" of my job at the Gap, there were challenges. I faced those challenges, and almost always succeeded in my task. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people all the time. "
good,"A typical day at work would be as a sales associate. Helping customers for what their looking for and satisfying their needs. I learned that so many people have different taste and are interested in what you have to offer. The management is great. We all get along as a team to get the work done. My co-workers are very nice and easy people to get along with. The hardest part about the job would be trying to get people to open up a Gap credit card, not everyone is willing to. But a challenge is always accepted. The most enjoyable part about the job would be seeing all the customers you get to help, and knowing the leaving the store satisfied because you helped them. "
good,A typical day at work starts off with floor surveillance of the store customers and employee transactions of the store that i was assigned to. I was in search of possible dishonest employees and  shoplifters. I was on the ORC TEAM (organized retail crime unit) and our job was to apprehend professional shoplifters. Before the day is over I would usually do awareness meetings with employees in my assigned departments on L/P Alerts and operational compliance based on my audit results.
good,"Big Company"
good,the merchandisers do not receive benefits which they should it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time.
good,"Greeted and helped customers, kept the store clean and neat. Ran the register. Management focused a lot on customer service and security. Co-workers were helpful and easy to work with. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers, but helping the customer was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,fold clothes
good,loading vans for deliverys receiving deliveries and putting stock awayadvanced from delivery driver to warehouse operator to assistant warehouse manager.
good,"Learning directly from the Visuals Merchandising district manager for Gap Inc was truly an honor. Learning about styling was not just about the presentation, it was also a business stategy."
good,On a day to day basis my duties find me in a fast paced fun environment. Where every day is a learning curve to achieve the maximum from my team and me.
good,Helping Customers by finding items that weren't on Shelves

good,"Easy and fast paced"
good,everyone i met there was nice and fun to work with. learned alot about retail. hardest part of the job was traveling to multiple store in the district
good,Relaxed environment with good quality of communication from management with workforce giving information on a daily basis about the work day and departmental goals
good,"The managers at the store are great!, they are always willing to help in any way that they can. this is one of the reasons that the store is very highly ranked in Canada."

good,We were always encouraged to do our best. The management staff truly went beyond expectations to ensure that we were working collaboratively and meeting expectations.
good,"very friendly environment to work in, there were a lot of university students working there as it like a 10 minute walk from both campuses (in the galleria)"
good,"I like working here is everyone’s really nice and they work with your schedule. The discount is amazing for their products, and other coworking stores as well."
good,"forklift operations mostly during peak season. Floor trainer for my department. Picking, packing and shipping were all included in the putaway process."
good,"Management was very in-tune with the employees.  Any time I was asked to stay late or come in early, I always had enough downtime to rest and recover.  Management had daily meetings to check in to see any problems, trouble shooting,  Management also had monthly meetings with employees to discuss progress, areas of improvement and progression"
good,I have fun working here my only problem with this job is the new manager. He doesn’t care if people like him and he doesn’t care to listen to people who have been working at that specific store longer than him.
good,Great company to work for. Really focuses on internal and external customer environment and culture. Follow insights from customers to make experience better
good,Some days are busy some aren't. Learned how to take stocks. It is a diverse place. The pay is decent and its a lot of fun. The only hard part comes during boxing day and black Friday.
good,"Great team environment, people are very approachable and friendly. All staff is willing to teach and help push you. benefits are ex-client and employee discount is awesome"
good,Working in Gap is a great opportunity. Good way to move up in the retail world with growth through the business. Nice way of meeting new people and gaining more experience in the fashion industry.
good,"It’s a great place to work at for a first job (my experience),& the Pay is good for a starter. It’s pretty easy to catch up with everyone else. It’s great."
good,"ambiente molto sereno,tranquillo e ben gestìto,ambiente molto cordiale con a capo persone molto umane che riescono a soddisfare tutte le richieste che puoi avere,molto disponibili in tutto ."
good,This was my first fast paced retail job in the city after graduationg. GAP is an equal opportunity employer & gave me the tools / confidence to embark on larger retail sales endeavors.
good,"It's been a few years since I worked for this company, but the Grand Junction store was a wonderful place to work until they shut us down.  The management was well put together and the brand's name reputation proceeded itself."
good,"Good place to work. Management is good. Only complaint is they do not provide enough opportunities for advancement."
good,I loved working at gap because it was a new experience for me. I loved that I was able to learn all departments job functions as apart of inventory control department we worked every where in the warehouse.
good,"Depending on management it can be a very welcoming environment, they can help you with any issue that can occur on the sales floor or customer. A Great emphasis on opening Gap credit cards."
good,Ensure high levels of customer satisfaction through excellent sales service. Assess customers needs and provide assistance and information on products. Welcome customers to the store and promote sales. Process point of sale purchases.
good,"Workplace was fun, great coworkers and flexible schedule. Management was helpful and understanding of having to balance school and work, so hours are very flexible."
good,I liked working at Gap but the only problem I faced was I don’t really know Spanish but everyone else's first language was spainish. This wasn’t a big problem for me I made it fun trying to learn spainish with the workers that didn’t know English.
good,never work here. Hannaford food store I have work for this company for 3 years everything was well and great there is was an great environment to work in everyone was friendly generous
good,"The work place was a very organised and productive one, and for the majority of the time I worked there a very fun relaxed place to work. Throughout my time here I learned to become a patient individual, and now realise the importance of customer service and delivering it to an amazing standard. The majority of the staff were really good to work with, which alongside meeting and exceeding customer expectations was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,fun place to work with new faces coming in everyday. The management at times seemed very unsure or confused on what needed to be done but other than that I would work there again.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me asking customers if they would like to open a GAP card and making sure they are finding everything they need, as well as, making sure they feel comfortable in our store. The most enjoyable part is knowing i can satisfy our customers needs and answer all the questions they need answers to."
good,"Organized all the clothes, clean the place, greeting customers, sales, customer service. Help the pt to find something they need in the store."
good,A great place to challenge your ability to multitask while working in a stressful environment. Working at Gap inc. one can consistently rely on managment for support and development.
good,"very customer oriented place to work at. Cashiers met sales goals, fast pace store to work at. Workers are very focus on their tasks."
good,"Overall the job isn't bad. I'd say it's perfect for a college student who's looking to make some extra money on the side, wouldn't recommend it for anyone with serious bills since hours aren't always consistent. Your hours for the week (and sometimes the day) depend on store sales, but they're very flexible if you've got school or a second job.  Management isn't really pushy or demanding, they just expect you to meet the basic responsibilities of the job (fold/put away clothes, ask customers for email and credit card). Co-workers weren't bad either, I mostly kept to myself. Overall I can give the job a 9/10."
good,I worked for the company twice. It can be fast paced but also fun. There's a lot of multitasking to do and you will be sweating by the end of your shift. Definitely a good company to work for
good,"Working for the Gap is quite enjoyable. The atmosphere is never dull and the customers always seem to feel some sort of satisfaction from the time they enter the store, and by the end of their shopping experience. We've always kept a competitive and fun work place. Our mangers would reward us whenever we've achieved any of our goals. My time with The Gap has taught me a lot when it comes to the retail sales environment. Understanding products, the type of customers that associate themselves with the Gap brand, product placement, reaching daily sales, loss prevention, and executing merchandising and marketing initiatives has really opened my mind. Our management team wasn't always persistent, but they definitely knew how to make sure each shift was full of exuberance. "
good,"Llegaba 10:30 , nos pasaban a una sala de juntas y no explicaban algún proceso para la hora de trabajo, posteriormente nos llevaban a donde se encontraban las mesas, botes , manteles y productos a promocionar, nos daban nuestro lugar de trabajo y ya así comenzabamos la jornada alas 11:30 am hasta las 9:00 pm , y nos daban una hora de comida. los compañeros eran amigables, aprendí sobre como interesar a personas a un producto, lo mas dificil era preparar las muestras para mucha gente y lo que mas me gusto, que solo ocupaba mis fines de semana el trabajo."

The management has good communication with staff and willing to help out in the store as well as doing their jobs. My co-workers are friendly but run in clicks and if you're not part of the click than they just tolerate you. There really isn't a hard part about this job. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping the customers.

When I first started, the store manager was difficult to get along with, and seemed to put the store and earnings before associates, and sometimes customers' feelings. But I still excelled at my job, which included cleaning before the store opened, managing the entire women's and men's departments alone for most shifts, maintaining the fitting rooms, registers and keeping the sales floor organized and well-kept while also deterring theft."
good,"As an employee at the Gap, I would provide excellent customer service by greeting and helping customers find what they are looking for. I would also encourage customers to apply for the store credit card. As an employee we are required to open up a credit card for a customer every shift. Everyone has a goal of how many cards they have to get per week.

My co-workers were very nice and there were a lot of diversity in the GAP staff. Management was very communicative because everyone would work while having walkie talkies so whenever an associate needed assistance with a customer we could just flip to the channel everyone was on and ask for help. The hardest job was mainly putting back the clothes without them falling off the shelves, since they weren't that big but just big enough to hold a certain amount of clothes. The most enjoyable part of working here was how friendly the staff was."

I worked answering cosumer calls and while helping the customers I would pull up their account online and put in information about the complaint or problem and what I did to fix it for them."
good,"GAP is a fun place to learn and grow at I love my fellow co workers I enjoy the work environment. As a sales associate I'm learning everyday I've been there for 4 years but things are changing everyday. Our management is okay as whole they could be better. There's nothing hard about my job so I guess for me it would be our S.H.O.P. behaviors while doing flow, moves , markdowns etc during business hours ( Smile, Help, Offer, Please ) but I think I do pretty well at it. The most enjoyable part would be doing what I love and that's helping customers."

good,"My experience was full of micromanagement from incompetent managers who lacked the ability to communicate with employees with respect. Every single day you will be hounded about convincing customers to submit their personal info (such as their SSN) to get credit cards. Yes, shocking for a retail store. During corporate visits, any employees who are not in management will not be acknowledged, you must run around to ensure customers do not approach management, although they can assist customers as well. There is little to no room for advancement, and employees are underpaid"
good,"Our team the entire GAP brand is like family.  Everyone is supportive yet we were all competitive when goals and contests were set, which made exceeding goal a blast.  Bonuses for monthly, qtrly and yearly were generous as well."

I most enjoy having the opportunity to meet so many interesting people, as our customers come from all over to visit the Opry Hotel next to our location.

good,"I've been apart of the Gap Inc. family for three years now and it's been quite an experience. I've learned so much about myself as a person and an associate. Working at Gap brought out a creative side in me because my managers gave me the opportunities to learn about upper level management. I became an associate leader and was able to teach new employees all the tips and tricks I learned over the years. Being an associate is hard sometimes because we deal with consumer's backlash from their day, especially during the work week. Customers have come in and taken their frustrations out on me and have even asked for my input on their situations. You serve as a friend honestly. We are there to make sure our customers leave feeling better than they did when they walked in the door. It gets hard because not everyone understands our mission, but we are honestly 100% focused on our customers. One of the greatest things about working at Gap is seeing customers come back for a second time and brag about how satisfied they are with the products they bought. As an associate, I'm there to give the most honest opinion I can but also follow up with a recommendation after giving my opinion. A customer once asked me if a pair of Always Skinny jeans flattered her figure. I took a few moments to analyze the jeans and in my head I was thinking ""These jeans look terrible. They're way too small in her thighs and are giving her a muffin top."" After rewording my response, I simply told her I think she should try going up a size in those particular jeans or switch to a more breathable material, such"
good,"I worked for them for two years, two years I thoroughly enjoyed. Management team is very professional, always willing to help and they set a great example.

My coworkers are a tenured group of employees that are sales driven. The hardest part of the job may have been not enough hours to give each employees due to payroll restrictions.

The best part of the job was meeting all the great people who came into the store, but on the flip side, it was also the hardest part. Never know what personality is going to show up at the register. But all in all, it was a great, great, great company!"
good,Very structured company that gives you all the tools to succeed
good,"The gap is a wonderful place to work. The managment team readily avails themselves to the employees. Team work is demonstated by all employees. My Gap store is located in the Chicago Premium Outlet Store in Aurora, IL. The Mall is used as a destination point for tourist's. Many buses come with International customers who do not speak English or know U.S. sizing. To me this is the most enjoyable and the most challenging part of the job.

good,"I had a wonderful experience working at Gap! Great discount, the job description was clear and a great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the training wasn't complete.

good,"A typical day at work is stressful. Many times you are required to think on your feet at all times. I learned how to manage my time efficiently which in turn taught me to do my job fast and well. The culture is dependent on the GM and their communication skills with their assistant managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customers as a group. We love to converse with our customer and get other associates in on the conversation, which makes the customer shop at ease. Sometimes the job does get stressful, when it comes to multiple discounts or the workload the company schedules us."
good,I liked the clothing aspect of customer service. I found that it was fun vibes with cute clothes. I had a lot of opportunities to learn within the company. I enjoyed helping put outfits together and liked that it wasn't always super busy but that holidays were packed. Fun people to work with. Easy to take off work and get shifts covered through an app.

good,"A typical day at the Gap for me would be an 8 hour shift with the beginning of my shift ranging anywhere from 6am-10am. Therefore I would end around 3pm-6pm and have my nights free. During this job, I learned the routines for shipment, cashwrap, merchandising and much more. The management is very friendly yet efficient. I enjoyed Cash Wrap the most because I was very good at having customers sign up for the brand credit card and I enjoy customer service. Often, the Gap managers would assign me to the kids side since I enjoy children."
good,The work place was very busy and required to be very attentive. Costumer service was mainly part of this job and built my skills in this area. As well as being registered trained.

good,"It was an awesome place to work at due to great co-workers. Fun to work at a place that has a little something for the whole family. Unfortunately customers at my location were  little too rude sometimes but we all treated them with a smile o our face to help them be happy by the time they left. Apart from that, i enjoyed my stay at Gap and would love to work there again someday, benefits/monthly incentives are great and was flexible to my busy schedule."
good,"They hired me by going out on a limb. I never had a job before and was new to the whole experience but they made it easier to adjust to. They were able to work around my school hours and had no problem giving time off when asked. The staff was friendly and I felt well trained and prepared for the job. As they closed they were able to offer me a position with either another GAP location or a sister company (Banana Republic, Old Navy.) Ive been through 4 jobs now and none of them even add up to how great that job was."

good,A typical day at work was fun and challenging. My store manager is the best manager i have worked with in my career. The workplace culture was like a family.

good,Management is wonderful and the pay is good too. Great job for people with customer service skills. The only problem is that it can be difficult to move up within.
good,Gap promotes a healthy work life balance and encourages giving back to the community.  They work at a wonderfully fast pace and are fabulous in creating teams that work well together.
good,Ive learned so much from being a sales associate to becoming a holiday acting grade 4 leader. Everyday is a challenge but that is what retail is all about and that motivation is what gets the business going!

good,"Empresa destaque em crescimento pessoal e profissional, oferecendo programa de promoção e cursos de conhecimento na área trabalhada."
good,"While working at Gap Inc call center, they try their hardest to make you feel like apart of the family. Of course there are the guidelines you have to follow and quotas you need to meet, but they are always willing to work with you and train you how to do better. Through my family crisis that I encountered while working there, they were more than willing and understanding to accommodate."
good,"Gap promoted great customer service overall, with helping out fellow Gap team members and work tasks taking high priority as well. The other employees were very diverse but all worked together to provide the best shopping experience possible for the customers."
good,Meeting new people was fun even though at first i wouldn't speak to other employers because i was always focused on doing what was needed to be done in the workplace.   After a week i started communicating  to the employers and getting comfortable.Having a conversation and doing work was fun and it taught me to be more out going than i was before.

good,"I would go into to work and make sure customers were happy. "
good,"I enjoy going to work! It is honestly a pleasure to clock in when you are happy with your workplace, and for me Gap is a fantastic employer. The management is miles above the lower-end counterpart of Gap,inc. because they are with you, truly lead you to be more successful and are constantly self evaluating their effectiveness. I have rarely met a co-worker undeserving of praise and more often made great friends with them. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the (albeit rare) unsatisfied customer. But I have learned through experience that you can basically turn any customers complaints into compliments with effort! The best part of working for Gap is that if you want to move up, it is up to your own work and determination. Advancement is there for you when you want to reach out and grab it. A positive attitude is absolutely necessary!"
good,loved going in to work every day and working directly with customers. Greeting and assisting them in their purchase. Management was great and co-workers were great. Really loved working there.
good,"Working at the GAP is an enriching as well as a learning experience. On a typical day, I punch in and am immediately given the daily update of the store, including what sales are currently running and the goals for the day by one of several motivating managers. Over the course of my shift, these same managers work alongside my coworkers and I, supervise, and give advice and motivation. Attention to customers is first and foremost during the shift, but clothing presentation is also given priority. Working at the GAP has taught me how to better approach and converse with customers, how to be more responsible with property, and how to better communicate with others. My co-workers are vibrant and enjoy what they do. The hardest part of my job is trying to converse with foreigners because of the language barrier; but this is the most enjoyable part of the job as well, as I get to meet and help people from all parts of the world."
good,"Known for exemplary customer service, team player mindset and exceeds expectations."
good,"A typical day at work would have been very boring if i hadn't been fore my amazing co-workers, and the regular customers that came in."

good,it was a very fast paced place to work loved it there had to quit due to ill child whom needed round the clock care from me
good,This is a job for people who like to talk and hangout at the mall.
good,A typical day at work consists processing shipment and setting out the clothing to the appropriate areas. Management always makes work exciting by keeping the motivation upbeat. The difficult part of the job is when we do not have enough hours to process shipment or when shipment does not come in order.
good,Gap is a great place to work. Very fast paced and process driven... Large corporate atmosphere. Team is very supportive and professional -yet casual culture.
good,its never a typical day at the Gap. there is always something new going on. Management was always wonderful. what i enjoyed most were the customers.
good,"Gap teaches you a lot, right out of high school Gap was my first job, I knew nothing about customer service, and when I mean customer service I mean Gap knew it.The service that Gap provides is very effective and polite. It was such a blast working at Gap and I enjoyed the company of my co-workers. We were one big Gap family."
good,"i enjoy working at this location, it gives me the opportunity to meet people from all over the world."
good,A day at the Gap is mostly fast paced and filled with customers who speak different languages. I've learned a lot about the company and the benefits of their products. The hardest part of working of the job is trying to communicate with customers who don’t speak the English language making sure they are finding what they need within the store. Most enjoyable part is working with wonderful co workers and managers who create a fun environment to work at.
good,"•         Owns execution of the tasks for markdowns, signing, marketing, and facilities. "
good,"When you arrived for your shift you swiped in and waited for the shifts SOS meeting the supervisors held to inform employees what they would be doing for the shift, before we did a few stretches and began the shift. we had three breaks, and everybody was friendly and willing to help if you needed anything, there was no one particular person of head you had to go to discuss your problem, it could be any level of command."
good,I thoroughly enjoy the Gap and my co-workers. A great place to work and great benefits
good,"I started working at the Gap as a shipment team member and we started the day really early, a typical shift began at 5 am and was scheduled until 10 am with an on-call until 2. As we got closer to the holiday season out shipments nearly doubled, and we were usually working from 5 am to 4 pm. We'd get in our shipment at about 6 am and we'd spend our first hour getting racks and carts together, filling up our supplies of hangers and getting everything we needed, like censors and censor pins and trashcans ready for use. Our supervisor would let our delivery man in and we'd start organizing boxes into 3 categories: Men's, Women's, and Accessories. We'd take the largest shipment (usually Women's) and set up a system with someone opening boxes and dumping contents onto a table, two people opening and folding all the items that were in the boxes, two people censoring price pointed items and moving them onto either the hanger or baker's racks, and someone at the very end hanging everything that was supposed to be hung, we'd finish with the whole team running all the items and moving onto the next category. There were multiple policies and procedures to follow, but they were all relatively easy to learn. After only about a week of doing this I was promoted to a Full Time Women's Specialist - helping the merchandisers do whatever they wanted with the store and products- this included setting up and taking down displays and moving folding to hanging or hanging to a specific fold. I had never worked clothing retail so all of it was new information for me. I eventually worked the cash register"
good,Great place to work but they have closed two of the stores I worked at.
good,i aim to go into work each day & give 110% customer service ( a smile doesn't cost much) I am very much a team player & having worked with the company in previous years i m there to help each team member throughout the store. every day is different & i would say i havn't came over the hardest part of the job.
good,"I loved working here but like most retail jobs, they could not guarantee hours. My typical day at work consisted of various activities depending on the stores daily goals. For example, if we were preparing for a stage set,I  would have a list of certain product that had to be moved from the sales floor & marked down to a sale price.I learned how to multi-task & still take care of our customers. My management staff & my co-workers were excellent! We always had fun but when it came down to business we were focused & ready to achieve the task at hand.The hardest part of the job was getting hours. Since we were such a big store with so many employees, there were times where I would only work one day a week or sometimes not even at all.The most enjoyable part of the job was bonding with co-workers ."
good,Gap is a great company to work for. great pay and flexible hours
good,"I left the company after I moved back to Michigan, but when I came back to California that was the first place I called.  A typical work day is fairly busy.  I work in a beach community so we have a lot of regulars who are always looking for a deal.  My co-workers and I actually love what we do, we don't work on commission so we sell product because we understand it and take pride in it.  Some days we are in as early as 6am because we do mark downs and refresh the store for new looks so there is always something to do.  The best part of my job at Banana Republic is seeing the look on my customers face when they see how much they've saved from discounts around the store and helping them pick out outfits.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to find product for a customers that really wanted it and we didn't have it in."
good,"Not only did they train very well, but they have patience for the trainees. They are not they type to be on you for every little thing, its a laid back chill place to work. You need to know customer service very well!"

good,"A typical day at work would be different everyday, this was because you were on different stations each hour of the day. I have learnt a lot while at GAP from learning how to approach customers and helping them with items of clothing to neatly organising clothes or other items. The management at GAP is exceptional they do a lot for their staff members and are really kind and they give you that extra motivation to do well in the day. The workplace culture was very relaxed. the hardest part of my job was trying to persuade customers to download the GAP app as it was either a cause of customers having them or they weren't interested in it. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to customers and get an idea of why they were buying what they were buying. E.g. either holiday, work or leisure"

good,Benefits at Gap are great it can’t get any better then that. Fun work environment. Management are good. Wish the advancement was better there. Not good on promoting within.

good,They are so nice and you should not feel scared or intimidated by them. Just be yourself and make as much connection as possible. I was traded so well and was thought so many things that really helped me feel secure being in that environment. Was always being pushed out of my comfort zone that got me stressed out and made my skills increase with public speaking. I was only going to be there for 6 months and they knew. That all gave me advice and helped me build a plan on what to do next.
good,Working at such a large company with so much structure was super valuable for career growth. Lots of opportunities for education & the opportunity to design your own experience.

The culture was so laid back and fun and the hardest part of the job was sometimes the amount of work that had to be done but the most enjoyable was the coworkers and the culture gap had."
good,"Absolutely loved working for Gap! Management really goes out of their way to look out for you and make accommodations as needed. You really get to make connections with your customers and it's nice being able to hear about how people in all areas of the country (sometimes even Canada!) are doing. :) I had to resign due to personal reasons, but the company was super supportive of my decision and encouraged me to come back next year. They tried to help as much as they could before I left and I've never felt so valued by a company before. Especially while seasonal! Definitely going to apply again next season!"

Make it look nice and help customers on the floor find what they want. Fitting room, help them to their rooms to try stuff on and help them out throughout. And then cash wrap, you would ring the customers up and end check them out and try your best to help them out before they leave. They care so much about credit cards though, it gets overwhelming."

During the course of the day I will have to assist them if they have a problem and I do have to audit each register before a new cashier goes on it. I don't think there is any real hard part of my job, as I enjoy assisting our customers and providing them with excellent customer service and also being efficient in doing so."
good,Customer service was priority. Making sure customers are always attended to as the store was keeped replenished and store goals were being accomplished. The hardest part of the job was hitting the credit card goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with people on a daily basis.
good,Just started a part-time position and I love it! Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful.
good,"Great team to work with, and always something to do --- always new product to learn about."
good,"On a daily basis you can say the past was fast and steady. Performing register transactions while folding and putting out merchandise. I learned how to set up manicans for store front displays. The managing team was great. Everyone was hands on very informative and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was selling the store credit card. I was succesful at it, but it took time and dedication. I enjoyed my co-workers. Everyone was a team player."
good,Great place to work for single moms..they'll work with you on your schedule.
good,"productive and fun enviroment, works well with ur school schedule"

good,I love my job I just hope after the season I get hired on permanent!!
good,"I learned a great deal about product development and traveled to inspire & train overseas vendors. Incredibly talented, responsible, and ethical cross functional teams"
good,I get to work with very friendly people who are like family. Gap Inc. is a very laid back atmosphere thanks to management. We are very productive and efficient due to proper guidelines and instruction. This is a team oriented establishment so we have support through thick and thin. At Gap we are offered wonderful benefits and lots of praises and recognition for our hard work. A typical day at work is very manageable and strategic. It is also really fun! Ive learned what it really means to be patient. There is a process for success! Ive also learned to wear my passion. Our management team is the greatest! The hardest part about my job is the diligent repetition. The most enjoyable part of my job is how much access I have to progress and how much leniency there is.
good,"I worked at the Gap Warehouse in Fishkil New York for three years. To be quite honest, I wish I would of kept that job. IT was just so far away from my family. If it wasn't for that important fact, I would still be at the Gap!! It was a fantastic place to work and grow. People were great and the challenge of the picks were awesome!!! I miss it so much!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Even in this short period of time I've worked with Gap Outlet I've seen and met many great people. I'm always glad to wake up early in the morning to go to work because my coworkers have always helped me find the things I'm looking for or have given me the information I've needed. On my very first day of working there I got to learn how shipment works and how to separate inventory.I also learned how to restock. I'm so glad to have such wonderful people to work with. A typical day for me is just to come in and clean. There is nothing at all hard about my job, its always easy to find something else that can be done. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with people and still be able to get your work finished."
good,it was a nice place to work and shop and also meet new people they keept you busy
good,"The company has a great oppourtunity to move up and advance but the schedule is the typical retail environment. 7 days a weeks, late nights and weekends."
good,"A typical day coming in.. was putting up shipment or a visual had to be taken down which meant one was gonna have to go up ..the location i was at .. the visuals changed kinda often . the management was great as well as my fellow co-workers some of whom i still keep in touch with .. the hardest part of the job i would say would be around the different seasons which meant a whole new roll-out- .. clothes.visuals, merchandising.i enjoyed working at that location which is now closed ,, the customers were great ..met a couple of stars during the times that were big events downtown"
good,"It's a great job for a college student! You work and get decent pay, amazing discounts and benefits. The atmosphere is clean and neat and the management is on point. The most enjoyable part of the job is clocking in to do my work. The hardest part is leaving! Working here is very fun and enjoyable."
good,Great benefits and pay as you progress through management levels. Old Navy is going through many changes and not a stable environment.
good,"GAP, Inc is the most amazing company. I began my career as a part-time sales associate and advanced quickly because of the values they held their employees to. Their motto was ""set-up for success"" and they encouraged their employees to learn as much as possible in order to grow and succeed. They also valued education, team spirit and leadership, and community service. Definitely a company I would work for again."
good,"The Gap Call Center was a very relaxed,chill,down to earth place to work.As long as you knew your stuff and got your work done and did it correctly you were all good.They provided free coffee, and tea.They had theme days.On these theme days they provided lots of food and beverages.They were very good to their employees.I learned a lot about not only gap but also banana republic,and old navy.Also learned a lot about having conversation over the phone instead of face to face.The hardest part of the job was during holidays and the phones ringing non stop.Also during the holidays when a lot of packages would get lost or arrive late and the customers were really angry.I enjoyed this job in every way.The management were super chill and very fair and personable."
good,The company is focused and truly values customer service. The only real issue that I have with the company is that the high up visual managers are beyond rude.

good,Gap is a good company to work for. They are constantly thinking about their employees. Management is always thinking about their employees. They are understanding and flexible with schedules. Great part time job.
good,"I worked at the Babies and Kids department, which was very interesting. At first it seemed a bit overwhelming because of all the yelling, crying, and running around of children that would come into the store but after awhile you get use to it. After two years I started working more as a visual merchandiser working early mornings displaying fixtures and clothings in the store so I didn’t deal a whole lot with customers then. The pay is convenient and you earn a bonus every 6 months after evaluation. And because Gap is a twin brand store, you get more opportunities to work more hours at different locations/brands."
good,The management was so supportive and very welcoming. There was no work drama at ALL. My breaks were never short and I was harder ever worked longer than I was scheduled. GAP truly cares about their employees as much as they care about their customers and sales.
good,"This Gap Factory's staff is very welcoming. The management team know what they are doing and do a good job of making sure new hires and associates get on track nice and easy. Just like any other retail job, your performance kind of sets your hours. If you are resourceful (being able to do multiple tasks well) you will be put on the schedule more. You defiantly learn a lot about people from customer servicing here. Even though retail can get pretty hectic around holidays, it is worth the experience!"
good,GAP is a great place to work with a real family atmosphere something unexpected for such a large company. They call you by name and develop relationships with you even as a seasonal employee.
good,"Work was competitive, everyday you had to meet or excel in your number performance it can be very stressful but the silver-line was that the food was amazing, employees always friendly, the higher-ups do not have a superiority complex and are approachable, overall I learned a positive association proves positive work [performance"
good,Being an employee at gap has taught me so much as far customer service skills. I communicate much better and I’m able to sell Gap products and add ones to purchase. Gap is a good place to start a new job especially to gain a customer service background.
good,"My experience there was pretty decent, only thing was they were not flexible with their hours, I need the evenings off to complete school.The environment was very slow-paced, but had it's times where it was busy."
good,"The Gap is a great place to work for college students. They offer flexible hours. In the event one has to take off for personal or school related reasons, the management is always understanding as long as plenty of notice is given and/or you schedule a colleague to cover your shift."
good,Hands down amazing place to work. Colleagues become family and the work environment is fun and supportive. Fast pace and great learning atmosphere. Only con is the early morning shipment shifts but honestly you get use to that. Another pro is the discount
good,"Overall great work environment, great atmosphere, great employees and staff, very flexible. I felt it was a great part time job that I gained a lot of knowledge from."
good,"I've worked for Gap for a few years. It has been a great experience. I had a great team, which made it an even better experience. The current management team is very involved and helpful which makes a big difference. There is a good amount of training which is helpful, and there is definitely a learning curve for everyone who has been hired since I have been there."
good,"E stata un'esperienza breve, lavorando solo 2 mesi, pero un esperienza in quale mi sono trovata bene con il team e i store manager!"

good,I have been employed by Gap Inc for 17 years.  It's a great company to work for.  This company believes in a positive work environment and believes in praise and recognition.
good,"The manager is very nice and understanding. GAP is very flexible with hours, and are not like other retail stores where they send you into work to learn what you're supposed to do while you are working. They make sure you know what you are doing before making you do it. Overall great atmosphere."
good,"As a sales associate, Cashier and most recently a LPSR for Gap Inc, I have discovered that the environment in the company no matter if you are the retail side or the Loss prevention side the environment is both professional and welcoming. Starting in both sides of the company, my peers and managers have been professional, courteous and insightful in helping you grow into your job title ."
good,I really enjoyed my part-time evening job at Gap. It was a fun work environment and I enjoyed the people I worked with. Being able to get a discount on clothing was the best benefit for me.

good,"I had this job to help me get through college. The managers were so nice and helping when I was trying to figure things out. If I did something wrong, they would correct me rather than scold me. Respect for this company"
good,At GAP we interact with customer on a daily basis to meet their merchandise needs. It is a very productive and fun environment to work in.

good,Its a great place to work it is a friendly place and they make you feel like family. Great compensation. Management was amazing always nice and great to work with.
good,"The environment at the Yorkdale locations is always happy and inviting. Maintaining stock, store presentation and product knowledge were very important at The Gap. The culture is very blended and everyone feels like family. Overnights are the best and holidays are very busy and get messy."
good,i like my co workers. i love my discounts.. i love that we come together to solve customers complaints/ just over all helping customers. it just sucks that part time associates don't get any benefits like paid sick days nor paid vacations.
good,"My time spent working at Gap Factory has been great! My store has friendly management and staff, a fun, safe, and secure work environment, flexible scheduling, and there is always something to do to keep you busy! Gap Inc. has a lot of great company policies and values. I have worked here since my 10th grade year of high school (2+ years) and I personally think it is a great place to work if you are looking for a part-time job!"
good,"Every day is different at Banana Republic. There are always new challenges that the staff as a team have to overcome, which it makes it intriguing and interesting work. Addressing the customer's needs face-to-face is almost always pleasant and rewarding. The management is top-notch and there is always a good work-life balance."
good,"This job offers great benefits for its employees. It is a very fast paced environment so you have to be able to learn quickly. The staff is very diverse, and the management is decent for the most part."
good,It was my first job out of high school. Although it was just retail there were a lot of things that I had to learn and be fast like shipment processing and ringing up customers. Also changing the prices on the sales section and having to scan every item of clothing was boring as well.
good,fast-paced retail environment but very easy tasks and great management. Room for growth within store level and can move around easily. Nice as a part-time job

good,Fun to work their and learn.. The shop always busy and every day you have something new to learn... I love the organization and flexible work schedule
good,Back in Brooklyn the store was very busy and out in Buffalo the job is slower  paced in retail. I was so used to fast paced retail that slowing down was a harder change then vise versa.
good,"Working for the Gap has been a great experience for me.  I love working with the different cultures and types of people.  I like being busy and being able to have fun at the same time.  They have a great management team and are willing to go the extra mile for their employees.  I would say the hardest part of working in the distribution center is the physical labor.  It is a lot of heavy lifting, standing in one place for long periods of time, twisting and so on.  "
good,"Assist customers with placing orders, keeping customer records and problem solving."
good,I really enjoyed the time I was there and I picked up some brief of experience on the retail sector. I enjoyed helping customers and keeping my area neat and tidy

good,"There is no such thing as a typical day in retail, there is always something new going on, from training new employees, to merchandising, to just being able to have 1x1 with our customers to help them find the perfect jean. At Gap I learned all of my retail/management experience. The company is amazing at moving employees up who want to further there career with them. My co-workers are amazing to work with, we have become one big family. The hardest part of being at Gap, is just never having a set schedule, really besides that the job was great. I would have to say my absolute favorite was the community outreach. Gap Inc, wants and is known for more then just selling clothes."
good,"hi my day at glenmoreinn was set tabble for wedding partys and birthday or halloween. clean up. serve customers .helping co workers too."
good,"A typical work day can consist of a variety of tasks including merchandising new product that has arrived, designing new window sets from upcoming promotions, or just giving great customer service to our valued customers. No matter the day, it's always nice to have a great team behind you knowing that they are helping to get the store to it's prime potential."
good,"Working for the gap has really set me up to be successful, not just in my professional life but in my personal.  The training and development that i have received over the last 15 years has been invaluable. If you have the opportunity to work for the gap I suggest you take it."

good,"It was my first retail job in Hong Kong after living in Vancouver for almost 13 years. I was there for the Christmas holidays and Chinese new year. The length of that period is around three and a half months long. The training system in that retail store was more organized than the companies I was in, in Vancouver. Training was held at the main office in Kwun Tong, Hong Kong. It was like a university tutorial, but it lasted about 7 hours with paid. After, on our first day of work, we also got hands on training in store with the managers. Overall, the training is the most helpful part of the job, we get to pick up and understand everything in about a week."
good,"customer service "
good,GAP is a great environment that keeps you on your toes with great new ideas and activities that we as a team could all share and be apart of.
good,"As a Pick/Packer with Gap, I would typically have ten hour shifts working to meet aggressive(but achievable) UPH Quotas."
good,"I enjoy my job at Gap.  The management team does a wonderful job at making it an enjoyable atmosphere.  As with any job it can have its stressful times, we all pull together to get our jobs done and help the customer to fine exactly what they are looking for.  I would recommend working at Gap if anyone is looking for a fun, fast paced job with great co-workers and a great management team."
good,"A typical day at work was cleaning up the sales floors, doing representations on displays and tables and ultimately helping consumers with their needs and wants. During the job, I had learn a lot about demands and customer's needs alongside my co-workers. As an employee, we are not able to talk back to customers, so it enable us to have a lot of patience for what one may look for or demand of us. The hardest part of the job was trying to get to all the customers when they wanted our attention. But as the days go along, each day you manage to deal with little of this and that and eventually you are able to handle and multitask multiple objectives on the sales floor. But even so, the most enjoyable part of the day was closing the store and knowing that we brought a productive day in."
good,"Typical day: easy going, competitive, and lots of standing"
good,"I really enjoyed working with my team at the Gap.  Meeting sales goals, merchandising, scheduling and other miscellaneous duties keep the job fun and exciting."

good,"Start time 6:30 a.m. (busy season 5 or 5:30 a.m.), punch in, have quick meeting, see how much work was for the day, gather your team, assign work (different area after each break and lunch). Made sure that work flow was assigned to your team and they had someone assigned to it. Being on feet for long hours. Most enjoyable part is when Supervisor/Manager challenge your team to finish your assign work for the day."
good,Gap is a forward thinking company with great balance. Job hours are mostly flexible. Positive environment and great benefits.
good,Gap Inc. was an idea place of working. It had ping pong table and a pool table in the break room.
good,I am still employed with the company. I have already filled out this portion for this job.  I am still with the company part time as I am continuing to look for a full-time position that can accommodate my educational experience and expertise.
good,I found the position enjoyable and challenging.  Shifts would vary from opening to closing the retail store.  I would balance registers and file reports when closing.  Open registers and arrange displays when opening.  The most enjoyable part of the position was working with the employees and customers to provide excellent service.
good,"We'd have busy days where you had to be sure to greet every customer, make them feel welcome, try to address every customers need make sure their experience was great and made them want to return. I picked up on how to be efficient in getting around to everyone; making sure all were helped. I learned how to ring and the cash wrap and make that a quick and smooth process for the customer. I became a very valuable asset in bringing in out Gap Cards. I think the environment that was provided was very welcoming and exciting, I grew to have some amazing relationships in working with my co-workers."
good,Gap outlet was a face paced work environment and overall great experience working there.
good,"While working for the Gap company, I learned so much and gained so much vital information. There I learned that I have a great passion for customer service and Visual Merchandising. I began at the Santa Monica promenade location and it was an awesome experience. From opening up gap cards, running go backs, managing the fitting rooms, opening and closing the stores, folding down an area, doing floor sets to staying after hours with the manager to be in the vicinity while the cleaning crew went to work on our floors, the gap was a great place to begin my retail journey."
good,At the beginning of the shift we would get our assignments for the day as to where we would be picking. This job was mainly solitaire with individual as well as team goals. I loved my team leader because he told everyone like it is and never sugar-coated anything but remained respectful. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with my co-workers.
good,Working for The Gap is very team oriented. The atmosphere is a very positive environment and management is GREAT to work for! Everyone helps everyone and they are very inviting when you are hired. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the fast pace at times but the people are what makes the experience the greatest.
good,"They had very good pay (weekly), and it was easy labor. The hardest part of the job was standing for 10 hour shifts, other then that it was easy!"
good,"I have  learned excellent customer service skills, my co workers were a joy to work with. I had great leaders who has taught me to be a successful team player.  Leaving was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable was being a part of the team."

good,I work fitting rooms a lot. There are times where it can get very busy but there are also the very slow times. I've gotten to know about all the different kinds of clothing GAP has. The management at GAP is very helpful and are willing to help with anything. They're very patient and very friendly. My co-workers are very friendly and are willing to help me with anything that I may need. The hardest part about my job is trying to keep all on the clothes out of the fitting room and on the the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of my job is being with my co-workers. They're able to make the work place stress free.
good,"a day at work was fun because my co-workers would compete to pick the most cases each night. with this job there was no hard part, the best part of the day was looking at the numbers we all put up at the end of the day."
good,"Just started working not too long ago and can honestly say that it has the best working environment. Friendly and diverse staff, and very understanding managers. They all have a different approach, and the workers (while wearing the GAP attires) aren't all conformed to a certain way of dressing, not always something you see in other apparel stores... The work itself isn't all that easy, definitely a little challenging, but nothing too efffort consuming! "
good,"On est très bien formé, les responsables sont toujours à l'écoute."
good,All though it has been a number of years since I last worked at the European Distribution Centre I always remember it fondly. This company probably had the best job progression opportunities I have ever seen. If you put the work in and had ambition it would be recognised.
good,"Gap, Inc is an excellent place to work at.  You learn everyday.  I learned from the people around me, both from my peers and from the management.  I am surrounded by smart and collaborative people everyday. The culture at Gap, Inc is something that is unique and inspiring.  Similar to all big companies, there are ambiguities that could be problematic to tackle but as long as you have the support of your management team, you can overcome and find solutions.  Finding success as a team always makes it more worthwhile."
good,"GAP INC. is a great company to work for.  We spend the day beautifing the store and our client.  They enjoy when we give them wardrobe advise.  I learned to listen first, analyze and then speak.  Management was very open-minded and always treated you with respect."

good,"while only there for one day i can say it was the best job i've yet to have, I'd definitely go back if I could"
good,Would open boxes to fill shelves for pickers. Would also pick items to fulfill orders. I learned how to operate a hand scanner and various safety procedures on how to work in a warehouse. Management was friendly and informative. Co-workers were also friendly and informative and willing to help if needed. Hardest part was walking across a warehouse up 3 flights of stairs. I just enjoyed how friendly and all the activities that Gap provided for its workers.
good,"Day started at 6:30 am prioritzed workload by instore date. Unloaded cartons from trailers quickly and as safely as possible. Teams were 3 person and we usually processed between 2,000 and 3,000 cartons per shift depending on how heavy cartons were. Days when cartons were not too heavy ( ie.)  less than 20 pounds, we could really move and had a great sense of accomplishment. Time really went fast if we were kept busy. Hardest part of job was in extreme heat when heat index was above 100 degrees in warehouse. Most enjoyable part of job in addition to pay rate, accrued vacation time and health benefits "
good,"A typical day of work: I clock in, acquire my gear (scanner gun and printer) and get to work, picking items from locations and putting them into boxes, taping the boxes and print out labels, then ship the boxes out. I have learned a lot. I know how to use a scanner and print a label. Management and co-workers are all friendly and nice. There is no ""hard part"" of my job. It is all fairly easy. The most enjoyable part is joking around with co-workers. It's a very fun environment."
good,"i miss the challenges i brought to everyday, i loved working in the baby's and kids section because i get to help the little customers find an outfit to their needs.i learned about valuing the customers voice, and their satisfactions. management was good, i had like three managers who were awesome and very optimistic most times when the store gets busy. co-workers are very helpful and very friendly, some will give you a hand in need.the hardest part of the job is peek hour during the weekend id have to say,also when you close the store you have to start perfect folding any mess or the area where your working in and even if you finished first before your co workers did in their areas, you still have to help them out before you leave, but other than that its a good reasonable job. the most enjoyable part of working at gap is that its a comfortable working environment to be in, your managers, co workers and even the customers make the atmosphere feels good in the store.gap values their workers"
good,"Gap is a great place to work. They stress safety first and have a fun, productive environmnet."

I enjoy the fact that we all practice the term 'team work' and we really work as a team no matter our area or department of expertise We are blessed with a team of manager's who are very proffesional and love their jobs also do everything they can to help us in any way the can. Im in the logistic team we are the ones who are in charge of how the store looks, shippments and do any kind of replenisment. The hard part of the job is when they give us time frames to accomplish tasks but i love to be challenge so that makes it fun too."
good,"Once hired as a seasonal employee, I was taught the basics of the store and kept in one general area doing one two jobs: maintaining the fitting room and recovering a large area of the sales floor. It was difficult to do both tasks when many people were in the fitting room while taking and leaving without any items in their arms to purchase. The staff was very friendly and welcoming as well as the managers. The nest part of the job was being in the store, managers and other associates made each other laugh and treated customers as friends."
good,en esta empresa obtuve muchos conocimientos en lo que cabe a la enfermeria industrial y se me incluyo en toda actividad con el departamento medico.
good,I loved working here. Workers were very friendly.and management was very encouraging and motivated. This job was very easy. Customer service was key. The most enjoyable part was the discounts in all of there 4 stores.
good,"I begin each day getting told what has happened since the day's opening. We are told about sales and other promotions going on. I grab my walkie-talkie and get out to the floor. Certain days can be very busy, but time goes by incredibly fast, and for me, it's not stressful at all. Managers motivate me everyday and it's absolutely great. I feel as though I am actually important in the company, which I've never felt before as an employee. My coworkers are just as motivated as I am which creates a great, stress-free environment. I LOVE MY JOB!"
good,"I've grown to really like my job, everyone there is friendly and doesnt mind stopping what their doing to help out. The managers and sups are extremely easy to talk to and give incouraging feedback. The hardest part of my job would be adjusting to standing for long periods of time, but gets easier as time goes by."

good,Lots of fashion style oriented dressing manikins fixing displays up sell name brand self starter but excellent management good instructions. Clear goels
good,"Great company to work for. I really love all my co-workers and the entire Gap family. A typical day at Gap is dealing with customers who are in a hurry and fixing the hot mess they leave behind, whether it be the clothes they leave on the floor or the food they forget about.The hardest part about this job is not being able to buy all of the clothes they have. Not to mention the rude customers who get upset about the music being too loud. My favorite part of the job is helping people put outfits together based on their needs and events. Working at Gap has taught me a lot these past few months but the best lesson I have learned working there is that patience is key along with kindness. Being kind and patient will get you anywhere."
good,I had a great experience and would recommand working for a company like this. I enjoyed the time being there. The staff and customer traffic was really good an easy to work with also.
good,"Great "
good,A typical day at work is to come in clock in find out the store codes are for the day. That's for sales that we have in the store at that time. I learn each day that I'm working rather it's promo sales or online orders. I have about 3 to 4 different managers on certain days and I love all of them. I meet all of my co workers and they are pretty cool and they all work hard and they don't hesitate to help me out when I need help. The hardest part about the job is the return and exchanges to in store items from online items. But the fun part is that I work at an amazing store with nice and expensive clothes and I get the best discount there is.
good,Working at GAP was fulfilling. The employees are supportive and work consistently to make every moment a teaching moment and an opportunity to improve.
good,pretty energetic team. not much to complain about other then i don't get as many hours as i would like to. staff is very friendly and daily goals are met.
good,"Gap is a fantastic company.A typpical day at gap includes taking high volumes of calls where you would either be placing orders for the customer,tracking packages, or solving issues such as an exchange or return.  The supervisors work hard next to their team to help coach and mentor their teams. There are many opportunities to advance in the company in all different departments. The teams that you are placed in are like small families, meetings are a regular thing to check in and make sure everyone is doing ok with calls and are used to also continue training. The hardest part of the job is dealing with escalated customers but there are many avinues to dealing with those customers and lots of support to do so. The easiest part of the job is taking calls to place orders, or track packages and most times doing returns or exchanges."
good,we would start the day off by stocking shelves and putting up displays and as the day went on we interacted with customers and sold garments and folded them
good,"A typical work day would include me doing online orders, pulling straight from the rack, then helping around 20-25 people a shift find their perfect outfit. Wish I got commission back then."
good,"Taking care of toddler."
good,I enjoy what I do. Co workers are nice although there is this one manager who acts like she is better than everyone else. The customers are friendly and its really easy.
good,"A typical day consists of helping clients find outfits/sizes, replenishing the floor, meeting new people. Weekends were always fun because of the promotions, opportunity to sell, meet new people and make someone feel beautiful in the fitting rooms."
good,"This position has been a terrific source of supplementary income. I have enjoyed working one on one with customers, learning about sales goals, and being part of a productive team."
good,"A typical day at Gap is pretty slow. If I were to come in at 12 in the afternoon, we'd be more so folding clothes, checking on customers in the store and really moving at our own pace. Around 3-4 o'clock is when we really start getting traffic because people are leaving school, work and their respective places of business at that time. With that, we being to be more fast paced, assisting more, cleaning more and getting more in-store calls until the malls closes just about."
good,my experience at gap was fun outgoing and new on a day to day basis. i loved to merchandising part of the job were i can change up sections.At my job I assist customers with finding there size to finding the right gift or outfit.
good,Honestly I've already answered this question to tell you the truth.  I like the people I work with and I look forward to the challenges of working as a team on various projects.

good,Gap Inc. is a great company to be involved with. Many divisions to be choose from. I learned so much is my many years with the company and the experience in invaluable.

It has allowed me to take on responsibilities such as training new employees on tills and teaching them how the business runs, I love having this role of responsibility.

I was an Assistant Manager for 8 years, having started as a Seasonal Part time employee and working part-time for 5 years.  I realized that I really liked my part time job better than my full time job and applied for and became a Gap Manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with both the great sales team and the customers, many of whom were repeat customers.  The hardest part was dealing with customers who were not happy with the promotions or an item, but it was my challenge and goal to see them walk away happy.  A typical day would start off checking our sales goal, managers to hours allocated for the day, giving the Sales Associates a one-minute meeting and deploying them to various jobs, as well as overseeing the sales floor to ensure that the Sales Associates were giving exceptional customer service while adhering to company policies and procedures."

Something else I learned was merchandising and taking in shipment. The management team worked collectively and are great team players. From them I learned how to lead by example. As a team player myself I that not everyone is ready, willing, and able. For those that were, they made the environment and tasks pleasurable. The hardest part of the job would be when its a really slow day, and we haven't met our goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is when its really busy and I haven't realized how fast time has gone, when I've exceeded my goal on selling Gap Cards, and when we reach our daily goal as a team."

good,"As a sales associate, you can expect to help customers by greeting them, offering a promotion when they enter the store (i.e. ""Hi how are you today? We've got dress shirts and graphic tees that are on sale at two for $25 right now""). You can also expect to help manage fitting rooms: typically, 8 items are let into a given room at a time, and only one person is allowed in at one time. So you might be letting someone in or out of the fitting room, taking merchandise back to the sales floor that he/she doesn't want or that doesn't fit, bringing him/her other merchandise, clearing out of empty fitting rooms, etc. You could be ringing sales on the cash register, where you'd need to know what the store's return policy is. You may process shipment (take merchandise out of boxes, put sensors on it, fold or hang it, and then put it on the sales floor or in the stock room. You'll also be expected to watch out for thieves. So it's important to know what to look for. You can't pin it on a particular race, gender, or age. I've seen mother/daughter teams that look like they're from families that make over $200,000 a year try and steal something as cheap as a pair of panties before. Things you might look for are if the person is looking around to see if someone is watching them, if they've got their hands in the middle of a merchandise rack and their bodies blocking the view of their hands, if they're carrying large bags that look mostly empty and look heavier than normal (think Abercrombie bag that might be taped on the inside to deflect sensor detection machines--maybe even from a store"
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with customers, completing visual merchandising, and training new employees. I have learned how to multi task very well and complete all of my projects in a timely and efficient manner. I have a full staffed management team that always works together and supports the store completely all the time. The hardest part of the job is keeping the store neat and organized at all times during busy day. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping each and every customer complete their goal or purpose that they had for walking in to Gap on a particular day."
good,Everyone loves working for Gap Inc. Outlet and the positive environment reflects in the high-quality work produced.
good,The team was great to work with and it was a fun fast-paced environment.
good,I enjoyed working the time I worked at Gap. It helped me as a person to manage stress and how to deal with customer service in a different way than I ever known how.
good,"During my work time in Gap, Inc. I learned so many essential aspects about retail and customer service. I had a great time doing it, and found out that I love to work and to bring customer service to people."
good,I work at the GAP Outlet and they started me well above minimum wage for having little retail experience. The managers are approachable and listen to your concerns. The employee discount is excellent and can be used at all their company owned stores not just GAP. Yearly reviews and raises are great too. If the store reaches its sales goals for the month the employees get a little bonus based on the hours worked.
good,"Great environment! Lots of room to grow, great incentives, nice people."
