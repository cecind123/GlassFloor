rating,review
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Not a good working environment at all!!!!  It’s not a bad job. Way to much b.s!!! The pay check is ok but that’s about it.
bad,hire you for one job. then have you do another job that is salary and pays way more but doesnt pay you for it. unfair work place that tells you they will pay you a certain amount and then doesnt
bad,"I started as a temp, and things began to move forward quickly. Once I became Permanent, I was placed in a different department where my manager smiled in my face then went behind my back to get me fired for no probable cause."
bad,They love to tell you to adhere to company policy when even the manager dosent. He'll tell you not to set safety cones and then ding you for it. Also im fairly certain the branch manager needs a drug test. Hes either on dope or desperate to not go home. His wife is pretty ugly lol. This company will not have your back in any way. If anything goes wrong you wont even get a chance to defend yourself
bad,"Been working at Airgas Hamilton for 2 years, the management is horrible and some people are very disrespectful to other. There is no communication and the there trading is no good. They expect you to keep track of everything you do down to the minutes even if you have use the bathroom you need to write it down. I would never recommend this place."
bad,"I learned at this job that management does NOT have your back. This is the worst job as far as maintanance goes. Nothing ever gets fixed. Drive it til it breaks. High turnover rate, not very secure due to management and their decisions.WATCH YOUR BACK!!!"
bad,"Beware  horrible company doesn't care about you,  pay is horrible, bad management, driver has no say so , safety company ,but doesn't follow there the safty rules"
bad,"A lot of favoritism  there. Special treatment to certain employees. Some others that are not favorite get over worked. Almost seems kind of racist, but camoflauged."
bad,Racist simple and plain. Last to get hired and first to get hired. Its impossible to get a fair shake because of the racist politics they practice smh
bad,"This job was very time consuming at a low pay rate for hard labor, also there was not much room for advancement in the work place, most people would say it's not the job for them."
bad,I would not recommend a place like this for work. No growth and salary is low for the area I live in. Management will take advantage of your hard work. They also force you take positions you don't  accept with no pay advancements.
bad,"New manager  unwilling to help or provide training. Negative atmosphere in the inside sales department. My mentor and other Colleagues were horrible, talked bad about you behind your back. Messed with your work to make you look bad and that you don’t know what you are doing. One colleague spit tobacco at his desk, against company policy. New manager didn’t do anything to him. New manager was bi-polar. Horrible manager. manager lied about wanting to train you. Untrustworthy and two faced."
bad,"My experience was unpleasant. Managers would avoid communication. I observed negative and hostile interactions among the employees with each other and management as well. "
bad,"management was incompetent, low moral. back stabbing, manager never carried threw.  no team concept, many hrs wasted playing on cell phone and joking around. poor work ethic, the most disfunctional   company to work for., STAY AWAY FROM AIIR GAS !!!!!!!!, in Las Cruces."
bad,"Place was unprofessional, racist, sexist, just not recommended. The Managers are often caddy, unprofessional, and play favorites often. An employee would exceed expectations but only receive credit if the Manager specifically liked them outside of the workplace. Also witnessed multiple moments of racism within the Management Teams. When advised of this, oddly more persons of color began to be hired. Seemed forced in order to cover up the lack of diversity in this LARGE call center."
bad,horrible job with no real management. favoritism is huge at this company and if you're not into baseball or softball the manager wont pay attention to you
bad,"I feel Management and HR are out to get each and every single employee.  The issues they are strict over, are usually simple issues that can be easily resolved."
bad,Management lied and did not say what kind of Route you would be on told you you would have to shave every single day just to be on one route with one stop. Culture is like High School lot of a BS. Not a good place to work low pay very physical.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,I was shocked at the hostile work environment. I was hired as an analyst for the AR department to find problems within the department. The employees were way to involved in what I was supposed to be doing and I was fed to the sharks. No one really wanted to take responsibility there is a lot of deflecting and evading responsibility.
bad,"Airgas was fun and I met a lot of great people.  However, it was cut throat, management was unprofessional. Pay was extremely low and bonus structure was bogus."
bad,"very stressful job."
bad,Don't waist your time on this sinking ship!!! The plant manager is a pompous donkey! I was injured at work and they didn't care they actually let me go because of it! Is against the law!
bad,This company needs to stick to the cylinder business. They are completely clueless about plant operations especially ASU's. Lock out tag out consists of notebook paper in the lock box. Very unsafe place to work for.
bad,Airgas being a company of acquisitions you can only advance if part of an acquisition. If you come from  competitor or off the street you are not likely to be able to advance
bad,To many people in your business and what you do. You can’t go anywhere without someone following you spying on you . The employees are so scared they tell on eachother if that person messes up.
bad,"More work than employees "
bad,you can find a better job that's more trustworthy and pays better and doesn't set you up for failure the management and the ladder to success is broken
bad,"Since being sold, the company has changed drastically and now has  low morale, inability to hire the right people or retain the experienced people, and has a reactionary and stressed workforce."
bad,"Air gas dry ice was just not the job for me! They have drive-cam which tells everything the driver does, you will never here of the good job your doing! In essence they really want robots behind the wheel."
bad,"Management routinely ignores DOT and safety issues. Sporadic work schedule. Drivers are required to do customer service, account management, and sales rep work."
bad,"Management will harass you and play favorites"
bad,And a bad joke at that. They have no idea what is actually going on. They have managers over everything but not enough actual workers. Typical American company. If they laid off the upper management that sat around sending emails and making six figures and paid the mid level mangement and employees better I would want to buy stock in this company. Tons of potential that is smothered by emails and lazy upper management.
bad,Poor management the company is for themselves not there employees and hr is no help to employees also when seeking help or to trouble shoot issues within the company
bad,I was wrongfully terminated they said I put my hands on an employee which was a lie speeding through the plant was also a lie. Did not move up and rank but I was terminated
bad,"They pay very little. Management is poor. They do not like you to work more than 25 to 30 hours a week. No pay raises or incentives. They try to give you stock in the company, but the stock price just keeps falling, so it is pointless."
bad,"I do not even know where to begin... First thing I can say is take your valuable skills elsewhere.  Never in all my career have I ever seen such horrible management and basically told the business always comes first and family second. Pray you don't have a family emergency at month end and need time off. You WILL be told ""but it's month end."" No joke.. these managers basically own you and your life will have to revolve around Airgas. Manditory overtime whenever they feel like it. You will be told t hst usually there is mandatory overtime at month end. However,  you will not be told that you could have manditory overtime in the middle of month, sometimes with no notice. Then when you tell them you can't work it, because we have lives and had made plans because it wasn't month end yet, you can pretty much consider yourself on the managers hit list.  This department along with many others is a revolving door. (Check how many of the same job postings are listed every month!) Cash App and Collections. If you do want to take the chance and work here, also be prepared to do work that you did not apply for! Collections work is part of the job but apparently the manager thinks we are too stupid to realize its collections work, you will ne posting cash, but you will also be performing collections job duties. Get ready to see that's it's all about numbers and goals... they want your speed but also accuracy, which is fine, BUT the goal is extremely unrealistic and people are trying desperately to hit the daily goal to avoid it being held against you. Which then causes tons of errors..."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"Bad management ,no room to grow with company and very hard to work without and support crom upper management will not recommend anyone to work there ,pay isn't worth the headache"
bad,The worst management. They can not keep workers so you are forced to do other departments jobs as well as your own. Should be shut down with how bad it is managed. Horrible place to work.
bad,It is hard to maintain your monthly goals if you don't get any worthwhile calling campaigns from  your manager.  Some sales reps  are spoon fed quality leads and campaigns while others are are not . Unfortunately the managers chose their favorites and the rest of the sales reps are left to fend for themselves with calling  recycled leads that have been called for many  years.
bad,Decent place for a first time job management is sometimes a joke they think anyone can be a branch manager that has retail experience can manage a store  and people
bad,This is probably one of the worst places I've worked. The bonus structure seem to change from month to month. Management was not professional. Micromanaged which increased the tension. High turnover.
bad,"You sure will be posting cash, but majority of the job is contacting customers regarding their account. Could've sworn the job posting said cash application processor. So if you're looking to JUST post cash, keep it moving. If you want to learn collections, get treated like garbage unless you are part of a clique, deal with extremely petty knit picking, deal with negativity and being treated like you're in grade school again, mandatory overtime, including Saturdays, especially at month end (be lucky to get a day notice) massive micromanaging and low moral, then welcome to Airgas!  Highest turn over rate I have ever seen in one department. Within an extremely short amount of time, several people have quit their jobs in the cash app department.  They don't care how miserable the people are, they are all just numbers to them."
bad,"This company changes their rules and SOP's to fit their buddies. Upper management and especially HR IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED. They will lie to you and do not care about you, only what they can get from you, if you want to be miserable work for them, I did 20 years just to have them fabricate something to get rid of me because I won't lie and kiss @#%*. I pray they all get what hey have coming. Management does not practice what they preach. They WILL delver liquid cylinders almost empty to customers. They DO descriminate based on AGE AND RELIGION. This is a company that needs to be investigated and a group law suite by everyone that's ever work for them either been hurt on the job or terminated for a fabricated lie. I'm not a disgruntled X employee just an employee that has documentation to the facts I have stated!!"
bad,Management  is a joke. Those people couldn't see talent or great people coming in the door nor do they care. I would not waist my time at the Duluth location ever in my life. Its literally a complete waist of your time you will not be valued and you will not make a career out of this company . Don't do it! Trust me words don't do it!!!!
bad,Mismanagement  don't care but just their bonuses...nothing for the employee...uses your own  vacation time when job gets really slow to make pay...
bad,"I worked (drove a tractor trailer) for this company for over 6 and a half years. There is no advancement here. Airgas has the ""Good 'ol boy"" attitude. I worked my butt off to learn as much as possible to enable myself to advance. I worked 10 to 20 hours a week overtime to help out and to learn more. It all went unrecognized. They even cut out all overtime. I tried on 9 different occasions to advance and cross train. Not one time did I get the chance. This company does NOT care about it's employees. They were fine with me working myself sick but, after I was injured doing their assigned duties, they wanted nothing to do with me and pushed to terminate me since my injury resulted in a permanent impairment. A word of warning. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY! I wish I would have known how this company was from the beginning. "
bad,"Do not waste  your time trust me . absolutely no respect for employee,bunches of  two faces .hard work .No apreciation run,run if you have a family that is not for you."
bad,"Best job ever. would never quit good pay good ins good hours profit sharing safety bonuses. How much more do you need? Best, Best, Best, Best, You will be hard pressed to out do it"
bad,"Job was ok. Doesn't pay very much but People were alright to work with willing to help new employees learn job. Some what clean warehouse, not a bad job if you like to stay busy."
bad,"I applied for a Division Director position and after the first phone interview, I could not get ANYONE to email or call me back concerning the status of my candidacy for the position.  Finally, after 2 weeks of asking for an update, I received a computer generated email indicating they had selected another candidate."
bad,"Sr. HR Manangement is set in their ways here at this company. They are resistant to change and suggestions for improvement nor efficiency. There is absolutely no room for growth here - dispite what they may tell you in an interview. Don't believe them. It's been a revolving door. The industrial gas industry as a whole is old and stogie so little interest to innovate or streamline technogies and the HR management here seems to mirror this too. So if you are looking for a place to make an impact and bring fresh ideas and suggestions and feel good coming to work each day, sorry but you won't get warm reception to that here. The senior leaders only hire their friends who have no human resources experience and then gang up on the employees like a wolf pack - shoot first ask questions later. You can regularly see them running around the office in panic mode, like chickens with their heads cut off. Very unethically group here so be careful and watch your back. Would suggest look elsewhere for a job unless you are seriously and absolutley desperate."
bad,"Low pay.  Strict policy.  No leadership.  Disfunction.  True example of what not to do. There is better!  Don't. Be fooled by the name. They pay class b more than class a drivers all pay is different.  No life. Always short handed.  They are a high turnover company. They don't appreciate workers. You not valued.   "
bad,I would go in at 7am and stay until 330pm Monday thru Friday I would do everything possible to get the job done efficiently and as productive as possible
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Public company. Moral is not good here. Lots on infighting and bittering which take up way too much time to deal with customers. HR will ride you hard. Somtimes too many meetings and training modules online. Not been a pleasant experience so far.
bad,"The worst experience of my life! They lie that you will make tons of money. Yes you can make a decent income after years of building a territory on 100%commision. You are challenged daily by outrageous goals of dials,minutes and if that's not stressful enough they micromanage and listen to all of your calls. The environment is a bunch of drama and tons of unnecessary drama. 90%women and take more time worrying about who is going what then working. This heads from leadership down. The new VP of sales I have no respect for nor some of the sales manager. They are the worst that sit around and talk about the employees and create gossip. Don't waste your time or health considering this place. Your just a sales number and not a person."
bad,"After being laid off I temped for some time, I got the opportunity to temp here for some time. I was not happy with the management as they really did treat people like lower class citizens.  Upper management was alot nicer.  Over all I am glad I had the chance to work but under the conditions I was also glad my job was up."
bad,"odd hours "
bad,The management is very unprofessional!! Hostile working environment. I had the most incompetent supervisor ever!!! Very high turnover! The pay sucks for everything they want you to do!! This place is a sweatshop! Please do not waste your time working here!
bad,"Management cares nothing about you're well being. They only care about numbers and who they can brown nose to move up in the company. The preach safety, but when it comes to spending money to make the warehouse safer it'll never happen. The equipment is outdated and they won't hire more techs which is why the equipment is always breaking down."
bad,"Airgas and Airgas Onsite Safety is a corporate driven company that cares about nothing but profit margins and pleasing their stockholders. The only objective that management has is making their annual bonuses and will lay off or fire whoever they want to clear expenses. They do not hesitate to close down entire branches if they underperform for even a few months. Training programs are a joke and lack any kind of expertise and then will throw you on a safety job to get it covered. There is no room for advancement because they do not promote from within, but instead hire from the outside. This company is cut-throat and cold blooded. Buyer BEWARE."
bad,"Delivery and pick up of industrial gas cylnders and assisting in day to day warehouse duties. I learned safety practices and handling in transport of cylnders. Most importantly, I learned never to get injured on the job. The hole tone of being a normal employee drops to an all time low. Management portrayed the impression of being concerned but lacked people skills. Componies interest was the only concern. For the most part, co-workers were dissatified with some work conditions and always worked in fear of losing their jobs. The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated and showing up for work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alone."
bad,Everything about this company is wrong except the benefits
bad,Very unorganized organization - The site manager is not trust worthy - The service to customers is appalling.
bad,Mean backstabbing people who are very click orientated. Management cares only about themselves and they use and abuse until they have sucked you dry.
bad,"Worst manager I’ve ever worked for, unfair treatment of employees. Not allowed to voice your opinion. The branch manager always takes credit for everything, and talks behind your back. Wouldn’t recommend working at this location to anybody."
bad,"Company is not focused on the employees or the customers - only on $$     for the share holders.  Poor upper management, no unity - different divisions are focused only on gas and welding"
bad,This company is a gas and welding supply company but try to dabble in everything from toilet paper to laser machines. Their managers are usually not very well equipped for the position and creates low morale. Not enough focus on the customer. Their too concerned with gaining new business and let the others wait. Don’t get me wrong they care about their customers but ther
bad,Poor management.Lots of favoritism.  Could care less about the employees.They ARE JUST a body filling a space.Management will demean and embarras you in front of your coworkers.They think they know everything and the people who are actually doing the job know nothing.
bad,They talk a lot about safety but when you point out a safety issue they ignore it. Over work and under pay people at the bottom. Show no appreciation for hard work. Management never listens to problems.
bad,not a great place for people with technical skills very pen and paper work space not a great deal of tech savvy co workers very sexist just not a good fit for a young man
bad,Air Gas has about 5 different managers and all operate from their desk.  They have no idea as to what's going on out in the field.Driver pay the worst
bad,"The lack of concern for the employees is key.  "
bad,"Immediate management is good, but the upper management has know is idea and is slowly killing off all the guys that do all the hazardous, strenuous, physical labor jobs."
bad,"I spent nearly 6 years at Airgas and was moved laterally twice. The Mid South region is the lowest paid and the cost of living annual increase if given is less than the increase in your insurance rates. Poor management that is worried about their positions from smart, up and coming employees. The management forces them out by blame for management errors and mistakes or overloads the individual with work and creates a lose/lose situation. I can honestly only recommend them as a last ditch place of employment and if you are desperate for a job."
bad,"I work for this company as a route driver and I can honestly say I can't believe the lack of respect and common decency management has for there associates. They constantly tell you that safety is priority ,but constantly have you in situations that are completely UNSAFE. Your are constantly reminded that Nevada is a right to work state and if you don't do as they say find something else. I wouldn't recommend this place , if you're a cdl driver there's much better out there."
bad,"Will its like walking on egg shells all day long with cameras on your ask,"
bad,Management is the worse in any company I've ever worked at.  Managers are rude and disrespectful.  HR does nothing about management harassing employees.  Would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,"Was a very difficult work environment , no room to move up in the company. Many management changes, high turn over. Hired for 1 job and you end up doing 4 jobs for the same pay."
bad,"They are crooks, charge you up front and then don't show..use someone else they are a rip off"
bad,"Enter at your own risk, multiple safety issues, many employess get injured, assets, delivery trucks are not safe. Procrastination and investing back into the business is none existent. Broken windows, mold, total lack of maintenance. By far the worst gas facility in south Orlando."
bad,When I started i was told i would work 2wks of training on floor pushing a metal rack if shelving around to collect items on in warehouse.  Was told up to 75p max...... unfortunately I was picking an pushing=pulling that rack around with well over 75p. At times one item was 25-50p an i was picking 4-6 of that one item not to mention all other items. The warehouse is extremely large an it was tough doing that type of work every day. I did not mind it being a little rough but when i started my 3rd week i asked management about me getting on to forklift as i was hired for. But i kept getting pushed away an was told next week.... followed by another week an another week.
bad,"This place was great to work for when I first started. I learned everything I could in one year and moved from operator 1 to 3 in just 1 year. Now, after 5 years it’s like the more you know you don’t get paid for. I should have known when they changed my title in the system but not my pay for about 3 years. (No backpay) I found out o was making less than people that couldn’t even speak English and was operator 1.That was just the first step of many things that set you off at this place. Management can harass you and nothing gets done about it. They would fire you before even giving the manager a warning. You get written up for going into work early. If you work hard it doesn’t matter. You can do everything thing right and do extra work but they only notice one mistake you did and write you up. No chance for moving up. You can have all the qualifications but they will either write you up right when it comes time to decide on who they chose or just pick someone on the outside. Your just a worker not a potential asset to the company unless you basically  kiss butt to move up if your lucky. I mean kiss a lot so bring some lip balm. It’s like working at a daycare we’re the kids are the managers and the employees are the adults. You never get a straight answer and when you ask something that is genuine they throw a fit. Safety seems to be last bc this place is falling apart. It’s held together by duck-tape and disappointments. If you have to choose between this place and cleaning floors I would clean floors honestly. At least that way you don’t have idiotic people standing over you"
bad,"Mgr’s not experience - some employees rude, disrespectful. Overloaded with work, no job security- will keep you as a temp for years. Pay is very low for the amount of work required"
bad,"Pumping propane tanks none stop all 8 hours if you have to no matter if it’s pouring down raining, thunder-storming, a blizzard or 109 degrees you still have to pump outside! Roll two 300 pound cylinders together using hand and feet hook up 50 lines to the cylinders one by one pump the product then unhook all 50 cylinders one by one with no help and roll all the cylinders outside"
bad,No room for advancement. Work ethics in management are lacking. If given the opportunity you can learn a lot just is a rare occasion. Pay in some positions is very good. No perks to the job in most departments.
bad,"DONT DO IT!!!! Management has 0, I mean 0 clue! They were short handed the whole time I was there and will make you do the work of others. And tell the workers just do the best you can. WHAAAAT??!! NO FORMAL TRAINING!! It's learn as you go, and if you mess something up then you get blamed even though they didnt train you on that specific job. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED, DONT DO IT!!!! Pay sucks, everyone wanted to leave or at least talked about it. LOT OF TURNOVER! DO YOUR HOMEWORK ON THE COMPANIES TURNOVER RATE! THAT'S A SIGN!!"
bad,"This place is this place is riddled with nepotism and cronyism."
bad,"The managers do not manage and do not stand up for their employees, they are the filter for Corporate. They look for reasons to get rid of certain people if you don't agree with their opinion. Managers have zero loyalty to their departments.  And worse of all, there are obvious favortisms and if you make that one mad, you will be forced out. Saw it first hand in my 10 years with the company."
bad,Management was confused about how to schedule drivers and could not manage overtime.  Worked in a very unsafe environment without many precautions being taken
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Crooked unethical management and if you aren't in the little kiss butt click it's over for you. RUN from this company...New management is running off long term employees and they don't support local businesses. They get family members to do jobs that should be hired locally.
bad,Work life balance?  Yeah not here.  When things go bad they really go bad.  Company only cares for the work getting done and not about it's employees.
bad,"Upper management does not care about anyone below their  "" buddies "". Area Operations Manager has no people skills. I wouldn't go as far as saying unethical,  but extremely close. Plant Managers leaving left and right.  Still nothing done about upper management. HR seems to work only for upper management, no employee support."
bad,"You can be fired for forgetting to completely cone off your truck under every circumstance. Management doesn't care as much if customers run out of product, just don't forget your cones and to wheel chock the right side of the truck. They will drive around and spy on you to see if you're doing that. They will hid behind trees and buildings and take pictures, to see if you forget one cone. If this sounds unrealistic, just ask any Airgas driver anywhere. I'm not a disgruntled employee. I just want to make sure that people know the truth before they apply for employment."
bad,Over all it was a great job love the experience and meeting great people... my issue was with management and how they handled their process and the inexperience in leadership
bad,"Management were all about themselves and making sure that the job gets done so they can get their bonuses when it was time. They also preach preach preach safety but most of the time put you in an unsafe environment to work in. The employees were mostly cry babies and snitches and if you sneezed the wrong way, they'd go run and tell on you. I'm sure that every location is not that bad and everyone has different cultures in perform in their tasks as a unit and does it smoothly, but this location was a waste of time to work for! Sometimes I regret leaving my previous employer to come work for this company"
bad,A good percentage of management is way under qualified.  They are moved into positions without having proper experience or training.  Micro-managment is a very accurate term to describe the atmosphere within the office.  Most employee's feel afraid to rock the boat and the general mood is very tense.
bad,"Management is so  unprofessional, work work work pay is awful.  if they don't like you no room for advancement. learn as much as you can to move on"
bad,Management is horrible if there is a problem between employees management expects things to just work out.  They hire anyone for store manager even if they have no customer service skills.  Offices and equipment is from Russia 30 years ago.  If you make any large sales and get commission they just take it away the following year.  Constantly understaffed and orders can take a month or more to get to the customer and buyers have no ownership.  When you can sign up new customers with reasonable prices they just jack up the prices on the next price increase which can be a year or less so people are angry. Customer cylinder balances are completely off and your fixing accounts that have been incorrectly charged for many years.
bad,"The HR department in Long Beach is not run well at all.  Micro managers expect you to respond 24/7 to all email/text, but will  regularly cancel meetings to suit their schedule and then question why things take too long to get done.  Work/Life Balance is non-existent.  Poor communication.  Unless there is change with the Management, I recommned you avoid joining the Long Beach HR department."
bad,In HR and it's not good. They only hire their friends. No one is accountable. The HR department is really messed up which  could be a precursor for rest of the organization. Proceed with caution if you are looking for a job. Or why even bother. Look else where.
bad,"If you are interested in a SAP positions, this company cannot seem to keep people.  I see the same positions posted over and over again.  The people I worked with were highly stressed and seemed unhappy.  My manager and her superior clearly did not get along.  Expectations were unrealistic.  Taking vacation was frowned upon.  Not a happy place.  Glad I am out of there."
bad,"This company is run horribly!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the mistakes management makes,if it were you or I we would""ve been fired.If management knew anything about what it takes to make a delivery maybe the company could run more efficiently!!!!!!!!!!!! How can a person route trucks that has no idea about any area that they""re routing?"
bad,"Never worked for such a poor managed company where every other dept in airgas is defended before management defends their own. Workload is excessive, pay is average to below average for the amount of work. Position is ""exempt"" even though this position does not meet ""exempt"" requirements. Outside management does not know of all the overall issues in this location. As a priority buyer, be prepared to be walked on by every other dept in airgas, and remember you are never right. When you bring up issues or ideas to management be prepared to be disciplined against. Overall, I believe regional management needs to step in and see what is being done at this location before everyone quits because that's the environment in this office."
bad,"This was a great place to work!  And the upper management changed and it went downhill fast!.. employees wondering what was coming next, there were days when no one knew what was going on. And don’t get injured, they would make it to be your fault even if their faulty equipment failed. Management only looked out for themselves, and takes forever to get things fixed."
bad,"Cool place to work, not really a place for a black man to make a career but it pays the bills. They have their favorites (who don’t work harder than others) but that’s any job.. great stepping stone"
bad,This company is the epitome of corporate America. Not what you know or how well you do your job. Kissing tail and being a yes man will get you eveything. Employees are expendable and not valued. Make a mistake and your fired. I hated every minute.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,skeleton crews at all times run their last mile drivers straight into the ground. bulk truck might be nice. wish their was more product training available.
bad,"Not a great place to work "
bad,"The hours are very long. The drivers work anywhere between 55 - 60 hours a week. You are told when you hire in they work you very little to no overt time. That is a lie. You are promised a hire in bonus and from what I heard, you don't get it. (One wasn't offered when I hired in so I am just going on what I have been told) The management is constantly on you about over time but do nothing to limit your over time except to tell  you to work faster. (You have anywhere between 12 to 19 stops a day unless you are the driver manager who will take 1 or 3 easy stops IF that. Most stops will take you 30 to 40 minuets with some taking 2 - 3 hours to complete. You do the math.  You can't get all of that done in 8 hours.) Most of the tanks you move weigh between 1600 to 1900 pounds. It is not an easy job and the better you do the more they load on you. The trucks where I was at were all newer but broke down frequently. If you break down doing your route they still expect you to make your deliveries once your truck is up and running. No matter how long it takes to get you back on the road.You will work 11 - 13 hours a day. Maybe one day a week you will work 8 hours."
bad,"No thanks...they will hire anyone.  A joke.  Stay away, they lie to you.  All the best workers have to do all the work.  "
bad,"The work itself was demanding yet enjoyable. However, they like to use driver facing in cab cameras to spy on you while working. They say its for safety reasons, but upper tier management uses it as entertainment. They look for anything no matter how minor to have an excuse to suspend or even fire a driver. Its overkill! Don't let them catch you drinking water while your driving. When I got hired, my intention was to retire their. However, there excessively overblown ""rules"" are out of control and highly unreasonable. They have a very high turn over rate especially at their La Porte, TX terminal. When drivers have better options where they may be treated fairly they will not hesitate to leave."
bad,"No structure. Management is a joke, always short handed, no praise, no job well done. Not a family oriented company. Hard to even take time to go to the dr. Job is very physical at times. Extremely busy, yet again zero coverage"
bad,Airgas in Southern California has unionized ...multiple facilities have joint the Teamsters for a reason. Better future to look forward to.. I wouldn’t recommend this company right now. Let the Teamsters do there thing. Then I’ll recommend. It’s a mess right now. Give it a year or so. Then it will be a company to work for.
bad,"I enjoyed the actual position  Hourly wage was low, especially  when you did not actually make commission, but a received an ever changing ""bonus"" structure.  Management is weak and unprofessional starting with the GM down.  Advancement is not merit based.  Top performers are over-looked for advancement, if you are not part of the management click.  Work place culture is passive aggressive threats on a regular basis.  The most difficult part of the job, was dealing with the insecurities of the management staff and continually changing policies within the department.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, branches and other departments that functioned normally."
bad,"In the beginning of my career with Airgas, everything looks positive for advancement opportunities within the company. Once Air Liquide acquired Airgas USA, the management from within went downhill. The company has transformed into a beast that doesn't care about any lower level employees and denies many opportunities of advancement within the company. As for management, perhaps after 2027, they may be on a right track, but until then, good luck."
bad,Management is horrible which creates a very unpleasant work environment. They keep people caught making out in their offices but get rid of the most competent employees. They are never happy.
bad,"In the eyes of upper management it is a great day within Airgas. The doors for good on ASG Port Allen have been locked up for good. Its been a long struggle for management to do everything possible to make this one time great facility under BOC to fail. When other facilities was getting money for up grades, Port Allen at times did not have money for repair parts, paper towels, or even toilet paper. Lets talk about the time they hired a Lab Manager who did not know on how to run any of the instruments or able to read the graphs, good job Big Dummy."
bad,"This company has unqualified supervisors, who abuse the reports in their charge. They foster an environment of non-communication amongst departments, and openly say that the president likes people who can keep their mouths shut. The supervisor over me was insecure, jealous, uneducated, and micromanaged her reports to death. The credit department is a joke and it was painful to have a converstion with management who stumbled to find words pertaining to subjects that should be commonplace for even entry level management. They foster an environment that allows supervisors to alienate reports, discriminate against reports, and insult reports. If one person is a threat and in line to be promoted, the supervisors fire them without just cause. This company claims to be a great place to work, and this is only true if you are inside the clique. It is a seriously mismanaged company at the middle management level because they make it up as they go along and have no clue how to properly direct human capital. It was the most stressful working environment I ever had the misfortune of working in. I would not recommend this company to anyone who is not a sadomasacist."
bad,Worst company I have ever work for. I was terminated after being there for three days.  I was in the tax department.  The computer wasn't set up properly.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,This is a horrible company to work for no overtime what’s so ever !!!!! Forget about leaving on time every time everyone feels like doing what they want..... a big location for FAVORITISM
bad,Stressful environment . Management that is out to get you Instead of supporting you. Favoritism Is a important part of how this company works. Don’t believe the seniority BS.But the money is more then fair.
bad,I’m psychologically getting better now after leaving that toxic environment. Even though Airgas is all about a “Safety Culture” they care little about providing the proper equipment to be productive at expected levels.
bad,They don't  care about the  well being of the  employees  or the health of their  employees...its all business!!! Management will not back you up if you have a long term illnesses. They will replace you.
bad,"Working at the branch or plant level is far different than working in an office or call center for Airgas. If you’re working in the branch, you’re treated as if you don’t know anything, there is no trust in employees to make the right decision and their commission “gain share” program is an absolute joke. My commission, or incentive to increase profitability for the company, was 80% out of my control due to getting commission as a division, rather than as a store. I’d rather talk to my customers than talk to my fellow employees at Airgas and if you’ve ever worked retail that’s saying something. Anytime I would contact another Airgas employee, outside of my branch, they were very reluctant to help. There was even a time I was cussed out by a dispatcher for calling to ask if we could pick up a cylinder for a customer, his reasoning was he was too busy due to the plant manager being on vacation."
bad,"Airgas as a Company, although rich in resources is like a State of the Art, expensive boat, with many holes that need to be plugged.  Lots of resources but lack of sound organizational standard.  The culture of the company is very poor, detrimentally affecting efforts to streamline    I highly advise anyone looking for a job to accept any position at Airgas, only as a last resort.  The personnel turn-over ratio is very high because of the more negative than positive things about Airgas employment."
bad,very physical job and upper management doesn't acknowledge what a physical job it is.  Upper management do not communicate with each other. They harp get the job done safely but hurry up with no overtime.
bad,"Poor HR department.  Used me for my State Board of Pharmacy License, and then worked me 10 hour days.  No family life, and although the benefits were good, the culture is poor."
bad,"The company is too big and it seems like they want to keep someone down unless you are a big brown noser. Then maybe you will get somewhere. Also they lie about the job. I can go on and on, STAY AWAY IF YOU ARE SMART!!!!!!!!"
bad,I worked at Airgas for about 20 months. The environment was not to my liking. Maybe because of the location. The company overall had a lot of structure and middle management.
bad,"The pay is competitive for the industry and the area. Team managers are well informed and helpful, however they are managed by threats of losing their jobs."
bad,"Airgas is a great starter job for college students. They would have an opportunity to see many text book missteps. Many in leadership positions lack the proper education and training to adequately perform their jobs. Unfortunately their employees follow suit. Proper managerial guidance would empower employees to maintain a good work ethic. "
bad,"They treat you like you can't be trusted to do the right thing.  Rules for everything, monitored and watched like a hawk.  My advice is to pass on this one."
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. Management does a poor job of looking internally to fill positions, which lowers morale and shows there is no room for growth. Along with that no clear guidelines are given for the work. It's a sink or swim method around there and managers definitely do not put people in a position to succeed. Along with that the turnover is extremely high because of the conditions from top to bottom."
bad,"Airgas would be a great company to work for if the management treated all of its employees with respect equally. The Branch manager of the Lubbock Texas store is a thief and is giving all of is buddies welding supplies etc... He has certain employees under his belt and allows them to come and go as they please, allows them to harrass other employees and has no class. In my opinion the company needs to terminate all management at this location and rehire new management or bring in good quality people to run this store because it is only going to get worse and more people will be harrassed and loose their jobs due to poor management at the location. The pay compensation is not bad, but the benefits are terrible."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Most of the outside sales people put the blame on other workers and customers have problems getting hold of the salesperson. The shipping worker has anger problems and make life hell for other workers. The grand junction store is a bad place to work...
bad,If you are looking for a company that states they promote from within and they are not biased or show favoritism this is not the company for you. They pick and choose who kisses their butt and that's who gets the promotion.
bad,"The one think that i will take with me that i left Airgas is to never accept that type of work environment again. "
bad,Pay was good and ok benefits.  Work is very hard moving heavy steel tanks around.  Company treats you like a number not a person and management really does not care about employees.  No loyalty for doing a good job.
bad,Nice benefits but you almost feel like your job is on the line every day. There managers are all disgruntled! They make sure to give everyone a bad annual review to not give you a better raise.
bad,"There are better jobs anywhere, benefits at This company is good but everything else lacks. Poor management, no weekends off, work 6 days. Actual time off none of this extra hour like 8-5 pm job. Schedules 6-2pm. 2pm-10pm. 10pm-6am."
bad,Up management was a joke. didn't have a clue what was happening in our part of the country. Worked there for 5 1/2 years got a 72 cent raise. Wage was not where it needed to be in North Dakota. Was promised raises but nothing ever happened. Insurance was not worth having. Most of my co worker we're awesome. I wasted about 5 years of my life there. Don't expect to much if you get a job at airgas.
bad,"They will happily work you to death, and don't care about employee moral. There is a lot of favoritism, and management will not solve any problems util it affects them personally."
bad,"Horrible place to work. The pay is poor for what you're expected to do. Air Liquide brought Airgas out and the facility is responsible for taking up Air Liquides workload and customers , with the same under paid and under staffed crew. Management is a joke , there is no guildelines to the rules. I can't wait until they shut the whole site down!!!!!!!"
bad,"they have people that harass people and that put a lot of stress on you and management don't do anything , that makes the job very stressful, these people are not management, many people have complain but nothing"
bad,Airgas has been sold since I left. I knew it was time to leave. Poor management from every level. The call centers are basically compaint lines and not selling any extra products.
bad,"-Goals are unrealistic-forget all goals and focus on new business $ to survive as bringing in enough $ to please shareholders is the only focal point"
bad,Its a small plant with only a few supervisor positions that are locked in for the foreseeable future.
bad,Very hostile work environment. No loyalty to employees. Good benefits but not so good hourly pay.
bad,Management only looks to make money and dont look at the driver situations at home they don't care.Also u tell them about a unsafe situations and its never addressed.
bad,"Poor working environment.  Company continues to be understaffed and add more and more work to those that are there.  The pay structure does not make any sense within the company, and the lack of consequences for poor performance is disappointing."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"These managers truly don't care about you. They coordinate with Human Resources so that their favorites do not get in trouble. The bonus structure is not good, the highest performers are not the happiest people there. I have never worked on a sales floor where the highest performers are not the happiest people."
bad,the safety team is sloppy and dont practice what they preach....the benifits and pay was great but if you get blamed for something they wont fight for you as a driver its basically your fault.
bad,You make good money. But family & safety means nothing here. Like any big corp. its all about $ they preach safety but it means nothing only on paper.
bad,Airgas lied to me.  They asked me to quit a job in less than 2 weeks making me unrehirable.  Then did not have a bonus structure as promised and their welcome package.
bad,Airgas gave me the opportunity to become a better driver. I miss my former coworkers.The management was good in my opinion and coworkers was the best I ever had. The hardest part of the job was to go up and down stairs with cylinders.
bad,Working at the Phoenix acetylene plant. The lead is a dummy and so is his father. Anything you do is analyzed and you get yelled at! Stay Away from this place. They work together to make your life miserable and they do a good job at it. The pay wasn't enough to keep me there.
bad,"Blind leading the blind. Went through 6 managers 3 general managers and 8 employees during work time there. Most fellow employees are ok but u always have the sneaky back stabbers. Even if you do the job the way your told and the rules state the managers will still throw you under the buss, Your just a # there and worked like a rented mule. Its either do it, good or bad, or your fired."
bad,"Airgas will have high turnover problems because they recruit for collectors but the position is very little collections, position is mostly releasing orders."
bad,"They expect you to pull of a miracle everyday, poorly managed branches, upper management doesn't help when general manager is lacking. They under pay you till you call them out on there little joke. The insurance doesn't cost much but the policy is junk.  They spend more money on a worthless computer system and safety nonsense than making sure the company can run smooth. Customer service provided by office employees is horrible. They have a million and one safety rules for the drives and the will write you up and fire you over stupid stuff such as not using cones to back up or not chocking wheels.  I hate this job with a passion."
bad,They need to give their employees back braces put wheels on all the tops instead of employees having to push them on con creek into place they need watch your step floor signs all over the facility the floor is all cracked up you could trip and fall not a very good safe place to work at
bad,Management very poor a lot of favoritism and lack of leadership will have you learn what you can and make it become your job without compensation no backup end up doing everything yourself while supervisor does nothing but come in late and state at his computer all day
bad,"Stressful day because is to much work with only few drivers."
bad,"Bad Manager"" Wiiliam Trout"" he was very intimidating. One Sided , Military Minded he worked off of Fear factor and was very dishonest and double minded"
bad,"I was hired as a driver was told I was cleared to start work. "
bad,They need more communication from management to employees. When employees say something manager ignores what the daily job entails and does not listen to employees on there take of there job areas.
bad,"Seriously.... The management have no clue what an operators job entails. Therefore you will constantly have someone telling you how you should do your job, that has no clue how you should do it. Also the pay is horrible for the oilfield work you do for 28 days straight. There is no opportunity to move up!!! If you get hired as an operator , thats the top of the ladder for you... Do not work for airgas!!!! Trust me, I left and went to a real oilfield nitrogen company."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"There is a major lack of leadership here so the local management gets away with everything due to the 3000 mike corridor - corporate geniuses are on the east coast and very rarely make it out to California. It is difficult to talk to upper level here and common for them to treat you as nonessential member of the work place. Arrogance is in abundance and a lack of caring for lower to middle rank and file. "
bad,"Airgas is a good company other than very poor management. They seem to put people in management positions when they have no people skills and aren't able to communicate to other employees. My manager was bipolar and everyone knew it, flying off the handle all the time. It was borderline harassment and hostile work environment and I won't work for someone like that. Avoid this department if at all possible. You will be miserable after about 3 months when true personalities start coming out."
bad,"This company uses people and pushes out the smartest people they have, leaving only idiots. I don't understand this company. If they would fire upper management and start anew, the stockholders would benefit greatly.."
bad,"Unsatisfactory due to lack of GOOD, Effective leadership."
bad,Most of my co-workers were friendly and willing to assist.  Management can be onesided and not really open to technology and change. Not a lot of structure.
bad,was a temp to hire job but never came to be money wasn't enough so I found better job
bad,"Okay place to work whenever you can get over 40hrs.per week but, other than that it’s not all that great because they do not pay enough money for the work that they require from you for the 12plus hours that you are there working for them."
bad,"HORRIBLY MANAGED FROM TOP DOWN. HR department is ineffectual and caters to  few individuals that are hr nightmares but complain a great deal to the national HR team so they are allowed to be racist, trans-phobic, and not meet minimal performance goals."
bad,"Go any where else. Just trust me. You don't want to work at the BSC. The culture is bad, as a salary employee, you'll have your minutes managed. Pick somewhere else."
bad,"I received fair pay for a woman working in this male-dominated industry but I also had to put up with a lot. As soon as I was financially able to retire, I did."
bad,Airgas was a selfish company who only looked out for themselves and did not care about their employees. Promised promotions and pay increases that never came. They make you not only do your job but make you do other people's jobs as well. They treat you unfairly and favoritism is a constant. They cut corners and expect you to make diamonds out of nothing. We were never stocked with supplies. We would tell management what we needed to order and they wouldn't. Then we would get reprimanded for not being able to complete our assignments.The preach about safety but when hurt on the job they immediately try to force you out of the company.
bad,Constant changes and never for the best. DriverS  have been giving up  money and benefits every year. Senior drivers leaving because manager  employees non experienced people. Gave 70 hrs a week for 15yrs. Stay away from here. Forced slip seating and took away having your own truck. Forced layovers. They will reach into your pocket.
bad,"This is a company that thrives on using their employees. This company was American ran, but since has been sold to a foreign company out of Germany.  They are definitely not the company they represent to the public and not the company they represent to their employees."
bad,Airgas was like working in a High School environment. I was micro-managed and management did a poor job of their role. The benefits were not all that great. There was way too much drama between management and their employees.
bad,"While working as a contractor and receiving great kudos for moving project forward, the management culture was unberable.  "
bad,If u have potential don't waste your time. A very complacent company and they don't value they're employees or management. I would not recommend to any one.
bad,productive but unorganized work place long hours I learned that most of the people that work there are not team oriented upper management lack people skills
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"Once management changed, so did the job experience. I constantly felt like I was on the line. Serious lack of training. No more to say."
bad,"Not for everyone,pay is good,managment is poor,promotions are not done fairly,good working condtions."
bad,after the day of long hours with some satisfied customer and trying to balance between the warehouse and counter and the gases it was not worth the little money
bad,overall was dissappointed with the company and how they ran the plant needed alot of improvements but never came while was employed there. there was no safety meetings either to improve the facilities.
bad,The plant manager at my time there was very  racist towards all the white employees and blamed them for everything that went wrong ever day. I was unable to continue to work for a manager like that.
bad,"N/A"
bad,The the was stressful do to some employees not taking the job of liquids and odorless gasses serious. I also learned if you see an employee down do not walk directly in that path.
bad,"Absolute horrible place to work, the job isn’t bad but the environment and management are terrible. All employees are constantly getting put down behind their backs and they lie about the vacation and raises you’ll get. It’s a cut throat stab you in the back workplace."
bad,"Like many companies, Airgas tries to increase profits by squeezing operational costs. The problem is many modern efficiencies are not available due to a lack of technological development."
bad,No support backing up your hard work. Nobody seems to care or take things seriously. They don’t listen to customers needs or employees needs to be successful
bad,good driver benefits; but a toxic environment from management for driver support. Driver made to do more duties than they are compensated for. Asked to do more than what you get paid for.
bad,the lack of training makes the job difficult to grasp and they give you a job title but that is not the job you do and they do not compensate  you for the extra job duties and extra rolls you take on
bad,"The job itself versus pay is acceptable.  The skill and training developed from preforming multiple jobs is not recognized financially.  The rules and regulations are not enforced equally.  Its an auto pilot atmosphere with little to no management.  The company itself has the right design to succeed, The ability to promote within doesn't exist, at least within my 12 years here,  I've never seen it at any location.  All in all,  It's an acceptable step to where you might be going, but I strongly suggest not investing in it as a career move."
bad,"Airgas would do well to implement the safety rules, procedures and devices that are effective as well as efficient and eliminate those that are neither.                                                                                     I was intentionally lied to by people who find it easy to lie."
bad,"This job requires loading and unloading trucks, and/or filling cylinders with gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.) Even though we are understaffed and the volume had significantly increased over the 2 1/2 I have been there, management still presses to get everything finished in 8 hours. This adds stress and potential for mistakes and accidents to happen."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"My only positive is that I get to make my own schedule .. "
bad,"It's a strange place to work .. the hours aren't bad . But they arent honest about the work you'll do.. they want you to be safe at all times , but then ask you to break there safety rules .. they say things like "" there a really good customer and spend alot of money with us so just deal with it "" .. there is no job security at all .. and don't bother trying to advance you can put in for a job and not even get an interview with your own boss.. it's a joke .."
bad,"I have a feeling that my experience was unique to the plant I worked at, but they didn't value safe work practices, and the manager was all about looking safe while getting as much work done as possible."
bad,"Management can not make a decision in a timely manner. They are unorganized and and way over the top with rules and regulations. On a daily basis I had to fix mistakes and do double my work load, I never herd one positive thing from management. "
bad,"Airgas East was self admitted as the worst territory of all the territories in the U.S. territories. Management acquired ECT, Inc. thru a company buy out, They totally had no knowledge of the worked performed at ECT. They discontinued Medical Gas Testing in Feb. 2015, Terminated all former employees that came with the buy out."
bad,bad company. horrible place to work. management sucks. no room for advancement. written up for everything. high turn over rate. do not listen to employees what so ever.
bad,Hired on with little training. Company has very little support for sales team to be successful. Company unstable with high turnover. Lack of local leadership. The Airgas Onsite Safety Division I worked in was not supported by the gas division and was not up to par with systems in place for support. Monthly discussions of lay offs do to productivity.
bad,"i try to service all my customers on two routes and keep them happy. i have learned sales skills, cumputer skills, and inventory control.the previous management did superior job as a leader and mentor.my co-worker's have always helped me to emprove my job preformance ,and my skills. the hardest part of my job would be trying to be in two places at one time.the most enjoyable part is being appreciated."
bad,"You’ll hardly meet upper management, I feel so disconnected."
bad,"One of a few non-union facilities. Senior management was afraid that this location would be next to unionize. Therefore senior management bought in an individual that could micro-manage employees better. This individual took away from coworkers being able to converse freely in the yard about anything during working hours,"
bad,"They do fun things for associates as a whole.  They promise raises with your annual review but only give you half in the beginning of the year then the second half at the end of the year.  The stress level is so high it makes you jump out of your seat if you even think you did something wrong. New comers do not get a warm welcome by most associates. Managers show favoritism within their team. Bully is allowed as Supervisors and HR doesn't do anything about it even with witness's. Overall,,, meh!"
bad,Not a bad job just way lower pay than other plants in our area.  High turnover due to all the other plants pay is more.  Poor training program due to high turnover.  No experience.   Senior people only have two year experience.
bad,"Many of the managers have little respect for people. They like to employ people that do not have options so they stay even when treated poorly. You are given many different directions to follow, they are not on the same page. You are treated good if the manager likes you,if they dont like you, you have to follow different rules than those that are liked"
bad,"I worked on the AR team in the Lawrenceville office for 4 years. The first 3 years were great - supportive management willing to teach and trust the experience I brought to the table, teammates that worked hard both on individual and team goals, which ultimately garnered awards from the corporate level. It was a dream job...but then things went really, really wrong when one person who clearly hadn't mastered her current position was promoted to a position she didn't truly understand.  She then had a hand in hiring someone else just like her. Neither were truly managing anything but pettiness and the perpetuation of an atmosphere wherein employees are scared of losing their jobs over something ridiculously unimportant - at best, they are administrators, not managers. True managers communicate with their team and implement reporting & processes that are understandable and ultimately work in everyone's favor. True managers identify and nurture growth potential. True managers stand with their team and are not afraid to get their hands dirty by standing up to other departments who don't want to take responsibility for their ineffective processes. Administrators on the other hand, huddle in their office having meeting upon meeting then dictating policies without really understanding what the work entails or discussing with those who actually have to do it. Administrators expect grown men & women to follow blindly, never question a directive and they do not generally care about morale. What killed it for me was watching my teammates get verbally torn down by our own ""manager"" and her"
bad,Company overpromises and under delivers to employees and customers. Lack of training leaves employees with no experience or product knowledge.  I could go on and on about how bad this company is.  It gives me heartburn every time I think back to the years I wasted at this company.
bad,"I came to Airgas because I was getting overworked at the last tanker company I came from with a lot of promises for a better work environment which turned out to be completely false. You run on average 12 to 14 hours a day when additional weekend work is pushed on you continuously. Management and the bosses above treat you like you are just a regular dumb truck driver and any complaints or help needed will be denied and basically laughed at behind your back. Compensation was low until we threatened to go Union on them, once they gave us a tiny bump and pay they didn't keep any of the other promises to try and keep us from going Union. Work culture is terrible because everyone is so disgruntled they don't get along and it is very tense. The worst part is they put cameras in our truck even with our perfect safety record. The only reason to do a decent job there is because of the constant threat of being fired. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, sounds good until you get here and realize you were stuck in a company that looks at you as if you are a number instead of a name. Plus the management talks to you like you are garbage and then laughs about it."
bad,"Top heavy management"
bad,"The company is big and financially stable. The atmosphere is cold, quiet and very impersonable. No warnings are giving for errors. The company's systems are numerous and antiquated. This is problematic because you feel like you do not have adequate tools to work with."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"You have management hiring people they personally know with no experience.  It is such an unprofessional environment, management sleeping with male coworkers and giving them perks. Department is full of drama and supervisors and managers always gossiping but will reprimand you for doing the same thing.  Its like an alternate universe working for this place because upper level management and HR just turn a blind eye."
bad,"Definitely not a team environment. Management  (two tiers worth) and friends vs. ""low man on the totem pole"" (all of which frequently receive reprimands including yelling, slamming things, pointing fingers, and swearing.) Management has double standards, is lazy, unhelpful and pushes their work on others. Inappropriate and lude conversations/pictures/videos are allowed, applauded, and not addressed or corrected by HR. Customers frequently express displeasure as all this is visible to them."
bad,Cash application department is horrible.  I’ve never worked in place like this.  Management is like chickens with their heads cut off.  They constantly are changing the rolls of the people in this department.  You have unrealistic expectations for your workload.  Most of the people in this department are miserable and a lot have quit.  The few that aren’t are the “pets”.  The management trolls up and down the isles to make sure everyone … oops I mean most of the employees are heads down working at all times.  They actually creep up behind you to watch what you’re doing.  If you take a minute to talk to a coworker you’re asked if you need something to do.  Overtime is mandatory during the week and always includes at least on Saturday a month. Too bad if you have plans because they will expect you to cancel them and be at work.  It is the most dysfunctional and miserable department I have ever worked in.
bad,"The only reason the Management portion gets 2 stars is because my Regional Manager on the West Coast was great to work with. The President of the company and most of the personnel in Phoenix are completely detached of how the ""field"" side of the business operates and the Controller is only interested in locations that she has a vested property interest in per her agreement from previous ownership."
bad,"It was a good place until they put Supervisors in that have no experience, rude and mean to the employees. Lost all respect for this company. They are backed by upper management."
bad,"A typical day would be to come in, grab an assignment and get to work because you would be boxing dry ice for 12 hours straight. This was really not a place of advancement, it was very hard to find someone willing to teach anything, none the less I learned on my own."
bad,"I love my job.. I love what I do but management makes it impossible to even breath let alone have a life. My mother had knee surgery which I had advised my sup of. So my sister call (me from Atlanta)  because to tell me moma had been laying in the floor for hours cause she couldn't get up. The neighbors and sister tried to call me several times but since we can have our cellphones out anymore and we can only use the company phone during lunches and break. This upsets"
bad,Management takes credit for the work of staff and sets up team members for failure. Harassment is part of the culture and Human Resources is threatened to look the other way. Not a safe or stable environment.
bad,They give you offer letter go thru a lot of unncecessary checking do not call or let you know if you are getting thru the process would not apply unless you have three months to wait
bad,To start off the add said dry ice delivery they call you and the manager says its local and OTR to Louisiana. Also there is a drive cam in the truck and almost any fast movement turns it on and you will be in the office being talked to like a little kid. When I went over the road the manager being lazy never told me how much I had to spend so I tried to keep it under 100 a week that didn't work I told later 20$ a day. The managers a big guy so he will try and intimidate you and if you show you ain't intimidated he won't like you the manager has no ppl skill I heard him talk to customers  it was horrible its a very slow paced job so if you like getting in bustin tail and working fast don't bother applying oh and the 12hr log you can't do it the correct way cause the manager has one he wants you to copy every day so good luck if hwy patrol pulls you over to examine your books cause the manager will prolly fire you for something he told you to do and now you paying the ticket and don't hurt yourself doing something unsafe or you will be fired as well my opinion its not that good of place to work because the management wasn't good but he swore he was and always loosing time cards
bad,This company has no training and is the most mgmnt heavy company I've ever worked for in my 15 years of selling. Micro mgmnt is the culture here and good people are fired at the drop of a hat.
bad,"The company as a whole is a great place to work for but the Tulsa business office is not worth the headache.  Management/Supervisors in the credit & collections office are walking around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The entire department has been restructured at least 3 times in the past year & you don't know what job you will be assigned to or who will be your supervisor until the day before, if that.  "
bad,Not a productive place to work. No structure or leadership. Would hire unquailified white employees over qualified minority. A true lilly white organization.
bad,"Airgas is a great company on paper. However, each location is ran somewhat independently. In such a situation you find that you are working for the Manager of that location and not Airgas itself. That Manager is empowered to act as he/she sees fit with little to no questions asked. *Open door policy is out the window while retaliation and intimidation are very visible."
bad,Job with benefits a company that has lots of opportunities. Depending on the management team this is a secure place of employment. Many locations to choose from
bad,"Was a  very good company when it was National Welders. When Airgas bought them it was still a decent company, but since Air Liquide bought them out it has gone way downhill. They have got rid of almost all admin people and cylinder control. All the company cares about now is the share holders. The upper management only care about getting their bonuses and work stores on skeleton crews. They preach safety but expect the drivers to do more stops while not getting overtime."
bad,"In the Salt Lake City area and see a job posting for bulk driver, RUN! This corporation doesn't care about you. The turnover rate is high because they continue to strip away benefits, have unsafe work conditions, are extremely unorganized, put their drivers at risk by governing their trucks at 62-65 mph, spy cameras in the cab, burn good drivers out,etc."
bad,A very two-faced company lots of back stabbers. They will promise you the world and give you nothing you can work there for six.  Years work up to the salary that you are at Then all the sudden they will hire somebody in off the street and pay them exactly what you’re making right off the rip.  Seniority means nothing to them you are just a number in a book!  And for as management goes absolutely sucks nobody has a clue what the other person supposed to do!
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"Good company but horrible management.  "
bad,You are treated like a number at Airgas. I had 12 years in this company and when I was told I had to start to work 14 hour days or else I was forced to resign or be fired
bad,"To many chief and not enough braves.  Everyone wanted to tell everyone what their job description. Anytime you have to have permission to go to the facility, it is time to find another job."
bad,"This job is pretty much meant for 20 somethings looking for experience. The company beats you up and expects you to be safe but quick. God forbid you may forget one of their 50 volume sets of rules, they will crucify you. You are very rarely if ever thanked for breaking your back daily, other than when Airgas buys donuts for monthly meetings to tell you where you need to do better and/or be safer. They have gains shares that you will almost never get because some department that has nothing to do with yours cant consistently hit their numbers or goals. You delivery dangerous gases and liquids in some of the worst conditions to some of the most difficult areas imaginable. If there is a nice dock for normal deliveries, your delivery spot will be on the other side of the building, where it's littered with any combination of pot holes, spider webs, wasps, grease, hoses, ice, rain, forklifts etc. Some deliveries will be by hand down stairs even though they say it's not done at Airgas. You will have to drag the cylinders through mud, grease, cobbled or broken walkways, up or down curbs, with overhead cranes and welders and such all around. Into a cubby hole area  of hot filthy businesses. Some businesses will be a labyrinth others will be vast corridors. That's the majority not minority of delivery areas. Benefits are good but good luck if you need to use them. Pay is not equal to what is asked of you. I've seen many good drivers come and go during my time here at Airgas turn over is high for a reason."
bad,very stressful and management is negative and not supportive. they leave you to your own and give you no suppport. they just tell you when you are on a performance phase and say fix it. if not you are let   did not back me up. i was employed there for 14 years and achieved senior account executive. so i was short on a new account or a dial but i was grossly over in the money I made for them. That was not enough because their goals are unrealistic.
bad,"He thing good I can say about the job is that there is always work, tuition reimbursement is offered,and time off for holidays are good. When talking about being promoted from within the ranks and opportunities to advance it is nonexistent. Management seems to choose who they want to put into positions of importance instead of letting employees apply and move up through the ranks. I have achieved two degrees working there.i applied for a supervisor role and never heard anything back. Ismnot one really scream racism but it does have overtones of it. It is a large company and I’m not sure what the others do but in Coppell,TX it seems to exist."
bad,it's a place to work..................its a job till you find something better................management has no interest in doing right by their clients of employees
bad,"I have no comments to make regarding this company.  I was only there as a contactor, for a very short time.  Help with the move to Kronos time clock.."
bad,"Management does not listen to or respect Associates. Ideas or innovation is unappreciated. There are plenty of efficiencies to be realized but are not acted upon unless your part of the ""inner circle""."
bad,"Decent place to work high paced and lots of pushing and lifting, good benefits, require long work hours and lots of training in the Carbonics field and drivers training"
bad,This is a great company if you don't have a family because my experience here they don't care what you have going on it's always about how much can you do for them and then when you have a lot of overtime because you do go above and beyond they complain about it and talk about wanting to get rid of overtime this business there's always someone that needs their gas and I don't think the big bosses up-top get that you're not appreciated everything they tell you is always a lecture on something. I worked here for a long time and I made a mistake I was let go for it almost 13 years and just like that that's why my caption says no loyalty I've made thousands of deliveries with no incident and because I make a mistake just like that I have a family I just got a new car and now things aren't so good for myself but I know God will take care of me I guess I was not meant to retire with this company when I look back though and how stressful that job was and how the management talked behind your back I now realize I'm better off
bad,Thought this job was a good one was told every year 3% raise and when started was informed by employees they had not had and increase 7 years until this year when the raised all dry ice to 18.50 and then in October 2017 got .5 to 1% raise. They look for ways to fire you if you make a little mistake.
bad,No thank you I would not like to comment the position the culture has a lot of growing to do. The high turnover of employees says enough and left alone.
bad,Over worked and under paid. Very repetitive work. Don't advance quickly. A lot of down time. Made some good friends. Benefits are just ok. Health insurance always seems take your raise away.
bad,"Retail environment, company supplies gases and other product to consumers."
bad,"Air Gas bought out ECT in 2009, Self declared that Airgas East was the lowest rated territory in entire Airgas Company."
bad,"Every level of management fights with each other all the way up to the vice presidents at the expense of the company and its employees. We on average lose 1 customer a week due to not having the support and operational freedom we need. This is the worst company I have ever worked for and the truly sad part is it could be dominating the market in other ways aside from its foot print but, there is so little responsible management and even if there was more there is no clear channel to execute directives."
bad,Arrive at work at 5 am and begin setting the production plan for the day. Continue on to cycle counts as well as receiving transfers and bills from bulk readings. more of the summary is available upon request.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Most often Collectors are overworked and assignment territories that are not attainable goal wise. If goals are attained management alters the bonus structure. overall minority employees are treated poorly.
bad,"This job was great when I first started, after a couple of years the ""taking care of our own"" feeling went away. Don't expect anyone to care. People are written up for things that do not happen and it doesn't matter what you say or how long you are there, no one cares what you can do because you are replaceable and they make that known."
bad,"not stable, not much for leadership, didn't have working trucks"
bad,"Airgas might be a ok company but my current location is horrible. Some employees are very hard to work with. Upper management have no clue what the heck they are doing equipment is broken, lack of communication skills to the Capital T. Worst management ive ever came across. I do not recommend this Company"
bad,No Advancement opportunities. Been with this company for 10 years and is stuck as a driver. No growth opportunities
bad,"It's a job.  Benefits ok,  Pay ok, but no room for advancement.  Get in and Get out.  "
bad,Not a great place to work!!! Management has favs and it shows!!! They dont follow policy unless it's to discipline an employee.  Other than that any thing goes!!! Look elsewhere for employment!!
bad,The experience i had was that the plant was very mismanaged. Very underdeveloped methods of production and efficiency. I probably wouldnt recommend this job to anyone who intends to have a meaningful career
bad,Low pay put hours straight trucks cool but management sucks good job but not good lol umm there no th much hood about it ..ooo and you have 2 load and pull your orders..safety is a cover up they dont care about if your boots leaky
bad,"These people are dishonest and hypocritical. They will tell you they are all about new and innovative ways to make the job safer, better, faster, cost and time efficient. But they don't mean it. They waste your time without cause. They have no idea what efficiency is or how to achieve it. And they impose a ""live to work"" lifestyle on their employees. But if you are not on board with that, they will make your life difficult. They know where to bend the rules and where to break them. And they all cover each other from the bottom to the top so their is no one to complain to or trust. This is a company that fires employees after decades of service just before their retirement. I've seen it happen more than once."
bad,"As a Driver the demand is too great at Airgas due to their understaffing at EVERY location.  Company rules (hoops to jump through) are beyond realistic and reasonable.....and I am a person who generally likes a place with some direction and rules, but very little of what the job is gets done in the excessive time you spend in a day with the insurmountable games and checkboxes for Airgas.  I know that some of you will not heed this warning, but move on and look for some other type of this work elsewhere.  Airgas will offer you pretty decent pay which enticed me, but like I have experienced before, it's not worth it unless you like to ""drink the kool-aid"" and be a complete company drone.  My manager was a pretty decent sort of guy, but he works for Airgas and has to follow their ways."
bad,Worked with four others reviewing and entering invoices for payment.  The co-workers were very nice to work with.   Medical benefits were very good.  Vacation plan nice.
bad,Lack of management skills and management will not help people to growth professionally. Very unfair the work distribution. Always a lot to learn when it comes to SAP.
bad,Started at midnight Sunday and would return late Friday night. Drove the southeast region of US. Load the trailer with hazardous liquid and deliver to customer. Work 12 then sleep 12 while teamate worked 12 hours. Great pay for the position
bad,"You need to be constantly aware of any risk.  If you cannot make this part of you, then you will have a hard time at Airgas. If you are detail oriented you should do well."
bad,"Don't get me wrong this is a very large company with quite a bit of opportunity to advance and grow, however be prepared for an uphill battle (I mean like climbing Everest style uphill slog in the dark). "
bad,"This is an entry level job, not a career. Learn the basics of wharehousing and then move on. Do not get involved with the cliques. Do your job and then go home."
bad,"This is a rough job working in all weather elements.  Management on local level is good, but as an overall company your just a number.  This company does not care about the employees."
bad,"I was the Safety Technician, Delivery Driver, Inventory Specialist, Safety Trainer for Clients and In-House, as well as many other aspects...essentially, AOSS had all their eggs in one basket with no desire to hire additional employees. I worked upwards of 16 hour days and was all over the country and state, where I would constantly be reprimanded by regional management for not having paperwork submitted to corporate and not delegating my duties enough; delegate to &@$%ing who? Oh, right, Me-Myself-And I."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"They look for reasons to fire you,great group of coworkers minus one,and he is sucked up tight.the manager is a back stabbing clown.he ignores safty but then he will turn you in for things he does daily"
bad,"Fast growing organization that will prosper in the Co2 business."
bad,Nice people and company. They need help with development and training of their employees. A lot of temps and not enough permanent people.
bad,"Listen more to your sales force for ideas to improve sales and morale. "
bad,"This company offers a hourly job, great if the overtime is there, but winter is bad, not much overtime.  They do treat you fairly and have no problem with you taking off as long as if its in notice.  Recently they added GPS logs, im not to happy with that. The new president is from a company that has Camera's. I will not tolerate a camera in my face!!  This company is very high on safety, i like that!  The hardest part is the long hours, working weekends sometimes, nights sometimes and dealing with a dangerous chemical. The co-workers for the most part are nice, but you hardly see them.  Management is ok, but the recent changes are not appetizing.  The most enjoyable part is being on the road on a long trip to get away!  Hot Plants and PPE's in the Sun are Heck!!!"
bad,"Miserable place to work management attempts to bully "
bad,"At work by 6:30"
bad,"Daily fulfillment of medical & non-medical gases,Delivery Route Driver"
bad,"Supervisors and management create an unhealthy environment. They openly disrespect their employees and use foul language in what's supposed to be a ""corporate"" environment. The workload is like any other job, but having to deal with supervisors that are nasty and like to belittle you in public make the heavy workload unbearable."
bad,"I worked here for a year pulling orders on a cherry picker, while getting paid the bare minimum, and the same amount per hour as people who dodnt have to operate heavy machinery. ZERO room for advancement, and a very racially separated work place."
bad,I work for this company for almost 5 years. And management sucks. When you hire a person in management they should know something about the company and how they are ran. Listen to the people because they know. I lot of drama he say she say. Something all the time.
bad,Company can do better in encouraging their employees! Not a very friendly environment! Most folks mind their own business in IT department! Not very helpful management!
bad,Poor Management in some areas which causes a lot of unethical choices and having targets on your back if you don't agree with what they are doing or how they are managing or not managing the problem
bad,"Do not resign from a good job thinking this is a job as if the grass is greener on the other side."
bad,"This is a great place to work if you are not looking for promotions/advancement. Weekly pay, 401k, PTO, floating holidays, life/health/dental/vision insurance,  and off on the weekends.  The job work/life balance, and compensation/benefits are great.  There is no training,  and the A/R Mgr. just let you sit with other reps. to see what they are doing, and hope that you catch on.  The management in the A/R Dept. where I worked is overbearing,  unapproachable,  unprofessional, rude, liars,  ineffective, malicious gossipers, and they lower the office morale. When I was hired, I was told by the A/R Mgr. that with their bonus incentive structure that I would be making way more money than I was hired. After two months of working there I was told to never ever ask about how much my bonus is and to never ask about it.  I was told that by the Director and the A/R Mgr. The bonus I did make was super low,  and especially after taxes it's a joke.  The office environment there is pathetic,  especially if you are a male. The A/R Manager will use your job against you,  and will write you up for any reason she seem fit and plus lie about it.  It's way too much negativity, and gossip from management and employees.  The HR Dept.  is useless especially if you have issues with abusive, overbearing, lying manager like I had.  The HR Manager is a complete idiot and she will put the blame on you no matter what.  If you are a male and go to your manager and HR like I did they will retaliate against you and make you feel highly uncomfortable.  I was harassed by a female employee and followed protocol."
bad,I do not have to many pleasant things to say about Airgas other than their benefits were good and if schools were closed due to weather they excused you from working.
bad,"Airgas has a very large turnover not only with drivers and plant employees but also in management."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Enjoyed my stay while at Airgas. Enjoyed working & Assisting my team members when help was requested.  Used all my available resources to help me succeed monthly & quarterly.
bad,"Just like any other work place, you have hard workers and workers hardly working. There would probably be less turnover if workers were paid what they are worth. Yes smiles and verbal appreciation helps but that doesn't pay the bills, mortgage, and food. It is hard to get work done when you are always training people due to high turn over and called in meetings. It is hard to be trained properly when you sit with 3 to 4 people for 2 to 4 hours at a time and you hear how you should do things several different ways. You learn the lazy way, the quick way, how to pass the buck way, and the correct way. Sometimes all in the same day."
bad,Airgas has a large number of employees and for the most part everyone works together well.  Recently there have been management changes and it has changed the overall direction of the company.  It has changed from customer focused to process focused.
bad,"No matter how much of a team player you are, the company will throw you under the bus the very first chance they get. Management is only out to save their own skin."
bad,"Delivered specialized gas and gas mixes to various colleges as well as Millstone nuclear power plant. Lots of backstabbing, very cliquish. Constantly being watched over. Best part of the job was when I worked alone."
bad,"Great Company !!!!"
bad,The job in itself was good but very poorly run from management. There was no fairness in how you were evaluated - either they liked you or they didn't. Wasted too much time on feeding employees as a reward instead of giving money in your paychecks. 3% raises a year which amounted to mere pennies. The manager in my group has lost at least 25 people in the 4 years I was there. Certainly a red flag to the upper management. They all left because they couldn't stand her. Most people work there to get the experience and then move to another company that pays more. Airgas is cheap and puts way too many jobs on one person to do in a 8 hour day. I would not recommend this place to anybody to work.
bad,Started with this company with the expectation of a good career move.  During the first meeting with the Regional Manager all he talked about was how bad a job everyone else was doing.  How no one was smart enough to do the job correctly.  After meeting with a few of the other ASM's it became very evident of how bad a decision I had made.  After about 8 months it was announced that Airgas had been purchased by Air Liquide and people started leaving soon after.  Our territories were going to almost double with no increase in compensation and demands were even higher.  I must note that this was on the Carbonic side of Airgas so I can't speak of the bulk and cylinder side of the company.  I enjoyed working with Cold Jet and really enjoyed and respected the branch managers within the company.  I chose to leave and haven't regretted that decision at all.
bad,"Typically would come in and follow up on some of the previous days work and on certain issues to see its progress. Reach out to other customer about any issues they are experiencing with their billing and why Airgas is not being paid. "
bad,"Airgas was probably the worst managed company I have ever worked from in all sections. The pay was extremely Low, they hire unqualified people to get the job done and they wonder why the turnover rate is through the roof at this location. Equipment broken, lies being told everyday, coworkers mad at each other management don't even know whats going on in the plant."
bad,"Airgas is not a fun place to work. You are not given the tools to do your job properly, there are many rules to follow and can be terminated for anyone of them. Its a sales enviornment where management has no sales experience. You are treated like an employee number."
bad,This company just laid me off after 6 years of dedicated service because myself and another driver with 25 years of service were union employees. We recently bought out another company and they decided to go with there under paid drivers instead of us.
bad,I been working at Airgas for over 10yrs.  Was a great company at first but in the last 2 years with new management this company has turned it's back on the number one thing SAFTY!! I have been asked multiple times to break safety rules and SOP (standard operating procedures) along with being asked to miss monthly safety meeting by my management.  Senior management does not back hourly employees they stand behind there plant managers.  Pay and benefits are ok.
bad,"The company appears to be changing over the last couple of years."
bad,Company is a good place to work.  Management isnt so nice.  Lost of turn over.  Micro manage and make it hard to focus on your job.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,"Airgas provides a stable work environment but it is not a place to stay for the long term. Gain experience, save your money, and follow your true dreams. Not a bad this to work but always want more for yourself."
bad,Terrible place to work corporate always wanting to do more with less could not take any paid time off because we were always short handed everybody always stayed stressed out because of the toxic atmosphere
bad,"It's a great place to work with regard to pay, benefits, work/life balance, and general employee appreciation. However, the management in the Data Integrity department is disorganized regarding their training procedures. I went through 3 different trials of training throughout my short time there.The first ended after 60 days, which partly consisted of forwarding documents I had questions on back to my trainer. I didn't learn much, obviously. Then, at the direction of my manager, I was supposed to receive some one-on-one, non-interrupted time from my supervisor. Instead of that happening, it was decided by them that they would try giving me all types of documents to process - most of which I was told previously that I wasn't ready to learn, yet. At that point, it was already too late. I was too far behind in progress to be allowed to continue. It seemed as if they were blaming ME for my dismissal. I lost my job due to their lack of a concrete training program. After I was let go, all ties were cut off immediately. Someone else packed up my things from my desk. When I asked about things that were left behind, they said they would mail them to me. Apparently, I was banned from the property. As far as I know, the Data Integrity department is mismanaged. I'm not sure as to the competency of management for other departments."
bad,Worst management I have ever dealt with in my working career.  I left because of the management.  Went to HR numerous times and nothing happened.  Coworkers were okay.
bad,"Airgas is the sort of place that will cradle even the most under qualified and help them to find a long, and outstanding career. The pay is great, the benefits are wonderful, and there are loads and loads of other great vacation and sick options. If you don't have a plan and need a job that will support you, definitely come to Airgas."
bad,This company doesn't care about it's people . manager lies  and company just continues to back him even when they know he is bad .you must break SOPs standard operating procedure in order to keep the job caught up.seems to be a revolving door the last couple of years. Was once a good job
bad,Company good. Female management I worked for is vindictive and will retaliate against you if you are a strong person. Beware and stay true to yourself.
bad,As a driver you will work plenty of hours.  Now that Air Liquide owns them however there may be drawbacks to working there.  Air Liquide is poorly managed.
bad,poorly organize / not enough man power. raises aren't worth the work . wish they would listen more to the staff on how to push the work out . I've worked there for over 10 years with little to no grow in the company smh.
bad,The job on a local level is good but they are top heavy and upper management has no clue what day to day operations involve they only know what the book says and they treat their older employees pretty bad it is cheaper to replace them than to take care of the ones who took care of them all those years just know going in you are only a number and that will never change with this company no matter how high on the food chain you think you are.
bad,"Long, long hours for many routes.  OT pay is good at time and a half. Some good benefits.  Starting pay is slightly above market average for similar Class B driver jobs.  But, most drivers are miserable and hate their jobs.  Promised monthly performance bonuses are almost never paid out at the Atlanta Medical branch.  Equipment is old and not well maintained.  Base of operations is dirty and hot. Instituted drive cams and cumbersome data logging tablets add heavy additional workload onalreadyoverworked drivers.  Favoritism and poorly balanced scheduling make for long days for some drivers."
bad,"Although benefits are on par with most other companies, the stress caused by unqualified supervisors, rampant laziness tolerated for a select few and wishy washy or ""loose"" policies when it comes to metrics is not worth it."
bad,average place to work there lots to learn and lots to do always busy and busy maintaining inventory on daily basis not a lot of room to grow and move up
bad,You had an hour lunch and management was terrible. They want you to learn everything in each department and what you to do all of it and when it comes to the yearly raise they don't give you want you earned.
bad,Great company to work for good benefits and great hours work well with request of time off. Great opportunities with company. Take time to train you on new programs. Take in mind new ideas to make your position efficient to do and reduce time.
bad,Unless your liked by management they'll get rid of you without thinking twice. I dedicated my life to them for 20 years and they hire a new kid off the street that didn't know a thing. He couldn't remember anything as simple as entering a sales order and I tell him he needs to start learning this stuff and paying attention to what he had to learn and he tells HR about it and they let me go claiming that I was creating a hostile work environment.
bad,"not much benefits after the change of management and positions were not solidified thru the company, spent a great deal of time there going nowhere.."
bad,"upper management only cares for themselves  they put people in positions to fail and then fire you when you do,, poor training module to"
bad,management always riding your back and no matter what it is never enough
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
bad,Not really a job that I would recommend to others. Supervisor is too concerned about himself than his fellow co-workers.
bad,"daily load ,truck deliver goods unload truck,make deadlines get done a certain time"
bad,The job itself was great before Airgas bought them out. It was more customer service before the big box came along. I believe customers come but they don’t have that philosophy.
bad,I was happy to have worked for this company. I Had a lot of good experience working here.
good,Airgas is constantly having a problem with turn over so they expect a small amount of people to do what is needed by more people and if you have any problem with it they don't care the pay is okay not a complaint there but management expect you to break your back constantly no incentive
good,"Worked for Red-D-Arc bought company and was a great employee.  Advancement is possible with the company if you can get in good with the office manager.  "
good,"Fair and balanced, the company did not tell employees of down sizing till the division was terminated. And did not let employees apply to over area within Air gas."
good,"Working for Airgas in the Santa Fe Springs Plant environment is unlike any other you will ever experience.  After having worked there for only 8 months, I feel completely exhausted and squeezed for my time and effort by my employer.  You can expect to work 6 days a week and never be recognized for a job well done; however, you may also expect to be publicly put down and humiliated for simple mistakes caused by fatigue. Management is the pinnacle of hypocrisy.  They expect more for less, yet never make any noticeable sacrifices themselves or give you equipment that is safe and that works.  The culture is very cut-throat and crass.  If you do not have thick skin, you will not last here.  Your co-workers will most likely be felons or have served time in prison.  The most enjoyable part of the job is driving out the gates to go home every morning (if you work graveyard shift)."
good,Airgas is a large company that operates as a mom and pop corporation. Most of the managers and above have been with the company for almost 2 decades and have a hard time being open to new innovative ideas.
good,"This corporation has it's head in the clouds when it comes to what actually goes on in it's end user stores, and has no clue what they put a regular associate through with all of their ""great"" ideas that come from some corporate desk jockey that never sets foot on a real retail store site They treat their drivers even worse than the store associates, and have no clue how much risk the drivers take everyday to get the goods to the customer. The actual part of the business that makes most of the money gets the least amount of support and encouragement, while the office personnel get all the benefits and perks of a big corporation."
good,"Typical workday included testing and adjusting as needed different process controls and systems, including pumps control valves, There are many times that you will be working by yourself with no one to go to help you if a problem will arise with the process equipment. Would have to call someone for help over the phone, which was not reliable."
good,"Manager expect you to put company a head of life. No feed back from employees, Very stressful, everyone was so stree no free time to experience fun in the work place."
good,it was a job that requires somethings were good and some things were not but overall it was hum drum
good,good job for high school students and college kids. not a lot of growth or financial growth opportunity! high turnover for employees. don't really have control over your success
good,Airgas in Southern California has unionized ...multiple facilities have joint the Teamsters for a reason. Better future to look forward to.. I wouldn’t recommend this company right now.  Let the Teamsters do there thing. Then I’ll recommend. It’s a mess right now. Give it a year or so. Then it will be a company to work for.
good,call on current and prospective new customers.  make sure inside and outside persons were doing the correct processes to ensure a happy customer. meetings to schedule meetings. reports on top of reports.
good,The upper management is constantly changing the rules in regards safety procedures. The company has equipped a large number of there fleet with Drive Cam to add an extra case of fear into the day.
good,Incompetent management. Backstabbing coworkers. Decent enough place to work until upper management started hiring branch managers with NO experience of any kind over people with 10 or more years in the business.
good,"I prefer not to talk about this. A atmosphere of employee and customer disregard is prevalent. Discontinued my work type, laid off employees and abandoned paying customers on short notice."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Top Leadership costly."
good,Can't discuss. Part of Severance package will not let me make any statements about the company or its management.
good,"a typical day at work began with cycle counting for 2 hrs then going into the system to do adjustments after all was complete i would either pull orders, pack/audit, or help out in receiving until shift was done."
good,"The job itselft is fine.......it's their management team, they are not professional."
good,"i loved the co workers, the management was not that good, i learned everything i know about accounts payable from this job"
good,Compensation is not competitive for the amount of work that needs to be produced. Management needs a lot of improvement. The hardest part of the job is learning the system and not enough training.
good,Safety is only a factor if something happens.  Many times management would contradict itself on safety rules that have u to remain static while in process of filling cylinders.  But also want you to multitask far away from your work putting others at harm because high pressure wasn't monitored.
good,Too many levels of management . Not a team atmosphere and to much finger pointing. Every week is a new policy that restricts your ability to work. Wish it could have been better
good,"Specifically in the Collections Small Balance department. The Manager is unprofessional, unqualified, manipulative, and self-centered. The demand put on the collectors is unrealistic with the current management team."
good,"Needs improvement on workplace culture.  One Airgas!"
good,"It was not a bad place to work . Just did not have good management. HR would never return calls!"
good,"Airgas starts out salary as a fair paying company. They say annual raises are performance based. They lie. They budget everyone for 3% raises. I was nominated as regional driver of the year, but was told I needed to demonstrate above and beyond performance to get more then 3%. Nominated driver of the year out of 300+ drivers, but i wasn't a high performer? Also, management directs company policy, but when they perform the same work they don't follow them. (using cell phone while driving, getting out and looking behind vehicle prior to backing up). But they will fire you if you violate these rules, first offense...personal experience. For almost 7 years I was considered by immediate supervisors a high performance worker. I had zero at fault preventable accidents with a better then most safety record. I was accused of 1 violation of a work safety rule and terminated immediately. No proof was presented to me, and the initial steps of our disciplinary procedure was skipped and I was terminated with no opportunity to defend myself."
good,Airgas was a great spring board.  The pay is decent and you have the ability to learn different aspects of the industry.  Capped at moving up fairly quickly
good,I worked in the dry ice division at the milwaukee branch. Airgas can be a good place to work for if management there was not A-holes.... Management was very rude and disrepectful. The manager there will yell at another grown man if he did anything wrong. The drivers was in the office more than usual because drive cam event such as hard breaking. It is very stressful working with this manager ther.
good,"this is over all a good place to work BUT very high stressfull job.you will work all the time on the average 70 hours every week. not much of a life out side of work. you will work at night when you first start. you are always told what you not doing right, never good job pat on the back!"
good,Worked at Airgas for 10 years with no advancement. The benefits and insurance are decent. The work load is overwhelming at times. Leadership and advancement has the 'good ole boy' approach.
good,"Airgas has good training and is all about safety, relax and get the job done safely. Once you're on your own, inner management  pushes you to rush and loads on more work."
good,It is difficult to feel you are getting adequate training with 3 different levels of management telling you 3 different ways of handling the same situation.  They would serve better to the department by having 1 manager calling the shots and NOT having 3 meetings a day every day so that they are available to others.
good,Worked there for four years as a bulk ammonia driver / driver trainer. When you go through the hiring process they want you to be very secretive about your pay scale! the reason for this is there is no set pay structure like most large company's. they will try to get you in the door as cheap as possible or pay you more depending on the desperation of need at the time. I was employed there for four years with a starting hourly wage of 16.50 and at the end of my four year employment was making 18.70 and the reason i ended my employment was a driver was hired in at 20.00 an hour and i was expected to train him. overall airgas is a great company but its the regional and local supervisors that choose what they pay you and as far as supervisors go the one that i had only cared about his own skin you where just another number
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"My work day started like most. Came in and went straight to a stressful day. Most locations were under staffed and over worked. I am a multi tasker and can usually excel in a job like that, I did for the most part. But being under staffed makes it hard to keep up with most of the extra requirements put on someone throughout the day. Customers were my focus and getting their orders right was my goal. But with to much upper management that all did the same job it was hard to please everyone."
good,Supervision lacks training not all employees are treated equally. Very little room for moving up for women. I have been singled out more than once in an uncomfortable situation.
good,"Its not the company that is bad, its management. Nothing is fair unfortunately. I would recommend working here if you need a job, but not to stay for to long"
good,"poor management not stable environment politics on the job"
good,"Work is very repetitive, new challenges can be solved by investments into infrastructure for long term growth; executive leadership is focused on short term revenue growth instead of long term customer growth at the expense of the operational infrastructure."
good,I have worked at Airgas for 1 year now and it is a great company to start off at straight out of college. This company is structured well and the pay is decent.
good,"As mentioned in the summary, when oil is up (over $50 a barrel), this is a good paying job.  You may work up to 15 hours a day when it is extremely busy but the overtime pay makes up for it."
good,"If you already know everything there is about the industrial gas world.  This may be a place for you but do not expect to be paid for your experience.  Although the job is ever changing, which is the part that I do not mind; the lack of support and training results spending endless hours off the clock doing quotes, reports, and sales prep."
good,The company is unable to develop clear lines of communication.  Managers discretion is overlapped by leadership; simple tasks that allow companies to thrive are held up by indecisive managers and leaders at all levels.  The culture is built on sales at whatever the cost; get the business and then figure out how to service it is not an effective nor productive way to sustain long term growth.  Leaders have continuously provide empty promises for people and equipment to sustain the current operational tempo.  Credibility is slipping away the further the company moves forward.  Even though my review does not validate the overall growth since the company was founded; I am speaking for what I have been visible to.
good,Just a big Dam company -- If you can deal with that and ALL that comes with it .....It gets tough going back to customers for price increases when you have 4 a year .
good,"Shoveled 3-4,000 pounds of dry ice perday."
good,Lots off different projects were ongoing  and frequent companywide changes learned quite a bit. My assignment at Holly frontier greatly improved my overall HSE knowledge base.
good,Stable work environment. Not a lot of opportunities to learn new technology. Climbing the ladder in the company is difficult. Reporting structure constantly changing.
good,"Very independent workplace"
good,Excellent for long term productivity for a career. Daily challenges allow for growth and experience. Family oriented company.
good,A ok place to work if you do not want think. Let someone else do the thinking for you.
good,Different regions are organized and managed very differently and so the employment experience varies significantly.  The company is head-quartered in Pennsylvania and seems to be most stable and consistent on the east coast.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Deleterious pyramidal management structure.
good,Company does not promote from within. No positions to advance to. A good starting pay but not much in the way of raises.
good,"Goal numbers are increased by 7 to 10% annually. You will be required to make up any lost revenue like (job sites)"
good,Airgas was a big company and had a lot of red tape in place to get things done.  I would pick up new accounts but it was difficult on the back end because our service was not good enough to support the company.
good,"Spinning those bottles are hard work after a while and if you really good, store manager will block any opportunity to advance within company. "
good,"Pay is good, but benefits are below average. With the exception of the branch manager, the company has zero appreciation of it's drivers or respect of their experience as drivers. They are constantly fixing things that aren't broken and introducing unless programs that make the delivery process more difficult and time consuming. They like to make promises that will remain unfulfilled. Wether it's compensation or something as simple as a new uniform shirt. They just don't come through. The job doesn't feel secure, in fact, it feels like they are always on the hunt for a reason to reprimand you for something. "
good,"Working at Airgas was just a fine place to work. You learn a lot about welding, safety, and gases. A typical day is sitting in a cubical making and taking calls and responding to emails, and it gets old."
good,It was stressful 12 hour shifts majority of the time they have ppl as manger that are brand new that don't kno or know just as much as u do pay was nice but the dry ice burns went fun
good,"This place was messed up from the start.It took them 2 months to correct my check with the shift differential pay. If you have any type of experience they throw you right in without training you. Then when you mess up its heres what you did wrong figure out yourself how to fix it. Then when it comes time to bonuses( which they do quarterly if they like you) if the plant manager doesnt have your information you got left out of the bonus. I personally have no idea how this place has remained open. There is one good manager and hes the lab night shift manager, the rest have their head so far up their own butts or the plant managers you cant tell where the begin or end.  I am personally doing everything in my power to leave this company as soon as possible."
good,work is simple but the management is hardly qualified to do their jobs. customer service is always included in every meeting but only applies to reports and not actually servicing the customer.
good,"This company exerts tremendous pressure on its sales representatives. The commission plan was decent, however, over time, the plan had become less lucrative. A somewhat stressful place to work."
good,"Didn't realize how difficult the environment was here until I left the company.  Very competitive environment.  Company does a fantastic job meeting/exceeding profitability targets and people work very hard to make sure that happens consistently.  Culture is quirky-be careful if you are not 'liked' especially by managers, senior managers."
good,I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by Airgas. Company has given me a stable income for the past 7+ years.  Management and management training is lacking big time. Benefits however were satisfactory. Company needs a revamp. Outdated mindset and ideology with a hint of favoritism.
good,It's a good place to work but needs direction.Someone to get everyone to do there job and work as a team .if we had a manager that had every employee do there job and work as a team it would be a great place to work
good,"Typical work day consist of, working as a team to fill oxygen cylinders. I learn about the different Dot regulation and how they apply to my work. Management give us instruction in the form of safety meeting, and they give the us the tools we need to complete our daily task."
good,"it is cold, u get wet because they cant keep a box washer so u have to go back their wash boxes and take care of the dry ice line. supervisors on other shifts be talking to you like your their child, thats not how you run a company."
good,"After being promoted, I found that I had a lot of upper management making demands with out proper tools to solve problems.  Personal problems were not properly handled by the human resources people. New rules were made daily to an all ready busy day."
good,"was a great place to work, unfortunately it was bought out. it was bought out by air liquid and they closed down my fill plant and many others."
good,"The Airgas I worked for was extremely unpleasant. The hours were terrible as was the management. The pay was great and so were the benefits, but it didn't change the work environment."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Prefect for the people that love the same work everyday. Management is there. Co-workers are nice, depending on what you do it is a physical demanding job. Best Part is leaving."
good,"Wasn't the best place to work.  Upper management tell you one way to do something but when it isn't the right way, you get blamed for it even if you disagreed with what was asked but you did anyways because UM said to do it.  Went to work, did my job but was railroaded.  Took the fall for others because it was other managers above me would not admit to issues at locations and when I did let the problems be known to other UM, it suddenly became all my fault even though it had been occurring for years before I got there.  Not a good place to work.  Stay away if you can.  It's a job but will give you ulcers and make your hair fall out."
good,"Good place to start but not stay. Rukes change everyday and employees are treated like children. No cell phones, do not talk to coworkers. Cheap"
good,"In charge of AR.  With hundred of customers had to make sure to keep the again respectable."
good,Airgas is a company that provides products that touch everyone's lives. It takes pride in their customer base and the service it provides.
good,"A typical day at Airgas can include a wide range of things, from loading trucks to filling liquids. Airgas is a very fast paced job where attention to detail is critical and if you aren't careful you can be seriously hurt. Management as a whole isn't that bad. The two managers there have been there along time and can be very knowledgable and helpful. Getting up and going to work everyday knowing that there isn't any room for growth was a tough pill to swallow. The group of guys I worked with were awesome and all brought different thing to the table. My co-workers are hands down the best thing about my job, we were like family"
good,"If you enjoy climbing the corporate ladder then this is the job for you. If you do not, then don't waste your time.  There are multiple locations accross the country so you can basically transfer anywhere you wish"
good,Very stressful-processes and procedures constantly changing...not in a good way.  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  Poor communications between middle management and workers.  Fantastic coworkers family type atmosphere.
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for. However, the Credit dept in the Central Division (Tulsa,ok) is lacking true leadership and accountability. There are way too many different levels of management on the sales side to truly do your job effectively in A/R."
good,Great people to work with but company doesn't care about employees.
good,A typical day I come in and fill any shortages and help the drivers get on the road. Then I fill on various manifolds in the plant for the loads for the next day.
good,"management has us vs employes mentality,once you start getting advanced they work to get ride of you,no long term employment with them,they will always tell you, "" right to work state"" You go to work hoping you still have a job."
good,A great work atmosphere. Very eager to get it's employees trained and certified on forklift and other warehouse equipment.
good,Go in load truck with tanks for delivery. Then pull hard goods that needed to be puled for customers. Then go do route. then come back and help customers and keep yard in good shape.
good,"Our motto, Do what you can with what you got. Like anywhere else could always use more help."
good,"Too many expectations, goal/requirements. Value Quantity over Quality when it comes to number of phone calls and time spent with each customer. Co-workers are ok."
good,A normal day at airgas would be to start work as soon as arriving at desk. I usually take an analysis of my desk and have a game plan and i start that plan and try to stay wit
good,"I have had the opportunity to work with some of the best people I have ever known and work with wonderful customers,"
good,Warehouse  work requiring a lot heavy lifting. The store manager hires a person with no warehouse experience and gives him the title of warehouse manager. Doesn't know how to run a warehouse and basically sits on his all day. No experience on fork lift; doesn't know how to receive or stock parts. Store manager is incompetent of how to manage a store.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"I been working here at Airgas for too many years it kind a boring job , now looking for new challenges ."
good,would rather not give a review and I don't know who the CEO is so it will be hard to rate sorry.  I loved my job there until management changed and at that point I knew my job wasn't secure.
good,"answer phones "
good,It's alot different from reading my job on paper than it is doing my job. They sure depended on me to get alot done with not enough help. I took care of a big area.
good,Go in pre trip truck and secure load placard the truck. Then load all the safety and hard goods in the cargo bays. Then get the list of the customers. Then Drive to customers and deliver welding equipment and goods. Then after delivering to all the customers drive back to the yard post trip do paperwork and logs.  Then help stock store and warehouse. Then help sale welding equipment and safety equipment. Also do the end of the day reports.
good,The management change caused constant conflict regarding employee and customer morale.  Employees wanted a positive work environment and the customers wanted that reflected by management.
good,"Lots of micromanagement. Very stressful, especially in sales. Competitors are cut-throat. Local branch managers are hard to work with. Good pay and benefits."
good,Okay work place to work. Great place if you are just starting your career or ready to retire. Airgas is not good place to work if you are looking to advance in your career.
good,"They expect a lot from branch managers. have to wear many hats each day. customer interaction was fun, learning what they were doing or trying to do with the items they were getting."
good,"Airgas, apart from the toxicity of my boss, was a fair place to work.  Unfortunately, Airgas tends to micromanage its people and makes advancement difficult."
good,Airgas is a decent company to work for overall.  The division I was in was a new start up with a brand new plant manager.  It was very difficult due to very poor communication regarding expectations and having the specific job duties explained or trained properly.
good,"Good learning experience for haz mat and hazard materials and how to fill compressed gas cylinders. Learning the the different compress gases from flammables to none flammables, where and how to store compress gas."
good,To bad the plant had to close after working there for 13 years. Really liked the people I worked with except for a few. Pay was good and liked filling/blending many different mixtures of gas.
good,"With this company there is a continual improvement emphasis for both Operations and Administrative roles. "
good,Learned a lot in an evolving work environment that was aiming to establish central internal guidelines and standardization. Gained essential customer service and conflict management skills from working with those employees resistant to change and overall management.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"It was a good job, but they put to much stress on you, required too much out of you, then they out source my department, and laid me off."
good,"This company has great benefits. Very fast paced, must able to multitask. They offer a lot of safety training. The best part of the job are the customers."
good,I became insulin dependent and Airgas safety policies would not allow that and at the time there were no inside positions available. I left on extremely good terms with all management
good,The overall job was decent and kept busy through most of the night. The Branch Manager was good and helped on most occasions to try and help satisfy his employees. The hardest part of job would be working nights and most of all the drive home was fairly long.
good,Airgas is a decent company to work for if you do not feel the need to increase in your career.
good,Air gas does have its cons and pros but from what i see the business as a whole lacks communication
good,"Airgas is a growing company. The HazMat industry is dead serious, with no room for 'grey area'."
good,A typical workday consist of running various accounting report thu  SAP system. While checking emails and call in orders for releases of Airgas products. I have learned that Time management is everything. My co-workers are just as busy all day evryday as I'am. The hardest part of my job is taking your breaks on time becuse you are so busy it's easy to work thru your breaks. The most enjoyable part of my job is the Customer Service part. Meeting new people over the phone and sometimes face to face on branch office visits.
good,a typical day at work would be a lot of multitasking and hard work but at the end of the day things got done because of the in house management and coworkers help made it enjoyable to be there.
good,"Good pay, good schedule. easy to work with co workers. Management was good in some areas."
good,"Safety meetings every single morning, 10's of computer tutorials which interupt driver deliveries. Employees are coerced to sign documents which are used later to insure that the workers and not the company are held liable for any and all mishaps despite not being provided the most modern and safe equipment for the tasks at hand. Dealing with and transporting non-flammable and flammable gases is extremely dangerous expecially because of the tremendous pressures at which they are contained."
good,Branch Manager for 6 years with a load of responsibilities. Sales for 6 years to begin my career out of college.
good,"daily work inside office, help with inside sales during lunch. make calles to customer base increase sales within each account. Co- workers were great, management was professional but compensation program was less desirable. Hardest part was no matter how much you increased sales limited bonus. Co-workers enjoyable."
good,Very High Volume AP Department
good,The company is good company but the assistant manager was always talking behind my back and I was the hardest worker there and other worker will tell me that they will tell them to work me the hardest . And felt that was u nfair
good,not a bad place to work no room for growth. benefits are ok and people are good to work with. training could be better and customer service should be better.
good,Enjoyed being in road and interacting with my customers I tended to in a regular basis.  Some behind scene things that happened began to change my views with management.
good,"Good Company, but very restricted on drivers, benefits could be lots better and cover more for employees. Work is inconsistent unless you have lots of seniority within the company."
good,"Very structured workplace that had a lot of hard skill training that was beneficial for first time employees. Learned much about the tax world, with the culture being business professional."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Responsible for loading trucks; Ensure that daily inventory is correct; create customer orders;  Pick up and deliver old and new products; Perform pre-trip inspection of  vehicle
good,"typical work day is to keep shop clean , work with customers and off load trucks. mulit-tasking is a must and workplace culture was transparent. forklift driving & palleting boxes ."
good,"Airgas is a stable and comfortable place to work. The culture is muted, and focused much more on the company than it is on the employee. Some areas of the company have high turnover, but there is also a good percentage of employees that spend many years working for Airgas. Airgas is good at hiring and promoting from within, but there is definitely a lack of management development inside the company."
good,"A typical workday can range from fairly slow, to extremely hectic, all in the same day. It really depends on the job position being held."
good,"I was happy for the time i was there, but once i was found to have ADHD i was push out of all career growth chances and and future with Airgas. They dnt follow the AWD Act at all."
good,Good place to work.   To far from my home. Trying to find something that is closer to my home.  Did not like sitting at a desk all day and making phone calls to customers.  Need to be more active in my job duties.
good,Currently owned by Air Liquide and the combined companies are doing over $20 billion in yearly revenue.  Airgas is continuing to acquire additional companies.
good,"Airgas is a company that allows you to work 7-4/8-5/9-6 if you choose ."
good,The people that work here are for the most part low brow and just sucking up pay checks. People have a discriminatory nature in management and upper level management is a good old boys club. Be wary.
good,"I worked in the IT department for six years and was happy with the company and the culture. When I was hired, I was at one at a regional headquarter office, but due to a reorganization that office moved to another state and it was not necessary to keep multiple IT workers in my location."
good,this company provided good healthcare and paid time off benefits. very large corporation with lots of policies and rules. Ok job  not the best company but it will do.
good,"I started in the industry in 1999, worked as a filler and worked my way up to plant manager by 2008, I moved to 3 different areas with the company and I am currently the plant supervisor in hutchinson ks."
good,"Basically go in do as your told then go home. its enjoyiable to a certain extent, some customers and management make it alot harder than what it really intels"
good,"When i was employed here the atmosphere was deceptive with a toxic culture that was exemplified in the two managers. Since then I'm told both have been removed and the culture has improved, but at the time it was a pleasure to leave."
good,Airgas was a good place to work for until they sold out to Air Liquied.  Their expectations are unobtainable in the economy where my store was located.  With Airgas we could talk to the upper management with out fearing retaliation.  Air Liquied does not allow this at all.
good,Overall good place to work. The culture can be all for one. Typical day working with customers on phone and in store . Was enjoyable at times. Loyalty does not count for much. If you are friends with upper management. You will get further.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Airgas was just okay to work for.  It was busy and hard work. There was breakfast on Fridays. I  worked for two different companies for Airgas. Airgas is no longer the company's name. It was brought out by another company
good,If you want to work for a company that expect you to not ask logical questions or to hold anyone accountable for their work ethic then is is the company for you.
good,"Performs administrative and management functions. Performs and monitors management (and procedural application) of manual or automated inventory control actions. Computes and accumulates data for use in analysis. Helps develop work standards and methodology. Performs inventories, and ensures timely correction of discrepancies. Prepares, analyses, and evaluates reports, procedures, and policy data. Provides customer service."
good,"nice place to work and get a good start, good people every body is willing to help . Bosses treated employees good  . the best part was making new friends and learning new things"
good,"Daily routine assisting distribution, working sales counter, inside sales of welding equipment.  Fast passed problem solving on a daily basses collective team to complete daily duties."
good,This is an excellent company to work for. I would have liked to have stayed a while longer but after graduation it was time to move on to my field of study
good,The challenges of the operation is rewarding when achieved. Create your own destiny when working with a company. Don't let other people experiences be your judgement.
good,"The safety culture ,and guidelines contradict the work load and production efficiency. Management changes in recent years has lead to many of transfers and resignations."
good,"Productive Work Environment"
good,"Before National Welders was purchased from Airgas LLC it was a family owned business. The owners treated you like family, but once the acquisition was finalized things began to change very rapidly. You were no longer treated like family but just another number. Airgas LLC liked to buy other welding companies and before too long jobs began to overlap and guess what? People were no longer needed especially the ones who had tenure. We were the ones that went first. Oh sure there where some let go that only worked for a couple of years, but for the most part it was us old guys."
good,Recent mergers have created many changes within the company structures. There have been many position changes among staff. They have not all be positive.
good,work week started as early as 1AM Monday and sometimes ended on the dock Friday out of driving hours and still working.  Not the life for me. character fill.
good,good hours . lots of training and safety. i don't have a lot of nice things to say about this company. if you are looking for a shining positive review please look elsewhere.
good,This company is a very good stepping stone for a career opportunity. You do learn essentials skills for entry level work to be a success in a warehouse environment.All training is provided o start entry level machine operations.
good,Excellent place to work the weather was just very cold and wanted to find a location in a warmer area excellent coworkers but not a lot of opportunity to move up
good,"I would say its ok, I mean the works is always there.  I feel like it would be better with some structural updates. I've worked for other Gas suppliers and they were far ahead of airgase's structure and culture in 2010 than now currently. the job just leaves me lacking for something more."
good,I typically had to run multiple reports a day. Some were quite tedious but necessary. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my co-workers everyone was very easy going.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,It is beneficial to use a forklift and to be certified.  Training is fair and very demanding job when orders need to be filled and sent out on the trucks for delivery to various locations.
good,had to deal with a lot of local management turnover. new managers with new ideas made it difficult to know what was up and what was down.  at times it was not a happy place to work
good,its a good place to work if you get the right set of co workers. work is at a fast pace and safety is talked about and always the first agenda .. Always be safe
good,"It was nice but too large, felt I was lost in the crowd"
good,I have been a contractor at Airgas for 2 1/2 years and was suppose to be hired on when I took my new position in January 2017.  But I was not.  Management gave no reason.
good,"Over all it's a gd place most of the time you just do your job, other times the managers hound you for their mess-ups. The benefits are awesome and 401k"
good,"Decent benefits, layoffs come every few years, no security, no loyalty. Pay is ok. Again advancement is based on the ""buddy system "".  Pays the bills but it's a dead end job."
good,its a good place to work but your on your on most of the time. Your pay depends on your sales. You can make some money of your a hard worker. I didn't like to go by customer and pick up past due money owed to Airgas
good,I worked for Airgas for 11 years.   While working there I experienced long hours.  Working past the allowed daily hours allowed by law.  I was let go for a ticket that was dismissed in court for cell phone use.  I was treated as guilty and was not paid for 3 months before they finally fired me.  There was little to no communication with me in that time period.
good,Company cares a lot about safety and is willing to spend $ to ensure employees are in a safe environment. It is a fast pace environment that changes daily.
good,I thought it was a decent company to work for. Part of their job duties just weren't a good fit for myself so I had to move on. They take care of their employees.
good,"was told that internship would be an account management intern where I would learn how our sales process worked. Ended up being mostly a warehouse job counting inventory, moving product, and cleaning up."
good,"This company has the crappiest retirement(2% match) and benefits($12,000 a year for family) of any company I have worked for.  The recent merger with former Air Liquide locations has created a lot of turmoil and people are leaving at any opportunity.  The pay is mediocre which could be good for a single person with no family.  $22 an hour is nothing spectacular for this industry."
good,I loved my night shift crew. we always worked together and worked toward a common goal.  management was unconcerned with the needs of the employees...
good,good place to work  great benefits - good hours -- you are on  call some weekends - people are good to work with - growing company
good,Good group of people to work with.  Not a lot of room for growth.  management rewards hard workers with more work and same pay.  Just average overall.
good,Enjoyed working with co-workers to complete daily task in a timely manner.  Satisfying customers by giving the best customer service.
good,Large volumes of accounts and many need analysis and corrections. Management is kind and people are nice to work around.
good,The company was under a merger and there was not steady work within the job I was hired for.  It would be a good place to work once this merger is completed.
good,Airgas was a good company to work for. Felt like a family run company at the location I was employed at. Hard work but good benefits and pay. Union job which was good for ensuring good pay and benefits but restricted great workers from higher pay.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Outside sales or the account managers position set his own schedule.  Turned in reports weekly to the District Manager.  You did not get much help from the DM.  The Area Vice President and the President of the division were numbers people.  They have lost site of the relationships that account managers build.
good,I have worked for Airgas for 3 years now. I started as a medical driver. Moved up to inside sales in a year of employment. I get asked to do a lot of other things in for this company however when a new position opens up I never get the promotion. I guess there biggest problem is too many chiefs not enough Indians..
good,"Report to work on time and go to work in a friendly environment on a team with common goals and interest. Introduction to safety culture and learn the responsibility to comply with DOT and Safety Management Systems. "
good,Airgas invests a lot of resources in training its staff in their new operating system SAP.  They also periodically train their sales staff in the newest welding equipment.
good,"Traveling from site to site, offering stand-by rescue services to various chemical plants and refineries during turn-around conditions. Ensuring the safe entrance and exit of workers performing maintenance in confined spaces. My co-workers were pleasant individuals willing to learn, teach, and do the job correctly. The hardest part of the job was traveling and being away from family 90% of the year."
good,I was a field service tech under DOT non CDL rules and seldom worked less than 55 hr. per week.  Many times I was expected to work to the absolute maximum time permitted by DOT both daily and weekly.  Go in with your eyes open and be ready to be pushed.
good,Busy workdays and decent pay.  Great co-workers and that is the most enjoyable part of the job. Typical day is start at 6 and end when the route is finished.
good,My days are usually very busy. taking care of deposits and entering Exchange tickets and taking orders from customers. There is some days that I help out at the counter.  Have done receiving and putting up orders. My biggest part of my day is research and helping customer with issues or just helping them understand their bills and things on their accounts. Close of day is closing up register and getting things ready to start next day.
good,This was a good started company. Learned many skills I still currently use. I still have Family and friends who work for the company.
good,"Manage over 50 active projects through design, installation and maintenance of over 1800 sites."
good,"Benefits are great, managment needs addtional training. The company is great. However, they need to do better with staffing of the company. Someone shouldn't make manager just because they've been there long. They should make manager because they are capable of doing the job."
good,I left the company because there no advancements opportunities and when those opportunities came up it required relocation to different sates.
good,"Review MRP and Place PO, follow up and provide service to internal customers. Analyze metrics."
good,Heavily invested in providing quality service and products to customers.
good,Airgas merged into the Airgas Central Division. They moved the offices of 4 regions to the Tulsa area.
good,Airgas was a huge part of my career and provided me with great opportunities.
good,"Developed systems, policies and procedures to manager driver routes and facilitate consistent corporate practice. Managed dispatch, supervised routes, and formulated strategies to improve inefficiencies and reduce delivery times while complying with appropriate quality control protocols. Transported and delivered hazardous materials for Greater Austin and surrounding areas."
good,"Delivered different types of gases to Hospitals, and Construction sites."
good,its a regular job you have to work in the heat and the cold but you have plenty of time to get warm or cool down
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"it was a challenge to work in air gas company , there were more break ins because the demand for gas cylinders is high. the hardest part was patrolling inside the warehouse full of gas cylinders and inhaling all the smell from gas."
good,"Since it is a tough job & as a delivery truck driver,  a long hours is required"
good,"Always wide open from the time i got to work. I learned alot of patience. All of my co-workers were great. The management was less to be desired. "
good,"Managed medical gas production facility, generating $3M in annual revenue with service and production staff"
good,"A busy day at work listen to voice message, answer emails, attending meeting and work daily tasks."
good,I have no regrets about Airgas.  I was able to manage my own territory successfully and have fun doing it.
good,"Typical work days would consist of checking equipment and containers, making sure everything was in order for installations and servicing customers.Contacting customers to verify services and times.Make hotel arrangements if need per job.Complete all require DOT paperwork.Conduct a safety meeting with coworkers.Actively conducting product/fuel checks,ensuring all was prepared for workday. Keeping a level head during hectic and crisis situations.Management was very encouraging of growth and often sent staff for training in other states and made sure all staff were properly trained.All co-workers were very respectful and helpful when needing any assistance with installs or sevicing clients. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to manipulate cryogenic liquids to ensure the best quality and give the best customer service that I could provide."
good,"A typical day at work, consist of reviewing abnormal activity from about 20 branches that resulted in customer asset discrepancies. These issues may result in customer been credited rent or paying addition amount due to errors. In addition a track my branch dally asset to prepare our company quarterly inventory. I have learned to communicate effectively with branches to understand their concern in order to better resolve their individual issues. Also, I have a better understanding of the welding industry. The management team is friendly and listens to your need. They also will help you determine the best career path in the industry. I have 5 co-workers and with work as a team helping each other resolves the task at hand, especially when it comes to conduct all business activities by month end. We also celebrate each other birthday and Christmas. We enjoy each other company overall. The hardest part of the job is analyzing multiple source of information to better determine a course of action to help our branches or a particular customer concern. The most enjoyable part of the job is to know that at the end of the day you have save the company money and that our customer and branches are in alignment with what our business report is reflecting. In addition is coming to work in a friendly atmosphere."
good,Great learning experience . Learned to work with various personalities and problem solve multiple scenarios.
good,Making sure all customers receive there products and satisfied.
good,"I worked for Airgas for 12 yrs. I saw and went through corporate changes with the company and adapted to various operating procedures. A typical work day was to till fill high pressure and low pressure cylinders to maintain a stocking level for customers as needed. I started at a young age and learned a tremendous amount of responsibility in the work environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the customer demands and seemed to be understaffed to be able to follow operating procedures and guidelines. The enjoyable part of the job was having good employees that were flexible and willing to go help if needed without asking. Also having a nice break facility to eat lunch and cool off during the summer months, as well as warm up during the winter."
good,"always watching over your back, never satisfied with your performance."
good,"The work itself isn't overly difficult, most of the time your deliveries are simple and you are in and out in minutes.  There are of course times when you get the long deliveries.  There are also inter-branch runs (OTR) as well as the local stuff and those are usually done by the guys with the most seniority.  When you start at this facility you generally start as a 3rd shift loader not as a driver, you have to wait for an opening."
good,"Too many directors, managers, and the like with differering expectations"
good,"working with this company was hard work, but i am athletic big guy that can handle it. it was a fast paced enviroment that i caught on to very fast. "
good,"I sorted gas cylinders on loading dock,cleaned medical oxygen cylinders,unloaded cylinders onto dock,maintained upkeep of dock"
good,It was good physical work which really takes place of a work-out.
good,"Overall good place to work. As anything else in life, it is what you make it."
good,This was my first accounting position that allowed me to develop some of the skills I have today (such as multi tasking and organization). Enjoyed working with the people in the field and providing support in their review of financials
good,Airgas is a great company as a whole. It has been a bit challenging as the primary product that we have been selling has a global shortage. This will soon be lifted and it should get better.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"A typical day at work involves many different things. I could work on quotations/RFQ""s, logistics of cylinder gases to manage inventory, calculate min/max levels for the regional companies for our national customers. I get involved with customer issues including bulk gases, industrial gases, speciality gases and welding hard good consumables. I have learned to work with various members of the national team force as well as your co-workers. My co workers where I am currently at are very indepedent as well, but often lean on mean for my technical expertise and background. The hardest part of the job is making sure the customer is satisfied with everything I have done from orders, bids, production, distribution and customer service. Commmunication is very important when dealing with national million dollar customers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be dealing with so many different facets of the company and dealing with third party vendors,distributers, integretors, and aggragators. Also making the customer and regional branches and regional sales force happy."
good,This is a fortune 500 company publicly traded on the stock market. A normal day here can be very exciting based on the customer base that you deal with. There is a lot to be learned if you're looking to pursue a career in the welding industry. Management seems to last quite a while in their respected positions keeping the turn over rate minimal.The peers that you're surrounded with range from newbies to 30+ year veterans in the industry. Dealing with a wide variety of customers can be both good and bad everyday can bring a challenge. That is why we enjoy what we do being in a customer service based environment the challenges keep us improving our customer service skills.
good,"Office culture has no idea what goes on outside in the field which drives their jobs."
good,"Company grew through over 400 acquisitions"
good,The manager at the time tried to fire me several times she was rude and and harassing didn’t know her job very well and tried to tell me how to do mine even tho she never driven a CDL truck before
good,"Filling gas cylinders for propane."
good,"The pay was good, but I did not agree with how things were run. The pricing strategies didn't make sense for what they wanted to accomplish. Especially since there's several competitors that are willing to promise the world and offer dirt cheap prices to your customers. A lot of good ole boy mentality."
good,Making delivery you learn every day we had safety meeting once a month so we learned in the meeting also   Managers under the gun all the time to produce so it makes for a bad invirament
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with employees who worried more about others than taking care of the customers.  Management seemed to overlook.  The ones who truly care for the company are the ones who seem to suffer
good,"Airgas is a very fast growing company. The employee are split on how they feel about the workplace culture and management. Some employee love it and some hate it, but that is with any company."
good,"The Acquisition Team was an Amazing group of professionals. We all put in long, tedious hours to accomplish an impossible task. Not once was I ever treated with disrespect, although, I am sure, I tested their tolerance. They were eager to share computer skills and short cuts that were essential tools for me moving forward. I enjoyed working with all of the support folks at the BSC in GA. We were all dedicated to exceptional Customer Service. Airgas has computer technology second to none -- really awesome tools to micromanage every aspect of their business. I appreciated the opportunities to learn about updates in technology. That was rewarding as I realized the benefits in cost savings, time management, and service to our customers.  Upper management totally driven by profits and revenues. Branch Managers must don their ""thick skin"" when confronting them with Customer Service issues. I Loved working with my Branch Manager. She was an excellent team leader, trainer, mentor. And shielded me from the harshness of upper management."
good,Airgas is a good company to work for. They focus on building a strong customer relationship. It is a good place to work but they are not very competitive with pay.
good,"Stock option were outstanding and added up quickly, benefits were good as well, health care, eye, dental, vision, 401K, work load could get hectic at times but always got it done"
good,Good place to work if you have benefits already. Good place to work for if you’re young and willing to spend a lot of hours away from home and travel. I just wish they would give employees benifits
good,If possible I would work there again.  I worked a week and a whole 12 hours a day but I didn't receive the correct pay.  My check only end up being a little less than three hundred dollars.   No one could explain why.
good,"I enjoyed working at Airgas, I would still be there except for difference of opinion with management. I would work for Airgas again only at a different location. The company itself was a great place to work. I received a lot of knowledge about the welding, medical and safety areas of this companies field of work."
good,"very solid work and plenty of hrs if desired . I personally would enjoy weekends off at almost 12yrs of employment ,thus creating my desire to search for my needs and my family needs . I enjoy my work and do take my work serious and the professional attitude in dealing our customers."
good,"Now we are truely lead by the numbers. I have been apart of building a team that has been more than productive only to live, daily, in fear that I am going to have to cut them in order to make a bonus. Good people, terribly managed."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Overall working at Airgas On-site Safety was good. I enjoyed my co-workers. Airgas was always good to me and I learned a lot. On the down side overall communication is not a company strong point. However, the benefits are good."
good,"I enjoyed working at Airgas. I got to see many different businesses all over Southern California, including San Onfre Nuclear Power Plant. I ultimately left to finish my education. "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, but you work a route on a schedule so it becomes routine.  I learned a great deal about working with different type of gases & bottles.  The hardest part of the job was lifting bottles and loading your truck for daily deliveries, but I enjoyed the interactions with the clientele."
good,I have learned a lot at Airgas.  There isn't much room for growth once you get to a certain level - unless you want upper management. I have outgrown my stay here.
good,Lots of training but once that was done I feel that they put me in a position that I could not thrive in. Branch level there is a lot of butting of heads that makes me not want to be there. Overall not a bad place to work but maybe just in the wrong position
good,Was a good company to work for until bought out by new company.  Production line.  Quotas.  Poor communication between management and production workers.
good,more pros than cons. they are worried to much about overtime instead of taking care of the customer.no real incentives.
good,Can't keep people and upper management is distant and difficult. I don't like the culture of the company. Airgas needs to improve in these areas.
good,"I was only employed here as a temp for two months. While I was there, the coworkers and management were good. I only took orders for this company as this was a temp posititon"
good,Fast paced and dynamic culture.  A good place to learn the medical gas business and develop the skills required for national account sales.
good,"the people are great, but micro management causes high turnover."
good,I have learned so much over the coarse of 3 years working in the welding supply business. There is never a dull day working with my customer base. My co-workers are so helpful with each other. We all get along great and help make the day go better. I enjoys learning all my customer needs and there business.
good,"Manage and support 5 branch locations across National Welders through customer service in identifying and resolving problems and issues to ensure top level customer experience. Responsible for personal portfolio of over 2,000 customers with monthly accounts receivable of almost 1.8M. Accountable to ensure company goal of 8% 60 day ageing. Make credit based decisions that acknowledge both maximum revenue collections while simultaneously maximizing company gross sales."
good,"Fast paced, chance to advance if you learn and work hard, endless possibilities for growth and knowledge, the welding world is vast and very in-depth, learning never stops. Lots of old leadership left over from acquisitions that are stagnating progress, corporate offices out of touch with those in the trenches (SOP)"
good,"the job was ok, but the location was awful."
good,"At Airgas i did everything from running safety meetings to answering customer concerns to scheduling, also all day to day safty operations in the field"
good,"fast paced distribution, high turn over in sales, warehouse is improving"
good,Good company good benefits paid holidays great co-workers
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Airgas is a very fast paced environment and has become very demanding.  A typical day can consist of several different aspects.  One minute I can be at a sales call with a customer, the next minute in a branch dealing with an employee issue, and an hour later handling a compliance or safety issue. My employees and I work well together, my co-workers are in other geographic areas but we work well together if the issue encompasses both of our districts.  We travel at least twice a month for regional sales or training meetings and interact with each other.  The best part of my job is my interaction with the customers that I have known for over 10 years.  I enjoy working with them and they have confidence in me, and know that I am selling products that they need at a competitive price. I also, enjoy the challenge of running a successful business unit and working to improve and set new goals for my self. "
good,Started as driver for 4yrs and went to inside sales. Never got raise for doing sales after a yr. Gave up on company. Once gave notice they decided to offer me a raise. I turned it down  and found another job. 
good,Really not to much to its a great company to work for. I had a really nice time and experience while I was there. The people are sometimes nice. The benefits was great.!
good,"Start your day by logging into Shoretell and starting you phone log, start making outbound calls to get orders, do quotes, take inbound calls, get orders, do quotes and try to make your monthly goals."
good,"All the people I worked with were great on a worker level. When it came to management the plant managers ran all over the higher up managers. For example, in the Tampa plant the manager comes into work at 8am or after and is out by 1pm to go drinking not good management there. Management talks to you like you are stupid. now don't get me wrong some managers are awesome and would walk to the ends of the earth with them. All in all a good place to work."
good,"Like any company, the slackers get the gravy days and the hardworking folks get the hard days.Can be challenging with repetitive motion of moving cylinders and liquids that can weigh up to 900 pounds. Management could be better and morale would improve,recently bought out and they are cheap! But reasonable pay and good benefits"
good,"Very Physical work"
good,"Airgas USA LLC "
good,A lot of good people at Airgas and competitive wages. A very big company with some very good people working there. Enjoyed working at Airgas but would like more options to advance in the company.
good,I enjoyed the interaction with the customers. learning a new trade while working was great. learned plenty working for Airgas met many friends in the industry. no complains. the only downfall is that if a particular person don't like you and he's in the operations manager you get framed for what he is doing....
good,My coworkers were great! A lot of great relationships. Hard workers that you can depend on in a crunch. I really do miss the work culture. Not a lot of room to grow in the company though.
good,as long as you follow the rules you have a good career. there is a lot of room for advancement. after  one year of employment at airgas you are eligible to post out.
good,"When I first started there, I really enjoyed it. The job itself was easy and everything we advanced to we were properly trained. It was a great company to work for."
good,"Not Good Staff, most of staff was great but one staff member was really bad. He made the work place environment very difficult was demoted but still made it difficult to work there."
good,tend to micromanage the inside sales associates inside sales is a very hard position there they require almost unattainable goals
good,Supportive management and always willing to give training around be involved in all task. Turn over rate was low and very good benefits. Receiving lead was a job that required detailed attention on every task also being open to move to different areas of the warehouse to fill certain roles.
good,A lot of cold calls 75 and 150 min on average trying to get new customers and maintain current ones.  Hard to keep that level up everyday.  I have exceeded my goals every month since I have been there.  Enjoy my coworkers and talking to customers.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"I enjoy driving for a living, and I take pride in working hard and servicing our customers.   I begin work at 6:00 am and work a full day each day.  I follow the rules set forth by management, work well with my co-workers in servicing the customer."
good,I enjoyed the experience this company provided me but it was highly unorganized and left little to no room for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work for me includes cold calling, service, prospecting, assisting customers at the branch as needed, resolving AR issues."
good,"Great benefits, growth is minimal in GA office."
good,"This was a job that allowed me to learn about the gas business and how to identify the different types of gases and liquids. Very informative to life, in the event of handling gas cylinders for which ever purpose. Riding on the road and seeing any tanker truck, im able to identify the DOT regulated labels on products being shipped."
good,I am an experienced delivery driver of 20+ yrs. Airgas is over stepping their boundaries with this drive cam invasion of privacy and confidence in me.
good,"I have a stable job with good benefits. There would be no pay if it was something you liked doing. You get paid to do your job, and if you do your job at Airgas, the job is stable."
good,Cool job nice co workers and management good work hours and home life good pay and overtime good trucks to drive close commute from home to job good  benefits...
good,"Started out great, if you are a temp you can only work forty hours. NO OVERTIME. 40.01 denied. Loved my boss very laid back. Then transferred to Disputes and Resolution new boss is a micro manager. I was told by other co workers that they wouldn't recommend working there."
good,"No shifts or weekends. Very flexible schedule. You don't really get raises. Seems to be a very top heavy company. Many times, up to 10 people telling 3 people what to do."
good,"for someone not knowing about the different kind of gass, it was hard for me . the hours were great. enjoyed weekends off. boss was nice and understanding ."
good,"Airgas has an excellent safety culture. They provide proper training for every job task, they hold weekly stand down safety meetings, plus daily tailgate meetings. Airgas has a divers customer base, not only to they provide services for the Oil and Gas Industry they also provide services to the Medical, Dental, and Food Industries."
good,"Airgas allows employees to work independently. I have learned new AP applications such as SAP and Open text. There is tension between management which prohibits individual growth, The option for flex time has been very beneficial.The most difficult part of the job is the favoritism displayed by the management of my department."
good,"Loading and delivering gas bottles."
good,"(back when AirGas Canada was bought out by AirGas USA, prior to AirGas Air Liquide) Guys were awesome to work for.  Managed ourselves for three months after manager quit. The new manager which eventually took over the role was an awesome guy.  Employees in crucial positions were never replaced once they left the company.  Moral was low because of wage decrease.  Actions of refusing to authorize purchasing of needed parts to maintain equipment and reluctance to hire people were suspect of head office attempting to ruin the company from within.  After I left, the place I worked was quickly closed and my old job was outsourced, likely for reasons ""hard times"", but I know it was engineered as the guy making decisions admitted that he hated our line of business.  Really sad to see they were sold off, but Air Liquide is a awesome company and means that there were likely improvements after I left.  I miss working there as I really enjoyed the job as a fill tech. I would entertain giving these guys another try for employment but cannot recommend them as I am no longer familiar with their operations after the changeover of hands."
good,"Most days you work 10 to 11 hours. Overtime without any warning, very hard to plan time outside of work.  Very Hard to advance in the warehouse, however there are many other avenues to explore within the company."
good,long days alot about the gas industry bad boss some of the workers were ok the hardest part of the job was going there the most enjoyable part was leaving
good,"they will enforce safety and there is advancement, if you are apart of the good ole boy network.  it is a good safe company but now all branches are willing to advance you. plus when it comes to race issues they take their time handling them. you definitely have to get you lipstick out and your nose ready to get anywhere here."
good,"I'm just looking to grow.Duties"
good,Professional management sought to develop employees. In this position
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Great work environment. Everyone has individual stores assigned to them, but we also work as a team. This is the place where I learned how to be a  a better team player and it has been really been quite enjoyable to work for."
good,Airgas is a strong productive company. You can count the company growing for a lot more years to come. They have a great 401k plan and other benefits. Not really a lot of room for growth within the company in particular departments.
good,"good workplace but the pay is a little low, management lets you work, co-workers are very nice and helpful"
good,Very hard worker I got employee of the month I've been offered production driver manager positions but wasn't interested in them yeah once I get my job down I try to give it 100% and very safe coordinator because we're going with Airgas definitely be safe
good,A typical day at work includes working together as a team getting the orders out for the day. I learn many new things such as: using different tools and machinery and I receive feedback that helps improve performance. The workplace culture is neutral and the management could be more helpful. The hardest part of the job is lack of communication. The most enjoyable part is when the work runs smoothly and everyone can work together.
good,"The company is good, but has had some set backs with billing and other issues with customers.  There has been issues with equipment being outdated and the business is very saturated with competition.  Since the oilfield market has had a downturn, opportunity is becoming very limited as far as sales opportunities."
good,Fun working with customers. Good learning job and room to grow. One of the best places I've worked for. If u like  exercising this is the place for you.
good,"enjoyed my time with the company however, at my age its time change. working 13 hours day just doesn't cut it anymore. i enjoy working but just can't work the long hours anymore. i want to work locally or within a regional."
good,The company was moving the Accounts Payable department out west. The assignment was to help them keep up.
good,"*All hours"
good,Long hours and MGMT was never satisfied with the results. If harassing employees benefits the bottom line they will be profitable in the Denver office.
good,"Was a good job, not a lot of compensation or advancement, but overall a good career path. Good management, and greatworkers, lots of product training."
good,"Great company, good benefits.job security. Days go by quickly."
good,"early mornings, spend time waiting for truck to be finish loading "
good,Its ok but you will work midnight shift for your entire time there. Its a little dirty but you can make your own schedule of whatyou want to do during your work night.
good,"The typical day at work is busy. Always something to do and never bored. The work environment is great. There are a lot of good, knowledgeable individuals working for this company and they are always willing to help. The hardest part of my job would be during the end of the month because there are always very strict deadlines that need to be met before the beginning of each new month. The most enjoyable part about my job would have to be the interaction with my coworkers and management. It really is a great place to work."
good,Good company to work for. They treat you decent. It is a big company so communication amongst employees can get missed sometimes. There are many different divisions and opportunities at Airgas.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Driven to achieve company goals. Comply with all national and state regulations including FDA OSHA. Very difficult to get your hours changed with management
good,"very stressed filled job with focus to push hard to produce products and deliver on demand and solve customer issues. depending on management can be relaxed and fun filled job but still focused on being ahead in the plant, delivering product before the customer  is out and getting things in asap."
good,Started off rough during the first week when my boss berated other employees in front of me and behind their back.  There wasn't a conversation that we had that did not evolve into some kind of religious lesson.  I could have went to HR but that's not my style.  The company was purchased by Air Liquide that brought a sense of uncertainty to everyone involved.  Territory doubled with no increase in compensation with a higher call of travel.  I decided at that time it was time to go.
good,"I enjoy my work schedule. The skills aquired have been rewarding. The location is convenient to where i live, stress free commute."
good,"I have had a great career at Airgas. I really don't want to criticize the recent management changes that were made when Airgas created the Gulf Coast Region, but let's say it just wasn't the best decision by Airgas. The employees I worked with were phenomenal. Very dedicated and ambitious. I have done many jobs at Airgas, so for me, there really wasn't any hard part of any particular job. The best part of the job is meeting new people everyday and helping the customers solve their issues, complaints and inquiries."
good,Airgas is a growing company and it is awesome that it has allowed me to be so close to my home and children. They have experienced a lot of growing pains with changing thier direction within the last couple of years. But overall it is a good company.
good,"great company to work for, one of the best safety mangers I ever had the pleasure working with, "
good,work day starts at 6a.m until... poor front desk disipline...lack of organization..
good,"There were constant changes to the way processes were done. Which resulted in  people doing the same thing multiple ways, and conctantly having to update ptocedures."
good,the Store Manager was very unorganized and very hyper. I was not told I would be driving over 2 hrs away to make my deliveries and was constantly driving over allotted hours according to DOT rules and regulations
good,"It's a good job and I would work there again, but they do need to touch up a few things to make the work environment more  proficient for daily operations."
good,"Airgas took care of me for many years, and paid me enough to take care of my family.  But there at a point with Airgas you hit the roof and you cant advance anymore"
good,"Like I said, it's overall a good place to work.  There is a lot of turnover in Management.  They are a huge corporation and things change and people come and go all the time."
good,You work long hours and if you are salary there is no other compensation offered to offset all the hours you are working.  Management keeps the employees in the dark regarding major changes until the last minute.  There is very low employee morale.
good,I was in constant contact with customers offering new products to help their bottom line. Airgas has an extensive product line with great value to customers.
good,They are resistant against change.  They dont embrace it like they should.  The management is micromanagement.  They do have fun filled fridays where they cater food and bring in events.
good,not a place i would send my life working at. not a very good environment and i had to leave spent most of my time grinding for a means to an end i would not suggest someone who is looking for a career end up here good for college kids though
good,This would easily be the best job I've ever had if wasn't  for the poor upper mgt . they don't have a clue !  no matter how hard you work it will never be good enuff . I work with some of the best drivers and inside sales people i've ever had the pleasure of working with.  this could be a great job and a great place to work if only the people who are in charge would would appreciate what we do every day . they need to start focusing on keeping  there employees happy instead of maximizing their profits.  Happy employees   are the key to maximizing profits
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Great company to have been a part of. I grew as the company grew. We were mavericks in the industry, which resulted into market share into whatever we tried. The later years the top managements philosophy changed. They are moving more towards internet based sales and away from the sales rep. with inside customer service support. Most of the original experienced people have either left the company or have been let go. Newer, younger, inexperienced people have taken their place. Training to only what they need to know for now."
good,I like Airgas and the stability it provides. I wish their was more chance for advancement for Drivers.
good,A typical workday usually meant getting to the job on time and focussing on the job at hand until time for a break. Not much personal interaction. There were many little tweaks to the normal flow of processes that made it a bit interesting. The training was not standardized and was mainly over the shoulder learning in my department.
good,"Airgas was a company that was willing to train new employees in different fields without prior experience.  The pay wasn't very high; however, the on-the-job training supplemented the lack of pay."
good,"Office/Shop hours were generally consistent flowing through an 8 hour workday(40hours/week) depending on your work scope and responsibilities."
good,"Good company, good team. Training was thorough, and everyone is given the ability to show what they're capable of. Some aspects needed extra attention, and some negatives were overlooked."
good,My time there has been very good and enjoyable. I have learned and grown as a professional and received updated training. My benefits and compensation are fair and competitive.
good,"Professional office environment, good people and tight knit group. Benefits are decent. They try to make it fun and do group activities. Not a bad place to work."
good,"Good work life balance, training in SAP, good pay, good benefits, great co workers, need to be proficient in Excel, attention to detail is a must, overall a good place."
good,It's okay place to work. Its a job not a career. Their is no hope of moving up in the company  and that is why I am looking for something else. I was told that I would be promoted to outside sales within the first year and that has not happened. I like Airgas and was hoping to retire from there but I just don't see that happening.
good,"Pleasant Atmosphere, some areas are more supportive than others, could be more diversified. Has undergone changes since the buy out of company to Air Liquide"
good,"Great company, considering the reputation. They're a bit too fussed on top-line sales, but they do a good job of taking feedback from their employees."
good,"Extensive training provided both initially and ongoing to assist in understanding the services  and products available. "
good,You get what you put in to this company. Safety oriented with room to advance. Must be able to multitask. Warm in the summer and cool in the winter but overall a good place to work.
good,"Company has been In business since 1982. We were obtained by Air Liquide on 2016.  The pay is EXCELLANT.  Expect to work weekends, most holidays, and nights when you first start. The shifts are based on SENIORITY. Here at this terminal we bid for shifts every six months. That was just changed from having tonhid yearly. There is a lot to do in this type of industry. We load, unload our product at various industries, hospitals and others."
good,Over the past ten years I've learned so much at Airgas.  I didn't mind the long commute to Lawrenceville from Decatur but now it has become a little too much.  Airgas is a great place to work unfortunately I don't live in Lawrenceville and don't plan on moving there.
good,"Good employees, good product, new management that was weak, we hit our bonus the only times when they were looking for a manager. New management and newest employees were let go."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,A good company to start a career with. Promotions / Wages could be more competitive. Management has a good open door policy. Great set of people to work with.
good,This company is a great company to work for and I very much enjoy working at this company. I would recommend this company as a great company to work for.
good,"If you like production facilities, it is a good job. You go to work, do your job, and hang out once in awhile.  There is steady work that can be pretty easy, unless it gets busy, but it is not bad at all."
good,Airgas is an amazing atmosphere as long as you can adhere and enjoy the micromanagement in order to get better. all things are watched and managed in order to maximize productivity.
good,The work is easy enough and manageable. The people are friendly at the CSR level. Management plays favorites and does not always communicate well. Discrimination is allowed and HR does nothing to support employees
good,"Field service technician role is very independent with a high level of responsibility, yet is one member of a team of associates that work together to make a project happen.  Good teamwork and communication."
good,"I enjoyed my time with my company and the customers I came into contact with. Being a small center in this community allowed me the opportunity to develop a personal relationship with many of the customers which led to more confidence in our industry and a higher desire to deal with me, not only personally, but with the company itself. "
good,"Extremely important job delivering gas products that improve, save and enhance life. Very detail oriented and a dedicated work ethic is required. Very physical job moving cylinders. Other divisions do not coordinate well with each other resulting in individual distriution plants having to scramble to provide customers with the required products on time and in the proper quantities."
good,"I mobilized on 11/7/16. My electrical and instrument contractor a week later. The work schedule was 5 ten hour days. Started setting 15kv and 480v switchgear, running cable tray and conduit, installing instruments, and pulling and terminating cable. The pace quickly ramped up to 7 twelve hour days."
good,"Average day is spent working with account managers and directly with customer from varying professions, from industrial to medical."
good,"good opportunity, get it done in 8 hours and go home.  Decent salary for the area.  Location is decent as well.  Holy cow, how many more words you want?"
good,"Just like with any sales job, if you work hard you will be noticed with a good manager. Great pay and benefits and great training as well. Duluth, GA location did have a culture problem in it. Very immature co-workers (not all of them)."
good,It was a great place to work for students. They had reasonable pay and they had flexible time to work which goes well with students.
good,"Airgas is a good company that is aggressive and strives to differentiate itself from the competition. Goals are aggressive. Unless you move, there isn't much advancement and the mashing of many companies does create some cliques in the management."
good,arrived at work and usually knew in general what was expected. Coworkers were helpful. The management could have probably cared a little more about helping. The hardest part of the job was that there wasn't enough time to finish some days.
good,"Airgas is a national, progressive, growth oriented, daily sales organization, built by acquisition to service a vast portfolio of customers with a wide variety of products, distributed and managed locally, to provide up and close and personal customer service."
good,This company runs lean and efficiently.  It is a challenging environment that demands quality work from every employee.  There are many opportunities to learn here.  You can find support and strong mentors but you need to be prepared to contribute.
good,"Various customer orders need to be filled throughout the day/night "
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Good place to work with great people to work with. No room to grow as far as careers go. Most employees are at or above 20 year seniority.
good,It was good I didn't like having to call somone about their account but had a good  relationship with them they knew it was part of my job and try helping them .
good,"Overall, Airgas, is a good, stable company to work for.  The hours are great, the pay is competitive and the benefits are a plus."
good,A typical day was extremely busy processing payments to accounts.  I found that I could learn new things and excel at them.  Management was very hands on and helpful.  My co-workers were very friendly and dependable employees.  The hardest part of the job was getting caught up on accounts.  I enjoyed all aspects of my day.
good,Solid company with a lot to offer.  Very good values and good people within company.  Company is secure with lots of good values. Pay is lower than most but there are other great benefits.
good,"Jefferson, Ga. Well run company. Respectful coworkers. Willing t help with problems. Safety is paramount. Good equipment. Inclusive work environment."
good,Management is clueless about day-to-day duties. The best candidates are not promoted because upper management is intimidated.
good,I learned many management skills with Airgas.  The company offered many opportunities to promote within.  Although Airgas does not pay  what employees are worth they do offer a descent benefit package.
good,"mainly just processing invoices.  very busy management was okay.  "
good,A typical day consisted of packaging dry ice im a controlled system lifting 50to 75 lbs working in extremely cold and clean work area being safe with freezing ice and operate forklift I enjoyed all aspectsof the job
good,"Loved the job and was a fun place to work,  Loved working with customers everyday and having that personal contact with them."
good,Consisted of collections of  business accounts that surpassed One million dollars. Updated the daily log to and implementing changes or applying credits to the customer accounts.
good,"At Airgas they provided a lot of training for a field in which most people would not normally have any experience in. They were a good company to work for, unfortunately they lost a huge contract in the Buffalo area."
good,Airgas is a stable place of employment and the hours and pay are easy to live with. Most of the employees are friendly and willing to help when ever possible.
good,"Constantly busy delivering and picking up cylinders."
good,same review as IPCO Safety as Airgas purchased IPCO Safety and the position and company remained relatively unchanged.
good,"Typical workday: Daily operations of warehouse to include forklift operations, shipping and receiving."
good,Always a new challenge due to the every changing environment.
good,My typical day was sitting infront of the computer doing reports. My co-workers were friendly and Professional. Creating IQ reports for multiple people
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,In the beginning there was educated and respectful management and life was great.  At some point that quickly changed. Regional and branch management continually broke safety rules in order to get it done. They put me on a Personal Improvement Plan to force me out. I retained everything in the PIP and they couldn’t kick me out. When Regional management gave me unattainable goals I found other employment.
good,"Management needs to be improved at company level, and "
good,"Great flexible schedule"
good,"Tried to stay with company when I moved to another State, had to go through hiring process and I wasn't hired  for the job because the relocation process of moving to another district."
good,"Good place to work, but little opportunity for advancement.  Strong safety culture which is nice.  Benefits are terrible for a company this size.  Family medical and dental plan is $800 per month."
good,"At first, I liked working here but now it has become a hassle.  I am trying to relocate and finding it very hard to do so within the company.  Most of the time I feel my best isn't good enough.  They work me like a slave child and will not reward me for my hard work."
good,"I love working for Airgas. I love the job that I have and  the for the most part the people that I work with. When I started in 2015, I had no idea how much I would learn. I was taught everything that I know today. At that time my supervisor saw more in me than I thought and was able to take my previous skill sets and integrate them with the programs and processes to become an asset to her team. I will always be grateful for the opportunities that have molded me into my current position with Airgas.  "
good,I like my job here. But I am always looking for bigger and better opportunities. In Order to move up in this company i have to be willing to relocate anywhere or travel and a consistent basis. These are things im just not interested in.
good,"Good Job. Always an adventure. Every branch with Airgas has different pros and cons, so I can't really give a proper review. Benefits were good for my family needs."
good,"Want to cut your teeth in the industry or sales, work at Airgas. You get to work with really fun people.  Some top level managers make it their mission to treat employees like the children they never had.  Otherwise, you learn a lot and will make a nice paycheck.  Lots of potential if you are good at playing the political game or are the beneficiary of extended nepotism.  Be young and move state to state, this is the best way to move up the corporate ladder."
good,good place to work. They are very lean and expect you to do as much as possible. Will ring you out but if you put in the work they will invest in you.
good,A typical work day at Airgas is very fast pace ad busy. The work load is very heavy and demanding. The hardest part of the day is balancing your day.  Management at Airgas is very structural.
good,"The everyday staff was great to work with.. A cast of characters for the ages and an absolute pleasure. Management had their up and down days but hey that goes with the job. When the company was bought out and new management was brought in is when things started to go sour."
good,The branch of Airgas that I work within is a rather relaxed environment.  It is also very random at times.  Typically we handle the same job tasks day to day and everyone gets along pretty good.  Sometimes the management team can be a little hard to cope with.
good,"Was part of the buy out and was treated like a second class employee. Company OK but needs betters structure, the old time folks are bitter and negative, has a profound impact on the attitude of all."
good,"Good place to work for , the benefits are very good,  coworkers are really good people,  management are ok, lots of overtime, good pay, flexible hours."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,It’s a good place to work but it is hard to receive salary increases When you move to a new department it is usually a lateral move which makes it hard to advance but they do pay for advancement through education.
good,this is a good place to work for the most part.  I have been here for 21 years and the thought of leaving the company is a hard decision to make.  the company is good to the military.
good,The lowest paying industrial gas company by far. Good place to get your feet wet in the industrial gas world though. Their business approach to the market is also very good compare to their competitors.
good,Working in the IT field at this company has been a real challenge since most of the management staff is used to manual processes. It is difficult to introduce the company to new technology when they are not technology driven.
good,"Good benefits, great coworkers, management is underwhelming, advancement options. Outside work doesnt stop unless there is lightning in the area......."
good,"I worked for several micro managers in my 10 years there."
good,"Working at Airgas has been very positive. Some of the benefits include;working in a fast paced, friendly environment. In addition there are many employment opportunities as well as training options."
good,"On a typical day you would work to take care of customers needs and schedule meetings.  Was taught P&L, budgeting and route planning.  Management seemed to be losing sight of what built the company to what it had become when I left.  Hardest part about working for the company was dealing with the changing management  and lack of direction.  Best part of the job was working with the people and the customers."
good,"I have been here for some time now, and have seen several changes, some good and some not so good. They provide cell phones to each employee to use as a personal phone. Home every weekend is always a plus for the drivers."
good,Hard to balance work and home life because of long hours. Good benefits and generally care about employees. You're not just a number. Some opportunity for advancement
good,"I loved my job, it was a nice place to end my Full Time Career.  I enjoyed working with the excellent staff.  Some of the Best Supervisors I have ever worked for.  I miss working there already."
good,"The days may very.  I could be on site doing consulting or on a project supervising other safety coordinators or confine space attendants.  The other days may be in the training facility instructing classes on MSHA, OSHA, Fall Protection, CPR/First Aid.  Or many other classes.  If there is nothing scheduled then I would be on sales calls to build the business."
good,A sense of belonging.  Employees really seem to get along with each other.  I would go back to work for this company of they hadn't moved the position across country.
good,Great company with a tremendous upside. Nice working environment and very peaceful. I was responsible for ensuring financial goals were met and that all accounts were in good standing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the close kinship built with several coworkers.
good,"This culture was like the Old West - you could do pretty much anything - as long as you kept your managers in the loop.  Airgas is a great company where you can climb to whatever level you want, BUT where your career can come to a sudden halt if you cross the wrong political lines."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Airgas was a very complex job, you had to learn so much about safety materials and products, but once you learned you would have an outstanding understand of many aspect of safety gear and materials"
good,"A typically work day starts early getting everything in order to go for the drivers once the day officially begins; orders printed, inventory pulled, deliveries scheduled.  After that there are a series of reports to run and complete throughout the day while answering phones, helping customers and dealing with inventory.  It is exciting working with the public to achieve their goals.  I always enjoy talking to people about their interests and ongoing projects.  The vast majority of people are thankful and reasonable to deal with but on occasion there will be someone or some situation that requires more than we can provide and must be turned down or redirected.  As a manager I have learned to prioritize between what needs to be done and what must be done.  My relationship between drivers and upper management has always been good yet my experiences in this position has made me better able to communicate my goals and expectations in both directions.  We have a good time while still  getting the job done."
good,"Great place to work and excellent pay and benefits. I really loved the customers on my dedicated  route.They became like friends or family."
good,"Very good place to learn"
good,I filled hydrogen cylanders.  Had to make sure co-workers were safe and the product was safe.
good,"Airgas is a great company.  I would have remained there, but the company restructured and my position was relocated to Ohio."
good,"This is a great job, you just have to be careful and keep your subordinates careful."
good,its been a great exeerience.driving long days and the customer service you provide is a cut above the rest.
good,A day at Airgas consist of making 70 out/inbound calls that are purposeful for prospective customers. Definitely organization and time management are the biggest lessons learned from this organization. the You have several responsibilities. In order to meet daily goals and objectives you have to be organized in order to do so effectively. Positive and encouraging work environment was shared among my former co-workers. The hardest part of the job was sitting for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of this job is actually assisting the safety of a company's employees.
good,"Typical Day - traveling to different locations, training employess in the SAP computer system."
good,"Delivering hazardous material was the job here, weighing from 5lbs to 380 lbs delivering in a daily routine route, getting to learn about different gases , liquids and gas mixtures was cool know the difference between an oxidizer and a medical grade gas."
good,My main problem is getting laid off and the company not finding work closer to ne.
good,Working for Airgas is relaxed.  Do your job and go home.  Employee attitudes could be better.  Management could be better but could be much worse.  Work/life balance is great.  Nights and weekends off.
good,"The SAP computer system, there was always something new to learn.  I was always eager to learn another area and sought after more knowledge.   Once the company grew very large it seemed that departments were further apart.  My counter parts across the country were never on the same page.  We worked with the same programs but worked with different policy and procedures.  We always asked if we could have web meetings to review procedures but never was able to get it to happen."
good,"I enjoy working at Airgas and I'm proud to be a team member of our company. The only issue that comes to mind is the strict scheduling which makes balancing other responsibilities difficult. The management is very effective, professional, and serious about their employees safety. I'm greatful for my job at Airgas and for the opportunity to work with such fantastic people."
good,"Enjoyed working there for 5 years."
good,I had no issues there. My boss was great to work for. Their safety dept can be overbearing at times. Overall not a bad place to work. I only left because I was recruited by another company offering more money. I would recommend airgas to any drivers
good,Airgas is a good place to work for. It’s just that I had  had trouble getting my pay where I needed to be. But I would work there again if they would consider updating the pay.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,A good place that also has a positive work environment.  the company put a lot of focus in and cares about the employees.  but lacks in career development.
good,"meet in the morning with the team, go over what was expected for that day. Come up with a smart game plan, keep communication open so we can get the job done and put out unexpected fires. meet up, if necessary, to prep for the following day. discuss other ideas to make everyone's job easier. One of the most difficult things about the job if we are down a man or two and a bunch of things come up unplanned. The easiest part of the job is when were ahaead of the driver and waiting on the last bit of the day's work."
good,"Good Benefits, could use better Management participation and coaching to help with your daily goals. Needs Management support and involvement in a positive way, you heard from them in a negative way consistently and rarely in a positive way."
good,Great company with benefits. Allow you to use the tuition reimbursement program to Accel in your profession. Gave you the skills and experience to do your job and then some. Lots of opportunities to climb up the chain.
good,Great place to work with some issues that every plant has every now and then. Small business where you work 6 months out the year and the pay is good. Insurance sucks if you have to put family on.
good,I have only worked @ airgas little less than a year. They have decent benefits they have quiet a few incentives from some of their suppliers. I just wish I could of known this 10 years or so ago.
good,"Lots of driving with this position, I have learned so much in all the years I have worked with the company.  There have been many turn overs.  I enjoy working with the company, but I am looking for changes."
good,"Airgas had two shifts, 7am-7pm and 7pm-7am, i would come in the evening time and get off in the am. The clock in time had to be ten minutes early. Everybody had different stations to cover around the the warehouse. I washed boxes sometimes but mostly take the dry to place into the bag out of the machine."
good,"It’s  consistent job, job security for sure. Always busy, makes the day go by pretty quick. Room for advancement is pretty slim, which can be very frustrating."
good,Not a bad place to work except for poor management. You do work LONG hours at times but the job is a different challenge everyday.  Best part of the job is being out on your own working at your own pace making sure the job gets done. Knowing your customers is the key to the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Fast paced working environment. Opportunity for advancement if willing to work for it. Plenty of opportunities to learn about various different gases and how there used, filled and distributed. Safety is a big emphasis with this employer. Management could use more training on processes and procedures."
good,"Airgas is a great company to work for overall,  the role i worked was inside sale. It is a hard core sales position, had i had a better manager i would still be with the company."
good,I have learned all the different types of gas. Airgas ia a great company to work for and I enjoy meeting new people. It is a great company and the workplace has various cultures
good,This is a good job for someone loooking for a mon to Fri position. It's always steady work with plenty of overtime. The safety culture is great. You don't have to do anything that you feel is unsafe. Managers always have your back when it comes to slowing down and staying safe
good,A good place to sharpen your skills using an SAP- based inventory control system.  Kronos was chosen as the timekeeping software.  Management was tasked with maintaining a high production level.
good,"This place is good place to work, has good work culture,has good management ,has  good work life balance.has good management and good atmosphere for worker."
good,"Management is great. I am there a short time, but like my work environment. Hardest part of this job is working with lazy people. I put my head down and work hard."
good,it was very cold and dangerous place to work get burned by dry ice don't give you the right training to do the job. I would operat a air gas compressourer and wash tubs one man job no coworkers to work with
good,"I processed, packed and labeled highly detailed orders for overseas shipment. I ensured cylinders were appropriately sealed. I filed orders and assisted front office with filing tasks"
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Great company, very expensive health benefits. Some management could use some leadership training and the management team should not be selective or have favorite team members."
good,this company gave me great experience and a lot of training classes as well as hands on training. The staff is great and very friendly
good,Great stable company. Job security is very good even during tough economical times. I enjoyed my time at Airgas. The culture here is older; staff in their mid to late 40's
good,Laid back corporate atmosphere with good pay and benefits. A secure place to work for those looking for such stability.
good,A supportive and productive work environment surrounded by positive and proactive people. I enjoyed an excellent salary and benefit plan and felt that management cared about my efforts .
good,"A typical day at work was to go and pre trip inspection of truck, wait for paperwork load my truck, go on my route come back do my post trip inspection of my truck and end of day paper work. What I learned at AIRGAS was safety rules, different gases, filling pressures of bottles, FDA paperwork, DOT paperwork, parts and supplies, of welding supplies, welding rods , welding wire, safety supplies, management when I first started was great, we all got along we were a team. towards the end of my employment New Management wasn't so great. Didn't want to hear what employees had to say. Didn't want to listen to advise, suggestions, My coworkers we all got along, we would help one another to get our job done, in a safe and  timely manner. I learned the business from being a pumper, counter sales, customer service, FDA paper work that needed to be done, Driving & delivering  hazardous materials to sites, CDL License CLASS B / Hazmat Endorsement. The hardest part of my job was moving the bottles, even with dollies and carts some unsafe delivery sites were hard on the body. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was meeting of customers and know I made a difference in there lives."
good,"It is a fast growing manufacturing multi billion dollar corporation. It has many opportunities if you can work hard and stay focused."
good,"On the road by 7am. Travel to the jobsite and since I was the Field Service Technician I worked alone on a lot of jobs. I had good relationships with my customers. I like a challenge and sometimes when working on older systems I would have to troubleshoot the system to find the problem."
good,the day started by relieving the previous operator and discussing the problems from the previous shift. then you started loading tanker trucks and making adjustments to the plant. filled out paperwork on each load and had driver sign paperwork and made copies for driver.The job was boring at night but great on the day shift. rotated between days and nights.
good,Good company to work with. Stable company. lots of product to represent
good,"I hade two jobs ultrasonic testing, and technician of oxygen concentrators."
good,I strongly develop a relationship with the customer to assure they are getting what they need to finish the job at hand. I strive to deliver and sell each product conducive to each customers needs.
good,"I enjoy my position and am continuing to learn everyday.   I enjoy the people I work with and believe in what I am doing is helping our customers, both internal and external."
good,"Great people good culture I would recommend!"
good,"As a cylinder pick up and delivery driver you can expect to work at least 9-10 hours a day, 10-12 hours if you want the hours. Driver managers and management in general are good. Yard workers and other drivers are like family. Would have stayed longer but I had to relocate and they didn’t have any openings in my area. Spent less than a year there but made friends that will last me a lifetime."
good,I truly enjoy working at Airgas. They really take care of employees by providing great incentives and benefits. Training is always provided to ensure that employees have the tools and skills necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of the company. Airgas is a great place to work.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Airgas provides their teams good opportunities to learn and explore new processes, technologies, and products. It allows you to broaden the solutions that you can offer to customers."
good,"This was a great company and I would've stayed until retirement, however they relocated to New Jersey."
good,"Aon a typical day at airgas its pretty quick paced but has its moments of being laid back as well."
good,Basically doing the same thing everyday some days are more demanding than others but overall its a great place to work with great management that helps throughout the shift in the warehouse.  Everyone gets along and communicates well without any issues hardest part is adjusting to working outside either being cold in the winter or hot in the summer but other than that its a great job.
good,"Overall I have enjoyed working for this company. The office is quite, and relaxed. Co-workers are friendly and easy to work alongside. This is not the best place if you are looking for advancement. Most managers are happy with their roles and are not looking to leave. Since I am in an office environment, we get a paid 15 min break 2x each day. The benefits are good, your typical Healthcare, Dental, Vision, 401K. There's also HSA, and Dependent Care account."
good,"Each day is different and always has a twist in it.  Leadership is good to great.  The interest of the employee is first and foremost, along with safety.  Pretty great culture overall.  Longer days make it a little more stressful, having an easy day once in a while makes up for it."
good,"Great place to learn about business culture. Team can work together, some days can be long due to some turnover. Busy work days must like being fast paced to succeed."
good,"This was a great company to work for minus the constant travel."
good,We all work normal hours.  I learn new things everyday.  Management keeps in touch with all the employees.  Culture is open and the hardest part about the job is not having enough time in the day.  The most enjoyable part is helping other branches to learn.
good,"Fast pace, counter sale, great customer service, Back up driver. When the manager is not here I open and close the store, bank deposit, and help train new employees"
good,"Good company just to many egos when I came to Georgia, upper management had a problem with what I made I guess to many years with the company. for every DM I had that was there issue what I made."
good,"My typical day is printing out spreadsheet timesheets and entering them into a csv file to prepare for processing payroll.  Updating direct deposits and tax information; activating new hires, confirming employee data is correct"
good,Great company to work for! The culture is very laid back making it easy to come to work and be productive. Management is approachable. The work load is very doable. It gets busy during month end but thats typical of any accounting position. Although there isn't much growth opportunity there is a yearly review for pay increases.
good,I was very ill during my time there.  Job security from Corporate was iffy at best.  It was really the management team that i actually worked with on a daily basis that saved me.  This was a fun job with a heavy workload.
good,"My typical day is managing all of our cylinder assets for Midwest region which consists of about 40 locations and almost 1 million assets.  I have gained management skills, customer service skills and leadership skills in the time that I have been with Airgas. I work for a great manager, he supports our decisions and is the AVP of the Operations group.  I enjoy working with most of the people, and make it work with the rest as we need to stay professional and take care of the customer first and foremost.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication and trying to work through that.  The most enjoyable part is the challenge that each and every day brings.  I am never bored and always have something to do."
good,"I was a class A delivery driver of Dry Ice. A typical day consisted of loading/unloading product, driving to and from customers in roughly a 300 mile radius of the branch. Typical day was 10 to 12 hours Mon-Fri. I was home every day. Some drivers on this account had to layover and work weekends. Management was as fair as they could be under the constraints of business. Unfortunately I was let go due to not reporting an incident that seemed minor. I backed over a plastic sign at a truck stop placed behind my truck by an attendant after I fueled the truck and after walking around truck. Also, this company uses DriveCam in their trucks to monitor the activity of there drivers. The camera has a lenses facing the front of vehicle and another facing the inside of cab to view driver activity. Camera records constantly but it only captures and sends audio and video to the company when there is a triggering event such as a hard brake, sudden sharp turn or jolt. This made my job more stressful!"
good,Our day started out with going through our large volume of mail to make sure all of the discounted invoices were entered on time.  I learned how to work with a team and really get things done.  The hardest part of my job was collecting the credit memos for items that were sent and the project or store said they never received.  It was then up to me to take the problem to the purchaser or sales person and they would decide if it was going to be pursued or put down as a write off.  Even though many times the vendor gave proof of delivery.  The most enjoyable part of the job was at the end of the month when we were able to close the month in a positive state.
good,I find it very exciting dealing with cryogenics.. having a liquid that is 3oo degree below zero learning about the physics behind it  The hardest about the job is the demand of 14 hour day 5 days a week every week. Not much time to enjoy family time or doing much else outside of work.
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"A very safety conscience company , training  consistant with ongoing changing business with newest and most effective methology. constant training on customer service awareness. open store and plant for operations, call all employees together for safety meeting prior to work day start, meet and greet public, evaluate employee performance, handle any customer greivance, assist employees in handeling and settleing any disagreements."
good,"An exciting job with an ample amount of opportunities to expand your knowledge and training. Several qualified personnel in management positions with plenty of knowledge to pass on. The hardest part of the job is traveling so often, yet not a major turn off. The most enjoyable part of the job is traveling to different facilities and learning how each one operates."
good,"Outside Sales: Typical day was to call on customers, gain new accounts, and increase sales. I learned a lot about being a professional at Airgas. I still think of the co-workers I had there. I enjoy visiting their stores to buy something."
good,"Diagnose and fix welding equipment."
good,"I started with this company as a graveyard loader. Which is where I loaded all the delivery trucks with filled gas cyliniders following a production schedule. I was then advanced to the swing shift filler where I filled compressed liquid and semi-liquid gas cylinders with a various different types of gases. I enjoyed worrking with my co-workers and management at all times. I didnt like the hours I was working due to the fact that I do have a family and I never had a chance to see them very much. I would have to say there was no hard part of this job, I adapted nicely to all the required duties and I was able to keep up with schedules and production goals on a daily basis. A typical day for me would be to grab the fill sheet ( production schedule/goal) for me for the day. Start the inspection process of all the manifolds and pumps I would be using, grab the correct cylinders for the day, inspect them as I was preparing them to be filled by the proper pumps."
good,I've gained experience working at Airgas. I was there for 10 years however I did not see myself growing there. Management somewhat changed over the years.
good,"Overall a fantastic place to work.  Great employees and super leadership, for the most part.  Just like any large organization, one must take the good with the bad.  Sales people can make quite a bit of money.  The company needs to take a hard look at their salaried employees, do they really get paid enough for all that they do?"
good,Big Company with big comp problems and benefits lots of room for growth for those willing to learn
good,"i start my day out by streching warm up a lil bit really this job requiers you to belimber & prepared .The next thing a maint. tech. does is he preps tools he will need for the day ahead. These are usually hand tools and power tools. At the end of the day, will usually end about 20 minutes early. This gives him time to clean up messes and gather tools. He will also use this time to walk through the wharehouse and see what materials or special tools might be needed for the next day."
good,Un dia tipico en aigas es normal entregas a pacientes atender emergencias. Aprendi a valorar la vida aconocer la importancia de una entrega eficas. La parte mas dificil de mi trabajo es la perdida de un paciente.Lo que mas me gusto es conocer gente humilde amable que tiene cosas para enseñar todos los dias.

good,I would highly recommend this place to work.  Both management and coworkers get along very well. Seems to be a very  respectable and stable work environment.
good,This is a union job good place  to work with great benefits. The work environment is decent you can expect to work very long hours on a average 12-14 5days/wk. The equipment fails often tractor or trailer which gives you a late start on your clock and sometimes leads to laying over. They have a lot of safety rules some are understandable and others are just flat out stupid. Management is ok no jerks  but overall good place to work just those complaints.
good,"it's a relaxed environment to work at.sometimes it picks up pretty fast,it all depends on the area you working at. but other than that its a cool place."
good,they have since been bought out.  I learned a lot there.  at the time management had a good feel to provide tools for customer service.  always felt supported

The people were great, management was great, the pay was great. I wanted to go permanent but there was no position open at the time. I would recommend this place."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,Each day was fairly consistent. The best part of my job were the few supportive co-workers within my group. The worst part was never feeling that I could meet the pace of data entry they required.
good,Results oriented Business Development Professional with demonstrated success in various sales and marketing roles of increasing responsibility. Very high paced
good,"I started out as Inside Sales and was able to take advantage of the company's scholarship assistance program to earn my BS.

Workplace culture was always good spirited. The hardest part of the job was travelling the eastern USA. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining new accounts.
good,"Good company to work for, stable environment, low pressure form management if your in the route driving position. Job requires alot of manual labor for cylinder movement. Must have basic knowledge of tolls and functional working of compressed gas manifolds, basic knowledge of different types of compressed gas and pressures.

good,Work in the lab is fun and exciting. There are about 15 people in the QC Lab.  We run two to three GC instruments each day.  It is really satisfying when you complete and approve your product as ready to ship.

good,"Completely enjoyed working environment and co-workers."
good,"At Airgas work is fun because of the people I work with everyday, I learned alot of stuff about how the process work with Air Separation Unit and how the company handle business. I think the hardest part is when we have to travel for weeks/months and we don't know when are we coming back, we do this because the facility where I work is shutdown because of low demands. The most enjoyable part is the training and learning, everyday you learn different stuff and it doesn't stop which I love. I love and enjoy learning."
good,"I really did not enjoy working here. There was a lot of drama and instead of everyone doing their jobs like they were supposed to including management, they were gossiping about co-workers and causing this workplace to be the worst it could be."

At location, I reload check to see if secured and manifest load. Next, I drive back to my location safely. Back at location co-workers help unload and reload trailer for next day. I've learned that safety 1st. And, I must abide all polices and procedures given. My management gives us goals to reach and sets high standards. The hardest part of the job trying hard to be safe.

good,"Come in at 8:30, Get straight on a lift . Grab crates to put the products in on the pallet and work all the way until 10:20. You get a 10 minute break than the temps come in at 10:30. You have snacks in the cafe you buy etc. Than you go back in to the center and do your job. Somedays it'll be a lot of people there and sometimes on Thursdays to Fridays people take off. So be careful with that, You will over work yourself especially if you're a temp. A lot of the older workers complain a lot and barely do any work. Its rough in there, Just stay to yourself ."
good,Working progress and great place to START with hands-on experience and great leadership.  Fast past environment with knowledgeable employees surrounding
good,Airgas Dry Ice is a very good place to work at while your going to school or getting a degree to do something higher. It’s a very honest work environment.
good,I liked working for Airgas it was a good job. The people I worked with were good to me and the branch manager did an awesome job keeping everything running smoothly
good,"You can a lot out of it if you want to, just got to get to know a lot of people and keep yourself informed of the advancement opportunities online (no one will do it for you)."
good,"Managed 15 Fire Technicians daily activities.  Through them, I learned a lot about the fire protection industry in general and about pre-engineered systems in general.  It was a fast paced but fair work environment with solid support from the management team.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things in this industry and collaborating with Fire Technicians that became my friends over the next 12 years."
good,"Company has good pay and time off. Benefits are great, there is not alot of room for advancement at the company."
good,A comfortable place to work with the understanding that safety comes before customer service.  A person with this mindset will flourish within the company.  Vehicles and facilities were well maintained.  Personal issues were discussed and flexibility was given when available.
good,"Been there for 10 years. The people are great and I really enjoy working there. The company provides good equipment, training, and pay. The people there are what really make the company special."
good,"Although the job was physically demanding, the coworkers provided a pleasant environment and proud camaraderie. Safety is paramount in the company and they take it very seriously. Management is generally very good. Hardest part of the job was the strenuous work."
good,"Every morning you know what you need to get done for that day, as long as you don't fall behind schedule you are left alone. There is a lot of self-management, managers expect you to get your job done without the need of micromanaging which is great. Communications with coworkers is crucial as you depend on each other to stay on track and keep the facility a safe working place. They can be flexible with your work schedule so long as it does not interrupt production and the ability to stay on time. You will be a full-time employee here, and even though they support employees going to school, work will have to come first. I would not recommend this as an option for someone that is looking to go to school full-time. working here requires for that you are fully focus and well rested mind as this is a dangerous work environment and one mistake could become consequential."
good,"Good job, but no room for advancement. Small location, so good relationships develop with co-workers."

good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"I wasn't terribly interested in the industry itself, but I worked with a great group of individuals."
good,"I loved my job at Airgas Onsite Safety. It was a positive atmosphere and my manager was a joy to work with.  We made it fun.  It had been a while since I had consistently worked on the computer, so it was nice to refresh my skills.  Being from a retail background, the customers made the job so much easier. Customer Service was our priority. The hardest part of my job was saying good-bye to everyone.  They became family."
good,"Airgas has provided me with a wealth of knowledge in the compressed gas, welding, and beverage gas industry. A typical work day as a branch manager consists of ensuring that orders and deliveries have been set up and scheduled to meet the customer's needs. It also includes working with our clients to find ways to grow the business , whether it is finding a better solution for their gas needs or looking for opportunities to sell safety equipment to their employees in the field.  Along with being focused on sales , branch operations and inventory management , Airgas has many regulatory policies to follow. As a branch manager I am responsible for ensuring that we are in compliance with Department of Transportation , Board of Pharmacy, Department of Homeland Security and OSHA policies. Each of these areas are audited on a yearly basis. The most enjoyable part about the job is working with our clients. We are very focused on the Wine industry in Napa and I have found it to be a lot of fun to work with Wine makers and learn about their processes for making Wine and how they use our products."
good,"Amazing place to work. Safety is always at the forefront of any operation at Airgas. As long as you are dedicated, hardworking, and seeking professional advancement, the opportunities are endless. Alot, if not most of the employees that work here have been with the company for decades, proving an extremely low turnaround rate. If you have the chance to be employed with this company, do not take it for granted. Airgas will take care of you."
good,"I was very productive here. I was presented several growth opportunities, and I was supported in trying new things. I really enjoyed my time at Airgas: Leadership is strong, and the culture genuinely supports a strong work-life balance."
good,The healthcare benefits are better than top 100 companies in my opinion. The culture of the company is about old school values. But just like any company it does get lost somewhere from top management to managers at locations. Managers are under a lot of pressure to make sure they meet the numbers that the message do not always come across the same. The company does have an open door policy meaning you can email or call senior management without any hesitation. The pay is lower than most companies in this business but then they do make up for it by their healthcare benefits package. Even the pay is lower the experience that you may gain from this company may be more beneficial in the long run. The turnover is extremely high due to training and pay.
good,"A typical day involved the management of account receivable accounts and product returns. "
good,I learned how to work with other as a team. We completed every task on time.
good,There was a great deal of mutual respect between departments within the corporate office.
good,"Typical day 300 miles, load twice, 4 stops, 12+ hours. VERY safety"
good,"The people are very friendly. Training is kind of long so that you are more comfortable with the material. Some of the management could've been better, but for the most part everyone was respectful"
good,"Great place to work just really tough to get started, alot to learn and not enough people to teach you how to do certain things."
good,Airgas was a good place to work and it had good people there. They focused on safety and customer service and were good at both. We serviced a lot of customers from many different areas. I really enjoyed the customer service aspect of my job there.
good,"Fast paced and physically demanding. Dedicated customers for each driver, bonuses for delivery percentage . Redundant work but keeps you busy. Develop a good relationship with customers."
good,Good place to learn skills and move up the ladder. The company is safety driven and cares about their employee’s wellbeing. Competitive pay and great benefits
good,I was very fortunate to work with Airgas. Safety is their number one concern. Upper management takes the time to listen to what you have to say or offer.
good,Typical workday would begin with knowing the job by making a walk-thru with the plant operators to make a specific safety / rescue plan for the job. Get the contractors / work crew together to go over hazards and safety. I learned that no person is injury proof and anyone can get hurt on the job. Complacency can get a worker in big trouble. My management team is great and willing to work with me when flexible hours are needed. Most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the travel portion and being able to see different parts of the country
good,"Wonderful place to work. I can see retiring from air-gas. I would recommend to friends and all I talk to about having a career choice of Airgas. They work with you, and try to make working here great."
good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,"Great company, pay a little below market.  Enjoyed my time with Airgas, however found a better opportunity with higher pay.  I would go back to work for Airgas with out hesitation."
good,My typical day started by calling on customers. I learned how to work and grow my territory revenue like it was my own business. Management was always open to new ideas. Workplace culture was good but very bureaucratic. The hardest part of the job was not meeting customer requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was working within a high tech environment and learning new processes.
good,Airgas is a great company that is still growing. The people are friendly. Asking questions is encouraged. Training is a thorough experience that really prepares you for the role when you get into it.
good,"Airgas is a big family.  People really seem to look out for one another and friendships are easy to make.  Productivity is the most import aspect of this company and is stressed but not over done.  At Airgas you will easily spend your entire career because of Job safety--so long as they don't need to do cut-backs.  However, advancement will be difficult because most positions only open if that person retires. Another flaw is how they judge success.  You will have to walk on water to be seen as an exceptional employee in your yearly review.  This does not seem to be a problem with management but with the way the forms are designed for yearly review.  Overall, they are a fair with employees and expect the same from you."
good,"As a trainer was exposed to many great people within the organization. Management was professional, personable, supportive, and goal-oriented."
good,"My position at Airgas requires cylinder preparation including organizing cylinders, valve and expiration date checks, filling cylinders, etc. Opposite the basic warehouse duties that I'm accustomed to fulfilling, this type of work was all a new experience for me. The management of the facility could use some adjustments as disciplinary actions aren't put into place for those who need it and the day-to-day operations could run a bit smoother with the proper implementations. The co-workers are good people but are a tad bit too comfortable with their positions in the facility; meaning that they work with no intent to advance. The hardest part of the job is probably getting through the day and keeping up the pace while the easiest part of the day is basically doing your job as every task is quite easy to accomplish."
good,Airgas is a great place to work. They have excellent benefits. There is room for advancement in the company. 
good,"There's a reason Airgas grows every year; it's a great company to work for. Though ultimately sales wasn't for me, the level of support and training that Airgas puts its team members through is really second to no place I've ever worked. So many people love coming to work there, you can't help but be drawn in by the place. Hardest part of the job is the continual calls you have to make, and the constant readjustment you have to make to your plans for the day. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people out by educating them on the products they need for their businesses."
good,"Good people to work with, great work life balance, and opportunity for advancement. Newer building to work in and great location. The company does a lot of events, lunches, popcorn, etc. for employees."

good,"Was hired as a ""inside sales"" but was doing more manager work than the manager they had hired previously. When i would go to my region manager with my concerns he would tell me i had to ""MANAGE UP"". I just didn't see a reason to stay at a company who one did not acknowledge my my concerns and thoughts, and also why would i be doing work for two people and only get paid once? the whole  ""MANAGING UP"" as a business major student if your manager is not contributing to the company he is no longer a asset to the company but a burden. that's just my two cents.."

good,"It was a great place to work.  Most of the time, it was a fast paced atmosphere and juggled multiple projects.  My coworkers were great and always helped out where needed."
good,Safety plays the biggest role with this company and it is seen and understood by all once on facility grounds. Production comes second but goals are still met and exceeded through proper planning and good management. Coworkers are hands on and diligent. Hardest part of the job is definitely time management; while the most enjoyable part is being driven by personal goals and expectations.

good,"In my current position of working as a counter/inside sales person I perform many tasks throughout the day. The position is much more than just waiting on retail walk in customers and answering telephone requests. I also resolve billing disputes, receive in product and ship out orders. Teamwork is essential as there are currently only two of us in the store and an administrative support group. I thoroughly enjoy interacting with my co workers. The hardest part of the job is resolving billing disputes as we've transferred over to a new operating system. The most enjoyable part of the job is having positive interactions with co-workers and customers."
good,Very busy job with helpful and pleasant co-workers. Heavy cash application and co-workers are very helpful in resolving any discrepancies regarding incoming checks from customers.
good,This company has all the tools needed to succeed in a career.
good,work is slightly physical but not demanding at all. Excellent pay and benefits. Some location are union and some are not. Management at my location is poor.  Definetly could make a career out of it tho.
good,Airgas Retail Solutions strives to provide a good customer experience. The employees are put through training on customer service and how to improve the overall experience for the customer from order placement or billing and payment assistance.
good,"I was given opportunities to solve problems and be intellectually challenged. I taught several Excel training sessions and truly enjoyed my co-workers. My director was outstanding, however my immediate supervisor was not."
good,"Open Store, turn everything on. Work the phone, email, fax, and walk in traffic. Co workers were great. Management hard but fair."
good,"My time at Airgas has been good, but there are many areas that could use improvement.  The sales expectations can be wholly unrealistic and penalize the salesperson over time."
good,"The supervisors and manager are great, very helpful."
good,"We were told we were there to work, not to make friends. So ultimately in the years I was there I made no work friends. Management didn't know as much as the processors, but when you get in trouble for talking to your co-workers makes completeing your job correctly rather impossible."
good,Stable hours with above averge pay and benefits. Good training programs with room for improvement. Management a bit disconected with day to day activities. Co-workers lack vision of team goals and operating procedures. Most difficult part of job is having to many programs to offer and procedures are not finilazed. The most important part of the job is having some really great customers to interact with on a daily basis.
good,"I really liked working for Airgas and loved my job. I thought it would be a company I would retire from. However, since the company did some reorganizing I will no longer have a job here and I do not have a desire to move to Tulsa where the accounts payable position is going."

good,"My position was unique within the company, so I can't say that it applies to everyone, however I enjoyed my time at Airgas and wish I could have remained longer. I did a lot of filing in my position and learned how to work several new programs. Management had expectations that were sometimes difficult to meet but it doesn't take much more extra work. Some of my co-workers enjoyed drama, but that's not atypical in an office setting. The most difficult part of my position was keeping up on reports when others would fall behind. The most enjoyable part was having the flexibility to work the hours that I wanted to."

good,the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with my customers that I processed the payroll for and the employees that I did the Kronos training for.
good,"Management is a bit unrealistic, out of touch with individual branches. Only time you get contact is reports where there is no explaination on how to interpret, or ""GET IT DONE"" type emails. "
good,My time with airgas was short and sweet but you work hard.... The people there are very supportive  and are very helpful.. Yes you really have time to cool down and worm up... The supervisor is very helpful so if you have a problem they will try to fix it as best they can and I would be honored if I was asked back........ Through them not temp........ That was my mistake..... It's the best job I've had in a long time.....
good,"My work experience was overwhelming positive.   Great company."

good,"in my line of work. i usually start 2:30 in the afternoon. i would usually stay in the cafeteria and have a brief interact to my co-subordinate. supervisor usually would hand you a load sheet and collaboratively plan my day. i usually did the most urgent first and most likely pick the most hazzard and delicate product. this is my every day task. eventually, i gotten used to it and work hard for it. in regards of management, they're treated us like professional and easy to approach with. if you have a problem. they'd listened to you. i believe every company you work. workplace culture is not perfect. there is always a glitch whether you want to improve it. it's up to your co-subordinate. there's always a personality gap. honestly, the job is not that easy. you have to pick and load at the same. these are heavy task and dangerous once you made a mistake, it would create catastrophe. but we aware of the safety and hazard regulations. the most enjoyable part is when it's time to go home. knowing you are safe plus you are getting paid for your hard work. although, i was the first person who gets the employee of the month because of my hard work and effort."
good,"Great place to work! Manager that I had was the best according to me! I Can’t speak for the other locations. But for the most part, every part of management that I dealt with was laid back and helpful to make sure that you knew what you were doing. Simple as doing your job and there isn’t ever any problems."

good,"Loved working there.  great job/life balance.  Always up to date with technology and very informative to their employees.   "
good,Everyday started differently depending on what department you were in. The benefit an employee will have at Airgas will be that you are cross trained in so many departments that you will have a wonderful wealth of knowledge in the medical gas and welding equipment industry. I valued my time with Airgas and appreciate everything my mentors taught me.
good,Good people with good pay. In transition now after acquisition by Air Liquide but seems to be ok so far. Nice new Kenworth tractors. Dealing with ammonia products safety is a must
good,"I enjoyed the duties of my job, however, management and employee interaction left me feeling out of place. The employees played mind games with each other, cliques were formed which made for a hostel environment."
good,"Airgas, in contrast to Verifone, was VERY training oriented!  They provided in house training classes and had ways to engage employees to do their best work with both internal and external customers.  They had monthly awards that you earned based on your interaction with co-workers and/or customers."
good,"Airgas was a place to learn and advance as you learned.  Management and co-workers were honest, loyal and hard workers.  That was an example to all associates.  Life long friendships were made."
good,lots of phone calls emails and faxing problem solving all day helping customers is a reason to work great people to work with a real team go get together

good,"Productive and always busy. I enjoyed my job and co-workers and would still be working there but the company went to a new computer system that eliminated more than a few departments. The Accounts Payable Department was one of them. I would have stayed at Airgas until I retired but the SAP computer system is the reason for my lay off as of April 5,2013."

good,The employees are great to work with. The safety culture is amazing. The continued training is excellent. The benefits package is outstanding. I wish I did not leave.
good,People are friendly. Work is always there. Great benefits. The pay needs to be better considering the amount of the workload. The pay is really the only down side to working for this company. It’s a really good company to work for.

good,"Airgas provides substantial pay and a unique physical experience towards employees who are willing to prioritize the production of the business. As a loader, I was tasked with securing heavy cylinders of various forms of compressed gas onto trucks for distribution of clientele.

Job-related injuries are taken very seriously and Airgas will make any effort to pass the buck and refuse to accept liability."

good,"At Airgas, I was in charge of ""fast track"" desk in accounts payable. Everything at my desk had to go . Expence reports, communication, Petty Cash, shipping. I ran weekly check runs, lots of data entry, contact with vendors. I learned you work better as a team in a lot of areas at this Administration Office. My co-workers had been with the company when it was independantly owned. And showed flexibility when it became national. The hardest part of my job would be saying good bye to employees, when they left. The most enjoyable would be the parties we would have that encluded the entire production team and Admin. office."
