bad,"I've been a career land surveyor. Before I became a surveyor, I had many various jobs. I've had good jobs and not so good ones. This by far has been the worst one ever. My term for this job was brutal. My wife and I both worked there. She came from manufacturing, including supervisory positions. She's never seen a worst run company. We got fired because we were snowed in. We were actually happy about this."
bad,It’s stressful job in my life. Manager and supervisor are very rude. Team leads didn’t help. And they give you alot of stress. I hate this job. Don’t work in Genie. They guys are sucks.
bad,I worked here and went through 4 supervisor's. They pick team leads that are upper management's friends. They let ppl bully other employees. And lie about everything. One of the ladies in HR also works with her husband that just walks around telling on ppl. They change their minds every second . They have on supervisor that ppl swear he's on meth . But I would rather be homeless than work there ever again
bad,"If you are looking to grow with your colleagues, they are stuck in a different generation. Not only are you killing your brains day after day at this job but you are also having to go through what I call a power struggle for a basic hierarchical jump. Its better not to work than work for this company. Did not meet a single person who intellectually challenged me."
bad,Terrible and inconsistent management.   The lack of better technology to do a 21st century job and terrible pay rates without any perks and or incentives for workers with high performance
bad,"avoid! they don't care about the staff at all, they just care about building their tacky machinery. Over worked and underpaid staff. ................................"
bad,I would not recommend working for Terex Cranes. The company is poorly managed and they closed the Waverly plant to move it to Oklahoma so they could get away from the Waverly union.
bad,"The plant has been shut down. "
bad,"This place doesn't keep anyone more than 3 months if your lucky, the only way you get hired on fully is if you beg. If you are a female they sx harass you"
bad,"This company don't care about their workers. It's production at whatever cost. No care for the health and safety of their employees nor for the mental welfare of the workers. The whole factory constantly has low moral amongst the workforce and this is further antagonised by the fact that the Human Resources department is that one sided that the workforce are alienated from it. It's happy to cover up and brush issues under the carpet, it's managed badly and I'd go so far as to say corrupt to the core! I wouldn't want anyone to take a job in it unless they want to end up with mental health issues. The management couldn't care less about the little people on the shop floor. Until there is a complete overhaul of management, supervisors and human resources they will continue to run a factory riddled with bullying and victimisation of employees. There is absaloutely no worker incentive ,no time keeping bonus or no production bonus. Regardless of who you are or what you give to the company you'll easily be replaced. Avoid at all cost would be the best advice I could give."
bad,"More than half of the people in my new employee orientation class quit after 2 weeks working there. Genie in Redmond is a very cheap place, because every things ( rubber gloves, and ect) is lock up. If you need somethings, you have to ask the supervisor to get it for you. The employee there are very lousy, they're always watching you. And the working environment at Genie is bad, you have to work very fast and hard. I had to stand on my feet for 10 hours a day. Genie in Redmond is always hiring, and they don't hire direct. You have to go through Aerotek, so don't come to Genie unless you are desperate finding work."
bad,"management are not nice,treated really badly, rate of pay is not very good for the work they want you to do,definitely wouldn't recommend terex to anyone."
bad,"Awful company to work for, completely disorganised, I’ve never known a company to treat its employees so badly. Virtually no training given whatsoever and the way the management speak to people is appalling, reducing members of staff to tears at times. The same attitude seems to apply at every Terex site worldwide. Couldn’t recommend it less"
bad,Terex came in and bought our company--destroyed it--then sold it to the competitor and lots of good people lost their jobs because Terex lied to the buyer about their profit numbers and customer base.  There is lots of good people that work at Terex in the manufacturing portion but when it came to service they really messed it up and didn't know their pole from their hands.  I can only hope that the ignorant managers that had their fingers in it are suffering more than the good people they trashed.
bad,"Horrible management, very little training, poor work life balance. I would never recommend this company as an employer to anyone. Very untrustworthy company with poor work ethic."
bad,"The stars say it all."
bad,"The management and staff were nose in the air elitist.  Everybody was complaining and back stabbing throughout the plant.  Waverly Iowa hate the place.  Mean, nasty people."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Spent 6 months here, I was told when applying plenty of chance of progression etc but after 3 weeks I was moved from the job I had applied for and ended up counting nuts and bolts for 6 months. When I asked store manager for rotation in my work or to be moved to a different area with more physical/challenging work I was told he didnt care. Direct supervisors are useless"
bad,"Poor management, poor on the job training and very poor wages. Poor experience throughout and I wouldn't recommend working for this company to anybody."
bad,"The training is terrible.  They expect you to perform like a star with little to no training. There are double standards on everything. If you are not already friends with management or are not good at kissing up, then don't waste your time. They speak of integrity and team work but have no actual clue what that means. Management will roll you under the bus in a heartbeat to save their own skin."
bad,My work there was I  in the morning went to meeting with management of Mercedes to see what needed to be done that day and what happened the night before then I would go fix what carriers was in my lockout to get them back in production then if I could I would start doing pms on different carriers to make sure everything was in good shape or sometimes I would have to go repair parts of the bus line before they broken completely and shut assembly line down then I would do what repairs they wanted me to do that day
bad,Not a safe environment. 12 hour days are common.  No overtime compensation for supervisors.  50+ hour work weeks are common.  High turnover.  Untrained team members.  Autocratic managers who don't have a clue about treating team members with respect or acknowledge their accomplishments.
bad,We started with a dept.  meeting in the morning to review the previous day and plan for the current day.  We went through emails & any other messages that needed attention in order to prioritize the work to be done for the day.
bad,"This Company is changing course every 5 minutes.  Between the lack of good managers and their general ineptness it's a terrible environment.  New ideas are extinguished by the dinosaurs trying to hold on to their jobs and who spout, ""this is the way we've always done it"" and tow the line.  Innovation and invention are frowned upon."
bad,"In my six years with Terex Roadbuilding we went thru 16 Managers, directors, etc.  The company morale was terrible.  Cutting people that had worked there a long time.  The goal for managers/supervisors was cut your department by 15-20% in people.  If that doesn't work cut some more. They had no regard or respect for their employees."
bad,Trex is way to top heavy and have always been.  They would do a lot better if they hired based on merit and not based on longevity. There are a lot of people that leave based on the facts that they never get a chance to advance. There are a lot of wonderful people there.
bad,"Helps you learn a lot fast. But there is no employee retain due to pay. Some managers have no degrees and people get where they are by luck. The only good thing about the job is the people you work with. Many team members don't carry their weight which wears on you. No innovation, just cheapening out machines."
bad,"Poor management, over work employees, lied bout work shifts, show extreme favoritism, supervisor are bullies, no personal time for doctors appointments, if a doctors appointment was necessary you get wrote up etc"
bad,"Work was often stressful with deadlines to meet. The air filter was broken and it was always to cold outside to open the doors, the air quality in the bays where terrible. Working conditions were rough."
bad,"Your a piece of meat at Terex, waiting to be ground down and replace at a moments notice.  Your prior skills mean nothing to management.  Supervisors have know idea who you are, and you are just randomly placed within the company."
bad,"Most full time employees are lazy and the 3 workshop so called foremen are untrained skilled labourers says it all."
bad,I'm sure like most companies Terex had their favorites and would promote them or give raises but not everyone got raises when when their time came. As far as advancements if you was in there Clique no matter if you had experience for that area or not you would be hired even though having almost 2 years experience in that area and you weren't in there Clique you didn't get the job. Supervisor hired over one area had no experience and therefore did not know what was going on. I wouldn't recommend Terex to anybody but some people can make it out there
bad,"There are some good people working at Terex, but unfortunately they get froze out by some of the managers, who are not very professional or competent. There is also an ongoing problem with Health and Safety at the site that the management are refusing to acknowledge."
bad,"I was given almost no training, which caused me serious injury. The customers are intentionally misled about the services you'll be required to perform.."
bad,"This company thinks its so big and more important and that it's management can treat it's employees unfairly with no regard."
bad,"just avoid in my opinion, poor management, poor hours, poor policies, no time for there staff, the agency they used when i worked there where shocking too"
bad,Terex bought a family owned business 2 years ago.  There was a a very big culture change. Terex has a reputation for buying smaller companies and closing them. They did this at the Waukesha location as well.
bad,There are constant big lay offs and they like to have a lot of temps so it's easier to get rid of people. They move managers around that don't know how things are run in an area and they start tweaking with procedures and products don't come out right so you have to stay late a lot fixing them. Until a couple weeks go by and they go back to the original procedure the workers all wanted in the first place
bad,"Was expected to work at a very fast pace for 10 hours a day and Saturdays, and then they were not happy with the quality of peoples work.  Would not show us our errors so we could see what we were doing wrong."
bad,"""I worked here and went through 4 supervisor's. They pick team leads that are upper management's friends. They let ppl bully other employees. And lie about everything. One of the ladies in HR also works with her husband that just walks around telling on ppl. They change their minds every second . They have on supervisor that ppl swear he's on meth . But I would rather be homeless than work there ever again""."
bad,It's sad how they discriminate against you due to a criminal background check after they have worked you for 90 or more days and you have performed very well and completed each and every task that was that was given to you also you passed a physical and drug test
bad,Company changes policies on the fly. Warehouse manager does not care about the warehouse associates. Very inconsiderate of personal life problems. Do not work in the warehouse. Other departments are pretty good
bad,"Would begin the day by hearing the information that we needed and then do stretching exercises that were a total waste of time. Everyone would go to their work stations and begin working. The company made the work situation so bad by imposing more and more regulations to the workers on the shop floor. Management changed the work hours after a petition was signed by 98% of the shop workers wanted it left the way it was. Everyone there worked for the same company but it depended on which side of the wall you were on if the rules applied to you or not. The office side or the floor side. The floor side could not have radios, had to take breaks at a given time and only had a limited time for them, could not go out and start their vehicles early to warm them up in the winter but the office people could do what ever they wanted too include a lot more."
bad,Shift work in place. Learning new skills. Can follow production from flat plate to full truck. Protective safety equipment provided. Located within easy access of M8.
bad,"A typical day at work began early in the morning. My manager would not always be at the job, but expected me to assemble machines without any help. When I asked for help, my manager would not get me any. I enjoyed most of my coworkers. I learned how to assemble cranes and how to operate them."
bad,"If you like a job that lack variety this is the company for you. No opportunities or room for growth."
bad,They offer great classes but you will never have time to do online courses. The company also cancels classroom courses all the time. Management will over work you and wonder why things do not get done.  Advancements are near impossible because if you department is short on TM you will not even be considered for the position and they are always short. They cant keep people because it sucks that bad.
bad,Terex offers good benefits but lacks in communication with Team Members. You can also expect to work quite a bit of overtime during the week (from home or the office) and expect to work the weekends.
bad,"To many temporary employees, month to month planning so work force is either let go or hired making unstable training or short. No room for advancement, Good benefits, compensation is good."
bad,"Poor Leadership all the way around. Understaffed and vacation denied continuously because of the lack of qualified staff.  HR seems to run the whole facility without any production experience."
bad,"Overall the workplace was acceptable, management ( upper & lower) would lie to you, show favoritism towards the ones they preferred, upper management was very poor to say the least, parts issues, equipment breakdowns, low employee moral, some workers hired in at 90 days others waiting 6 months to a year or more(favortism). Poor planning, lazy managers, a lot of seasonal turnover and layoffs. companylocationevenables"
bad,The people they call cell leaders which are actually Foreman's don't know what they are doing they have never built a complete concrete truck some of them worked in areas for all the time that they've been there and they don't know what they are doing the engineering staff asked the employees for ideas and then take credit for it. I will never work there again the place sucks.
bad,Everyone on my crew was beat down and disappointed because of management.  The saddest part is that it could be a great job but the uppers wont let it be. They talk too much and do nothing.
bad,"This was a temp position. They trained me very little. Gave me very little feed back. Supervision , inappropriate and not well managed. I loved what I did , but not who worked for."
bad,"Little in the way of advancement opportunity. Management not consistent. Crazy days. Loved the team members. Went through the worst day of my career so far there when they had a ""RIF"" reduction in force in 2009. Hr was calling people at their desks and the next minute they were being walked out. Very badly managed. No thought to how the business was going to continue as usual with 30% less people. Put a lot of stress on those left behind. This really soured my opinion of the company."
bad,It paid bills and had at the time pretty good benefits. Needs to jump on board like CAT and other companies getting new technology and out of the stone age with how many things are done.
bad,"It is a good ol' boy system there, even though they preach ""we follow processes"".  HR favors certain people in management and are not to be trusted.  They had a fatality there less than 6 months ago, and we have escalated safety issues to management.  Management turns their heads, all they want are numbers.  They preach safety, but that is only a cover-up.  It is unsafe.  Hours are very long.  You have no life at the facility.  Management micro manages and does not truly develop their team.  HR doesn't seem to know the answers to anything and never helps.  "
bad,Meetings and more meetings yet nothing get resolved. The needed change happens at glacial pace. Most of it never gets done at all. Upper management changes every 6 months so employees are always starting over to accommodate the whims of the new Ops director or whoever is there that month.
bad,"This job is everything not what it was said to be when hired,no advancement completely good enviroment but workers as well as myself need more pay for the jobs and tasks that are asked of us,not to complain but the struggle is real at this place,constantly hiring people because of high over turn of people is what happens here."
bad,"They ended up leaving all the workers high and dry,  They didn't try to help us relocate of find new jobs. They are proof that they don't care about the working man at all."
bad,"People not held accountable for their responsibilities. When they dont do their job, their work is heaped on the backs of those that do work. Creates an atmosphere of apathy and failure."
bad,"Sorry to say the company does not function properly."
bad,"Very poor company with regards to employees"
bad,"Having hydrovac experience started here to run hydrovac. Got told couples or so weeks will have a new dedicated unit of my own to operate, till than to help out on site etc...no problem! Right away you can see who’s trying to run the show and they know anything and everything or verbally try and belittle staff/crew in front of other crew which is disrespectful and HR violation, deal with you like they are nothing unless you are buddies or have connections! Pay is good, hours are not guaranteed cuz rain means no work but you do get 35-45hrs, miss lead you no OT pay the so called crew supervisors try and dictate and if they don’t like you or you don’t bend over you go pretty quick. Upper management is blind and most crew are young unaware of HR Or employment policies hence don’t stand up so higher up never knows or cares not too! Smoking in trucks, filthy, borderline CVOR safety and all gets overlooked! "
bad,The location is in MS and you have to pay MS state tax on earnings which is not good when you live in TN. The place was a good place to work I was part of a great team. The salary was very low for the job.
bad,"Layoffs from the day 1, watch out and be careful, do your research, meet the people you'll be working with to get a feel for your team's culture.  be careful"
bad,"The work is what you would expect and the hours rarely go over 40. The pay and benefits are decent and keep most people there. The mangement is terrible and corrupt. They look out for their own and the people doing the manual labor take the brunt of it. If you can take the work and not ever really having a say in anything or being able to defend yourself when you get in trouble, it's a good job."
bad,while i was production supervisor I learned quite a bit and was also challenged to show my employees what I learned.  Teamwork was a big part in my department.
bad,"Management is poor, but co-workers are great. 10 hour days minimum and getting parts in on time is always a problem, which frustrates the line workers."
bad,"Other than the compensation and benefits, if you are not golfing with the Plant Director you can count yourself out of any promotional opportunity.  The HR Manager there is a complete waste of space.  HR is never available to assist employees and help develop them.  They are more interested in traveling in their flock of 6 and gossip about people.  Managers there micormanage everything you do and do not foster an innovative culture.  Corporate needs to come in and talk to employees to get the real life persective of how things are Managed and make some serious leadership changes.  Employees are miserable, but because the job market in Moses Lake is not that great, are forced to stay in order to provide for their families.  Corporate needs to do a better job looking into the way employees are treated and how they are throwing money away by paying Managers that are not Leading.  They are paying 6 HR employees to flock together and be completely unavailable.  Do not work here.  There are other plants coming into Moses Lake.  Consider those before working there."
bad,At Terex we pull pick audit and pack heavy Parts I also drive cherry picker reach truck etc.. the good part was the work was fast so the end of the day came quick. the bad parts was the machinery parts was too heavy.
bad,"Coworkers are okay, management is awful. You are overworked and micromanaged. You are never given the opportunity to prove yourself as you are constantly micromanaged."
bad,bella la paga i colleghi unpo meno lavoro a giornata capi extracomunitari devi sapere fare altrimenti ti lasciano a casa
bad,"If i was asked this 2 years ago, my opinion may have been different but the company has had 5 Plant controllers/Managers in 4 years and management is a disaster.  Very little support on projects that need completed to increase both safety and quality.  Communication was terrible, we pretty much identified issues, tackled them then got grilled for not completing  something you didn't know management wanted done."
bad,"In work early and out late, very fluid operation with daily multi tasking opportunities.  Good experience being part of a team  helping turn the manufacturing facility around with great success.  Very good teamwork environment.  Con, lack of recognition for success's accomplished, on an upper level management stage."
bad,There was no understanding from management.what it took to get machines out. All they saw was figures and not the shortage of parts and team members when it came to setting deadlines. They had courses set up to help team members but after the courses where over you could see it was a ticking exercise to show corporate.
bad,falta de oportunidades de crescimento do funcionário e descaso quanto a funcionários que precisam de tratamento médico prolongado .
bad,"A typical day at work used to be busy managing multiple engineering project and design tasks with other engineers and now simply waiting for the next equipment sale and developing concept equipment design. Very quiet in a bad way. The company is exiting the product and looking for a buyer. I've learned to meet the needs of the customer and that working fervently may either be rewarding or not. Its a matter of ethic. Management lives for the quarter and has no real interest in long term development goals, i.e. no R&D budget. Co-workers mostly are concerned about their future while anticipating the next workforce reduction. The hardest part of the job now is believing the company would actually be staffed properly to build product to meet delivery. The most enjoyable part of the job is the potential to design and build product I've created using solid modeling engineering software. Its very rewarding for me to be creative in the engineering environment."
bad,good place to work learn new things good working conditions good hours good holidays excellent working team fast paced assembly area clean tidy good tooling
bad,Find a job somewhere else. Job security is unknown and the Management is a joke! The pay and benefits are the only plus to this job. Unfortunately there’s not much opportunity in the area for better pay.
bad,"I was blessed being awarded a job at Terex, as it was perfect for my short term plans. However,  I never felt I had job security since Terex was shutting down segments every year. The segment I worked was lacking organization, training, and management did not hold certain employees accountable for their actions. I would not recommend Terex as a place to seek employment."
bad,"Its productive, and job culture is good. management is good. but salary is low. the hardest part of job is low salary, the most enjoyable part of the job is cooperative staff and management."
bad,"I'm finding it very difficult to stay with this company, there is never any planning when it comes to setting up new processes and i find they bring in a new products last minute and expect processes to be set up at the drop of a hat without the required staff and support to do so.Today my manager had to  pick due to lack of staff required to do the roles required"
bad,"Excellent Product"
bad,Your a number here...a cog in the machine...that's it.
bad,"Mostly care about numbers out the door which usually fails due to poor planning and management, requiring random days pulling 12hr shifts sometimes. Good pay but they can make you really work for it."
bad,"Poor place to work, run on temps "
bad,"Very poor culture and short sighted management, coupled with poor product and support. Very frustrating work place. Doubt it has a future."
bad,Challenging to use your experience. The ability to be successful definitely depended on which manager you are under. In four years I had six different managers; not a good position to find yourself in
bad,"Good place to work, good job security but management is full of individuals that are not qualified and make bad decisions."
good,"Terex has some great people that work there and are great to work with. The management needs work. They are very inconsistent for what they want, need, and claim. Their values are preached but not followed. Some of the managers have a bullish and intimidating style."
good,"Learned a lot about liaising with various  functions , departments, customers  and parallel about  Material Handling industry , its overall working."
good,Because I worked at the head office I had to travel to Oxford on a Sunday evening and would return home on Saturday morning.
good,I wouldn't recommend working there the only perk is decent wages and great benefits but the management system sucks and they keep taking away our perks slowly they also think they are to rulers of your life and like to make mandatory overtime
good,the senior management hasnt a clue what its like on a mine site they think there still on the factory floor .the guys on site they make the job work enjoyable to work with
good,I would never work there again. Bad management. Bullying by management. Pay was average. People were always depressed. I am glad I am out of that place.
good,"Exceptional ability to enter new environments and produce"
good,They do not let people have there own health or medical needs met. They put the needs of the company first and peoples needs second. People are just a number or someone to fill a space on the floor. People are told that anyone can do your job and that you are lucky to have a job.
good,"- vraiment très difficile, travail 7 jours sur 7, 10 à 11 heures par jours"
good,"Glad I quit and left this place. If you love yourself, think twice before accepting a job at the Calgary location. Be careful who you trust and talk to. No one who has worked here has anything nice to say about the people at this location."
good,Over the years there has become more favoritism and lack of integrity. It is very difficult to grow unless close friends with managers. The team members are friendly and easy to work with
good,Great company to kick start your career but would not recommend staying there longer than 1-2 years.  Terex is a dying company with many challenges.  Career paths are not defined and there is too much bureaucracy to get anything done.
good,"boa empresa para aprendizado, ambiente de trabalho desafiador e bastante preocupada com segurança no trabalho"
good,"In this job, day-to-day hours are unknown. Very difficult on the family. Have worked with some good people over the years, some not so much."
good,Time has come when im not sure of my employment. Sales of equipment is down to non-existence. I need a full time job with security..this isnt the place anymore
good,"Empresa com bom clima organizacional. Marca forte, ótimo produto."
good,"Ho imparato e gestire le emozioni, in un ambiente dinamico in continua evoluzione, capacità ad adattarsi, velocità ma con precisione"
good,Work schedule erratic and interferes with time at home. Pay not sufficient to retain skilled workers. Pay increases fail to reflect contributions to the company. Leadership fails to follow through on commitments.
good,"I have worked hard and completed my work to the best of my ability, adhering to management and working well alongside my co-workers. The job is not actually very hard and reasonably enjoyable."
good,"Go to work, and sometimes don't know when you will go home."
good,"Cold -Callings"
good,"I arrived at work, completed my tasks, and 5s my area. I also assisted others when needed. Terex was a good company to be apart of and the employers and employees were a good crew to work with."
good,"Great people in operations, however the up & down of construction equipment business drives the business to layoff in down cycles... unsettling not knowing if your job will be there from day to day..."
good,"Terex focuses on the bottom line every quarter and ignores the fact that there will be another bottom line in 3 months. No good long term strategy or development, but lots of cost cutting. Leadership changes too frequently to help stabilize the company"
good,"My immediate supervisor supported training and innovative ideas.  Drafting work was fairly repetitive with 2D software.  Terex paid for all drafters to be trained in new 3D software.  Shortly after, the facility closed and moved to another state."
good,Typical MFG company.  Work place flows from one leader the the next with no real direction.  Large company that is operated as a small mom and pop shop.
good,"Great manager, uneasy job security. A typical day as a Sales Coordinator changes every morning which is a good thing, but the company goes through too many ups and downs to feel safe."
good,"It was formally known as dueco and then sold to Terex.  It use to have a family feel to it and then everything started changing. wages should be higher for the constent difficult work employees do,"
good,"Perform maintenance of cranes and industrial maintenance."
good,Lots of immature office politics.  I am much more mature and did not enjoy the pettiness.  I loved talking with my vendors and purchasing the needs for a continual growing business.
good,"This company has extreme potential. Options for team members are essentially unlimited if one has the desire to achieve. In-house trainings are available to increase the knowledge of the next step as you gain experience to fulfill that next step. Unfortunately, the speed of knowledge and experience accumulation does not match increases in salary. This creates a workforce of over-qualified, under-challenged and thus under paid team members whom will eventually seek other opportunities that will compensate them for their ambitions."
good,"ho imparato cose nuove era un lavoro stimolante mi sentivo realizzato quando finivo un lavoro,la gestione non so rispondere a questa domanda visto che dopo un anno mi trovo senza lavoro xke esistono favoritismi i miei colleghi sono stato molto bene a lavorare con loro la meccanica comunque e una parte molto complicata del lavoro che svolgevo pero nello stesso tempo stimolante"
good,"This company was hit hard by the recession. And with that came many cuts. And with many cuts came a system full of cobwebs and poor maintenance, from the facility standpoint and the leadership standpoint. However, Terex is in the process of a major overhaul across the board. They have become much more focused on safety, the employee benefits and a huge renovation project on the 70 year old facility. It's not great now, but many changes are coming and I am glad to be a part of it."
good,Terex Cranes and Terex Global Business Services have been great places to work and I have learned so much.  Now it's time to broaden my horizons and see what other challenges and opportunities are out there for me to face and accomplish.
good,"New Supervisor spoke rude to employees and threatened jobs. On the good note they do have decent people there, The job wasn't that bad but the hours weren't what was stated 10/13 hours a day mon-fri and they thought about adding Saturday."
good,its a company with great benefits and a bloated management department. if you need a place with meh money and good benefits and lousy management this is your place
good,Terex is a large company that has been experiencing significant change over the last 10 years.  The company's products are in highly cyclical markets making it challenging to know what kind of future you had as an employee.
good,Most people that worked there assembled cranes. Other departments painted and welded. The testing department and ran tests on new equipment. Management was horrible. They tried to over manage everything.
good,"The supervisors that were placed on the assembly lines had very little knowledge of the build of the product. It was very much a push, push, push, industry."
good,"It is a great environment to work, experience  and also learn a lot.  my colleagues  were great, it was quite challenging at the beginning but once you get a hinge of how things work everything gets better, I would strongly recommend genie to anyone who is willing to learn the hard way and for beginners who want to be tough and confident about what they do. mostly when it come to assembly and shop ethics, safety conscious about your self and the shop floor;"
good,"Company was closing, sorted mail, telephone, received call  for direction to delivery driver. Paged technician for repair question.  There is not more to said about a company."
good,"there is great working hours with only 4 day per week Monday to Friday, sometimes can be very unstable as in 12years there's been lots of  redundancies and changes made"
good,"Used to be a good industrial company, oriented towards excellence of its product range and to its clients. The various changes of ownership did modify the DNA of the company."
good,"Very secretive management with ultimate goal of money over people, constant struggle between common sense and new ways not applicable in big machinery atmosphere."
good,"Empresa com ótimos colegas d trabalho,todos ajudando um ao outro isso é muito importante p/ que saia um trabalho perfeito , pessoal do rh a gerência em geral foi um ótimo relacionamento tranquilo, refeição ,nada a reclamar,foi um ótimo lugar de trabalhar e aprender."
good,"Great working people, friendly, helpful."
good,"Buscar os materiais no almoxarifado e efetuar análise técnica das conformidades das peças antes de montá-las, analisando desenho técnico e buscando a forma correta de montagem."
good,i did not mind the company and the people. with it being a start up production line there were some situation that i found to be very dangerous so it ended up not being the place for me to stay
good,"I enjoyed my time at Terex as I feel that I had a good relationship with both colleagues and management alike.  I feel that my skills have improved as I have learnt different techniques which I am able to take with me to my next employment. I feel that these techniques have helped me improve my skills and abilities to do my job."
good,"As long as you are willing to wake up very early for this job, like four in the morning, you will do well here."
good,If you are going to work for Terex then there is one thing to remember. Never try any harder or do any more than you need to do. It will not be appreciated and in may cases it will be despised.
good,Was looking to relocate. This was something the company was unable to do.
good,Could be a great place to work but there is a desperate need of strong middle management.
good,"A typical day would be a busy one, with continuous improvement tasks to carry out, working with production teams to identify improvements. I learned a great deal about how a large company works, new techniques in lean manufacture, but most of all I learned how to work as a team, dealing with complicated issues and developing my skills and experience."
good,"• In my role I provide leadership and motivation to 18 associates plus two team leaders,"
good,"Large environments to work in, good people employed, little disorganization but can be worked with. Many options available from material handling to welding."
good,"I worked for the okc location, it started off great. I crossed trained and learned a lot on the line. Unfortunately that doesn't mean that your pay will match your work efforts. It is set 50c every 6 months weather you bust but or not. They claim to care for you, yet they treat you like a number instead of a person. Once you get a point it's a year from that date before it falls off 6 pts on the 7th you are let"
good,inspect and review all products from the beginning of the line to the final product. manage cranes and parts running through machines. fact paced and time controlled
good,It's not a bad place to work. There are multiple areas where you can succeed and grow. It's mostly just long hours and early mornings. They started doing a good job of giving notice when overtime was required.
good,This was a typical back road country hick trying to run a multi million dollar company. Yes this is not the way to run a company. All decisions are made without any thought about the consequences.
good,Terex is a great place to work for the people are easy going the management is always there when you need help or have questions. Terex has a in house decently priced cafeteria.
good,"Extremely busy very fast paced.  Heavy welding and fabrication work.   Great hours, some travel involved.  Great place but time for a change of pace and environment."
good,The job included working with every area of the facility inspecting many different types of equipment and parts. Making sure that all team understood what the standards were.
good,10+ years of experience with this company through good and bad times.  Workplace environment was nice most of the time but there were times when management would not stick up for its employees.
good,Worked with accounts receivable on past due accounts and customer service on the phone with new clients. Hardest part of the day was researching and calling on past due accounts.  Time was not allotted for detail research on overdue balances. Loved my coworkers.  Supervisor was not effective in training or following up when help was indicated to her.
good,"I come into work finishing any leftover paperwork and unanswered emails from the previous day, and wait for the new packing slips and material to arrive for the current day to start entering into the computer."
good,"Worked at Terex for just over a year.  Worked n contract until recently hired.  Actually make less money then when I was on contract.  Have good benefits, just low pay for as much money runs in an out of Terex."
good,I wasn't always working my job position that was broken up with frequent covering for others; taught myself Microsoft since that was the up-and-coming software of the future at the time and I wanted to keep up with the trend; co-workers could be a little overbearing; the hardest part of the job was finding the time needed to do my assigned position; the most enjoyable part of the job was it was in an area I could leave the building for lunch occasionally for a change of environment.
good,"People are given independent responsibility to handle large complex high value requirement."
good,"The people I worked with were amazing, the management team was something to be desired. The management and the workers were very divided and could never seem to see eye to eye. This made the work atmosphere very difficult at times."
good,"fazendo meu trabalho com qualidade, e muita transparencia fazendo para o cliente como se fosse pra mim"
good,"The people at Terex are wonderful, and you will find good mentors.  In recent years the company has been run so Lean that the work/ life is skewed and I saw many individuals not getting to spend time with their families.  Because they pay in the median range, there started to be increased turn-over."
good,Terex is a good place to work when times are good.   Career growth is possible but politics are strong.    IT spending must be offset by headcount reductions.
good,"Empresa Multinacional, possibilitando oportunidade de aprendizado continuo. Um grupo de profissionais qualificados."
good,"Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, porém, não oferece muitas oportunidades de crescimento para os funcionários que já trabalham nela."
good,hit the time clock and go to work.I started in assembly then transfered to maintenance then to e&e department i really liked the e&e job

good,"Terex was a decent enough place to work. Safety was a constant issue. One employee died from being crush by a hydraulic lift due to no safety precautions taken to prevent accident. Ironically, this happened during a safety meeting."
good,"Empresa. demag uma excelente empresa, com muitos benefícios depois que passou a ser terex, mudou completamente a cultura."
good,"Lots of room to grow, especially in management position; good company to work for in a strong macro economy, so much of a loyalty when it comes to recession."
good,"Terex is a diversified manufacturer of many different products and world class brand names. There are great opportunities for advancement and relocation between the various business segments and geographic locations. Terex has an extremely active and interesting acquisition history. Unfortunately this can lead to difficulties in integrating all the different systems, people,functions and company cultures."
good,very unorganized and not given the same tools but held to the same standards as your teammates. management seems to have a positive goal in mind and the thought is there but there are no standards in what happens. you have to call 15 places to get an answer that should be a standard process.
good,"Read and comprehend instructions and follow established procedures"
good,"was ok. dodgy H&S  worked there three years, no raises, very little training or development done.  Had to take holidays etc when told as the factory has shut down days"
good,"Terex did not use the knowledge base that manufacturing engineers had. We could not plan our activities with our experience and background but had to follow the directions from upper management which created More issues for the manufacturing engineers to solve.  Two of the managers during my employment allowed me to initiate my plans and ideas along with the support of other team members which and in one activity reduced overtime by $600,000 per year. I never got credit for that either. Into many instances the team members/welders were permitted to do things to equipment that they should never had been permitted but the supervisor was given that authority; Which hindered the manufacturing engineers from implementing logical and useful programs."
good,"I worked a few months for Terex before a layoff in 2009 Iowa was a culture shock, but loved the job."
good,"I left Terex for what I thought was a better opportunity.  If I hadn't left, I would have lost my job because my position is no longer there.  Terex was not a bad place to work."
good,"We are a site-based branch, embedded at a steel making facility.  We work a fast-paced and constantly evolving schedule which results in instability in the workforce,  The constant shifting of schedules and customer processes makes it difficult for our team members to be fully aware of all that is required of them"
good,Im a hard working person that give my very best to achieve my goals.  I have never been afraid to work hard.  I always help other people and try giving my best advise.
good,"I enjoy the daily challenges that are typical in a management role. Wether it be staff, client or company issues I enjoy being able to support the company and department."

good,"Aprendi muito na área produtiva quando comecei e principalmente na área administrativa, como apontamentos, programação e contato direto com a coordenação e gerência da empresa."
good,"Overall good company to work for.  My experience was during the recession so I felt the retraction rather than the growth side of the business.  However, as challenging as it was Terex made decisions that kept them moving forward in a stagnant environment"
good,"i work on the main line building scissor lifts, before i worked here i was a courier for a major company and i have learnt how to hit targets and to adhere to health and safety, and to complete the process in which my job in-tales. Since i have worked there i have also learnt different jobs on the line and the management are ok but feels like we have no support hence the reason i am trying to find a new job."
good,Hours are awesome and some of the people are cool.  i had some issues with management because i wanted to get into welding and i asked multiple times for help with getting the information and my boss said she would help but then she would never help when i needed it.  the benefits are awesome and if you like doing the same thing over and over again its a great job.
good,I learned here how to sale your product even if your competitor is very big and well known like JCB. In my experience of more than one and half month i feel that this company requires very much changes in there after sales service team
good,"-Daily work returning is to schedule Distributors and Customer visit."

good,"I assisted several departments with all the administrative duties which included, for example,travel arrangement, expense reporting, correspondence, preparation of mailing documents for packages, and data entry.  I experienced for the first time working for a corporation.  I enjoyed all my duties as an administrative assistant."
good,"While I was there, the company was in the midst of disposing of several business segments and re-organizing the remaining businesses.  New CFO.   Very casual culture with monthly and quarterly very busy times."
good,"Enjoy my job "
good,If you are a workaholic then this is the place for you. Corporate must be blind to the actual operation and how the manufacturing culture is. The messages are all positive and encouraging but you have to be addicted to work and have no time for family.
good,"productive, easy going as long as you got your work done. Mostly work one on one in cab build unless there was a problem on the production line and I would have to trouble shoot a problem"
good,very good work place nice people all different job roles with opportunities to progress unfortunately I was agency work and my time had ran out with no contract offer .....shame
good,"My almost two years with Terex gave me the opportunity to experience management levels.  The training I received from Terex was outstanding, and I had the support of both management and workers."
good,There's been a lot of changes in the time I've been here from management to the entire organization. The lack of communication between facilities & even within your own facility causes quite a problem most of the time. Maybe if the pay was better & they worked out some of the kinks then there wouldn't be such a high turnover rate.
good,The only reason why this job was good was due to the fact that there was a union. If there wasn't management would have walked all over us.
good,"Great co-workers. Terex has always been behind technology wise, but are moving forward at least with trying new things."
good,After 2 1/2 years at Genie it became clear to me that the only people who work there that have job security are employees with many years with the company. Everyone else is considered expendable and replaceable.

good,Enjoyed Learning the Regulations about Forklift Safety. All Around Nice people and Management
good,"No managerial support, at any level"
good,"Le giornate si sviluppavano attraverso una scaletta di lavori in modo da avere una organizzazione fluida dell'ufficio. Attraverso il sistema gestionale il lavoro era a sua volta ancora di più impostato e semplificato, quindi grazie a questa gestione ho potuto seguire il mio lavoro di creazione del codice senza tanti intoppi avendo all'inizio un ottimo aiuto dai colleghi. Imparando la gestione del codice di ogni particolare ho verificato come un minimo errore in codifica può portare a conseguenze importanti lungo la supply network."
good,Pick and pack orders scanned orders and loaded ups and fed ex trucks.
good,"Terex was a good place to work as it taught me valuable lessons at work, I learnt such skills as time keeping and being able to finish assignments within a certain time frame. A typical day at work here was fun and relaxed as everyone got on within the warehouse and the management made you feel relaxed and not to pressured. the hardest part of the job at the beginning was finishing the work within the desired time as I was new and didn't know much about the job but once id got the hang of it it was easy."
good,"A few short meetings each morning followed by balancing production support with projects."
good,"My normal daily schedule revolved around meeting deadlines before entering month end close.  Close was normally tough and required a lot of overtime.  I work with a great group of people and that will be the one thing I miss.  It has been tough as there have been so many reorganizations, you were always worried when it would become your turn.  The hardest part of the job was SOX compliance.  You could do everything correctly but if you failed to do a screenshot of your report paramaters you could fail the test."
good,answering emails
good,10hr busy day great people to work with i have learned to be prompt at all times be trustworthy and to be a team player this is the terex way quilty work the hardest part of my job is tryingto stay cool the enjoyable part is sending out good work to keep people safe will they are on the genie

good,"Alcançar a meta do dia"
good,I was the only person in company with a CDL so I was used to pick up and deliver customer vehicles. Before that customers had to deliver their equipment. It was a great opportunity for the company to get more business and the customers were very happy with this arrangement.
good,Falta mais empenho  aos lideres de equipe. Empresa desperdiça muito material que da para ser reutilizado.
good,"1. Implementation issues "

good,good co workers but management is lacking. nice pay. nice facility. long hours. not a lot of time for family. i like it and the benifits were great. nice
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. My supervisor stayed on top of things and always made our workplace safe and feasible. Sometimes it was slow and sometimes it was wide open.
good,travail très intéressent avec une équipe agréable et hiérarchie (direct; chef d'atelier)  à l'écoute. Point négatif on travail dans le sens inverse du montage des machines mais c'est le métier qui veut ça. Perspective d'évolution restreinte. Travail pas reconnu par la direction.
good,the working conditions are less than desireable but the knowlage gained it well worth it. if you are willing to learn you can learn it here
good,"A typical day at work is doing various testing for SOX purposes. Whether that's obtaining payroll reports for proper authorization for changes or a report showing fixed assets showing properly authorized writeoffs. Many things can be improved such as the process for new items, current processes, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working there and did not want to be laid off. Worked with nice, smart people. Learned a lot. Excellent supervisor. Worked on CNC machines and the Nitride system."
good,"Mise à jour de nomenclatures de production"
good,"Société orientée international"
good,If you had asked me to write this review a little over a year ago it would have been mostly glowing as a great place to work with opportunity and great benefits and mostly great culture - however things have changed in the last year and a half so much so that I felt compelled to seek other employment.  Please note this review is for the Terex AWP division - your mileage with other divisions may vary.  It became a toxic work environment within that 1.5 years I went from having a great career path to being dead ended and demeaned.  I do not recommend at this time.
good,Working with union employees made it difficult to get the job done.  Management had a hard time getting results due to union involvement. I also did not have back-up coverage for when I was on vacation.  I had to work remote during my vacations.
good,"Terex e uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, porém o momento que vivi dentro da empresa foi um pouco conturbado por lado da Terex, foi um período de muitas mudanças na marca. Mas no geral foi uma boa experiencia."
good,Bad management at location where i worked. Too much office politics and untrustworthy leadership. Team members tried making the best of the situation under draconian leadership.
good,"Great place to work. Plenty of support and encouragement from managers. Management changes so fast, so often, we lose any feeling of trust or loyalty in the new managers that swing through for a moth or so."
good,"Gestão LATAM muito ruim nos ultimos 2 anos. Sem foco, sem metas claras e definidas. Muita vaidade envolvida!"
good,"Fun products to work on and challenging environment.  My experience was prior to Terex ownership, so it may or may not be relevant."
good,"Nice place. Nice people. Pretty stable place to work. Typical day included anything from resolving employee issues to generating new hire paperwork. MS state taxes were taken from payroll, being that this is located in MS."
good,"Started out as a mentoring family type atmosphere, offering training courses and certification classes to further your goals. Some courses were kept, others discarded. Leadership culture was Servant leadership style but depended on who your direct was and how well liked you were. The people that work there are good people trying to live up to corporate expectations."
good,Poor management culture of not my job red tape everywhere. Manager that very rare shows is face on department where mean to manage. Targets impossible to achieve with conditions of work
good,"I lead a team of 10 everyday stood a new challenge but we were persistent. Overcoming any obstacle that we encountered. held meetings discussing safety, cost, delivery, morale."
good,Terex is a flexible place to work. There are many opportunities to grow within.  Terex is located all over the US with 20+ branches and field work. The most enjoyable part of Terex is all of the people.

good,"benefits were great and the pay was great for the location. one of the highest paying jobs in my previous area. the medical and retirement was amazing. as with any other company, there was BS you had to deal with but still the money and benefits were almost worth it."
good,The Genie brand of Terex has a healthy improvement culture and strives to offer careers. I have enjoyed the team I work with.

good,"Learned how to lead a team, how to manage my time and how to work well under pressure with a busy schedule. I completed a supervisor for success course , which helped me a lot, and improved my management skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things each day"

good,"Sono stato bene per quanto riguarda i rapporti con gli altri. Ho avuto qualche piccola gratificazione che mi ha permesso di andare al lavoro serenamente. "
good,Good exposure of machines and tools. Lot to understand in construction machine world. Lot of challenges without much manufacturing in the country. Business sensitivity tied with volatility of construction market.
good,"Pros - I thoroughly enjoyed working at Terex GBS over the past 4.5 years. I was provided with many advancement opportunities that allowed me to truly better my general accounting, payables, receivables, and management skills. I was rewarded for my dedication and enthusiasm with more challenges and responsibilities throughout my time at Terex. The one thing I miss the most was  being able to work with the people from my team on a daily basis. They always made it truly enjoyable to come to work on a daily basis. Overall, Terex GBS is a great place to work and provides numerous advancements within the company and is willing to put you in a position that you would enjoy working at.  "
good,"Good place to work, just no room for advancement. Unless you want to move to out of the State. Small location for a very large company with no way to move up."

good,"overtime always required even when you were out of parts"

Ranging from forecasting sales, producing reports, to meeting customers, holding customer review presentations, plus meeting managers and engineers, presenting change or feedback, or dealing with Human Resource issues."
good,Company with many opportunities and challenges.  No two days are the same.  They are flexible with hours and have great benefits at a low cost.  Great team members to work with.

I was able to move within the organization and gain valuable experience within each different segment. I was rewarded for my dedication and enthusiasm with more challenges and responsibilities. I believe that is why I thrived in this environment. I also received extensive vocational training as well. I served much of my time in this company as a safety representative while fulfilling my primary duties. I am no longer with Terex due to a 40% workforce reduction, and was in no way a reflection of our mutual work relationship. I regard the company and my experience with them as very favorable."
good,It is a great place to work at. I's just the pay and the distance that I have to drive is not worth it for me that's why I am looking for something different but other then that I really enjoy working there.
good,"different areas in the workplace have different moods, for example, in the fitting areas, many people are joyful and happy to work, where as in the machine shop/ fabrications area, there is a lot less excitement for work and more moaning. I feel this is down to there being more elderly gentleman in specific areas, whom are more tired."
good,I enjoyed my seven years at Terex.  I liked the work and the people.  The work was challenging.  I had opportunities for advancement and received a couple of promotions.
good,"I was in a contract role during my time @ Terex.  It seemed like a secure, stable company.  They wanted to hire me full-time, but I couldn't commit to moving to Waverly, IA."
good,"It is a good company  to work. Good health and safety "
good,Company with aggressive culture in the market and not very generous to its employee. You need to work hard to secure your job and can not expect the full support from the management.
good,"The job is easy, the pay and benefits are good...but family life is non-existent. If you can find balance, that's great, but it is definitely not the way things work."

Staff friendly, management ok training good be late sometimes, you may get a permanent position if you survive the heavy lifting."
good,"A good place to start off a career. A lot of trained and seasoned Engineers, very helpful and friendly. Great manufacturing facility with serious and safety-oriented manufacturing practices"
good,It is a good company to work for. I am hoping to get rehired back in there. I quit there to go into training for another line of work. I am hoping to hear from them soon.
good,"Terex teaches their workforce through a variety of programs. The philosophy, the mission and the community outlook is phenomenal. Unfortunately, the workforce is a bit of a revolving door. It is difficult to be effective when management is rotated, or when the pressure to produce cuts into the values of the company. Overall, a great place to develop and gain experience."
good,"Challenging projects with plenty of scope to move around within the business. Hardest part about the job is sometimes a lack of visibility/communication between departments, difficult at times to know what is happening on a daily basis. Management and people skills is very good, although sometimes felt like they were being stretched a bit thin. Alot of meetings and work for different projects internally and externall going on at the one time."
good,"The place had a good team work ethic.  Safety was a big deal and made things flow a lot better.  There wasn't to much overtime, but people were willing to do it."
good,Great people to work with and good atmosphere but management changes managers too often. General managers are replaced quite often which leads to confusion and misunderstanding of rules.
good,Market changes predict number of needed managers and staffing. Attrition of workers due to Management demands high.

good,"I worked at the Terex Cranes plant for 20 years until it's closing in September of 2016.  While employed there, I received excellent training in all aspects of manufacturing."
good,I worked with the Sales Team at Terex Cranes.  I learned that change is hard to implement when you work with a team of very seasoned employees who are happy doing things the way that they've always done them.
good,This a job you need to be able to multitask many projects and be able to drop everything to do projects for top management but still get your work duties complete. people were amazing but could have a better training program.
good,"Genie can be stressful and hard work, but the pay is decent. Construction directly affects our business so layoffs are a regular occurrence.Depending on who your direct bosses are advancement can be difficult. The culture of the team is amazing. Almost everyone is ready and willing to lend a hand if needed. If extra training or advice is needed to effectively perform your job, the other team members a there to help."
good,"Very productive on the job trainning, alot of 'in house' certification to those who were interested in learning sklls you wouldnt ordinarily be exposed to.Decent management that did what it could to come to resonble out comes.Did not enjoy slow times becase of slow crane sales,but really enjoyed the pace when it picke up and loading cranes onto tractor trailers with crane..great people to work with."

good,"Um dia de muitos atendimentos ao cliente, onde venho desenvolvendo atividades relacionadas a manutenção."
good,A typical day at work as briefing other team members of goals to be met though out the day.  Management was a huge part of why Terex was a very fun but challenging place to work.  The hardest part of the job were the challenges that were beyond our control in regards to suppliers.  For the most part Terex used the 14 leadership traits and 11 leadership principals.
good,"Empresa onde adquiri um bom conhecimento na área profissional tendo um ótimo relacionamento com os colegas,gerencia e diretores."
good,"A typical day in shipping would be to log in my computer and check out all shipping schedules fot the day. Find all my units that needs to be shipped. Call in containers for drop off.

good,"Productive environment that meets and exceeds Customer requirements. Innovative and solution driven."
good,"Good work/life balance (almost never took work home with me and rarely worked overtime). As a manufacturing engineer, I had a lot of freedom to choose my own projects (with management input), set my own deadlines, and get my work done without union restrictions or a ton of red tape. I could go into a workshop area and quickly make my own prototypes (if I didn't want to wait for a resource welder or machinist) by machining, welding, or making it out of wood. Laid back culture."

good,"A typical day at work, is to arrive before time of work begins, i've learned to be prompt at all times, be trustworthy, to be a team player, and to stay loyal.

good,My days at Terex would consist of taking completed machines from the production line and doing a final inspection for quality and putting on the final decal and staging them for shipment to dealers. I would load them on trailers and tie them down and do shipping paperwork and keep a shipping log for our records. coworkers were good I actually only worked directly with one other guy and the truck drivers who picked up machines. I also had to work with management directly to get lists of machines and where they were going and then stage them accordingly. my whole job was enjoyable and I can't really pick a hard part at all.

I actually loved going to work every morning, and while the 10 hour shifts seemed long at first, they soon started to fly by as I got to know my work and team better.

good,"good environment, fun people to work with, sometimes the job varies and new parts need to be weld"
good,Overall i enjoyed working at Terex corp. However i was a contract temp through an employment agency which was not what i was looking for.

good,I enjoyed my time with Terex while it was in Denison Texas; once upper management changed hands to roll up under Terex Utilities all organization went out the window and dedicated employees were pushed to the side in order to make room for the boss' pals and lifelong friends.

good,"On the go from 8.30 to 6.00 pm haveing a very varied work load. This was a highly pressurised job, ensuring material at the correct point of use daily. Management usually did not get involved in the day to day running of the business. My co workers were very helpful and polite.

good,I was brought in to turn around a core market that was unfortunately being neglected and had dwindled to almost zero percent new sales as a result.  I built credibility with key target account executives and started earning their trust and business.  Within 3 years we won 75% market share with the core product at target national accounts.  It took a team effort and a new focus on customer service and support.  It was rewarding to improve the company's reputation and earn repeat sales as a result of individual and team efforts.  The most challenging part of the job was working to keep the new branch company management focused on the customer needs.  Product and aftermarket service parts availability during factory consolidation efforts hurt the company but Terex is a great company and will continue to improve as they integrate companies into new divisions.
