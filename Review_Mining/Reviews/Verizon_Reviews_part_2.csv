good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This was a great place to work. Everyday I was learning something new to better myself as a Sales Associate. Repor building skills definitley improved with my experience working here. The hardest part of my job was waiting for the doors to swing. During these times I would go through a list of qualified customers and speak to them about our special promotions that we had going on at the time. I would never stop selling. I think to make a great Sales Associate you need to use every resource you have to make a sale. My co-workers were fun.smart, outgoing to work with and miss them very much. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of accomplishment."
good,"Came into work for a normal day at work which consisted of helping customers on a constant basis, solving their needs, and also selling Verizon Wireless and Residential Services."
good,Fast paced but fun because you are helping people with there computer issues.
good,Fast paced company. I learned a lot about sales and became very proficient in my craft.
good,"As a company, Verizon Wireless is amazing! The people are friendly and seem to want you to succeed. When you first start, it is made known that they want you to make it a career instead of another job. However, the opportunities for advancement are few and far between. The biggest drawback to the job is that it is almost impossible to advance as quick as they tell you can. Typically, the days are what you make them. If you are a people's person and can deal with people's problems without getting your own emotions in the way you will have great days. The hardest part of the job for me was just staying completely detached from any feeling or emotions when being insulted or degraded by customers."
good,"Our employees are our greatest asset and a mirror of our wide-ranging clientele. Here, you find an open, accepting environment where individuals are valued for their unique talents. It's not just good business. It's simply right. And it works."
good,One on one personal training
good,Verizon Wireless was one of the best places to work for. You worked hard and played hard.
good,"Typical day included helping customers find the best phone and phone plans for them, handling customer complaints and concerns, maintaining inventory."
good,"Go to customer's homes, fix/ install phone lines."
good,slow moving blue chip company
good,"I liked working at Verizon wireless, I just wish it was a permanent job."
good,Assisting customers with technical issue regarding phone services.
good,Federal Customer Service Center. Assist customers with billing and service inquiries.
good,"I manage a team of call center employees focusing on coaching, mentoring, and connecting with the customer. I've learned to be patient and listen to the customers. I'm a consumer as well and need to remember this when offering solutions."
good,"• Developed my portfolio of clientele throughout the tri-county area, through lead generation, retention practices and negotiations, customizing deals from single lines to the entire migration of companies."
good,I liked working for Verizon due to the fact it was a challenge because I had to aquire skills I did not obtain.
good,Analyizing accounts an proving customers with total wireless solutions. Ensure customers have a great experience in our stores and leave with what meets their needs.
good,Verizon is a very strict company to work for
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Expect a workout daily, and have plenty of fun working with people. And it was a safe enviornment also."
good,My job was a sales rep you are on call 24/7 especially with your business customers very little time for your family.
good,"Management tried to make it a fun place to work at, but in the end production ruled the day because there was a constant stress on sales of one kind or another. I felt bad or the sales people because it seemed that most were all in one way or another scared of getting fired because offailure to make a quota. What made it worse was the fact that a customer could have been a giagantic waste of their time in more ways than one."
good,At Verizon you must take each call and work to the best of your ability not only to give the customer good customer service but to sell to the need and wants of each and every customer. Hardest part of the job was changes in packages and non working systems. Products and services not availble to all consumers. Internal problems which made placing orders difficult at times.
good,answer phone call assisting customers in trouble shooting problems with their phones or wireless data cards.
good,"My job was to come in and speak to customers all day about paying their late bills. My coworkers made my day go by quickly & were always eager to help if I needed. My supervisors were also very willing to help without complaint if I requested. The supervisors left us to do our jobs without looking over our shoulders, which was very relaxing. The hardest part of the job was when the customers were irate, but that wasn't very often. Overall, it was a nice place to work."
good,Verizon is a great company. Currently not going in direction that will benefit loyal clients or employees. Top level management does not seem to be engaged with the industry needs.
good,Cutomer service and sales. Took care of customers finding out the need of the customer and placing them in the right phone. Deal with customer service issues and resolve issues.
good,"Great company, learning experiences, and staff were friendly to work with"
good,Highly Sales driven position. Love helping the consumers with their phone concerns and upgrading their phone and educating them on how the phone works. Management was fine. No micro-management which made the job easier to do. Co-workers were ok but highly competative. The hardest part was as a store meeting our goals.
good,"Typical day at work consists of going to several locations, motivating the sales crew, discuss current store goals with the manager and marketing suggestions to promote the store. During my time here I really put to use a lot of my leadership course to use. I believe with this position I grew as a leader. My co-workers are fantastic. They work together great as a team, and get things done. The hardest part of my job is giving a store or store manager bad news, whether it's an improvement plan or a closing of a store. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with sales reps on improving their sales pitch and seeing the confidence they have with their job."
good,"taking over the phone residenital install orders, offering products to inhance their phone experience, helping customers with their bills, what I learned is how offer products that would make the customer happy, management sometimes wasn't fair with certian projects, however I still gave a 100%, co-workers was great, offering service to someone who would be calling about 2 cents o their bill, the most enjoable part was when I was able to resolve an issue with needing management."
good,Good place to work. Lots of outsourcing off shore.
good,"Verizon was a great place to work with wonderful staff. All in all, I had a very positive learning experience."
good,Verizon Wireless has been a great employer. I have been encourage to take lead in projects in my store that I have felt would benefit the team. Our management in very knowledge and very willing to take the time to teach you how to succeed. I have had to learn how to balance taking time to complete inventory demands with spending time on the floor help customers. Verizon Wireless is a very goal driven company that is always changing and always pushing forward.
good,"This job provides decent pay, very good benefits, but is stressful beyond all belief."
good,I enjoyed learning how to handle cell phone and the most I liked management they were very patient with us. Good hours to work had good benefits. I never knew how important it is to have a cell phone there is many things we can get out of them.
good,"My typical day at work was somewhat unpredictable because I worked out of a call queue and you never knew what issue you would get a call on. It made the day exciting as sometimes you would get those out of the ordinary calls that you had to spend a lot of time on to resolve. I was always learning something new, got to speak to a lot of nice customers routinely."
good,"A typical day of work consists of upgrading customers' current phones, resolving customer issues and complaints, and proactively looking for ways to get additional lines of service for customers with a variety of different products and services. I've learned how to deal with the general public and how to discover customer needs and desires in order to drive more business for the company. The management and coworkers are great. We have a great work environment with a very close team. This is definitely a tribute to the management team that has helped everyone mesh alongside one another and push each other to achieve the goals needed to succeed. I really enjoy working with my coworkers and management. The atmosphere that has been created is incredible. We all get along and are willing to help each other improve, which is much different than when I had originally started working with Verizon; our team has come a long ways. It's also exciting to wake up every day knowing it's not going to be the same as the day before. I love the challenge of having to uncover my customers every day lives and turn that into a way to put a new product in their hands that will increase productivity for their lives."
good,"Inbound Call Center sales. Typical day was approx 8am- 7pm. 5 days a weeks. Handled incoming calls for new and existing verizon customers. I worked with an incredible team, and we were the number one office in the Verizon footprint for 3 years in a row."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,No real complaints about the job. Its a job that has benifits and negatives.
good,My daily routine included the following:
good,Interesting place to work. Opportunity for growth. flexible work schedule.
good,"Bonuses every year. Ive never worked in a job that gave bonuses. So that was a plus. But its your typical customer service job. Nothing more, nothing less."
good,"No movement in the degree I am pursuing, So I am looking for other options for employment."
good,We were the ILEC in certain parts of NC and provided Solutions for government and education departments in NC and SC customers
good,"Verizon was a great company when it was GTE. GTE was famrily oriented, cared about its customers. However when they became Verizon there were many changes some good and some bad. Verizon paid well but due to upper management spent enormous amount of money for fiber to the premise which put Verizon in the hole. We all worked together the best we could to make sure our customers were taken care of."
good,"It was a great place to work with plenty of training.I attended training facilities in Albany,Pennsylvania,Ohio and Illinois throughout my career. Towards the end though the training slowed down quite a bit. I worked for many managers throughout my career, but there were just a couple of real standouts among them that I would do anything for."
good,If you are not punctual and cannot produce this is not the place for you. The Fiber Solution Center is a call center environment and has high stress. You must be technical and have great customer service skills
good,"Working in a fun and careing enviroment, with a team of Blingual Reprsentatives, Very helpful team of supervisors that took their time to teach, train, and listen to our needs. It was very competetive since we hand over ten members in ten different teams with their own supervisors to see how much we sold through inbound/outbound calls."
good,Great experience lots to learn from the company I’m glad I have the sales experience from that job unfortunately I moved away just before I had been there a year I wish I could go back and have a redo
good,"Initial training is very good & comprehensive; then each Unit manager has slight variations as to how they perceive good customer service vs upholding VZW policy so there are informational conflicts in providing a definitive, best approach understanding. Too much rote repetition with heavy daily call volume makes a very dull existence which is often the case in call centers that override the personal approach to focus on micromanagement grading & report cards."
good,"Always a different kind of day working here. Some days will be very slow and full of just tech issues, some days will be very busy and all commission work."
good,"Great benefits, management is on you all the time to hit quotes that are unattainable most of the time. Stressful culture. Was laid off twice in 2.5 yrs. I don’t recommend working at Verizon."
good,Did not manage projects very well and pay subcontractors well below industry market rates resulting in low retention rate with contractors. I would not work for this company again.
good,"Verizon is a very big company and its India division has around 5000 employees. Workplace is quite comfortable, Hardest part is to deliver the work quick enough to beat the market competition. But there is a lot of learning opportunities being provided for career growth and development."
good,"Good job, poor work/life balance. Overall it was a great company to work for as long as you don't mind working long hours. My management was competent"
good,"Productive and Dynamic place to work in. company culture was good. Made some good friends. Consultants are treated like second class citizens which i did not like,"
good,Fast paced work environment where priories can change quickly. A great place to work and learn the wireless sales business. Verizon offers some of the best benefits in the industry and has a great pedigree for delivering strong results.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"In the beginning, it is very exciting, but once you have been there long enough you learn just how ridiculous the company can be with policies that literally are not necessary."
good,Great place to work as long as they’re not paying you to leave! I have had some of the best managers and worked with awesome people. My work was important and challenging but very worth it. Leadership is motivating
good,"Great pay, but more opportunities are needed. In the retail side, you could level up to a General Manager, but very few movements after that. So you will have to initiate your own path outside of that."
good,"Having had the opportunity to work in 2 large markets with Verizon; I found that I was able to broaden my spectrum of influencer's, coupled with a wealth of knowledge.  With the constant growth within wireless, data wireless and iOT; I became very diverse in my sales solutions thus allowing me to create long term partnerships with my clients."
good,Learned allot from this company. Before closure of the call center the stress was high on leadership. Great benefits and compensation. Unrealistic goals at times.
good,Advancement opportunities within corporate for those willing to put the time and effort into political maneuvering. Work/Life balance varies by department. Exempt employees should expect to work more than 40 hours a week to achieve expected results. Great benefits and generous tuition reimbursement. Good opportunities to advance by moving between departments.
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. The open work environment does take some getting used to. The morale is a little low because many co-workers have taken ""the package"" and others have been laid off. Many disgruntled workers."
good,I worked nights and went through emails to see what was on the agenda that night. Updated routers and switches and made backups and monitored any work being done by contractors. Learned a lot about networking. Management was a mixed bad of good and bad. The culture was good. All employees helped each other. The hardest part of the job was being on call every 6 weeks or so.
good,Nice place to get paid and benefits package. Not flexible for associates with small children. The company is changing the culture but very slow and don’t get input from employees.
good,"Good place to work. Really result driven. Great opportunities to advance if you apply yourself.  "
good,"It's a basic call center job, where the company profit is the most important thing.  Pay was pretty good, benefits are pretty good,  but felt like just a number and not a person. "
good,"Great company if you enjoy innovative technology. Great benefits like health, dental, 401k, and also discounts. Large portion of pay come from sales performance when about 70% of the job involves technical support, troubleshooting, or account issues. Compensation is declining rapidly. Competiting companies are closing in on Verizon as a whole."
good,my experience was not the best the last 1.5 years due to my direct manager.  I am not sure this is typical in other departments and upper management..
good,"IT Manager wears multiple hats. High level job function includes : "
good,Verizon was a good company to work for.  Training was good.  Job security was adequate.  The company needs to improve management and professionalism.  I was grateful for the opportunity.
good,"typical say would be  answering calls concerning cellphone issues .i learned  how to trouble shoot cell phone technology ,networking as well as internet of things."
good,"Good company,, to work for at the time emails cell phones all those things was popular and just getting activated so is a very good time the company Verizon was one of the first companies to do and go into the internet world"
good,"I originally applied at VZW as a fallback while waiting for my clearance to come through on a government job.  After training and seeing how the company took care of its employees, when I received that call, I declined the job offer with the state and stuck it out with Verizon for just shy of 10 years before the call center closed. I saw many opportunities in that time for career advancement.  My initial salary more than doubled from when I was hired through raises and promotions.  There was a steady decline in the quality of benefits.  Over time, management became more numbers focused and less caring about the culture or environment created for their frontline and middle management workers.  It was a slow shift in the culture.  Our center did lots to curb it, but it was inevitable.  I don't fault Verizon for closing and I have a better life as a result of working there."
good,My job with Bell Telephone which evolved into working with Verizon was a Amazing time in my life .I learned many technical skills the work atmosphere was safe and respectful.The training was complete pertaining to job skills needed to perform all duties necessary.My tenure as a splicing technician and P.A.ONE CALL Specialist was demanding as well as rewarding.
good,"Great place to work. Excellent Pay. You'll earn every dime. Great benefits. You'll learn a lot. There can be long hours, rewarding projects and great incentives. The management style varies by area, but overall the management was good. There is always an emphasis on culture and improving the culture so that goes a long way."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Decent pay, horrible management, great benefits. If you have never worked in a call center environment before, they don't prepare you on how to deal with certain situations, you have to adapt and overcome."
good,When I worked for Verizon it was a good company to work for until towards the end when mergers and adopting of other companies culture really brought the experience down from what it had been. This is the reason I took the early retirement package.
good,Good Pay & benefits. No room to advance. Jobs & titles were controlled by the Unions & all that mattered was the date you started. No incentives to do a better job.
good,Great culture of people helping people. Large company with big company problems. You are in control of your career and the company offers plenty of opportunities for you to explore your interests.
good,Good learning and decent people around to work with. There is a good work life balance in the organization. Work from home is also encouraged. Along with that for fitness there is nice and gym and well trained trainers.
good,Verizon provides great benefits with health care and pay is also decent but the company’s employee orientation has drop significantly. Hardest part of the position is finding growth in already existing customer or getting customers in the store.
good,"This was 100% commission based. We travelled with a team member to our specified territory.  If one team member gave false information or looked disinterested, both team members would fail."
good,"Worked in several locations  including remotely at home office.  Typical day required interfacing with numerous employees to gather information for the project.  I learned from the folks I interfaced with and was able to complete my assignments and develop friendships and resources. "
good,This is a good sales position. Verizon is a good company with a good reputation. Outside of gripes about the cost of service. Verizon customers are leveled which is all a salesman can ask for.
good,"people are great. great diversity, telecommuting is available and flexibility to take time off when needed/necessary to meet your family needs. open space environment."
good,I've worked with Verizon Wireless off and on as a Contractor for 5 years.  During my time at Verizon I have  learned a lot about the process of creating Purchase Orders and watching over them from beginning to the close of the Purchase Ordrer
good,"Solid job, good pay but limited advancement.  Good bonus structure and benefits, ok vacation allowance, takes a long time to acrue any large amount of vacation. Beginning to move to an outsource model for many jobs."
good,"I’m a detailed-oriented team player with proven delivery of customer friendly business results.  Works well independently as well as under supervision.  Expressing strong work ethics, exhibit strong energy and drive. A"
good,Good place to work  nice atmosphere great time off and great benefits nice co workers morale was good. Manager not always on the same page but the for the most part great place to work the company moved so I had to leave.
good,"Fun place to work, good benefits.  Everything depends on who you report to directly.  Big time Fortune 15 culture when it comes to doing everything to maximize shareholder value."
good,They are too rigid to work with people that have families because they do not care what issues arise. You get fired for doing what needs to be done for your family.
good,"I worked for Verizon for 4 years and my overall experience was good. As a sales representative the micro management is at an extremely high level which I did not enjoy. On the contrary the benefits and pay were pretty good. Although it is hard for any hands on parent to work in a sales position with the company I would definitely recommend the job to anyone willing to work long hour. Your work life will depend heavily on your management team so if you do not feel comfortable with your management team, transfer to a different location because they have the ultimate say on everything at their store location."
good,It is a large company that always focuses on getting more done with less than necessary number of people. It has a huge burden to move a legacy business model to a fast-moving dynamic enterprise.
good,I loved working for Verizon. Kept busy but not too difficult. A lot of customer service experience. Got a sense of counting inventory. Light cleaning.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I worked for 2 different teams over the course of 4+ years.  The majority of time I worked remotely as a recruiter and sourcer for other recruiters. I enjoyed the work environment with my team.
good,It was a job could've created a career from it.. I personally don't think it's for everybody.very stressful environment but the pay was great. 3 of 5 rate
good,"Nice company to work on. "
good,"The best part of the job is being on the cutting edge of wireless technology and assisting / sharing the technology with the customers.   "
good,"After your immediate manager you are just a number worked there for several years was great until the company went nation wide and became Verizon. At that point you lost all personalization as an employee then the lay-offs started in 2004ish and the reorganization’s constantly.  Every year since you are waiting for the hammer to fall in September, Will you survive another one??!"
good,"Was paid well, and has good benefits, lots of discounts on cell phones etc. Can work from home as needed, generally everyone is happy to come to work."
good,Things changed at my location as the company merged with other Telcoms.  it became more profit oriented rather than customer service.   it was all about the numbers rather than taking the time to service the customers needs.
good,"Incredible benefits package with 401K, WFH opportunities and excellent health, dental, vision, etc.  There are constant layoffs, however, and little room for advancement due to being very top-heavy."
good,"For most, it is a job. An 8-5 show up and get it done march where every day bleeds into the next. There are good things and the culture is good but for an entry-level person, you need to work hard to differentiate yourself."
good,Good Benefits.Lot of opportunities to work in multiple projects. Work load is a lot so be prepared to work evenings and weekends.Good place to get early experience before moving on to newer organizations.
good,Schedule changes every 6 months is hard when you have a kid. Benefits are wonderful best type I’ve ever had. They do have some 4x10 schedules which aren’t terrible 3 breaks and 1 hour lunch. But overall great company to work for. You may get one terrible leader but other than that they have options for every life situation.
good,Great culture and drive for success. There is always a new gear and another level to achieve.  You will manage multiple tasks at all levels. With hard work upward movement is possible.
good,"I had a great time working for fantastic small business owners in Erie, Pennsylvania. I had the ability to work on a day to day basis helping customers understanding their phone plans, new cell phones, and what products Verizon offered. Getting to know the customer makes it easy to understand what they need, what they are comfortable using, and what other products could save them money or improve their cellular communication."
good,District meetings were very eventful and full of interactions and activities. The store culture was good depending on the store you worked in. Overall a good working environment.
good,Stressful. I saw many coworkers go out on stress leave or leave in ambulances.  This is not for the faint of heart.  You are just a number and replaceable.
good,"I enjoyed my 33+ years ad GTE Data Service/Verizon.  The people I worked with were great and would not trade the experiences gained for anything."
good,"Good company with great benefits. The pay is good, but advancement has much more to do with who you know and how you answer interview questions than actual work abilities."
good,"Customer service and sales/problem solving on a daily basis."
good,Really enjoyed the training. Called my peer mentors and close relationships developed. Constantly evolving quota targets and shifting company initiatives were challenging and stressful.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It was overall a great place to work - the commission structure changed too frequently, though, and you wouldn't track what you would be paid for hitting goals."
good,Good pay good benefits and good co workers experience.  It some opportunities to grow in the company not many.  It really don’t have a lot of flexibility if you want to go to school and work full time.  Only a few managers there to help you grow the rest just don’t care for their employees
good,"Depending on other commitments you have, the work/life balance is ehh.  There is plenty of time ""offered"" to take off, but that depends on the vacation calendar not already being full.  If you're stuck with answering the phone, be prepared for micromanaging and staying past your scheduled shift (some days).  You'll have to choose between having a snack at a certain time and using the restroom, otherwise your adherence will suffer.  The culture is great and very inclusive.  No one is left out and there are trainings throughout the year to help with resume building, branding, etc.  The people are awesome too.  I've made some great friends along the way, but the job isn't for everyone especially if you're used to freedom.  Oh and shift bids!  You'll be split up from your team members and likely end up with a new supervisor."
good,"Good work environment. Plenty of advancement opportunities.  8,000 yearly for education included in salary package.  Benefits effective first day of employment."
good,"Work Culture centered around results, and while the company is generous with its compensation and benefits, the work environment is turn and burn. The culture of engineering first became less and less important. Time to marker caused issues with quality."
good,"Amazing health benefits! "
good,Verizon is a great place to work for a stable job.  The culture is nice and a typical day is good.  The management supports you and the culture is team like.  The hardest part of the job is trying to resolve complex issue while dealing with multiple channels of business.
good,Fast paced and very data driven. Great place to be on the cutting edge of technology.  Extremely smart co-workers made the day move quickly and increase learning curve.
good,work life balance was poor but the pay was good if you are good at selling. management was nice and laid back. YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANGRY CUSTOMERS
good,Decent company to work for. Benefits and compensation are outstanding but leadership has taken a nose dive over the past five to six years. Advancement is difficult due to being a cog in the machine. You really have to go over the top to make yourself stand out.
good,"Company provides excellent benefits. The work life balance isn't great, especially since its a retail schedule. The pay is great, not as good as it used to be though."
good,"Good pay, especially for commissioned employees like me"
good,"Typical work day is helping customers through the sales process. Whether they came in to upgrade their phone or add a line to the existing account. Your job is to handle the reason they are there but also make them aware of new products and attempt to sell them these additional products and/or services. My Co-workers are the best part of the job. Verizon hires amazing people.  You are very lucky if you work in a store with awesome Management as well. Each store has 4 managers. Stores go through many changes. The hardest part of the job is handling the daily pressure of lofty sales goals and monthly quotas. It's also difficult to have a family life because you are working nights, weekends and holidays and it's not a consistent schedule. Every week you have different days off and they are not always in a row. Sometimes you have to work 8,9,10 days in a row before getting days off."
good,"Pay and benefits were great.  Work/life balance was a joke, it didn't exist.  The job has a way of consuming your ENTIRE life.  Personal sacrifices have to be made (i.e. family time, education, etc)"
good,Great environment and the employee determines their future. If you work hard it is rewarded and I saw many people advance to other positions over the course of their career.
good,"Verizon is a wonderful place to work.  I enjoyed the years spent growing and learning.  My management was very approachable and supportive.  I worked in a very fast paced, but friendly environment, which kept me motivated."
good,"As a leading sales rep at Verizon Wireless, you are in charge of many daily tasks. Leading the morning motivational meetings, reviewing previous days numbers and counting cash drawers and opening the retail location are just a few. I developed many sales and leadership skills while working for Verizon due to the upper management mentorship culture. The late night hours were the only aspect of the job that didn’t work with my lifestyle as a mother at the time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a great company to utilize your skills. For years now the company continues to evolve and change, requiring employees to change jobs with some to no notice, and potentially be without a job internally due to terms of  transformation. Being mobile is a key essential, and self motivated development internally and externally."
good,"I had a base of 200 to 250 accounts that I was responsible to grow and retain.  All customers were $10,000 plus monthly billers and were handled as total solutions sales, CPE, NETWORK, SUPPORT, and MAINTINENCE. I was consistently above my sales quota and recognized as a top producer.  I was also chosen as part of a nation-wide team assigned to restructure the support model for the ALLSTATE Insurance contract"
good,"Pay and benefits were pretty good for a job that didn't require a degree, but the place needed some work in work life balance. Reliance on shift bids for scheduling can make it very difficult to have a schedule that lets you have much of a life outside of work."
good,Verizon was a big experience. It was exciting because of the people that walked and to be apart of someone excitement of getting a product. Only thing that really was unprofessional was the Management .
good,"Verizon is a fast paced work environment.  If you don't like change you won't like working there.  There's a reorganization every time you turn around as well as constant changes to both databases and processes which fosters a lot of confusion. There were times when employees didn't really know what they did anymore or who was even doing a specific function.  Generally, moral is very low.  Most assignments are given rapid fire with little time to prep correctly.  Sometimes no one even knew how to implement a process since all the knowledgeable employees had moved on.  Verizon is a company that likes meetings to have meetings.  You found yourself attending meetings more than actually doing work.  Often times you wondered where the company was really going."
good,Verizon offers great training on new products and new sales and customer service techniques that you are able to carry on to different jobs.   Great place to work.
good,"Verizon is good place to work.  However, working in operations could be very demanding depending on what organization you worked for.  Most teams (NOCs) where 24/7 365 days of the year.  Tier 1 managers/supervisors were constantly putting out fires in the network.  A lot of pressure was put on the Tier 1 management teams from executive leadership to resolve outages in timely manner.   Tier 2 managers jobs are less stressful and there is more time to pour into your team and make necessary changes to optimize your team roles."
good,Its a great place to work. They allow you freedom to do your job within limits. The compenation and salws trips are amazing. Goals are streatch but reachable in most cases.
good,Verizon was a fun and innovative place to work. Very diverse technologically and very progressive. Verizon offered flexibility and training. Verizon prides itself on being cutting edge
good,"Manage, coach, develop and motivate supervisors and representatives in Customer Care, Global Technical Support and Core Support back up. Partner with employees to create, implement and drive reward systems to build a strong culture of inclusion and performance excellence. Analyze statistical trends and opportunities by utilizing reporting tools while leveraging partnerships within the center and area operations team. Demonstrate the ability to strategically solve complex problems in a timely manner. Oversee management of customer service processes, advocate of change management and accountable for meeting/exceeding deliverables for the call center. Actively commit to daily floor management and engagement with all call center employees to drive morale and to address issues real-time."
good,the job its self was a little disorganized but that was because of the district managers the company just started up in a small town and they were not very fair.. I enjoyed the people I worked with sales consultants but it felt like they didn't let me advance like I could of this was a third party company not Verizon direct. I was the manager for 4 months and all my goals and gpa was met but then the district manager wasn't able to do his job so he stepped down and took my positon which was not even legal...
good,"Good company, well run,   Focused too much on cost cutting.  Transitioning towards a younger company but still an old school phone company with lots of bureaucracy."
good,"Working in the call center side of Verizon seemed to be fun and challenging at first, but then quickly became about meeting stats which then became very stressful."
good,"I promoted quickly in the company. Promotions seemed to be unfairly given to some people at times. It's very political. Prior to the mass hiring the company did in 2014, things were great! The company spent money on its employees and threw parties and gave out gifts. After they hired hundreds more people, they couldn't afford to provide  free things anymore and they got cheap with company events. Management was about half and half as far as being helpful, friendly, and fair. Supervisors were treated worse than the frontline employees and were not given pay raises when the hiring pay was raised. This made some agents make very close to what supervisors made on salary which was not fair."
good,"OVer all the company is good to work for, but in individual departments it can vary from site to site. and there can be some cliquishness. But they  do provide opportunity for those who are self motivated"
good,The local mangers are very helpful. Job advancement opportunities are few and far between. Overall my time at Verizon as a manager and contractor was good.
good,Verizon was a great company to work for.  i spent 15 years there.  I hated my commute and if not for a 2+hr commute i would still be there.  i would recommend the company for any young professional
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"very busy call center environment, must adhere to minimum call handle time, no personal items allowed on your work station, monitoring on all calls, work in close proximity to your co-workers"
good,If you want to work hard and get paid good for your efforts come here. However you will sacrifice so much. You will miss parties and birthdays and such and such. The choice is yours.
good,"I work there as a contractor."
good,despite the credo to focus on the customer most of the time internally was internally focused. Much of the day was dominated by internal calls and internal process drove direction
good,Great Pay and Benefits. Should have given ex Fios employees a better opportunities in the company after the Frontier merger. Overall Verizon is good company to work for.
good,"Pros:"
good,Its Good. Some things still need some changes and has to work on employee. Done have more to say. it is a good company to work with and good opportunity as starters in the industry
good,Worked at Verizon for a few months and the company was a normal corporate environment with a pleasant working environment. Good onsite perks and co workers were courteous.
good,The best benefits out there. Paid maternity and paternity leave. Discount on wireless plans. 401k 6% match and profit sharing. It is hard with the hours to have a good work/life balance especially with small children.
good,"Nice environment, pension, compensation, health care for technician.  No pension, and high premium for health care as local manager. Less training in management."
good,"it was an ok company to work for but growth is slow. its a union shop so it can be even more challenging ,,,,....../////////////////////////////////////"
good,I actually worked for a subcontract for Verizon. My direct supervisor was deceitful and dishonest. We were mislead about income potential and our immediate supervisors displayed no leadership skills whatsoever.
good,Solid place to work but center closed due to home base agents.  High on Quality and Assurance.   Your rating was derermined by customers feedback on surveys.  Culture was not very employee friendly.
good,"working for them was good. the people were great, sometimes customers were a little difficult but you learn to manage around it. sales could get a little stressful at times and managers would be on top of those not performing"
good,"Overall, Verizon as a company has the opportunity to provide their employees with a great work life balance option. Unfortunately, as a company Verizon falls short. For some office positions the schedules are great but for those in the technology sector not so much. It's virtually impossible due to consumer demand to have a schedule where one does not have to work on the weekend within that employee's first 5 years of employment. 5 to 7 years is long time to go without having regular weekends off especially if a family is involved."
good,"Verizon pays well and has amazing benefits. The challenge is that unless you plan to work retail forever with no regular schedule and a roller coaster of positive and negative interactions with shoppers, there really isn’t much growth opportunity."
good,"The call center was a 24hr call center that had fluctuating hours. Every couple of months the schedule changed and no one had a choice in which what team they were on to get the desired hours. For times worked and the amount of work, the compensation did not seem worth it."
good,Verizon is a great place to work.  Managers are very supportive and friendly.  There is always room for advancement if you ware willing to work for it.  Jobs are daily deadline driven with often high pressure situations.
good,"It is a daily routine of setting up the Field Techs with work to keep them busy all day, make sure the calendars are open for the Customer Service Reps to create orders for our customers with a decent due date."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The company has some of the best benefits and insurance packages there are. Schedules are electronically managed down to the minute. Culture and management quality depends on the location. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. Great coworkers and friends. Hardest part of the job is the absolute stress of trying to maintain customer service as well as hitting performance metrics.
good,"get assignment in morning and leave garage,  local management pretty good but upper level micro-manages. just do the work you are assigned and they pretty much leave you alone.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the micro-management.  Fellow techs are great to work with ."
good,You get what you put into your work. Balance your time and devote effort to the areas that matter and you can make it. Surrounding yourself with correct mentors will help your development.
good,"Good place to work if you get in with the right leadership. If your unlucky and get a not so good boss it will ruin your career. They take an employee minded stance, but really quit delivering on it starting around 2014. Ridiculous quotas to only keep making the same money as when they were lower and management wasn't experienced enough to coach and mentor correctly. The benefits and perks can be great, but again you just have to have the right leadership. In my 7 years I had great to horrible and it really makes a difference."
good,"Overall, this company offers excellent benefits but you really need to keep up with the fast-paced job and frequent changes. "
good,"The job was great, however the company terminated the position to cut overhead. They keep cutting corners as a company and make it harder and harder for the sales reps to make quotas so they can pay them less. They have made terrible decisions about where the future of cellular technology is going and wasted millions on Oath."
good,If it had not of been for the declining calls in my department I would still be working. They offered a buyout. Job security is why I decided to leave.
good,Verizon has provided me with the opportunity to work in a skilled occupation with minimal supervision.  Verizon rewards employees who can competently complete their jobs efficiently
good,"Its a great company,i am bleassed to have the pleasure of working with a good company.Ive meet some good people and made some life long friends...…..."
good,"It was good at the time.  I was let go, but they gave me a good package.  I heard they keep letting people go.  All my friends at Verizon Wireless are looking for new jobs outside the company now.  It's all about the sales.  Sales jobs are staying for now."
good,"At the time I was there, the benefits are what got me there and kept me there for over 11 years. Unfortunately, after over 30 applications and 15 interviews put in to move forward in my career with them, I realized that I only had a job with them and not a career. I wanted, needed and desired for myself."
good,"looks great on your resume, So much experience and employers love the problem solving, negotiating and diffusing volatile customers. I made a ton of great friends who was always willing to help me if i got stuck on a difficult call."
good,"It is for some people not for all. I know nothing about technical support till Verizon took a chance on me. They provided alot of resources to me, and they offer a lot resources to your family."
good,Very high energy and dynamic. It's hard to judge as a consultant the real dynamics of the planning and execution. Most of the staff is anxious about the future plans.
good,"Verizon was a great environment to work in, great people and a good amount of benefits. I would highly recommend Verizon to any person looking to boost their sales skills."
good,Constantly changing technologies and rules. Challenging to trouble shoot and solve complex problems with a diverse group of people. Frequently feeling unappreciated by management staff.
good,"verizon was a good place to work , the benefits and pay were great and the atmosphere was employee orientated. vacation time and sick time are available if needed. alot of traiing is done for reps which is paid and advancement is possible."
good,Great pay but you will earn every dine with micro management. If you are willing to relocate this is the company for you. A lot of busy account work leaves little time to sell.
good,"I liked working here, all jobs can be stressful though, and it has been very stressful at times. I really appreciate the benefits though. There is a lot of change happening all the time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"At the time that manager the interconnect group was one of the best managers I've ever had."
good,"Solid, aside from layoffs and voluntary separation offers.  I love the work I do, and enjoy working there.  I just wish the company cared more about my 17 years of dedication."
good,"The company has made efforts to make the job more efficient, yet they cut stay by at least 20% per store (about 5 people)."
good,While the people and managers were great it is a fail upwards company.   If you do well in your roll they will push you to your breaking point and if you do just enough to where they want to get rid of you and cant they will end up promoting you.
good,"Verizon use to be a place you could work at for 20 years or more.  Not so much anymore since there has been regular downsizing that appears to be continuing due to heavy debt load the company has taken on.."
good,"You work hard and have flexibility to make your own decisions with the company in mind though.  I was fortunate enough to know all the systems (there are a lot) so I could make decisions.  If you didn't, then it was hard to make them."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits, great supervisors.  I enjoyed working for this company but moved out of the area.  I need to be closer to my home due to family obiligations."
good,"When I first obtained my job at Verizon, I vowed to dedicate my career to the company and to ride out my career with them until I was ready to retire. Over the years, with all of the twists and turns the company as taken, and with all of the layoffs the company has executed, I slowly started to see this dream come to an end. "
good,A good place to work but limited advancement opportunities. Upper management seems to mold a typical perspective that may be old and outdated. Diversity in upper management can be improved. Overall this was a great company to work for.
good,"It is a very structured environment driven by scorecard that allows you be close to trends and changes in behavior.  Supporting high volume call centers is never boring. It allows you to be part of a very dynamic environment that keeps your adrenaline up at all times. You have the autonomy to influence the performance thru action plans, sharing results, coaching and training to change the course of how the front line employees care for the customer and are able to drive revenue up and expense down."
good,I looked forward to interacting with the customers and co-workers every day at work because they brought about a sense of comfort and pleasure to be in a work place where every one is friendly and on the same page. all though I do wish there were more opportunities for growth at the time I would still nonetheless recommend this job to others.
good,"Good benefits and stability, however has been eroded due to outdated union structure weighing down cost structure. Also, these is a bias towards compliance and promotions are often from outside the company."
good,Great employees.   Stressful job.  Great salary. Alot of rules and regulations.  Verizon has very strict policies that you have to follow.  Also very fast paced.
good,"Great place to work for a career driven individual, Verizon provides a lot  of advancement opportunities .my only concern is the lack of work life balance"
good,Good company to work for with great benefits and career opportunities. I worked my way up from a retail sales representative to a manager in a matter of 8 years.
good,"It is you typical call center.  You have great managers and you have bad ones, it's all part of the business.  If you can handle the mental stress it's not a bad place to work."
good,Depends on what department you start with. Some departments don’t have enough openings for promotions. No sick time really available. Job security is awesome for some departments but for others there is constant layoffs. Multiple hireing freezes a year.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a very fast paced Job. There are many metrics to stay on top of, but overall the culture and management are good. Sometimes dealing with the public and the work life balance are tough."
good,"A typical day at work is very demanding depending on your customer accounts."
good,"has small game room .Progressive company that is competitive in the industry."
good,"Although I don't plan to stay with the company long-term, without the Tuition Reimbursement program, I would not be where I am today. I will always be grateful for Verizon for providing this opportunity."
good,"hard to balance life and work. overall good place to work and grow. Paid for my undergrad and grad; great 401k, good working environment. management can be difficult to manage"
good,"start the day with a sales meeting."
good,keep up your stats and all is well. learned a lot from the company especially with enhancing my customer service skills. great benefits and great pay.
good,"Most of the management and staff know the job and what they are doing, but the drawbacks are like any other call center.  The constant mental stress of dealing witht he customers issues and emotions while meeting your individual and team goals"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Verizon Wireless.  The salary and benefits were enough to allow me to live a comfortable lifestyle, even if I didn't have as much of a work/life balance as I would have preferred.  In all fairness, however, as a commissioned sales representative working a retail schedule, this is to be expected.  "
good,Verizon is a pretty decent place to work. Calls come in very heavily and steadily at a fast pace. You have to be ready for disgruntled customers. Overall it’s a good place.
good,"Work-life balance is a major trade off to be successful in this position. If you are looking for a simple sales role with flexibility, go elsewhere. The pay was great if you were good at what you do but, not for those without a strong drive. The hourly is not nearly enough to support yourself or a family so you have to make up for it with sales. The benefits were great and there were many incentives offered to be successful. Management can make or break the experience."
good,"A typical day at work was moderately stressful, but Verizon has a good diverse group of positive minded people that keep the company's culture happy.  I learned the technical side of telecom and a variety of different remedy-based applications.  The management team is fair and understanding.  They go out of their way to assist.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant layoffs and disregard for employees with no feedback on cause or reason.  Nobody knows how layoffs are selected and what are the key priorities .  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and culture.  Great place to make friends while working."
good,The culture and expectations are completely dependent on the department and management. Compensation and benefits have always been very good. Upward mobility depends on ability to relocate and your particular career path.
good,Overall company is a good place to work for depending on the location a lot of incentives to make great money at the time (2years ago) managers are overwhelming at times.
good,"Productive, competitive,career advancement opportunities. I learned a lot working for the company. If you work and do your job you can definitely move up well past entry level"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The company provided decently considering the industry trends. The truth is that retail sales in the consumer space is no longer a flourishing industry. The internet is becoming more informative, more convenient, and more attractive to the average person to research and purchase new service and devices. What used to be a good job with surprising amount of mobility and compensation is becoming more competitive within, leading to a few really successful individuals and a lot of less successful ""average"" sales people. This leads to high turn over and poor moral. "
good,There are so many different area in Verizon that it is hard to tell you what a typical day is like.   Some positions will be behind a desk while other could literally have you climbing a pole.
good,"Store managers do a lot for this company. Goal is bottom line every day. Good for business, bad for consumers. Pay is great, but you have to work to maintain your metrics or you are gone."
good,Great culture and management. Calls with customers can be difficult. Constant changing environment. They try to create a fun atmosphere to make the job easier.
good,"Benefits are nice as well as the knowledge you acquire along the way. The Support from management is great. Very fast paced, yet team support atmosphere."
good,Sales and commission structure needs an overhaul. It's outdated. It has not adapted to people shopping more online than every before. The want balance in KPIs but sales structure is volume based.
good,"After years of working at Verizon I have learned no matter how hard you work and what you achieve its not about what you but who you know.  "
good,Very fast pace and competitive. Hardest part was calls per day. I like the wireless phone service plan discount. Management I came in contact worked well with his team.
good,No real ability to advance in the company. Many stressful days of showing up early for scheduled shift then being chastised when you leave fifteen minutes after your shift ends. Work life balance is horrendous. Glad I left a few years ago.
good,Verizon is for the young.its not for the faint of heart or weak minded. be hungry and come to Verizon ready to work. Management is poor due to they do not empower thier managers to make business decisions.
good,"I mostly enjoyed my time at Verizon throughout my career. I was provided with excellent training & benefits. I was moved throughout many departments ALL over NYC, so I was afforded many great learning/training opportunities along with meeting many new friends & also to work for a few great Managers"
good,"The company has helped me grow as individual and I'm very grateful for the opportunities it has given me."
good,"I started out in Customer Service then worked my way into processing Internet Orders. Credit review of customer applications was added to my duties."
good,"Das einzig schlechte was man sagen kann, ist das beim Stellenabbau die falschen Leute die Gespräche geführt haben."
good,I loved the store I managed but the salary was not compensated for the living area and the management above me was unproductive. I definitely learned to manage employees and how to be more organized.
good,"Work started with a lot to do. Has since slowed down significantly.  No training documents,  very few standardized forms across the company, each market, department has a different set of forms. "
good,I feel that the company focus should also include internal customers .VZ has lost great talent because of the lack of structure that they are providing.
good,"As a network engineer, I had several managers who ranged from very good to fairly bad.  The vetting process was not very good.  Working in a regional headquarters, the stress level was fairly high, while in outlying offices, a more relaxed atmosphere was typical."
good,"I started my IT career with Verizon Wireless.  However, over time with my salary I faced the downsizing cut.  The opportunities and platforms are excellent and the training was wonderful."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, but the demand on what we need to sell each and every month has become overwhelming. As a Business Account Manger we are required to sell many products and they just changed our compensation structure that does not match with the growing demand"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This company does a lot of leadership training. Expectations are always extremely high for perofrmance. It comes with being able to enjoy a fun culture driven by employees and it offers the best benefits .
good,"Good people to work with but getting harder to find as time goes on after more and more good people left, not all were by choice.  So sad to see so many of them go."
good,I really enjoyed working at Verizon there was always chance to make money.  And a lot of it.  The customers were hysterical.  The co-workers were some of the most funniest people ever.  The hardest part was staying awake on the graveyard shifts.
good,Working at Verizon is very educational.  The work is interesting and can be stressful at times but most of the people are great.  I would not have left if I was not going to be forced to change offices that would create an undesirable commute.
good,"If I had to share the one thing I learned working at Verizon, it was that nothing is guaranteed and that 20 years of faithful service can be disposed of like garbage.  That observation became crystal clear to me once I was RIF'd by this company.  Therefore, any positive statements I would make about working at Verizon would be colored by the bitterness I still feel about how I was treated.  For me, the reason that I will never purchase any of Verizon's services was the final humiliation of being asked for a deposit for local phone service after working for them for twenty years.  If asked if I have something good to say about my former employer, I have no words."
good,"I answered troubleshooting calls, helped clients take care of the bill payments and issues with clients Verizon Wireless account. I've helped clients upgrade phones and add additional lines onto the account."
good,Verizon is a wonderful com[any for the young professional just starting out in their career. There are wonderful benefits and opportunities available for the right individual
good,"Every day is different, the customers are always different. Once day you could have a 10 line deal and the next you could have nothing. You have to stay dedicated to hitting your numbers and not get discouraged."
good,"Working at Verizon Wireless was a upbeat job with excellent benefits. I learned how to understand customers needs and assist them with their daily routines. I learned how to manage my time, and listen to customers negativity and turn it into a positive atmosphere. I've always had a positive relationship with each customer that walked into the door. The hardest part of the job was sales being taken by another employee. It seemed that you worked so hard, listened to the customers needs, but sometimes you could not close the sale. Once the customer walked out, they could come in at a later time, and you would miss out on the sale. My favorite part of the job was, I am a people person and I love meeting new people."
good,Workplace is average for the enviroment its stresfull at times but can be rewarding if you work hard and give it your all. Layoffs are heavy and happen often
good,Knowledge is key for sales and having great communication skills. knowing how to top down sell from the promotions and always trying to maximize each sale with creating a great customer experience. I learned how to read people and how to control a conversation with opening questions and giving the customers a solution for their daily needs.
good,Workday is varied with much interaction with peers. Management information systems are evolving to meet new corporate goals. Good employee services including a gym and many food choices.It is difficult to keep up with the changing management hierarchy.
good,"Fun work environment with very nice people to work with , offers several benefits but no real benefits, good team work and excellent t trainers to learn from."
good,"Verizon does not customize solutions toward the customer needs.  They force the customer into a rigid product set.  The ""Verizon Business Markets"" division is not the place to be."
good,"."
good,"Responsible for supervising a team of employees including planning work and dividing it among employees. Training, coaching & counseling employees, directing the work of employees; managing the performance of the employees including setting objectives, assessing performance, placing employees on performance improvement plans, and recommending disciplinary action."
good,"I love Verizon.  The only opportunity is to truly mean what is said - example - if you want to know the truth as a senior leader, then do not ""come down"" on someone if they are open and honest."
good,"Productive but tough environment to work in - great benefits and pay."
good,"I typical work day consist of talking with customers to sale various devices and accessory.  The challenging part is competing with online and other retailers who may be selling same product for cheaper prices. "
good,In the beginning I loved working for Verizon wireless. its a high paced always changing environment.  I was happy to be helping Verizon's customers as a Customer service rep in store unfortunately the company decided to not have customer service in stores and my position was downsized
good,"For the most part of my contract they treated us well, I've been in worst places so no real complaints. My supervisor was very good to work with so that made the day pleasant enough."
good,"Get ready to go. With Verizon everything changes so quickly so be prepared to keep up with the ever changing technology industry. You must be able to interact with customers, if not its going to be a long day. Hardest part of the job in my opinion was to sell something to someone that I know does not need or want it. Part of the culture was to almost force feed products down customer throats. I am a customer first employee and I didn't feel this was right. Great team culture thought and thought of those team members as a family."
good,Fast moving technical career. You have the ability to work on the foward edge of wireless communications technology with good benifits and pay. This is a good company to work for.
good,I like the competiveness and training opportunities.
good,They want everything you have.  I worked there and lost my job when I got sick. The union is of no help except a write off to a place that will not be there when you need help.
good,"I have worked there many years and reached the top sales position. Once I reached it I felt like there was no where else to go. "
good,"With this job a typical day was assisting customers all day with new purchases, account information, and troubleshooting. This job was absolutely amazing to me, the team was more of a family."
good,"Work/life balance was harder when working in a retail environment, but the benefits were some of the best I had. Constantly going through courses to better develop your line of work, specifically sales tactics."
good,Very fast paced business. Always trying to stay ahead of competition. The training department offers a variety of programs and the company takes personal growth very seriously
good,"Verizon University, a great concept where you would go to the corporate office and spend a week of 8-hour training classes. Loved it. I think the classes could be extended felt the training was rushed"
good,"Good place to learn. Many avenues to learn. I learned Selenium automation, JMeter and also learned coordinating different teams both onshore and offshore."
good,Work culture is good . Learned my initial corporate life from my team mates. Technical and personal training were given which was very useful .  salary was descent and we can sustain for few years .
good,"typical work day...containing network fires"
good,"daily emails checking and individual work assignment by myself based on email from onshore."
good,Sales drive the business but the team culture encourage collaborative efforts to excel and succeed.  Fast paced environment with huge components of customer service.
good,"I Liked my job it was simple and paid well. I had to make incoming calls and outbound calls regarding the services Verizon provided. I had goals per day, week and months. I always achieved and succeed in all my areas."
good,I spent three years at Verizon and almost everyone that was with the company originally got burned out and left. It just becomes monotonous dealing with the same issues every single day. Not much support from management. You could make a good living if you really hustled all the products and services. Just not really something that most people see themselves doing long term.
good,Like most call centers the Verizon financial representative environment is very fast paced and you are graded on everything. You must make quotas daily.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This is a great company and perfect for entry level but advancement is very slow.  Recent changes have reduced the starting salary and experience and education has minimal reflect on salary or advancement opportunities.
good,I was fortunate to work for VZW in different positions around the country. I was recently laid off. It was a good career and would recommend working there. Hopefully they will stop laying off soon as that was my worry.
good,Okay company to work for. The environment is changing. If you have the option to work else where. Do it. There is nothing more that  I have to say about working here.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for the only problem is the worry about being laid off in an organization in constant restructure. The organization is going thru continued change over the next years.
good,I gained a lot of customer service and IT experience. Very hands on management with a lot of assistance. Was able to move up the ladder to help get the job done. A good several years of a career that helped advance my overall skill set.
good,I absolutely loved working at Verizon but the management team was horrible. They never helped you or tried to help you grow they were mainly all about themselves. Defiantly not team players that is for sure.However teh work environment of being fast past and the pay was pretty awesome!
good,This job was based off of sales. At this location the traffic coming in to purchase was very slow. So when the traffic was slow our hours were shorten.
good,The commute to work was overwhelming daily no matter how early you get up to go or get off to work. There is a lot of time spent coming and going to work
good,Good place to work with excellent benefits.  The downside is there is constant turnover before Verizon is always merging and consolidating to save money.  The pay is fairly good amongst the competitors.  You can learn a lot however don't get comfortable.
good,"The benefits are great if you can handle the workload. You aren't asked to do anything you aren't compensated accordingly for, however a lot of people don't want to work hard, they prefer to work as little as possible and get paid more than what they're worth. You have to have patience for customers and cannot take complaints or frustrated people personally. You work AT LEAST 40 hours, if it's busy you are expected to stay. It is definitely not a 9-5 Monday through Friday job."
good,"Fast-paced and fun place to work. Management in my store was pathetic and made it very hard to succeed or advance. I was a top-performer, yet had obstacles that made it a less than enjoyable place to be because of management. However, structure and benefits were amazing."
good,Its a good place to work for . There is work life balance and the benefits are excellent. Verizon gives many opportunities t learn and advance your career.
good,"Lots of room for advancements within this company, great job at creating opportunity. They have 180,000 employees so some one can look forward to being riffed every year, as revenue goes up and down so does the employee count. Just the nature of the beast. they spent 21 billion a year on labor and wages."
good,"Answering min25 calls per day. Every call monitored and recorded , had to meet stats that were impossible to meet. Products always changing and updating and would not be given training or be prepared prior to having to answer and take calls on these products."
good,"I was in the ""use'em and lose'em"" contractor category.  Co-workers were fine...it was a continuous temporary assignment, which has major pros and cons."
good,"I worked with a lot of diff customers in the retail store"
good,"If you like sales its a great place to work. Benefits are great and pay is good. The commission structure changes a lot, so sometimes it takes a while to get into the flow."
good,"Typical day included daily morning meetings, peer to peer training, training modules, daily, weekly, and monthly strategic sales, consumer, small and medium business cold calls, phone trouble shooting, bill analyzing, fraud prevention. I've learned how to handle different customers from different backgrounds, also how to successfully work with co-workers with different beliefs and backgrounds. The most enjoyable part of the day would be the end of the night when we successfully helped all of our customers to the best of our abilities and knowing that we exceeded the company's standards and goals."
good,"I do not choose to write a review about Verizon. Verizon is a great job to work for. However, I believe more time should be allowed due to life situtations occuring."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The company of Verizon is a good company to work for. As far as the Solution Specialist position goes, its a good position to be in when your just starting out. To me it is a stepping stone you have to accomplish if you have hopes of having a outstanding career. The position allows you to learn numerous aspects of business."
good,"As with anywhere, this job is what you make it. You are paid in direct correlation with your effort. As it is a retail environment, you can expect a taxing schedule with just about no predictability and long hrs, especially during the holidays on which you'll almost certainly be working. This is probably the most difficult thing about working for Verizon in a retail outlet. On the upside, however, you'll enjoy many opportunities for personal growth and career advancement if you excel. This job is not difficult to execute if you are disciplined and coachable. Management will help to guide you to whatever heights you look to reach as retail/sales channel advancement is plentiful. It is a bit harder to transition to the corporate side as those spots tend to stay filled. Gi"
good,"No advancement unless you want to relocate out of the state."
good,"This was a well organized company."
good,"Maintain customer service. Ensure store organization, and      				      cleanliness.Oversee shift sales and progress. Interact with team 				      members and set daily goals. Maintain proper inventory count. 				      Cc weekly and nightlyreports. Accomplish monthly goals."
good,"helping each customer as they walk-in the store.  And try to get the most sales of each customer as much as possible. "
good,The reason Verizon Wireless is at the head of the cellphone market is that it is constantly changing and tweaking what they do. Every employee get a lot of training on a weekly bases. The thing that makes the job stressful is once your learn your job it changes. What ever your job responsibilities are get adjusted and change on a quarterly bases.
good,"Very competitive market and have to be willing to be aggressive. If you are not, this is not the role for you. I dont have much more to say about the position. Overall, decent company to work for."
good,Good place to work with nice work life balance. A typical day at work is reading mails and responding on various tickets or data issues raised. Hardest part is keeping up all the calls happening everyday.
good,"A typical day will consist of troubleshooting devices, answering phones, selling accessories and setting up phone plans for new and existing customers. The main pressure is on new accounts or new devices as well as accessory sales. There is pressure from management to keep your numbers (and consequently the stores) up and you will be in constant competition with co-workers for customers. If you enjoy competition and a fast paced sales environment, this is the perfect job for you."
good,Position became very stressful and demanding once they began hiring a great number of management personnel who clearly knew nothing about the duties that were performed by the associates.  Lack of sensitivity when it came to trying to balance work and home life.
good,solid company with good medical benefits ...take of advantage of the tuition options and move up quickly as possible and can make a good career- sales is probably the most lucrative
good,"Good job, did 27 years, then retired. Enjoyed my earlier years there. Company becoming very modern now. Future outlook very insecure based on company's desired path"
good,"The department I was in was nicknamed Hotel California because you could check out anytime (half of my co-workers were mentally checked out all the time) but you can never leave (no one could ever get promoted or move to another department. "
good,"Verizon has one of the best compensation packages I have found in the job market.  Many benefits that other employers would make you wait for, VZW gives upfront, and the employee tuition assistance program is great!!! With the good comes the bad... Call Center life is not all that great.  While there are things done to help boost the moral of the reps, those things have become less and less over the years, and still do not compensate for lazy managers, or the disconnect felt between ""floor life"" and the ""Top Floor"".   "
good,Somewhat cutthroat environment. Quota based sales so customer service in stores somewhat lacking. Typically assisted guests with account information and assisted with new phone purchases and billing issues or questions.
good,"Coworker relationships are great at Verizon. It is a good environment to learn together, and grow together with many departments to move to and grow your skills."
good,Constantly changing technologies and rules. Challenging to trouble shoot and solve complex problems with a diverse group of people. Frequently feeling unappreciated by management staff.
good,Shortly after AOL/Verizon purchased Yahoo. Verizon started to start laying off Yahoo & Verizon contractors & employee company wide. Had they better manager their finance they would not had laid off so many staff members. Bad management from upper management.
good,"Verizon Communications, Inc. is a leading employer, providing exceptional benefits packages and opportunities for employees.  Loss of profits on land-line side of business makes corporate reorganizations frequent and job security questionable."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"An ideal sprint length is between 1 and 4four weeks, with a 2-week sprint being the most widely used.Velocity is the average number of points from that past 3 – 4 sprints. It is used to help predict when backlog items will be delivered."
good,Verizon had the potential to be a great company. The culture has changed a bit with the times and the result was something unrecognizable. I left in the midst of the big changes so it would be hard to give a full review of what's going on.
good,"The company provideds amazing training benefits for human capital development. Their educational assistance is better than most, $8000 a year on job related training. In house training and online are great."
good,"This company takes good care of employees. Benefits, paid time off, compensation are all AMAZING.  However as a results driven organization (retail) if you are not a hard worker, do us all a favor and apply elsewhere. Work life balance sucks but retail hours and the needs of the business are paramount to maximizing shareholder value."
good,"Verizon is a good place to work for.  They have great benefit and invest in their employees.  "
good,It is a great job if you can keep from getting laid off and dont mind dealing with a bit of mindless bureaucracy. The people are what make Verizon - they are great.
good,Verizon is a great company to start from the bottom and work your way to the top.  I would recommend anyone to this company for great advancement opportunities.  Always are putting there employees first!
good,good pay  very competitive environment easily to learn the online system very flexible hours for college students. very good on and off site training.
good,"Fun place to work. The staff are a diverse group and have interesting backgrounds. I have made friends with a lot of season ticket holders and have to say ""they are the best part of the job"""
good,You were expected to donate 10 hrs  extra a week on top of your 40 weekday hours. You also were not expected to take a lunch. In addition you were expected to work every other weekend. Life of operations management.
good,Verizon's call center work environment was typical of utility based mega corporation. Employee's were made aware of expectations and commended and/or reprimanded accordinging. Very strict code of conduct.
good,Great benefit package...no room for advancement. The time off is incredible and they paid for my master's degree. They also had awesome quota relief. I lived in too small of a community to continue with the company.
good,"The way I can have my own style and don't have to be so forceful in sales makes me enjoy work a whole lot more.  I like to think of myself as a 5 star rep, and customers feel well taken care of."
good,Working at Verizon is stressful as the work load increased but not the headcount.Opportunity to learn new skills & sharpen existing skills are limited
good,Most coworkers were fantastic. The one downfall  is not working with employees who were falling behind in their assigned workload. It brought the entire team down.
good,Good company that is growing.  Too bad the state got too expensive for them to stay.  A lot of people with tenure over 15 years. The company appears to still have a strong business model.
good,The Authorized retailers are not really good to work at. you have a lot of competition from Best Buy.  I would advise that you work at a Company store.  Training is a lot better etc.  Verizon is a great company but there are no benefits at a Franchise
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon was a great place to work at one time, however, it has gotten worse over time as they have consolidated areas and regions.  Also, they have attempted to become a tech company however they are extremely rigid and still subscribe to old way thinking and not totally embracing what they are trying to portray."
good,"Not bad, feels like hs. Popular etc, verizon needs more oversight of actions by management. They don't seem to value individual achievements or recognize good talent."
good,"Verizon is a profitable force to be reckoned with, and being a part of their team will demand your best every day.  It is not an environment for the thin skinned and those unwilling to own their success. One would do well by mastering substantive time management, crisis control, relationship selling, and search engine like product knowledge. If the effort is made, there are real benefits in growing with this brand.  From tuition reimbursement to an impressive retirement match, Verizon has the resources to go beyond any standard compensation and benefits package."
good,Management does not make employees feel comfortable with their career or advancement with unrealistic goals. When hired it is a place to enjoy and have fun.  Verizon is a no fun zone with no light at the end of the tunnel no matter how well you do.
good,The company went through four major restructuring while I was employed and a few after I left. The people were great and helpful. As one of the top producers I received many fantastic trips and gifts. I was paid well and had good benefits. As most companies the politics were challenging and rewarding at times. Overall a good experience.
good,"There is a slight dissonance between official company policy/culture and what is really going on at the store/district level. On the one hand you are told to be ethical but you are constantly pressured to maintain a high ARD and to create growth (adding new lines of service). The compensation is fair but at least at the district level, managers look the other way when certain tactics are used to make sells happen."
good,Very successful organization with long term career opportunities.  This business constantly changes due to the changes in technology.  Advancement opportunities are much greater for employees who are mobile.
good,Verizon has the greatest compensation and benefits package.  Salary is very high and full-time employees do not pay for benefits.  It is a high volume high call work environment.
good,constantly changing due to technology needs. fast paced at times. work life balance not much to offer. great people to work with and benefits were really good.
good,Great place to start a career within the technology industry.  Best part of being hired was receiving all benefits from your first day.  Great people to work with as well.
good,"Verizon was a good place to work. I spent 29 years through MCI, Morldcom, MCI WorldCom and Verizon most recently. Verizon has a wonderful engineering team. The only fault I can find is that above first line managers leadship is lacking."
good,In my time here I learned a lot about the operations of a global company and gained the ability to learn a multitude of billing systems in a ashore period of time.
good,"The only big problem with Verizon is that it doesnt let their employees work from home. Everything here starts with the senior management (for years, eg: work from home) and then by the time it goes down to each employee, it takes ages. Very slow process."
good,"very slow at times, but rewarding If you learn your customers and  needs. friendly often quiet, nice coworkers. Learning products waseasy and helped a lot"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,the work environment was very stressful but rewarding i do not think it is a realistic job environment for anyone wanting to have a social life  or family time
good,"the company is overall good place to work for, and in the last several years, things are not so good as the competition is taking a toll on the bottom line and top line,"
good,A great company to work for...I would recommend this job to anyone..... I learned a lot about being a programmer and using computers to translate lines in and out of service.  I also got a lot of training and into office telephone training dealing with outside telephone guys who also installed lights on the outside
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for with awesome benefits.  Working in retail requires you to be available more often and during various hours compared to an 8 to 5 but that can change if you decide to pursue a position in corporate.  If you enjoy sales and focusing on individual goals you can make good money.
good,"Verizon was a good place to work ,the training was very detailed and informative,the work place was fun and relaxed, the only issue I saw was there was a lot of younger people and turn over was high."
good,Your schedule will depend on the manager who is in charge of creating the schedule so it changes weekly. Your typical day will be talking to customers and getting to know what it is they're looking for in a phone so you can upsell. The company pays well and it's a great place to turn coworkers into great friends.
good,Working for verizon you meet a lot of great people. Although you do have to step up your game and not care about the customer at all when it comes to making you quota. This is a for profit company so in the end its yourself that matters and they put so much pressure on you its unreal. They make up for it though with pay and benefits. aside from pay the commission they pay changed often and they make drastic changes constantly so you need to keep up with it. they only thing i hated was they do not truly or ever trust you if your new they will take veteran employees words over yours and managements words over yours even though your right so if you manager is getting a fire lit on them then they can put the blame on you and and you end up taking the heat when you did nothing wrong.....only in the business sales department though. they dont mind keeping the shady staff on board so thats why i left
good,"Fast paced work environment.  Primary function is customer service within a call center environment. Veteran friendly. Great pay for this area. Also, opportunities for career advancement."
good,I worked for Verizon Wireless for ten years. I enjoyed working with people for the last ten years. I learned a lot during the last ten years as a customer service representative.
good,Very good work environment for sales. Consistent pay and great benefits. Not as lucrative in the past year or so however and has cut out some of the better incentives.
good,"Retail schedule is the main downside, fast paced retail, top pay retail sales, great benefits and pay. Management is a bit too detached from employees at times."
good,"I really love my job talking to customer on the phone, helping and giving advice to customer about their phone service.I enjoyed the feedback that was given by my supervisor was helpful"
good,You don't get paid very well due the inconsistency of what you must sell. What you made the most money did not correlate to phones at all. We were forced to sell cable and other things if we wanted to make money.
good,"Employees are given the tools needed to succeed. Compensation is fair. Dealing with irate customers is challenging, but customers that believe they are entitled to some form of compensation is beyond frustrating."
good,"One of the most enjoyable things about my current job is talking with guests about their lives, and finding mobile solutions to make their experiences better, so they want to come back and get more products and services from us."
good,"Job is the same everyday, which is good and bad.. its good because repetition is easy to work with, bad because of that same repetition leaves you bored."
good,Working for VZW was very stressful. I didn't work in sales and I still felt the pressure of having to sell all the time. There are constant changes in management and it gets difficult to keep up with different expectations.
good,"Fun place to gain knowledge of wireless. great training, and preparation for future jobs. great understanding of customers needs, but tiring to keep up with younger employees"
good,Don't care a typical day at work what you learned management workplace culture the hardpart of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job dont this conf
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"great to develop and build your skills as a sales person. most management tries to help you develope into a great sales person. "
good,"This is a fun atmosphere to work in. It is a fitness center complete with cardio equipment, spin bikes, free weights, ping pong table and volleyball court. This a great place to work if you are interested in being an advocate for corporate health and wellness."
good,I was able to work in a variety of different departments and meet a number of great leaders in the company. Great place to work if you are in a corporate position.
good,Great Money Benefits and Vacation. Great training and networking!! Competitive sales along with incentives. Lasting working relationships great people to work with!!
good,"If you're joining the retail sales channel, your experience is going to be directly affected by your location, management, and coworkers. Every location provides a vastly different experience. There is room for promotion as long as you have strong leadership skills. You must be able to handle abnormal hours, overtime, and a high stress environment. Retail sales is probably the highest paying entry level position at Verizon and can be very lucrative if you have the necessary qualities."
good,If your looking for a good paying job then this is the place including good benefits. The biggest problem is the lack to fix areas where cooper cable needs to be replaced. And having supervisors who wasn't any good out in the field so they made them management.
good,Great Company to work for fun and challenging at the same time. Good management staff. I enjoy working with people and also i enjoy the money that i make there. I have learned to be more detailed.
good,"We want our customers to feel loyal-we want to be their favorite and only technology provider. As a Verizon Retail Sales Representative, or what we like to call a Solutions Specialist, you'll create that feeling! With your sales expertise, love for technology and excellent customer service skills, you'll create the ultimate in-store experience and turn our customers into lifelong fans."
good,Originally one of the best jobs I have had. I advanced pretty fast within the company and made a decent salary. Compensation plan has changed and does not work in the favor of the employee. Lack of a union allows them to get away with mistreating employees and sweeping it under the rug.
good,"This was my first full time retail job and the schedule was all over the place, sometimes i wouldn't get my 2 days off back to back which isn't as bad."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, the opportunities are there if you want to work your way up the ladder"
good,"Verizon has well taken care of me over the years. I would recommend this as a Fast Paced, challenging,performance based work enviroment. I would recommend them as a company."
good,"My time at Verizon wireless has been one of the best experiences I've had since joining the workforce. The job itself is very demanding & things change within the blink of an eye. I didn't like that things change without the company not notifying its employees of the changes so we would just be a deer in headlights when a customer had a question we couldn't answer. Verizon offers amazing benefits and there's no waiting period once you join the company, you're entitled to the SAME things people who've been there for years have. Bonuses were great, pay checks were great. If you don't deal with high stress situations easy this isn't the job for you, as well as back to back calls. 30-50 per day for an 8 hr shift. Its stressful so its not an easy job, I don't recommend it for anyone younger than 23."
good,Jobs are delivered with a certain amount of hours built into the workload. Sometimes work is divided up as more technicians are added to the job. There is often times too much time built into a job and techs are freed up but do not go on to the next task because of these time allotments. Many techs get lazy and know that they can work for a short duration and then the rest is down time for them. This is not productive.
good,everyday is a learning experience when a technician is installing Fios in the financial district. Every job is different and it is hard to place a definite time for the customer which can be very frustrating because we always want to satisfy
good,I have been working with this company for over a year. I have had a very positive experience overall with this company. They offer great compensation and advancement opportunities.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Productive and fun place to work. Large company with multiple technology platforms, enterprise software, and diverse systems to learn, explore, and contribute"
good,"Enjoyable workplace with excellent coworkers. Interactions with customers and sharing my knowledge with them was best part of my work day. Learned how to speak with customers and distribute my knowledge to them. Enjoyed assisting coworkers with issues that they would have with systems and over coming obstacles such as completing sales, system issues and handling escalations."
good,"I'm proud to be at Verizon. After 5 years on the job, I have met with great professionals, both knowledgeable and willing to help you advance in your career. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management, which at times, seems completely out of touch with employees' needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is protecting customers' assets and information, this drives satisfaction levels up and promotes trust."
good,"Great benefits and they have a diverse work environment but they underpay by a lot. I qualified for public assistance while working there.  I have since moved on, but hey they give you a free phone."
good,"I have been employed with vzw for 16 years and the culture of change is evident in every department I have worked. Adaptation to an ever-changing industry is key. It is a very good company to work for, but at times decide to put hiring freezes up at the most inopportune times."
good,Verizon is a great place to gain experience and understand how to work in a large corporate environment.   Experience gained at Verizon will be valued by other employers.
good,"Interim Security Manager "
good,"Job sent overseas...That's about it..."
good,I feel I was compensated well in my management position. I had difficulty with work/life balance due to the hours and my job was relocated to another state.
good,"Everybody in the workplace is awesome and the management really cares for their employees, it was the job itself that is tedious. Having to satisfy customers and please them is sometimes hard when their being difficult and demanding."
good,"Answered an average of 50 plus calls, while resolving customer concerns as it relates to products and billing. Management staff encouraged to meet or exceed our goals."
good,"Verizon wireless is a great place to work, but that all you do. You barely get a break to eat. You work like a dog working 6-7 days a week. The pay is great, but a person needs a break here and there"
good,A typical day at Verizon Wireless was helping customers solve their issues with every bit of knowledge that we have as a team.  I worked in a team oriented environment but also we had to take initiative to get some things done.  I learned to become more of a leader and I can see myself in a management role later on down the road in whatever career path I follow.  The hardest part of the job was when a customer is yelling in your face and you have to calm them down naturally and not retaliate.  I learned more about myself through those situations than I have in any job.
good,"Excellent beginner sales company. Verizon provides great benefits for their employees including pay, 401k, and insurance. Their onboarding process is exceptional, and the management team is diligent in developing their team. However, it is a beginner sales position. The sales process quickly becomes tedious and stale. Unless you want to move into management and make a career in the telecommunications industry, the job will quickly lose its appeal. Verizon will teach you the appropriate sales flow; connect, discover, recommend. However, if you are an experienced salesman you might find yourself board. I highly recommend Verizon to anyone who needs to develop their sales skills, you will be developed quickly, and make good money during the process."
good,"Fun work environment, emphasized team training on products and services. Company claims to be customer friendly. Seemed to be less customer service friendly over recent years. Beginning 2014 seemed to be focused on downsizing of senior staff personal."
good,"Verizon offer some of the best benefits around and has the potential to make loads of money in just an entry level sales position. But be prepared to sell your soul and shame your family name for it. Verizon loves to test out new roles and positions, but beware taking them at any level. Just as must as they love to create them, they love to lay them off as well."
good,would not recommend working for this company though. It has great benefits and the people you work with are great the management is not to be desired.
good,"At this position for this Fortune 500 company, it was an amazing experience that I won't forget. A typical day at work is predictable from day to day and after a while you get use to what you have to deal with over the phone. Everyone enjoys their job because of the great benefits of working there and most are happy about the job. The hardest part of the job is making business decision on behalf of the customer while trying to maintain integrity with the customer and the business. It is hard to make those decisions when there isn't much direction given. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers and make the relationship with he company better and cause more promoters."
good,"Downsizing the Telecomm division by selling many of it's operations,"
good,"Verizon Wireless (legally named Cellco Partnership,[4] often branded and referred to as Verizon) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications offering wireless telecommunications products and services. With 142.8 million subscribers as of July 2016, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[5]"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Fast pace; enjoyed my co-workers, had great benefits.  Provided telephone assignments to commercial and residential clients. Executed sales and administrative tasks for National Accounts. Handled invoicing for major companies like JC Penney."
good,"All the employees are intelligent, fun to work with, and passionate about their work. I think this is the most significant factor that makes Verizon a great place to work."
good,"Pay is great. Needs more accountability for leadership and staff. Benefits start on day one. Discounts on cellphone plans, matching 401K and paid vacation time"
good,"Great place to work, great work environment. Excellent benefits and bonus opportunity. Company truck with fuel and maintenance card. ON call and overtime pay."
good,"Working for a Fortune 15 company always has benefits and drawbacks. If you're satisfied with making $55K a year as a sales rep you can ride into the sunset no problem. However, moving beyond the bottom of the totem pole requires drinking the equivalent of a pool-full of company Kool-Aid and using unsavory sales techniques to get ahead."
good,Job was based on sales per hour which made it hard to make advancements because of the amount of staff that they had everyday.
good,Was a great company to work for however the work life balance has significantly gone down. If you have a young family i would not reccommend the retail channel
good,Good Job. Company takes very good care of its employees. A lot of benefits and compensation. Bonuses are great also. Friendly environment
good,"Verizon offered excellent benefits including tuition assistance and flexibility to go to school. Minimal room for improvement in a call center, unless willing to relocate."
good,"Verizon liked to keep employees happy and keep morale up. There were struggling points, but all in all they accomplished this goal."
good,"I was in retail and the retail industry is difficult. Employees have two different thoughts of the company depending on what the role is performed, retail vs non-retail."
good,"Great benefits. Good Leadership. Enjoyed working in different areas of the company. If you are mobile and willing to relocate, there are plenty of opportunity for growth throughout the organization."
good,"-look into plans and suggest best course of action but always trying to expand the businesses by adding new lines"
good,"Great company work life is hard, rarely have two days off in a row. micromanagement can be challanging even if you are exceeding goals there is always someone there to nit pick."
good,"Fast paced, ever changing environment and very competitive within teams, departments and across departments. I learned to work in an enviorment where you must be adaptable and be able to keep up with the fast pace. I gained confidence in working on projects and presenting new ideas for process improvements and automation of processes. I learned to work with all types of personalities and cultures which is a plus. I gained lifelong frienships."
good,"I was promised when I took this roll that I would not have to deal with customers as it would be project management and analitics. All I do all day long is give out bad news to customer who have zero respect for the fact they are talking to another human. I hate my job because I hate the customers who yell, scream and point there problems at me as if I created the bad service at their house."

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Multi cultural at the root, everyone from the person at your side to your supervisors Boss. No stigmas or bashing it was just everyone working to make their own day and everyone they come across better than it was before. I learned multiple things from how to handle sticky situations with co workers to how to handle a tricky customer better than I would have ever thought in the past and I am positive these are life long skills and memories I will carry with me until the end of time. I have also learned how to apply my skills and resources to better the majority and not just myself. Learning how to multi task would of been the toughest trick I've learned, just putting together so many ideas from customers, superiors and equals I feel having this collective of knowledge knowing what personally works for me in multiple situations is a great talent I have gained from employment. Supervisors being able to relate when you have had enough and they can just bring out the best and remind you why its really not a big deal."
good,"The Verizon retail environment is exactly what you expect from America's top provider. Busy, busy and more busy. The fact it was so busy was more of a blessing than a burden. It taught us how to complete tasks efficiently and quickly without disregarding quality. With a major focus on driving up sales, Verizon maintained integrity and honesty with the customers that entered our stores. It was pleasurable to deal with the public and the ever-changing atmosphere. Each day presented a new task, challenge and time crunch we had to overcome. "
good,"Good company, fun environment, good benefits. Retail hours means less time with friends and family, have to know how to navigate company politics.."

good,"awesome benefits. most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits and the paycheck. i learned excellent customer service skills that I still use today. management was hit or miss, some approachable and others not. The hardest part of the job is being micro-managed and having other departments' responsibilities piled onto your job"
good,"Relocated Finance department responsibilities and job functions to beautiful campus in Tulsa, OK  offer excellent opportunities for individuals interested in various accounts receivable positions."
good,"Depending what time of the day you arrive to work. So even you start really slow or fast pace. One of the things that I feel like the company doesn't care is that always we are low staff and there is not to much room to get a brake or lunch. once in a wile you understand that the store is busy and you have to do what ever it takes to get the job done. But not every single day."

good,"Working in the Verizon Wireless Health and Wellness Center has facilitated personal growth on many levels. I have met many extraordinary people, including my current boss.

This means I receive no benefits or paid time off, and I also am limited to work for the company for a maximum 30 months."
good,"My day typically started at 5:00am, and I would commute to a train station for a 6:20am train.

good,"good company to work. Good company for female employees.  Promotion policies and internal job change not transparent,"
good,My day would start off with logging into several window applications.  Deal with incoming customer inquiries.  Make outgoing calls to analyze and fix trouble reports.  The hardest part of the job was not having sufficient training to do your job to the best of your ability.  Non supportive management.  All about the numbers not how you personally grow and develop.  The most enjoyable part of the job is comradery with my coworkers.  Also flexibility in work schedules.
good,"n/A busy day everyday. good people great work environment. management very professional, not a secure job though. quality of life changes after a couple of years"

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,When I first started with VZW there were too many hands in the pot trying to stir. Also lots of drama going on folks sleeping with each others husbands and wives.  Once that stuff got cleared out things started getting better. Yes there was favoritism included as well. They would say oh it wasn't about the numbers but that was a LIE.
good,"I answered phones and handled the customers wants and needs.Did spreadsheets for customers, etc. I loved my co-workers. We were family.Hardest part of the job was trying to fill the customers orders on a timely basics with the different departments. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking with my customers."
good,"Great company to work for. Lots of expansion and opportunity."
good,"Great compensation with Verizon and good local leadership and management, but corporate out of touch with family balance life and recently sold out assets in area to a smaller rural competitor. Great local people to work for but high pressure sales."
good,"A typical day at work included stocking of truck, safe operation of same, safe and efficient job performance, customer contact,  customer satisfaction and pride in workmanship, clerical work. I worked with a great crew, many of whom put the customer needs above their own needs and those of their families. The hardest part of the job generally involved having to work in horrible weather conditions. We performed physical work outdoors during hurricanes, blizzards, heatwaves, ice storms, floods, etc. The most satisfying part of my job was knowing that the customer was pleased with the quality of work and service provided."
good,responsible for personal sales and commission. This company provides wonderful benifits and compensation packages. Customer service and retention skills needed. Technical knowledge and problem-solving skills needed every day. fast moving and demanding.
good,"great job to earn a lot of money"
good,compensation has dropped and they you to hit  increasingly high targets that cause employees to resort to less than honest tactics
good,"Due to the commission-based pay and the current shaky economy, I felt as a single mother, this wasn't a great way to make ends meet. There were bonuses offered but there was no base pay at the store I worked for. I found it difficult to stay afloat between market rises and falls."
good,"When i was a employee at Verizon Wireless, i became a natural sales rep. I over achieved any goals that were put out by management. I was a well known salesman in my town as well as through the surrounding areas. I enjoyed working at Verizon."
good,Good relaxed atmosphere. Good managers. Good location. Had cafeteria on first floor. I would work here again. Could be noisy due to people re-locating
good,"Providing customers and employees with solutions to complex problems, exceptional experience, and developmental support for future leaders.  Learned in the capacity of leadership a variety of different coaching and accountability methods, HR standards in in managing performance, benefits, and payroll."
good,"Running queries, working daily issues, flexible work environment."
good,"My typical day at Verizon started with me waking up at 4:30 in the morning to commute 40 miles by bus to downtown Pittsburgh.  I would log into my computer and all necessary programs needed to perform my tasks.   I would typically trouble-shoot higher level network issues, determine and implement the correct course of action to resolve issue.  I learned how to trouble-shoot many different multiplexers and how to enter the proper strings to communicate with each device.   Though there was some resentment between management and my co-workers, I typically didn't have any issues with my bosses.   Most of my co-workers were very knowledgable and helpful and each had their own strengths and weaknesses.   I really enjoyed working with them all.   Hardest part of my job was convincing Customer Local Exchange Carriers that the network problem they reported was resided in their networks.   They most enjoyable part of my job was doing something that I loved.   Considering all my work related hours took up atleast 14 hours of each day, I would have to say that was rough but I loved my job."
good,"A workday includes assisting 30-40 customers with technical, billing and customer retention.  I have learned to work with a team of 10-12 individuals whom come together and share knowledge to provide customers with the very best experience.  I often substitute for supervisors and I am known as a ""go to"" person.  The most enjoyable part of the current position is knowing that you have truly helped a customer resolve their issue while a tough part of the job can be trying to do your best to help a upset customer."
good,Typical day at work whether you work in center or at home. Log in ON TIME or after 6 minutes you will receive a .25 point for being late. Points accumulate and after 30 points you can lose your job and trust me they rack up quick. If you are late or log out of your tools during the shift other than to go on break you need a ticket number that support the exact time you are off the phone. Usually I take about 15-30 calls per shift and I say that because I had a split shift. 10am-2pm then 6pm-10pm. As stated earlier no call center job is easy if you have upset customers calling in so if you allow them to make you mad then this isn't the job for you because honestly no one calls tech support in the best mood because its usually inconvenient. My manager was nice and she was young so we didn't exactly feel threatened because we could relate to her but she made sure we were in tip top shape and our metrics were at least 76% and 80% as a team. I barely saw my co-workers because I worked from home but they were nice to me when I did see them.I actually only remembered the people I trained with. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the company had events like basketball competitions and karaoke at the center of course and the cotw department ran food and hygiene drives to give back to the community.
good,Overall a great company to work for. I attended several leadership classes on how to lead high performing teams and how to coach to behaviors. Had the opportunity to work with a brand new team and watch my team exceed in sales each month.
good,"Interact with customers on a daily basis "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,Enjoyed the depth of the company and the technology available. Solid capabilities providing customers with extensive options to meet their IT and security requirements. Great people and teams.
good,"I like the atmosphere in the office environment. The class of Management and Staff. They have respect for the employees. The co workers were high spirited, and they provided a relaxed atmosphere where everyone can communicate and participate without confrontation. the company provided excellent health benefits.

Paid Holidays.Company allowed the employees to invest into the company through issuance of Stocks, and Bonds. Provided Life Insurance, and a ESOP Plan."
good,"*Abundant Resources"
good,I worked 26 years for GTE / Verizon Communication.  The company offers great benefits and a good company to work for.  This company has the best Network
good,"Job responsibilities were providing technical support to Verizon Wireless customers. This includes activations, device and network troubleshooting and general billing questions. I learned a great deal about different types of cellular phone communication networks and detailed operation and specs of many different models of cellular phones. Management was knowledgeable and helpful most of the time. The hardest part of the job was explaining billing and/or usage values to customers that disputed the amount on their bill or the amount of data that they have used. Dealing with customers that were not computer literate could sometimes be challenging as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction that i felt after solving a difficult problem and getting positive feedback from the customer."
good,"Good company for benefits, Not a fan of how management are treated, threatened by layoffs every quarter,  This company retains the vestiges of old-school Bell employees, which are known for their loyalty and long careers and combines it with people with 401Ks and no pension who float from company to company, and is basically at war with itself over it."
good,"Really liked working here, became team leader when I didn't know if I could do it and it made me really proud of myself AFNI Verizon in Bowling Green Ky was a great place to work."
good,was not the best place to work due to management issues but was great leaning experience and a good jump start into my own professional career
good,"Verizon is a fantastic Company to work for, as they provide amazing benefits, imperative training for potential advancement, and they are active on a more National scale with positive programs for domestic violence, area's affected by National disasters, etc.  Verizon is also very focused on providing support to their employees and families of said employees with job placement, career advice, etc.  A great company to work for."
good,"Shareholder-driven culture, management may or may not be interested or educated in telecommunications in general.  Projects may or may not complete as planned."
good,"Cubicle style work"
good,This was a wonderful company to work for. Laid back environment but always about business. Friendly people and hard workers. The work life balance could use improvement.
good,Wonderful place to work with enjoyable coworkers. Overall a great place to work
good,AT&T has great pay and benefits but just like a lot of other companies they are trying to eliminate union jobs.

good,"Its a very busy environment from beginning of your shift to the end. There are always targets to hit and it is different from day to day. Competitive environment, competitive benefits, and the pay is great as long as you know what you are doing."
good,a typical day would be mostly sitting at your desk taking calls. I learned a lot about cell phones. The hardest part of the job was the surveys and wondering how a customer felt about you and your performance and the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you helped your customer.
good,"Company is evolving and becoming leader in multi-tower technology solutions. Culture has shifted to focus on measurable, business outcomes for its clients."
good,"the hardest part is that people think you can fix everything "
good,"Typical work day at Verizon started with our morning meeting, getting our assignment and getting the job done. Upon hiring we were sent to school to training which was awesome but working in the field proved to be the best teacher in my opinion. I had several managers who where serious but fair, they pushed us very hard but at the end of the day the proved to be a push in the right direction to me as I excelled under pressure. My co-workers at my location were senior techs who were with the company for many years so to be taken under their wing was an honor. The hardest part of the job at the beginning was trying to understand all of the information that was needed to complete a splicing assignment but as time went on it was smooth sailing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working along side of my co-workers, we were a TEAM."
good,"The company has good working conditions, the employees seem satisfied with their jobs.  As common with many companies most opportunity for growth and promotion requires movement to the HQ location."
good,I loved working in the HR department hiring people and giving them the GREAT news that they have a job with a good company.I loved working with Great co -workers

good,"Good company, but way to mane changes impacting service delivery"
good,Loved the group I worked in. I had different work everyday and it was great to lean about marketing
good,"The experience was very rewarding as I familiarized myself with the systems and processes needed to get the job done. I encountered management pushback when trying to implement new methods of doing the job more effectively for no reason. Despite this, the work was enoyable as I had the ability to tinker and really scrutinize data to provide metrics when needed, one of my favorite aspects of the job."
good,Great work environment - less then stable job security. Limited room to climb the corporate ladder or to seek advancement.
good,"I was in 3 different stores. everyone 180 degree change. overall good company as long as you like working 7 days a week, open to close and being on your feet all day."
good,"I loved the job itself and was very successful in it, but in order to climb the corporate latter I would have taken a large paycut and it didn't make sense.  Plus with a family the retail hours take a huge toll on family life.  "
good,"Good job, good benefits"
good,Sales goals were some what the hardest part of the month. just trying to make sure you hit you numbers. other wise overall good job to have.
good,"As Verizon Wireline and Verizon Wireless continue to merge, it is apparent that positions will be cut. Looking at options prior to what I believe will be a large RIF."
good,Great teamwork atmosphere and proactive daily functioning
good,"Busy work day/environment.  Calling on customers, reviewing orders"
good,"Needed to meet company goals utilizing union workers as well as a fluid work responsibility load.

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,this is a stressful position but leadership was more about the bottom line.  It was not even about the customer and employee morale was not a priority.
good,"In a typical work day I was able to interact with a wide verity of people. I learned how to solve various technical problems as well as improve on my customer service relations. While we were considered our own managers, we did have team leaders who would help guide us or be available when we were unsure of how to solve a problem. The hardest part of the job is the emotional aspect of dealing with upset or angry customers. Also having to accept that people would ""deact"" which means to cancel service before a certain time period, in which case we would be financially responsible for that and the cost would come out of our paychecks, which were commission based only. The enjoyable part of the job were my fellow coworkers. People often commented on how we always seemed to be having a good time, and honestly we were. I enjoyed working with every single person there, and I miss seeing them on a daily bases."

good,"overall verizon is a good company to work for , my typical day is assisting and reviewing customers accounts with them"
good,still would have liked it if I was working this job. It was fun communicatring with different individuals daily. The competition amongst us employees made for one to work diligently.
good,Great place to work.  Must be flexible with availability.  The company recently shifted from an employee focused environment to a production focused environment.  They are demanding more work in less hours and I felt it was adversely affecting the customer service.
good,Enjoyable work environment and are given opportunities for advancement.
good,"Answered over 1000 411 calls a day. I learned people can be very demanding. Management always had to monitor operators to make sure  we were doing job correctly. Co-workers usually got along. The hardest part of job, having to stay inside all the time.  The most enjoyable was leaving for the day."
good,"Great place to learn Corporate level experience."

good,"Verizon Enterprise Solutions is a strong company with dedicated employees, but is held back by crippling bureaucracy, ineffective top-down management, weak salary growth potential, and an inability to cultivate talent."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"When I first started at the Orrville store I couldn't have been happier. We had 2 reps and 1 manager due to the stores size, but we all worked together as a team. The manager at the time was by far the best manager I've had. However, the downfall was there was no chance for advancement and due to our location there was no chance for a commission check either."
good,"Worked in Graphics division. Worked overtime; but was never forced to. Division closed down in 2010 after laying off most of its employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was its people. Had a good work culture, with an emphasis on teamwork. Very flexible schedule."
good,I enjoyed my time with Verizon. I met a lot of great friends and had fun building relationships with the customers and seeing them happy. I learned how to really sell because we worked hourly but commision is where the real money came from. The management was great and had a lot of knowledge. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers and people that were frustrated with something that was out of my control. The most enjoyable part was being around enjoyable co-workers.
good,"Great company with a strong Can-Do culture, and made up of some really good people. Each year we're all surprised at how much we were able to accomplish, despite so many challenges. The wireless industry is constantly changing, and one of the most important things I've learned is that I can shake the uncomfortable feeling of ""Not Knowing"" enough about new things as they come along, and go ahead and jump right in and figure things out. And not only can I do it, but that I'm GOOD at it. So much in my life changed for the better once I had that realization. "

Pipeline management and tracking of the succession rate for using traditional (Monster and CareerBuilder, etc.) and non-traditional."
good,Has to be customer focused and have a great work ethic to be successful.
good,Interesting to see how the telecoms industry works from an accounting perspective.  Management is good to work with and if needed will assist employees in terms of completing a project especially during the monthly close periods.
good,"Work is very much technology oriented and I enjoy to work here because all tasks that are taken are the ones which is a great workout for brain. "
good,Fast paced work environment. Learned how to work efficiently under pressure. The management was good and we where constantly trained on new products. All employees interacted well with each other. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to take breaks. the most enjoyable part of the position was making customers happy by fixing their phones.
good,There is not enough time in the work day to get everything that Verizon wants you to get done and also get your job done.
good,"This company is very customer focused and employee focused. Excellent Customer Service is the top priority and giving employees the tools and knowledge to provide that service is one of the many strong points. They acknowledge that this type of position, with it's high quotas and expectations can be quite stressful, so they do provide many incentives and rewards to their representatives. The extremely high ratio of representative positions to management positions makes advancement quite difficult and highly competitive, but lateral moves within the company are often available, as well as differentials for shift types and annual salary increases based on merit."
good,"Verizon was a good place to work, but everyday there was a threat of losing your job"
good,If you are looking for a company to provide you with skills and challenges then this will be it.  They have a good benefits package but the compensation is always changing.  Not many sales positions will provide hourly + commission but the commission payout structure changes several times a year.
good,"Selling cellular solutions to existing and new customers. Managing the kiosk with paperwork, inventory, sales, etc. Long hours and you usually don't see your manager often. I learned that the more you take care of your customers the more they will take care of you either by only coming back to you or through referrals. My co-workers were great and everyone had a great time together. I didn't see my managers that often and when I did it was usually short and sweet. The hardest part of the job was no life outside of work. 50+ work weeks. The most enjoyable part was back then it was all about selling and that was it."
good,"A typical day lasts more than 8 hours, at various locations, making all kinds of repairs to telephone cables. I learned all aspects of telecom repair. Management has a very difficult task. Co-workers are a very well trained and professional staff. It was very difficult to maintain a work life balance. I always felt good about the work we did in the cable maintenance department."
good,"Ok job typical call center. Work many hours, hard to advance, cant get a good shift, but good medical benefits"
good,"Basically, customers call in and get help with their internet and phone service. Different technical supporting steps are taken for the customer to reach a resolution. Trouble tickets are created if a real time solution can not be reached. Follow up with customers and assess any other issues at that time."
good,"I love my role with this organization, however there are some definite setbacks in terms of job security and overall culture."
good,"Need more room for advancement."
good,"Hard to transition from sales to corporate."
good,"You can get of End-To-End knowledge of Telecom Industry and its OSS/BSS services, Products, Technologies etc."
good,Working for VZW was a challenging and mind expanding work place.  By that I mean that the technology was constantly changing and I needed to stay on top of all new market trends.
good,"Work Consisted of a Six hour shift ranging from 11-5, or 5-11 p.m. The work load was considerably easy, consisting of entering inventory into the Computer Database, Price checks, Product Merchandising, and Product Placement. Upon Customer arrival our duties consisted of First and Foremost, Customer Service including One on one Interaction to best evaluate and diagnose the purpose for patronage. Next, was device troubleshooting which consisted of routine checks to the devices systems and often was fixed with some minor adjustments at no cost. Our main focus was sales, consisting of asking the customers their wireless needs and giving them the best product to suit their wants and needs. My only Concern with this job, was too many times Management pushed sales over Troubleshooting devices. Even if the problem was minor, we were encouraged to sell them a completely new device. I felt that this method of deception was not only Immoral, but Unnecessary."
good,"Depending on the location of the position depends on the type and quality of work. The manager of my favorite store location was supportive and encouraging. She allowed her employees to be autonomous and challenged us when necessary. She worked hard for employees and we worked hard for her. Because it was a sales position that was commissioned based, some co-workers were very competitive and I feel that was the most difficult part of the job. I feel that each employee has something to bring to the table, especially in sales but I feel that the company pitted us against each other instead of developing a culture of cohesiveness. The most enjoyable part of the position was the money and the autonomy. My manager was awesome and where I fell short she would coach and develop me to be the best that I could be. Another great aspect of the company was the tuition reimbursement. They were really great about paying for classes or reimbursing the employee for the credits and you would not have to dedicate time to the company for doing so. "
good,"I very much enjoyed working here for the first few months I started. The pay structure was extraordinary at the time. As time elapsed, the methods started changing more frequently and decreasing at that. It was extremely busy mostly during open hours so there wasn't much ""play"" time. This is where I learned most of my knowledge in regards to electronics, in particular, wireless and mobile devices and software. It became very addicting so the selling was simpler over time which was very helpful to me as well as the company. Overall, it was a great exposure and I did have fun as well as increasing my intellect. The main issue was the pay structure as well as rules and regulations constantly changing. As a result, the employee turnover rate skyrocketed."
good,"While working at Verizon Wireless, my responsibilities were very limited which hindered my performance. As much free range as I was given to create projects for executives, my work would always be changed to suit the company's needs. However, the people were easy to work with and very nice when it came time to get things done or be very detailed on what they needed when it came to the changes. Overall, the experience I had was one I fully enjoyed."
good,"This company’s awesome to work for; they had a lot of great benefits and compensation until recent changes.  For the 13 years I was employed there I was able to be promoted multiple times with increasing responsibilities.  The opportunity for growth included educational opportunities, training and development and field experiences."
good,Verizon had a good corporate culture of learning and teamwork.
good,"Verizon Wireless is the best wireless Carrier in the world.  Their motivation to stay ahead of their competition is unparalleled.  The local office is uniquely competitive while maintaining  a relatively strong bond.  "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ensuring that all contracts received to be processed were uploaded into our web viewer and counter-signed by the Vice President within a 24-72 hour timeframe. I also had to ensure all calls and emails were answered and tended to within that 24-72 hour time frame."
good,"Typical day at work includes figuring daily forecasts, sales strategy development, schedule planning, "
good,"Fast paced environment, with different challenges to meet on a daily basis."
good,"On a daily basis, I help customers with billing and account question, as well as basic technical service questions in a retail location. I directly  interact with the sales staff on a daily basis,  assisting them with transactions to expedite the sales process. I also assist with inventory management, which involves daily counts of inventory as well as accepting new product into the inventory system. Besides inventory management, I also am heavily involved with the merchandising of the store, from locating devices and signage in the proper place according to corporate protocal or keeping customer accessible inventory stocked and orderly, also according to corporate protocal."
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. Their benefit package is amazing. When they formed a partnership with Comcast, is when the job came to screeching hault. Comcast is extremely difficult because so many people think of them as a difficult company to deal with. The quota structure changes every 2nd quarter, but once they included Comcast, it became very stressful. Worrying about losing your job can make working there hard no matter how much you love what you do."
good,It was a great place to work. I left the company to open my own business. I would not mind to work again with them. The job was very challanging and exciting.
good,"made and received calls for eligible upgrades on mobile devices, and sold a exchange mobile devices, took inventory, and cleaned store throughout the day."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if you can dredge through a day of monotomy. They have great benefits, many of which start on day one. But the pressure to continue to perform even when there aren't the tools necessary to completet a task successfully wears on an employee there. The pressure to have the perfect survey is always constant, as if you solve the issue if it comes back within 10 days you can still be held accountable. Even of the equipment is faulty."
good,Verizon Wireless had great benefits. I was able to live in confidence knowing that my family was cared for medically at all times. The co-pay was kept low and the medical options were outstanding. The monthly costs were awesome as well.
good,"A typical day at work consist of interacting with customers, meeting daily goals, and being accountable for leadership roles. Things I learned at this job would be soft skills, time management, and analytical skills. The hardest part is of the job is selling products that you do not believe in. Though this is the hardest part, this also challenges you to set aside your own biasness and do what is right for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is discovering the needs of the customer and recommending solutions that will benefit and met the unmet needs of the customer."
good,Exciting day to day experience.
good,"- Competitive salary, commission, bonus, profit sharing, benefits and discounts package. Rewards can include money, gift cards, devices, accessories and even an annual vacation for top performers to places like Whistler, B.C., Paris, and the Caribbean."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I loved working at Verizon Wireless as a Contractor and wish I had accepted the offer despite the odd salary/bonus format. There was some amusing bureaucracy, but overall it seem like a great place to be an employee. Bright people and great management"
good,A typical work day is a at your desk responding to a high volume of inbound customer inquires specifically dealing with technical issue or concerns.
good,"Exciting days and some long hours. Overall, great experience with the company."
good,Worked for last 12 years in Verizon.Overall have a satisfactory work experience but poor management decisions
good,I enjoy the constant change that takes place at Verizon Wireless. It always has a new challenge to offer.
good,Phones are busy and not much family time. Would recommend still a good place to work.
good,"Call Center environment is not for everyone , those that can deal with it would enjoy Verizon's culture"
good,This is a great place to keep moving while never leaving your seat.
good,was a great job and would be happy to still be working there had the company not closed
good,I worked in the field and was responsible for the installation and repair on local telephone lines to the customer. Working alone the majority of the time taught me self-motivation and a good working knowledge of customer service on a personal level. The toughest part of this job was weather conditions that made performance very difficult; but this was also very satisfying upon completion of assignment. Management was generally good especially in support situations. We all had to help each other in certain situations.
good,"÷ Oversaw sales and customer service calls daily; implemented productivity plans and communicated with representatives one on one to up-sell, re-bundle and contracts."
good,Consists of inbound calls from customers and being listened to by quality....I learned that hard work pays off and meeting and exceeding the required metrics made me a perfect candidate for promotions and i enjoyed working with great people.
good,Project Management
good,"To be successful with the company Cellular Sales, you must be driven, willing to work long hours, and manage your time effectively. The opportunity to make your salary as high as you would like is there, depending on how you interact with management. If you play your cards right, you can make it to the top of the sales leader-board in a few months. The culture is mixed and seems to change every few months depending on who is hired/fired. I personally really enjoy the people i work with. Communication is extremely important while working for Cellular Sales. The typical workday is coming to work, doing inventory, and waiting for customers to come in. You have to take advantage of every opportunity that comes through that door, and often times have to create your opportunities. Management is good for the most part. Like i said communication is key with this organizations so usually when something goes wrong it stems back to communication issues. I have been able to learn many things while working at this job. My time management skills have improved significantly, as well as my ability to be patient and find solutions. I have matured quite a bit while working here. The hardest part of this job would be staying motivated due to the fact that you cannot really control the traffic that comes in the store. You could work two twelve hour shifts and see three people total. The most enjoyable part of this job is the networking that arises through customers and spending time with my co-workers as well."
good,• Tier 1 Technical Support
good,Call Center of approximately 70 associates and management
good,I loved the job. Gave 10 years of my life to them. I have nothing bad to say other than the transition fron Verizon to Knology.
good,"Overall a great company . Typical day at work is a blend of great co-workers and some great leaders, with some stress in dealing with customer issues. Some day less stressful then others."
good,"loved the customers,atleast the ones that weren't screaming @ me,wasn't to crazy about management,it a dog eats dog enviroment"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon does a lot to make our work environment fun and upbeat. The only down fall is since this is a call center, your work schedule changes every 6 months or so."
good,Verizon offers security and pays well kinda stressful a lot of pressure on represenatives
good,"You are busy and You get paid well for the job you do if you perform and do well then you will succeed,,"
good,VZ has a different type of corporate culture than in the East Coast.
good,Not very good work life balance and HR managers seem to have favorites and an agenda. There are many good senior leaders in place though.
good,Great place to work offering options of advancement. Depending on your supervisor the environment is very relaxed. There are several departments to apply and excel in.
good,"Cool Job, with great benefits, but management increases the stress levels of employees causing a high turn over rate in customer service representatives."
good,"I would get there around 9 am. Get the deposit and go to the bank. when I got back made sure everything was picked up and ready for the day to start. Then check my email, voice mails, Inventory, then have my conference call, and by 10 am open the doors. I would leave around 6 pm if it wasnt busy."
good,"Inbound call center, friendly environment, great discounts."
good,"I have worked for this company for 5 years and for the most part I was happy with my job. Benefits and pay are great, I enjoyed the people I work with and even the type of work that I was doing. However, I didn't enjoy working in a call center and being connected to a phone 8+ hours a day. I also felt as though with the skill set, education, personality and experience I have, I wouldn't be able to advance in the company because it wasn't a good fit for what I see in my future as a career."
good,Typically my day consists of taking phone calls with training for relevant job information sprinkled in here and there. I've learned to make sure that the customer not only gets a resolution to their issue but to also go above and beyond to make sure they recommend my company to family and friends. For the most part management cares about their employees and genuinely want their employees to succeed.
good,"there was never a dull moment, i learned how to cater to the customers needs and find a resolution to all their problems. the management was helpful but mostly i learned from other employees. the hardest part of the job was learning all the new promotions ans trainings but it was the most enjoyable because i wouldnt have became such a great salesman if i didnt learn"
good,"A typical day at work for me was Interfacing with Engineers and Vendors an processing purchase orders for Central Office Equipment for various job sites. Also maintained communication with Engineering and Network Planning counterparts on items and process changes related to quotes. Worked with suppliers to make sure material was delivered and received in a timely manner. Being a team player and a leader, I worked well with all my peers.The job was very demanding but not hard. I always looked at every day as a challenge. The best part of the day was satisfying the customer."
good,Typical workday includes coming into work and helping customers with whatever their needs may be. Their needs can be both visible needs as well as hidden needs.
good,No day is ever the same at Verizon Wireless. A typical day consists of 10 hour days. Management is constantly changing.
good,Good place to work nice atmosphere. I have nothing else to say
good,This is a fun and ever changing enviroment. You must think with all parts of your brain in order to get thru your tasks. It is not about doing the job it is about doing the job well.
good,I really enjoy my job at Verizon. I have learned a lot about technology. Everyone I work with is great. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance. I am looking for something monday through friday 8am to 5pm and I cant have that at Verizon.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,ok place to work for good benefits
good,"On a daily basis I would assist customers with purchases , customer service (billing issues, price plan questions, trouble shooting devices(smart phones, tablets, netbooks, ect..). Over my time with Verizon I have acquired a better understanding of how business works from a customer service, operations and management prospective. The over all experience with management and co-workers at all levels has been very pleasant a team atmosphere is encouraged. I find the most engaging or challenging part of the day to day routine is overcoming objections from customers dealing with pricing, service, contracts, and technical issues. Which also is the most rewarding part of what I do, after addressing all questions or concerns with my customers I recommend a total solution which will benefit the consumer as well as the company. A win win for all"
good,A typical day at work was answering over 100's of call and providing customers the information that they requested.
good,The company is a great company to work for. Moving up from a retail position can be difficult.
good,it was okay. management is terrible. overall good company just not so good people running things in the store channel.
good,Verizon offers a great product and good benefits for its employees. They need to work on the Work/ Life Balance. They tend to change elements of job requirements often and without notice.
good,"Great training and products,but lacks in career advancement opportunities."
good,"Their was not consistant information given, and their were times that given instructions from a teamleader and upper mgt was telling somthing different."
good,"loyal employees great benefits however stressful, but since change of manager morals for the team has reflected the change positivity."
good,Verizon Wireless was a private industry job where you could tell that the company put and inferences on its employees. The company had a lot of perks that worked for the benefit of employees and they made you feel like your opinion counted. The only thing that was harsh was the times that you worked. Instead of having set times for people to work the company had shift bids. That made it hard for people to set a life schedule around work because out of any six month period you might not work the same shift consecutively.
good,"Great Place to start in Corp America, but can definitly be a little cut throat. If you have children, it's a very hard place to find a work life balance."
good,"Company has an indepth training program that offers a wide variety of resources. Competes in a challenging and constant changing environment therefore, one must always be current and up to date in the telecommunications industry. The company allows a sense of autonomy. I created a large funnel of repeat consumers and small business and Verizon was very supportive in providing a representative with a sense of personal style in the sales process."
good,have worked for company for 11 years and seen many changes - company is currently outsourcing and reducing jobs in US - good place to work
good,"the job is good, pay is great. they provide tools but only the basics. hard to do jobs that require specialty tools. no where to advance, you will be in the same position until the end."
good,A large company with versatile work area having several department for work opurtunities to maintain a standard of technology. Verizon is a leading company of united states onshore and off shore offices.
good,Time off and benefits are good. Home based agent positions are not entry level. Schedule changes every six months. Leadership is iffy and some have favorites.
good,"Verizon is an excellent company to work for however, everyone is not built for it. Most positions are very stressful with no flexibility or work life balance."
good,While working at Verizon Wireless you will quickly realize that if you dnt know something about the product they will Always makes sure you have the resources to get the product knowledge you need.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Monthly and Quarterly reviews of the Accounts. Technology review of the accounts and revenue reviews of each account to ensure targets are met for company grown. Current technology reviews with the customers to ensure they're able to fully benefit from the technologies available for any vertical or solution that fits the need of the customer business model.
good,Overall the pay could be better commission is not much for as much as they expect out if you. They don’t care about their employees as much as they should
good,I was really excited to work for them and this was when they passed out the tech support and customer service rep in the store going to just sales only-there was a tragic Gap felt when those roles were phased out tbh
good,"Fast passed, good work load. did not take work home with me. good sales experience. fast paced commission based sales job. far drive to ann arbor, good benefits."
good,"Management can be over-barring which can make job stressful. "
good,I have met some great people along the way that inspire me to be better at my job by their example. When I started almost 19 years ago  everyone I worked with had a sense of pride for where they worked.
good,"Everyday is different as far as attending to resolving issues that fall under installations, network anomalies, customer followup resolutions and internal escalations that needed to be addressed. I found it very enjoyable in isolating and resolving issues that were escalated to me. Working as a team we had pride in being the go to personnel when issues would arise that would have been new to the platform and we were able to isolate it and resolve it. Even out of scope issues, we would go the extra mile and help the customer. Enjoyed to have worked with a very knowledgeable and talented team of technicians."
good,"Verizon is a great company with excellent benefits. They are leading the market in technology and innovation which makes it easier to feel ""run over"" if you do not keep up with the latest and greatest. Management has some of the smartest people I have ever met, which makes it important to understand the companies direction and expectations."
good,"good place to work, management was good, coworkers got along great.  company needs better employee cohesiveness.  pay scale is comparable to other companies"
good,Working at Verizon become stressful. Worked more than 40 hours without over time pay. No backup. Working during vacation and weekends. Good family benefits
good,"Verizon is leading the way to the changes we will see in the very near future and stays on the forefront of innovation. While recent cutbacks have taken place, it is still a place where you can advance, network and see the impact your role plays in the technology that will be next."
good,The job changed a whole lot from the time I started until time I quit. Loved the people I worked with it was like a family. Great pay great benefits. They use to have a lot of sales incentives and contest for employees but that stopped a few years ago. Work life balance isn’t the best due to retail situation. Overall a good job with a good company.💯
good,Verizon is a great place to work if you know what your role is and what you want to do. You create a culture with your team and peers. That is what makes it fun and worth going in everyday.
good,"I worked for a retail company, and working for a retail/ stand alone franchise company could have it's good or down falls. The company I worked for had more downfalls, and I didn't feel comfortable working there because of what they would ask us to do. Their would be fraud and dishonesty. Long story short I quit before my year mark, because I didn't agree with the culture of the Verizon Authorized dealer I worked with. But Verizon corporate is great."
good,A great place to work and be well compensated.  You have opportunity to grow and advance.  You have the ability to work overtime and even join a union if it is your desire.
good,"1.  Enjoyed working at Verizon."
good,"Knowledgeable employees - Industry leader - very flexible"
good,good company to work for very friendly very fast-paced business just have to be wary of which neighborhoods that you work in outside of that it's a great company I recommend it to most people
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon strives for perfection and is a stat based company. Verizon strives to be number 1 in all that they do. The hardest part of my job was defending the price vs competitors. The most enjoyable part of the job is the health care benefits.  The training is great as industry continues to evolve and they strive to make sure you are up to date on all cellular equipment and new devices.  The one thing that could be frustrating is the way we are surveyed by customers.
good,"Good place to start career and learn new technologies."
good,It uses lot of technologies and provides good scope for learning and informal networking with all level of employees in India and other countries. A bit bureaucratic and outdated in their appraisal methods.
good,Verizon is an overall good place to work.  They do expect you to perform but the work is steady and technically varied. Fairly good camaraderie.  Customers can be very demanding and that is one of the most challenging aspects of the job.
good,"High stress/fast paced environment"
good,"Unrealistic expectations "
good,My experience working at Verizon was positive overall. Constantly trying to improve the culture at a huge complex corporation. The education is business is superior to other companies.
good,"It's a laid back environment as long as you do what you are supposed to. As far as advancement, I didn't see much. But the perks and benefits were very good. Decent vacation. Good place to work at overall!"
good,Great place to work overall. Verizon has a very fast-pasted call center environment. You must be detailed oriented on order to be successful.  Verizon boasts a hands-on leadership team that offer tons of constructive criticism.
good,Verizon is a place where you can earn quite a bit more money than other retail jobs. This allows one to save and hopefully start their own business at some point. If you enjoy retail and wish to remain in that field it appeared quite accessible to become an assistant store manager and go from there.
good,Hard but rewarding work. Good envirnoment and employee friendly. Well compensated for sometimes difficult work. Training could be more put on management rather having the employees trying to read about new products and procedures on line.
good,"Great company, excellent,  health insurance/benefits, & compensation plan. There is very very limited opportunity for local career advancement.  There is a poor work life balance."
good,Great job to have with different career options and a great salary. Really good Benefits. Great Health Care. And overall good atmosphere to work in. It is a great job because you get to learn so much about the high tech communication world
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if you're looking for culture, a company that cares about you, and great benefits. Some of the management can be a little off putting, but that comes with most jobs. The job requires taking customer service phone calls for the entire shift, aside from two breaks and a lunch. There was little to no-time between calls for the entire shift."
good,"I worked for a Verizon retailer for almost a year. Although it could be stressful at times, it was a great learning experience. Luckily I had a fun group of coworkers who also cared about their jobs and kept the morale high. The owners were also great people and would come in or call frequently so if there was anything you needed they weren't too are out of reach. Customer service was a BIG part of the job and dealing with irate people or people who couldn't grasp technology could get very tiresome. But to reach your goals every month you had to build a good client base."
good,"hard working "
good,I enjoyed my time working there. Overall it was a good experience for a call center. A lot of growth opportunities once you are out of the call center environment.
good,"Availability, long hours, and great pay. Has an exceptional view with a great management. No other additional information. Please refer to call for additional information regarding company"
good,"Between the time that I started and when I left, approximately 5 people quit and 3 people opted to work at a different location. Those people were not replaced with new employees so as a result we were severely understaffed. As a result, customers came into the store irritated because it was a prime location and with limited staff, wait times on average were 45-60 minutes. There was never room for time off as a result of this staffing issue, and they frequently requested employees to come help out on days off."
good,"Working for Verizon was an amazing experience, i worked with phenomenal sales professionals and management. We had to part ways due to a shift in management."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This job will provide a lot of stress into your life. As with any call center job, you will be interacting will all kinds of people, and by the end of the first year (if you make it that far) most employees become jaded. You can leave a call feeling like you made a difference and brightened someone's day, but most of the time you will be treated in a hostile manner by ungrateful customers who suspect your advice and well wishes as you trying to pull one over on them. The management at Verizon is great, the team mates will keep you sane, and the overall culture is very kind to employees. This is a hard job with little thanks from the people you will help and is not for everyone. For those who can make this a part of their life and manage to leave the negative feelings at work and not bring it home with you - you will receive fair pay with small annual raises, and great benefits."
good,Pay is good and discount off your phone bill is very good.  They need to do better on work/life balance. Verizon is always changing commissions and adding more work to your job title for same pay.  It’s all in who you know if you wanna move up in the company.  Benefits are great.
good,Great company to work for but the work life balance needs to be addressed. The benefits are great but you spend over 50 hours a week hustling to hit your quota and requesting time off isn't easy.
good,"The security safety  of their employees doesn’t really matter to them, but they pay well. Benefits are nice too but you will get stressed out with the customers"
good,Great Place to work if you dont mind high demand sales environment and are OK with ever changing sales commission structure that only accommodates companies views and demands versus employee satisfaction.
good,"You are paid very well and the expectation is that you perform very well.  At times, you will be expected to work more than just 40 hrs, but the rewards are in your benefits, exposure and career advancement."
good,The focus on sales numbers drove a lot of people out and created an environment of loose ethics. There was constant oversight from management and constant coaching. Those that sold the most were usually a little unethical and then rewarded with management positions.
good,"Verizon gave me the opportunity to become an asset the moment I graduated college. A typical day at work could become stressful but my teammates always kept me motivated. The hardest part at times would be the not being trained on our products. This would cause many of us not to be set up for success. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the morale, my teammates and the bond I created. I feel as though the management would be challenging due to every supervisor was different. One supervisor stood as she taught me to be responsible for my performance and to give 110% on every customer interaction."
good,"Verizon is very stressful. It’s not very big on compassion fatigue. You really just worked hard and earned the rewards. The breaks are strict so be prepared to sitting long periods of time. Appreciate your breaks and get back on time adherence is stringent."
good,"I would still be working at this company if they didn't move our position overseas. The benefits were great, location of our office was convenient, overall I really liked this job."
good,Verizon is a solid company with great benefits. Leadership positions are highly competitive and roles are generally filled by internal applicants.  There is great opportunity to move up and across organizations at the management and lower level.
good,High paced with a tremendous amount of things in motion for projects. Work allot to try to keep up. Continuous technology changes which was great and kept you in your toes.
good,Verizon was great for the time I spent there. There the ones who got me back into college. They also reinforced what my brand was all about and was my best own investment.
good,"I worked for two years and it was a fine place to work. The placed closed now but when i was open it was a good company to work for, boss was very nice and great way to get your foot in the office assistant job."
good,I really have no complaints of my time and Verizon. It is a very competitive environment with a lot of politics. You have a lot of advancement if you play the political games.
good,The work environment is good.  The schedule is erratic.  This makes it difficult for a good work life balance.  Management was good to work with.  A lot of surprise changes from higher up with little or no notice.
good,"It was a fun and good environment to work in. Always had good hours and overtime, if you needed more training or more help on the job they will have the help ready for you"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I had a great Supervisor and Team , we all looked out for one another and  well together.  The pay was industry standard and the reward was able to put my Kids through college."
good,Verizon was a great place to work but most of IT was outsourced to a 3rd party company with provided some employees some uncertainty of future. Flexible scheduling and ability to work from home was great!
good,"I dedicated 12 years of my life to Verizon Wireless.  I allowed them to transfer me from my hometown to Birmingham, AL.  I wanted to be a Call Center Supervisor, however, I was transferred out to retail.  In retail, I was a device specialist initially and ultimately an Operations Manager.  I helped open three new corporate locations in Birmingham, however, I never had job security.  I was finally laid off in 2017."
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with there for the most part and the pay and benefits are unmatched. 6% for the 401k and multiple coverage plans you can choose from. The company culture is pretty ruthless from a business standpoint and they only fake care about work life balance.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,Decent job with the potential to be a career.  I learned alot in my time there.  I just do not appreciate being around drugs dealers and drug abusers in my day to day work life
good,"The benefits and pay made it worthwhile but it was pretty stressful which made it difficult to balance our work/personal lives. It was a great company to work for in the beginning but became more and more micromanaged in the last few years. My co workers throughout the years made it bearable. They were the best part of working there. What I did not like about working there were the issues with the internal systems, all the nick picky policies and the lack of communication between specialized teams. Our work would have been less stressful if systems worked as intended, policies were streamlined throughout the markets and they facilitated communication between internal teams. Many of our specialized team would only accept emails, which really slowed down progress. I loved my job but the increased lack of control in getting my work done made it frustrating."
good,Over all it was a great place to work. I left on great terms. If I wanted to go back I could.  The hours were the main reason I left..the pay was extremely well.
good,"If you love a fast paced, inbound call center career it is the one for you. Can talk to people all around the United States. It was definitely a learning experience."
good,IT Infrastructure Management  Data Centre Management  Strategy Formulation  Transitions & Migrations  IT Operations Management   Change & Release Management  Service Delivery Management  Hiring/ Recruiting/ Appraisals  Training & Development  SLO's/ SLA's/ TAT/ KPI's/  MIS/ Documentation  Project Management  Presentations  Target Achievement  Team Leadership  Customer Relationship Management
good,"Great way to gain experience and has opportunities to move up. However, it has created a culture of micromanagement, but if you are willing to stick it out there is benefits that will make it worthwhile."
good,"Verizon Treated me well.  Depending on the position, sometimes work life balance is difficult.  Annual headcount reductions over past 5 years raised stress level."
good,"I had good experience working for Verizon, compensation and benefits were above average.  "
good,"This job is what you make it. There was alot going on. ALot of systematic issues, a couple problems with Management but that can easily be resolved. Rude customers are a big factor in the sales industry. So You create your own experience"
good,Enjoyable world leading telecommunications company to work for. Verizon  is a large company with lots of different options for employment. Compensation and benefits are above average for skilled employees.
good,A few rotten management spoils the bunch. Had 5 managers during my time there. Had lots of issues with 2 of the women in management. So much so I asked to be removed from a team. When that couldn’t happen I had to leave
good,"Verizon is built on acquisition after acquisition, for this reason they have many different disconnected systems that fail to work together.  In order to get something done you need the human component to bridge the gap between the systems.  For this reason the folks that have been with Verizon forever are invaluable be cause they have seen the evolution of these systems."
good,"But..."
good,"The people I worked with were great, but the job in a call center is rough. Taking calls is the job, and the call metrics were not hard to meet. At the time offering to sell something was mandatory and I was not a big fan of that."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  Good pay, very good benefits.  They expect a lot from their employees, but they give a lot back in return.  The work can be demanding, but most telecommunications work is."
good,Overall the company is a great place to come to work and make money. They do provide you with enough products and services to make it possible. The benefits are great and you are guaranteed full time hours. They are sales and metric driven so it can be very repetitive but you can definitely make it a career for a ten year span.
good,"Can be as much of a relaxed work environment or as much of a stressed environment, it all depends on management mood. Great place to develop sales/people skills. depending on the particular month the opportunity to make money depends on whatever leadership decided the month's targets are."
good,It's a good company to work for. They offer benefits and job security. They are very data driven in their management style which can lack a human element an seem very robotic.
good,"Solid Company to word for.  I think they treat their employees well.  They have a good benefit program and treat their employees very well. Overall, a good company."
good,Great place to start a career in the communication field. Also a good place to broaden your knowledge about technology and the frequent changes that’s come with it
good,"Verizon is not very flexible when it comes to having small children that may get sick.  They expect you to be on the phones from the beginning of your shift to the end with no interruptions.  If you have a sick child, you are expected to get someone to tend to them."
good,"I get to work around 8 am get my computer set up, check inventory to see what I have to login and see what I have to dope off to Fed x I have learned how to build a cage for the inventory and how to use a spread sheet. the hardest part of my job was getting Lay off  the most enjoyable thing would coming to work and working  with a great team"
good,"Verizon started off as a great company to work for and I feel has lost sight of what made it great. They still have great benefits which entices people to stay, but I feel immoral some days I work."
good,Productive and had opportunity to advance in career. Excellent advancement in pay. Didnt have work life balance. Flexible hours but the workload was not balanced.
good,"Great environment to learn while also growing as a leader and manager.  Fun and engaging atmosphere. Great experience, this a job that helped teach new skills and refine old skills."
good,Great place to advance your career because they will pay for additional schooling if you choose.  Stable and fun environment with plenty of work so there is never any downtime.  Great place to meet new friends and have fun.
good,"A solid option for some who choose. When I was there they had just switched from a yr. Schedule, to a six month. Options to switch. I loved having Sunday & Monday off."
good,"I was with Verizon for about 10 years. from 2008 to 2018, compensation was great at first but reduced over time. "
good,"During my time there, I started out as a Customer Care Rep (CCR). My job was to help the sales reps as they finished their sales to take over and begin processing the activation and transfer of information of their devices. I also taught classes on how to use their devices. Moving up to sales wasnt as easy as I thought. I had to prove that I could sell and sold things with no benefit for myself to show that I can upsell after a sale was done. "
good,"Typical workday for me was doing paper work, strong customer service skills. I oversaw inventory mgt. shipping, receiving and operations. Overall the company is a good company to work for."
good,good company to work for with opportunities to educate and advance. Training provided as needed and as required consistently. Workforce prepared adequately to perform duties.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, but they need to have customer service at the store level. There are a lot of sales pushed to the online services."
good,Why would you want me to review this company. in order for me to continue with using this service. If i did not want to do it? This will be all i put for right now. Until i find out more about how this site operates.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great Benefits, nice place to work.  relaxed culture.  Good leadership.  Company motto is run to not run from problems.  Employess are given tools to do job"
good,Had amazing management that just wanted to get everyone trained and paid. Constant training and learning was always going on. Which in turn made interactions with clients much easier and stress free.
good,I worked in various roles over 12 years with the company.  I was acknowledged for doing good work but felt that it was hard to advance with the company.  I was not paid based off of my education and felt I was underpaid for majority of my time at the company.
good,"They have alot of events and services to make coming to work enjoyable, such as professional muse to come in two time a week ."
good,"Founded in 2000, the company operates America’s most reliable wireless network and the nation’s premier all-fiber network, and delivers integrated solutions to businesses worldwide. With brands like Yahoo, TechCrunch and HuffPost, the company’s media group helps consumers stay informed and entertained, communicate and transact, while creating new ways for advertisers and partners to connect."
good,"The understanding has been a company you will retire from once hired. Managers that previously worked in every part of the job, many having 25+ years in the company"
good,"Most managers seem to mean well."
good,Constant commission changes. I was lucky enough to be in a store with a good management culture.  With the commission changing all the time it could put some stress on the employees.  I am very grateful for the opportunity the company gave me though and would recommend it to people that are trying to get into sales.
good,"Good company to work for, you get what you put into it. Average pay but does have room for improvement. Part-time pay is also above minimum wage, they also care about student employees."
good,Overall positive experience. Learned to handle multiple tasks. Constant need to think outside of the box. Learned to use best judgement to resolve a given situation.
good,Working here I met a lot of good people who loved what they did and it shows in the environment. It is very competitive and demanding but worth it in the end because you are compensated well.
good,"Good company with great benefits for a FTE, if you are a contractor much of the benefits wont apply."
good,over the years the company revolved from a employee first environment to production and numbers. It has lost the overall advantage of being a company who always did the right thing to a money hungry political business.
good,Verizon has a really good team culture.  IT has changed a lot in the last 6 months.  Half the team has been re-badged to Infosys.  As a Sr Mgr the job has changed to more vendor management and security reviews.
good,"The job itself wasn't too bad, I just did not consider myself a sales person. They provided good training and they always did prizes for when we did well. It was a cool environment and I worked with great people."
good,"Verizon Business (legacy MCI) was/is a wonderful company to work for. I left after 29 years of service, but would gladly do it again. Co-workers and customers were very nice. Work environment great. Every manager that I every reported to from the beginning until I left were all very knowledgeable."
good,"Overall good company but needs work on company culture - not consistent across orgs. "
good,"Was good in the beginning.  Not so much in the end. Employees lost more and more ""coos"" as time went on. I did not feel supported by upper management in 2018"
good,"Sick time was horrible. Performance reviews were not fair. Bidding for shifts was not fair, Could have had better events for employees. Base pay for entry level should start at $17.00 in California."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"More job security required ."
good,"While a massive company, the workplace culture is focused on employee growth and skill advancement. Employees are consistently learning new technologies and skills through consistent and effective training programs."
good,Loved working for Verizon but the management would form cliques within the company. This would put a damper especially being around the clique. You would know whenever they would be talking behind your back and bad mouthing you. Also every month or so they would start firing people who weren't hitting the quotas instead of helping them achieve their goals.
good,"The store environment was very unprofessional, advancement not a option. Regional director was not interested in a manger with 17 years of customer service management with the company. I had a very productive and successful career. Until I came to the store. Director told me she wanted some else for the position. But they did not pass the test for management. I did successfully pass the test. The store Manager had no control over the team."
good,Verizon End User Support is just a contract position. Difficult to get your feet in the door in reference to employment. I'm more of a Networking guy.
good,Good overall work environment. Not great at pay for such high goals. Have had a good experience overall. Potential to grow for some like myself. As long as you follow guideline it can be a nice line of work.
good,"Verizon is large company with hundreds of thousands of employees. My day is typically dictated by me. I set me meeting schedule and I arrive at work to make sure my meetings are attended. I've learned agile project management, SCRUM, Kanban and Lean techniques. Management at Verizon is sometimes lacking. My personal manager has been my manager for 6 years. But senior leadership has been up and down. "
good,"Verizon is cutting edge in technology and revolutionary to bringing the gap forward to what a company should be. However, I was employed by a third party contract so my opinion differs towards them."
good,"Your manager and your team make a big impact on the quality of work you will have and the job satisfaction you will have. The facility is nice, with a ping pong table that I never had the time to use, but I saw some people taking advantage of it. Summer time is nice when they have food trucks and concerts outside on Thursdays, again if you have the time to enjoy it."
good,"Good company to work for if you like innovation and learning new technologies. Nice co-workers. "
good,Verizon is a great company to work for with great benefits.  A typical work day consist of focusing on our customers and making sure they are valued with the best service.
good,"There is not a lot of opportunity for innovation at Verizon, but there are fairly well established procedures for each step in the software development life cycle."
good,"High call volume"
good,When I started I started as a sales rep so there’s more than enough room for growth with the company helping customers was the goal understanding the products was fun and easy
good,"Very good company to work for, no compassion for kids being sick.  You can advance quickly if you start at the bottom of the pay scale.  If you come in the door making top pay, you are then capped out and have nowhere else to go, until the union negotiates a new contract for more money."
good,"It was the best place I ever worked and had it not been for the disagreement between verizon and our union, i'd still be there today. Sure, some of the jobs we had sucked but, the pay was good, the managers were respectful and even working long hours wasnt too sour"
good,"Positive working environment.   Most goals attainable and realistic.  Good resources to work with senior people."
good,I spent seven years here. It was very far but liked the environment and the people I worked for. It came time to stop all the long commute and my time here came to the end.
good,Good work place to work and raise your family. Flexible work hours. Great work and personal life balance. People there are very helpful and willing to share information.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The job itself was not too tough. However, their unrealistic phone matrixes are not fair nor do they always apply. For the most part, supervisors were understanding of situations although they work under the same matrixes. Good schedules are tough and hard to come by. Your first 3 years there, you will work the late shift. Seniority guides shift bids and no one leaves. So, the chances of you getting a great schedule are slim to none as a new comer."
good,Verizon is a good company to work for with great benefits. I work in a store location as a Solutions Specialist. Which meant I did about 60 to 70% customer service and the rest sales. If that is what you are looking for and have at least 2 years of college than it is a good place to try to get a job.
good,It was a great job for someone who really was interested in furthering their career in sales and increased personality. I enjoyed the technical traits of the job.
good,I worked for a third party store and I recommend working for a corporate store not a third party store. These third party store will make you lie/steal to your customers to make a good commission check
good,Job security can be an issue in certain groups. When new business areas are embarked upon people are brought on board in droves but the company can quickly switch gears and cut ties with these new recruits.
good,"Great company benefits, tuition reimbursement and commission. Culture is what you make of it, if your preforming its good, if your not performing it may be more difficult."
good,Verizon was great to work for but as companies merge their surface new agendas which are sometimes makes and employees and staff jobs a little difficult then need be.
good,Verizon provides the most in terms of pay and benefits of any company I have worked for.  Job security is questionable as it depends on some poor leadership in place.
good,Every day was a challenge.  I have learned a tremendous amount of skills.  Learned how to work under pressure and collaborate with other employees and companies.
good,"definitely had a lot of opportunity to met new people and sometimes would have to go work at other local stores to help out if needed. the people I worked with were great. management at my particular store was garbage but with the right people around you, it was nice. I wish the pay scale was different or else I would've stayed longer"
good,"Try to go for client facing roles, as the opportunity to build contacts and learn is immense."
good,"great environment to learn multiple work functions because you are expected to take on all presented.  Work hard and may get promoted.  "
good,"Awesome job and the bottom line is ""We get it done"" always. We are reliable!  The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery of my fellow employees.  Working in this environment forces you to stretch your abilities and talents to meet the goals of the organization."
good,"Overall I believe Verizon pays well & gives plenty of room for advancement. That being said, it is a fast paced & competitive work environment. There are strict goals stores must meet & sales are basically all management cared about. In my particular location I felt the men employees were favored & that was often off-putting. There were times I felt I went above & beyond my job description & it was underappreciated. There were a handful of managers that were excellent & genuinely cared about your well-being, success & concerns with the position. If you are able to put up with a ""boys club,"" meet sales goals, and work often longer than your scheduled shift this job would be great for you. The pay usually made it worth it. & since you work a lot you become close with your team. I often miss the comradere of my Verizon location."
good,good pay as long as they don't change it on you. Commissions often changed within GoWireless which was annoying however everyone I worked with was great!
good,too many changes on a daily basis and quotas were almost unattainable unless youre taking advantage of every customer. management worked with the staff to help with schedules if needed time off. benefits were great
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon Wireless. Employee recognition was great. Benefits were wonderful as well as compensation. There was constant opportunities to enhance your career and build a career path. After 1.5 years of employment, the dynamic changed when the regional manager changed. Times were stricter, company moral was lost. I was unable to cope with the negative changes that I eventually was placed on medical leave and given depression medication until I left the company. Had the moral not changed, it would have been a wonderful place to tell people to apply to. With that unfortunate change, the branch I worked in closed down after I left 7 years later."
good,"I worked in the office for what feels like forever ago now, however, I have fond memories of those I worked with along with management.  There seemed like there was an opportunity to grow and advance quickly if you took your job seriously.  I was promoted 2x in less than 2 years I worked there.  I only left because we moved out of state."
good,"A typical work day as a project manager for the data center is dealing with various in house groups."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good work enviroment"
good,The company is a good company to work for and they offer great benefits. They offer Tuition Reimbursement and provide the payment at the beginning of the semester versus the end of the semester like some programs.
good,Great company benefits and pay along with stability. This is a company that will be around as long as people are using their phones for snapchat and facebook.
good,"Excellent experience overall. Went thru lots of organizational changes along with job duty changes. "
good,Great work environment.  Understandably unstable due to recent changes in wireless and tech industries.   Struggling to adapt to being a mature market
good,"A typical day starts with logging in my system which consist of how we clock in, bringing up about 4 different systems to get started. then it is answering phone call back to back.  I learned that no matter how many calls are in the que I can only handle one at a time where I will provide the best customer interaction to that call to ensure a satisfied customer.  Management gave you information weekly of your progress to let you know what you did good and things that you need to work on.  The workplace culture was diverse, our dress code was relax but I believe in dressing for success.  we did different activities and cultural training to avoid and misconceptions of anyone where everyone is treated fairly regardless of race, religion or sex.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the different technology of the phones and their operating system. I truly enjoyed learning the new systems that the company incorporate because that would give me a chance to learned new things and to keep me up to date with the ever changing systems."
good,Large technology infrastructure.  Focused heavily on network reliability and security.  Family friendly.  Management direction currently in transition.
good,Good company.  Great benefits and good work-life balance. I would recommend working here. I had challenging assignments and was granted autonomy to work on those.  Collaboration between departments can be challenging.
good,"A Typical day at Verizon Wireless is Very busy depending on your location. Customer facing non stop."
good,It was a great place to learn sales. One of the best sales training in the world. Commission use to be better. Goals got harder to hit in recent years. Still a decent salary and the best benefits I have ever had.
good,"Relaxed and productive atmosphere with positive value. Open and honest communication within all levels of staff. Commitment to excellence, cooperation, support and empowerment from management. Sense of humor, respect, compassion, flexibility and understanding between all level of staff."
good,"Very fast paced and challenging sales environment, incentivized with good performance and great benefits. Management gives a lot of constructive feedback and helps you learn and develop skills on a daily basis. Learn to give a great customer experience and tie customer needs into a tailored sales solutions to meet customer needs."
good,"I'll begin by saying Verizon has a lot of benefits in working for them. They used to pay commensurate with the area and industry to stay ahead of competitors. However as the business has gotten saturated, they have only focused on the corporate structure making all the money. It has essentially become a really large pyramid scheme. They no longer pay you for all the things you are selling, yet the company continues to get paid for those things. Also it's retail, the work/life balance is yelled from the mountain tops, but not actually evident. Their benefits are slightly above average in regards to medical costs and 401k match, but the 401k is preset blends of portfolios that are low risk / low rewards. All in all going back to my original start, I would have rated Verizon an 8/10 but with the new developments and pay scales, it's more like a 4/10. It's certainly 100% a what have you done for me lately kind of company, while they have taken away the opportunities to do more with your time."
good,"Our role at the call center was to process all phone orders, both business and consumer, through our systems so their phone service would work with all features expected. We also processed all directory orders for the upcoming phone books."
good,"Must be open to consultative selling. Great store environment, commission sales,  retail hours with meetings and conference calls constantly coming up."
good,"While Verizon offers good benefits, the work environment has been on a steady decline in terms of enjoyability over the past 3-5 years.  Traveling to area of responsibility takes 1.5-2 hours each way requiring 3-5 hours of driving per day."
good,"Lots of work load and information."
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits, results oriented culture, dedicated to innovation, continuous process improvements and transformation, very diverse"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. With Verizon, you are given the opportunity to progress quickly within the company.  It's what you make out of it!"
good,This is a great place to work. I was in the Boston Market and it was one of the most fun and pleasant experiences that I ever had. I enjoyed my time here. The support was top tier and the team was always there.
good,"Exceptional benefits. Would almost think it was union. Take advantage of the education benefits and find something off the phones. Very stressful metrics. One call could ruin your performance for the month, and you could of done everything in your power to take care of the customer's issue. Just the way it is."
good,Starts with busy in the morning to till 3pm and good place to learn. Less interaction with management. Good Work culture. War room is the hardest. All are team work.
good,Being in sales in Verizon can be tough if you work in the NY/NJ area. Managment can hold meetings and really put the pressure on. It's a good job overall if you are self motivation and don't mind a hard nose manager.
good,"Working in the GL region. Working for Verizon,"
good,Looking for a career in which I can grow. Currently employed at Verizon with no growth in company. Due to work hours and commute I have missed alot of my children's childhood and now seeking either a closer commute or different hours than the 1-9pm the I have worked for the last 10 years. Management at Verizon usually changes every year so as soon as your comfortable with the work style of management you get someone else who is looking for something different but I have no problems adjusting to what the company needs. A typical day would consist of taking about 30 phones calls with selling and managing the objective for the customer. I reach my sales quota every month and will continue to work hard for any employer.
good,The Wireless telecom industry has become saturated within the last decade resulting in a fundamental shift in Verizon's approach to business.  This has created a work environment which is constantly in flux with reorganizations becoming a consistent narrative.  Over the course of two years I worked under six different direct managers and 3 directors.  The company does provide great benefits and invests heavily in new tools and trainings.  Verizon is also very good with working with its employees to create a strong work/life balance.
good,The job teaches sales techniques and tactics which can be used in many areas of work to handle person-to-person interaction and presentation of products. High goals expected but goals are subjects to change often.  Management is supportive in making sales but could be better about system knowledge within the company.
good,Job has great benefits. The culture of fear is not that great. It is easy to overlook many of the negatives with the what is offered for what the job is.
good,Verizon is equal parts innovative and stuck in its ways.  The people I've worked with throughout the years have made those hurdles much easier to get over.  The opportunities to learn things (internally as well as a solid tuition assistance) are all there assuming you take the time to put in the work.  Overall steady work and you get what you give.
good,"Verizon is hectic and busy, and is a great place to learn. There is a variety of technology platforms to work on. I would have stayed if my job had not been relocated to another state."
good,"Great stepping stone, to elevate yourself before moving on to bigger/better things. Your existence will always be looked at as a desirably avoided expense to higher management. Overtime Pay first 8 hours time and a half. Every hour after is double time."
good,"Working for the company can be rewarding but at the same time stressful. Hourly is fine, but to obtain commission you have to meet certain goals. This highly encourages customer interaction and service."
good,"Verizon has always been a great company to work for. There's plenty of opportunity for you to grow and advance your career within just a short time. The company also matches your 401K at 6%, your health benefits start on your first day and you also receive tuition assistance; not to mention an annual STI bonus 10% of your base salary."
good,I was learning alot from my from work experience at Accenture since I was working at different of Projects and different types of client contracts.  Projects sometimes have very tight deadline.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I loved working for Verizon when I began in 05. In the beginning there were bonuses and so many ways to get involved with the company culture. You didn't just go to work and then come home. BUT things seemed to get worse and extracurricular activities were cut, management went downhill and ultimately I couldn't wait to leave! The call center I worked at closed a few years later so I guess you could say I saw the writing on the wall."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. They have excellent customers and a great network which satisfies the customers. A typical days includes anything from a phone upgrade to customers switching over multiple phones to Verizon. Customers purchasing accessories, tablets, connected devices, etc."
good,I believe this would be a great company for someone fresh out of college.  The hourly pay is not great and commissions could be better.  They also could have better annual reviews.
good,"Enjoyed the staff and the customers but the work environment is greatly centered around inexperienced college students. However if you don't have a degree and speak Spanish chances are you will be paid more than your peers."
good,"Retail environment helping customers with issues ranging from forgotten passwords to what service to purchase. Learned about the telecommunications industry, billing, and typical devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Work culture is fast paced and rewards the most efficient sales members."
good,The hardest part of the job is the retail hours and the demand it places on you and your family.  Verizon takes pride with its stance within the community.
good,"Many projects occur simultaneously  and there is not enough time or resources.   Teamwork, prioritization, and focus is the best way to complete them."
good,"Fun environment , stress at times but good leadership and structure. good place to learn and grow> God part of the job is he pay and benifits, bad part of the job is it's very micro managed"
good,At Verizon I was able to enhance my skill set.  The company I worked for was in transition after being being acquired by Verizon.  There were some growing pains there.
good,"Cool place to work. Just a personal ethical issue that I would have loved for them to address when it comes to my employment there, that they just swept under the rug."
good,"This job is just like any mobile company job. It is required for you to be a good salesman and have excellent customer service skills. If you don't mind sales, then this is a good company to work for. Stressful goals sometimes, but much more laid back than AT&T atmosphere."
good,"Sorry, did this already and really wasn't comfortable the first time. I would prefer to not discuss Verizon in anyway and do not like feeling pressured to do so."
good,I worked for a vendor who had a third party  vendor agreement solely with Verizon.  Verizon only provided support for me (i.e. supplies and troubleshooting).
good,"The company has an awesome compensation package along with great benefits.  The perks, such as annual bonus,employee discounts and much more are incredible."
good,I am no longer working for Verizon because I took a government job. while employed there I had a great a supervisor/manager. I am a person who likes to travel. If offered a similar job I will definitely think of my options.
good,"No flexibility on schedules.  A lot of mandatory overtime.  "
good,Verizon offers great benefits and potential to earn above average annual salary. Unfortunately working in retail you must be able to balance work/home life due to demanding hours especially during holiday season
good,"Started as an associate, then was promoted to Store Manager.  I really liked working here. My goal was always to provide the best customer service experience I could possibly offer."
good,Up until the last few years it was a great place to work. Then they made some changes that made it fairly uncomfortable and more of a CYA atmosphere and high stress became the norm.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon allow work from home, which is great for pregnant women and also if someone is caring for elders. Verizon has provided me the opportunity to excel in my education and earn a BS degree."
good,Verizon is a good company to work for the atmosphere is great. The culture has changed and is now shifted to accommodate some of the employees but others can some time be ignored.
good,Overall great place to work as long as you have a good manager. Being a retail store hours get hard around the holidays and weekends are a requirement.
good,"Enjoy immediate team and management, enjoy flexibility of working from home when needed in my role, difficult to advance unless in a sales role (which I am not)"
good,"While Verizon isn't exactly a bad place to work, I felt the training was a bit off. There is a lot of product to go over and the time they give you just doesn't seem enough. The pay is okay, and management seems to genuinely want you to succeed. If you catch on quick, and can hold the line then it's a great job. If not, I'd say look elsewhere."
good,training is top notch! Benefits are great! Manager is great! Pay is good. Hours can be hard from time to time - especially around holidays. Large promotional times might be mandatory
good,"Company treats their employees extremely well. Unfortunately, job  intereferes  with your life balance as days and hours of work vary every week. Very high paced environment. Sales driven. Compensated well for exceeding sales metrics."
good,"Career path definitely a plus, lots of ways to advance your career. Spent 12 years there, I would have stayed longer but management became a problem. I miss working there and would love to work as a trainer in corporate office"
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon as I was constantly challenged and busy. It was a very competitive job and was hard to meet their expectations.  Overall it was a great learning experience.
good,"Verizon Communications was created on June 30, 2000 by Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., in one of the largest mergers in U.S. business history. GTE and Bell Atlantic evolved and grew through decades of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. Today, Verizon is a global technology company delivering the promise of the digital world to millions of customers every day."
good,"Great pay if you are willing to put in the work. GREAT BENEFITS much more up to date than most companies, vacation, maternal/paternal leave, health coverage, and 401k match."
good,Slow-paced environment at Mineral location. Typical day involved greeting and obtaining new customers. Restocked inventory and did sales research in downtime.
good,Verizon can be a rewarding company to work for but you just never know. Lay offs are random. One day you can just come to work and its your last day. I've seen this happen too often. Retail hours are draining and Quota can be rigorous. You have to work very hard for your commission. Hourly/Salary plus commission. The growth is limited when moving from retail to corporate. It is extremely rare. You can work to becoming a solutions manager or sales manager but the job security just isn't there. If the company decides to make changes you can all of a sudden find yourself out of a job. Very unsettling.
good,Game rooms alot of advancement opportunities. Still a call center but better pay than most stock options and short term compensation opportunities. Gym available
good,You are never bored working here.  High expectations for a difficult yet rewarding position.  Great people to work with and is fun resolving complicated issues on a regular basis.
good,"The benefits were the best you could ask for. Cell phone perks, I received a 50 % discount while working there. There were a lot of incentives to cell. It was very stressful in having to keep calls to a certain time limit and lack of ability to take desired breaks when necessary. You are tied to your desk and expected to stay there."
good,The company is good but need little more caring for their employees. The company can be a little more flexible when it comes to family and work.  The company has good benefits which can be better. The advancement of employees has changed from the time I was there which is great. They can allow more teams to telecommute instead of driving an Hour away in Atlanta traffic.
good,"It was stressful because it was a lot of work required. They pushed us to upsell services but if someone was going into nursing home , I'm going to offer blocks to put on phone so no one could make calls or run bill up. I enjoyed providing good customer service. I made sure the customer was satisfied with my service and the company."
good,"I was an overachiever and was rewarded many times for achieving 100% or more of my monthly goal. Then, the company began raising goals to unattainable heights.  I went from overachieving realistic goals to barely or not making my goal.  The company added additional sales associates into my territory, making it impossible to achieve the same goal as if I were the only salesperson.  I was eventually let go because of my ""lack of performance"" even though I have a Winner's Circle trophy and too many awards and certificates to count.  I worked for this company for 5 years and achieved and overachieved for 4 1/2 of those years."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was a great way to launch my sales career.  Retail is something that can be very difficult with the integration of Sales goals with customer service and working with something that has become a basic necessity of everyday life.
good,You will get good pay and you will earn it.  the benefits are also very good.  big corporation and it feels like it.  sales are hard core with good return in pay
good,Great place to work. However if you are easily stressed or have anxiety I don’t recommend working here. It’s cut throat. You will be worked to the point of wanting to scream and walk off the job. The customers can be very rude and will make you feel bad.
good,"Manager of sales team"
good,"From my 2 years there, we had a lot of fun as employees. We really did try to make the customers happy and focus on the clients. From time to time coaching form managers varied and the vision and execution changed."
good,Overall a good place to work to gain experience. Chance to work with multiple tasks. Dealing with customers is also a plus to improve communication skills.
good,I didn't see much advancement unless you were in the inner circle of certain people. I worked there for 5 years and could not wait to leave because of the lofty sales goals and unrealistic expectations on the sales floor. I did learn a lot about the sales process but that is a requirement to maintain job security.
good,Its a competitive mobile industry the demanded a lot from you. I did not get a chance to experience the full advantage of the company because I was temping at the time but the benefits were great for full-time employees.
good,Back in the the wireless industry was booming and Verizon was on to when it came to paying their employees. Commission was great so was the lead generation program
good,Great company to work for.  There are always issues within a company for change but Verizon change very often and sometimes its not good for the moral or the retail teams.  Also a frontline employee you do feel helpless about your career advancements and job security.
good,If you live at home and going to University this is great. If you are beyond this level not so much. Seek more of the support and technical positions for greater fulfillment.
good,Goals to hit bonus is pretty high so its pretty stressful. The people were great to work with and you get discounts on products. I learned a ton about phones.
good,"you get paid by how much effort you put in! If you're willing to work a lot, you can make a lot! I wouldn't work for them again since becoming a mother and having more responsibilities."
good,Good Place to work. The only thing I did not like was working every weekend. The hourly pay was pretty good and you were eligible for raises evry 3 month. Good bonus opportunities.
good,"Great place to work but, being on call 24/7 for a week can wear you down a bit. Over great pay with great benefits. Company provided truck was great to have."
good,Got nothing to say. It was a good place to work at and the environment was good. The schedule always suck cause I never knew what my schedule would be until that Sunday of the week.
good,"I'd like the new open space environment where employees and managers are in the same area. Although it also has focus and meeting rooms."
good,Too many layoffs makes working here stressful. People are fun and smart. Working in a union culture proves to be challenging at times. I would recommend this employer based on its high pay scales.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon was an awesome place to work. I spent a total of 8 years there. "
good,"A great company for learning networks and the next generation networks.  Excellent camaraderie and teamwork in designing, building and maintaining a network that spans the globe."
good,I really have no comment but to say they provide great benefits and if your interested in sitting in a phone al day this job is for you. It’s a good company
good,Company was great to work for however the district was not well educated on markets. Basing a commission structure from a Dallas Market was an unattainable target for the reps.
good,Fun working with other employees. Sometimes there was tention between coworkers. Customers were always kind. Managers were loose on rules. It was a survival of the fittest kind of job.
good,Used to be an amazing company to work sales in. Too many changes not the same as when I first got hired. A lot of changes in the commissions that wasn't the same when I first came to company .
good,My time with Verizon has been nothing but enjoyable. did not have any problems with management or coworkers. However it is time for me to expand my horizons.
good,This place is a great place to work if you have no children. It can be long hours but super fun and allows to grow. Verizon also takes care of employees as far as benefits. I have children so working here was difficult as my children decided to become more involved with sports.
good,Verizon has a great environment and great benefits for its employees. Contractors are treated fairly but do not remain too long at Verizon. Must wait several years as a contractor to get full-time employment if eligible.
good,"Was great position until I was laid off. Came in one day and had no more job, just a year after I was made an employee from contractor. Would like to work there again but that uncertainty will always be there"
good,Take calls and follow my schedule no different from any other job.  Nice workplace culture also had a gym and a cafeteria in the the building...also Strayed on site to for education
good,Large company with good benefits but has Hiring/Layoff periods.  This company is a great place to learn and chances for advancement.  Overall I enjoyed working at Verizon.
good,Worked in the HBA department that is 99% work from home. Home office is heavily regulated and immobile. Must dedicate entire room of house to office. Webcam required for regular meetings. Abnormal schedules due to not having to commute. Work/Life balance suffers.
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"I do not wish to say anything about my experience at verizon, I worked there it was a good experience for me that helped me grow and thats all else I have to say"
good,Great Company to work for. A very diverse workforce. Constantly evolving and advancing in the tech world. Management could use more training and development.
good,"Worked from home.  Great paid training.  Great annual bonus.  Constant middle management turnover.  Software skills with management and long time employees severely lacking.  Typical day filled with regular meetings.  Most employees worked from home, so difficult to build trust."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good sales job if your manager is decent.  Can be less fun if you have a weak manager.  Sales goals are challenging but achievable and benefits are great.
good,Lots of traffic.... angry callers just not conducive to my lifestyle.  Long work hours and a constant push to do more.  I am looking for a more relaxed work place
good,"I worked for an authorized retailer that provide me the training, knowledge, and skills needed to move on and become more successful. Their where ups and downs, but all in all a learning experience."
good,"Though the Verizon Wireless Call Center was exceptionally busy at almost all hours of the day or night, their pay was very good, as well as the benefits.  They worked hard to compensate the employees, knowing that it was a very tough job.  Kudos."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. I think some of the large corporation rules get in the way of real life in a smaller office. However,  as far as opportunities,  I personally have had several offline roles and have been able to help train some of the new people coming in.  I think they do give people different opportunities to do things which I think is good."
good,"I enjoyed working here but the hours were hard on my family life. I learned a lot though the trainings they offered and day to day sales. I would recommend this job to any young professionals, without a family, looking to get into sales."
good,"Former sales rep for Richmond VA area"
good,Benefits are amazing at this company. Education is key for self development and advancement at this company. In retail is the hardest as you do miss a lot of personal events. unless planned in advanced
good,"Ok place to work. Most of the time, it was rather boring working for Verizon. The training was the best part of working for Verizon.  They constantly judged you."
good,Great place to work unless you work in customer service and worst of all technical support. And you seem stuck there with minimal advancement unless you know someone.Benefits are excellent
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. It has amazing benefits and continues to always invest in their employees. They have amazing training and daily meetings. They are very clear about what goals and standards that they want you to meet. The hardest part of the job is the retail hours at times but its a great environment so that helps. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people. You meet a ton of people from all walks in life. I've learned a lot from Verizon including investing in yourself at all times. The management training have also taught me how to be a better leader. Communication is key and how you communicate. Again, I would highly recommend Verizon to anyone who would ask about them."
good,"You are able to thrive with Verizon, but it is competitive. Therefore your work/life balance can be a challenge. Verizon is a numbers company. If you don't meet specific standards, you may not get the schedule you need or desire.  For this reason, having a family can pose a challenge.  The schedules change every 6 months, and your performance and time with the company determine your schedule.  The opportunities to advance, are definitely available. Layoff's happen often as well.  If you don't have any children, and would like to grow professionally, Verizon is perfect."
good,It performance base environment you're definitely replaceable but when it come to the money and compensation you won't regret they try to create a culture of work life balance but trust me it's retail no such if thing of work life balance.
good,I like working here for the simple fact it feels like family but I cant make the odd hours an non steady pay work anymore! I need more flexible normal hours! Besides that Verizon has been great to me!
good,"Frontier bought out Verizon, so it is really no longer Verizon corporate culture any more.  But, given other job, it was fair pay, fair benefits, and some advancement potential, depending on what you do."
good,it was a learning experience. But they lacked the flexibility to implement new ideas. I did learn the importance of being able to change on a whim. My team loved working for me.
good,I was laid off from my position due to a change in the store format which eliminated customer service (non commissioned) employees from most locations.  The format and culture have changed so much since I worked there that I don't feel qualified to review this company any longer.
good,"Verizon is a learning culture. In order to work there you need to be ready to learn a lot and to sharpen you skills continually."
good,"Working here wasn't too bad I enjoyed my coworkers, it could be stressful at times because of the customers and meeting goals such as up sales and customer surveys"
good,My duties included assembling customized
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work for a young, outgoing, driven individual that is comfortable with results based income. The management team I worked with was fantastic and provided training and assistance I requested to help my success while with the company. I decided to leave only to further my management career and I didn't see a clear path with Verizon that I deemed would be the career advancement I am seeking at this time."
good,"Typical day at work - Included quick meeting with manager to discuss daily goals, store performance then on the sales floor to greet customers ."
good,"Laid off back in 2012, company closed irvine location.  Work is  repetitive and not very enjoyable.  The job pays well and the benefits are excellent.  the job, however was very stressful"
good,"Awesome work environment, daily tasks were different to keep up with the changes in the industry."
good,Nothing to say about working for Verizon. Started off as a good company to work for they decided to close the call center and now I no longer work for them
good,This was one of a kind place to work in. The people at Verizon are filled with talents. And there is a lot to learn and contribute. A typical day will start with a sprint and end with a smile.
good,"Although job security became a thing of the past, Verizon rewarded me well for my work. Most of my supervisors were good to excellent. I worked with a great team."
good,"In most cases you would be working alone, and the environment is pretty laid back.  Sometimes I feel I'm overlooked because of my tenure with the company is less than the rest of my team,"
good,Very stressful work place. Often mandated overtime compensation. Very competitive. A CYA type of environment. Low quality insurance carrier. Bonus were often very good compared to other industries
good,I learned the importance of offering additional products and services to customers to ensure that their experience with Verizon was maximized. The culture and environment was fast paced and upbeat.
good,"Verizon offers amazing benefits and competitive pay. If you work in retail, the work life balance is challenging and if you work in the call center it is highly stressful. They do incentivize very well but advancement in the call center is difficult."
good,"Don't have much to say, After 10 years I was willing to let it go for increased stress over calls about cell phone bills and competition with other providers that was benefiting someone make 10 times more than me as executives. Overall the company is a good company to work for but they make you put in the work to get...which you should work but shouldn't be anxious and stressed about simple stuff. I no longer wished to be spoken to like I was nothing."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Verizon wish it lasted longer may go back in the future  I enjoyed the time interacting with customers helping people get things they need to make their lives better
good,The employees are like family at Verizon and we enjoy each other. We collect on account balances and resolve issues with payments. Training new employees and maintaining integrity throughout the process.
good,"Good company, great benefits. Our department does a lot of training is good in preparing you for the next level. They do a lot to prepare you for your career growth and even inquire about which direction you want to go in. The management can use a little fine tuning."
good,Working with customers to help them with billing or cell services. Management never would help you out it was like they were always worried about there job. Hardest part about the job was working with people who didn't know there job.
good,Company moved almost all the functions offshore. Has no interest on onshore employee welfare. Didn't utilize the existing resources well. Started off good but ended otherwise for many employees.
good,"This was a independently owned location, small group of close workers. Overall good place to work, but no advancement opportunities. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the community."
good,"Verizon is a good company , but right now they are going through a head count reduction and some relocations. This creates a little stress depending upon your department."
good,"The Verizon to Frontier transition could have been planned better. Fortunately I was offered a position with Frontier when others were laid off. However, it was a totally different culture."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Nice work areas , cafeteria and nice wooded grounds. Management was friendly to everyone and you felt that your efforts were noticed. The team all got along and had a good teaming environment."
good,"Fast paced, variety of people."
good,"Gym discounts, cafeteria, competative salary and daily activities to keep people engaged. Agents are able to work form home. Groups and management change a lot."
good,"Typical day at work goes by reviewing inventory and inventory count. Assisting customer with issues and in hopes of generating a sale. Cold calling customers is generally what you do when no customers are there. Usually what you during the morning and early afternoon. "
good,Great company with good atmosphere and work life balance.  Great benefits.  Just too many layoffs to feel safe.  I had a wonderful boss that was very easy going.
good,"I really enjoyed the position of Brand Ambassador.  The pay was okay, but there were no benefits and work was 25 hours per week.  I would have never left had the position offered benefits and more hours."
good,"This company has helped me excell in learning to do KPI reporting, how to coach and lead a team and drive metrics for store level and district level. Advancement is reachable,  so if you're dedicated and push hard to help your peers and store you may excell and get to be selected to be in leadership training courses."
good,"Since it has been so long ago, the atmosphere and culture may have changed greatly since then."
good,"Pros: Good Work life balance, flexible timings, good work environment"
good,I truly enjoyed my experience with Verizon and would consider going back to work for Verizon in the future. The culture was well balanced and I learned how to manage people and customers.
good,"i was there for almost 16 years.  at the beginning it was really fun and exciting, but the last couple of years were really stressful and frustrating.  dThe culture throughout the years really change"
good,"Several reductions in forces prior to selling off of much of the landline service made a stressful environment, however, management was always there for their employees."
good,"Though I, for the most part, enjoyed my position at Verizon, the company decided to remove my role from the current center.  Fortunately, there were options to consider - such as relocation to another center, or accepting a work-from-home type situation - though none of those options worked out for me.  All in all, during the few years I was there, it was a pretty nice place to work with a bunch of interesting and diverse characters.  They pay well, and the benefits are nice."
good,"A typical day at Verizon is slow paced. In this environment, I learned more customer service skills and I bettered my selling pitches at the same time. The management is stern but very flexible, scheduling is never an issue. The environment breeds positivity amongst coworkers and even for customers as they come and go. The hardest part of being a sales rep is getting the customer to bite on something they aren't sure about getting but the end of that same sale can be the most enjoyable part for us. Feeling like you really helped them out or helping them get their bill down."
good,"Come into work and read emails. Sometimes there would be a contest for example anyone who had a perfect survey would get popcorn or play ""Planko"" for prizes. I'd take phone calls from clients and do my best to address all of their needs while assessing account, asking questions to recommend upgrades or accessories, and feel empowered to help the client. Management is there when you need them with weekly coachings and call reviews. Hardest part of job is handling callers who have had previous bad experiences with Verizon and upset. However I felt it a challenge to turn them around using my skills. The most enjoyable part of job is the clients, especially when they say thank you and asked to speak to your supervisor to let them know you were appreciated."
good,Great company to work for in a high speed high volume environment. The perks and benefits that the company provides are some of the best that i have seen for any company available day one.
good,"For several years the environment has been great, especially for such a large company. Lately, there have been directions and decisions made that drastically impact thousands of employees. This is not necessarily a knock on the company, but one thing to consider with Verizon is the constant quest for shareholder value, which means continually doing more with less. There are excellent benefits and many of the people are great to work with, but be prepared for automation and consolidations to take many jobs away. This, in turn, results in stagnation with little opportunity to progress, as the log-jam of talent in the middle is stuck not being able to move up, and talent at the bottom has little to no chance of progressing."
good,The facility is closing and going to a Home based model. So support staff and departments lost our jobs. If you like talking on the phones and working from home this these new positions are for you.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall great company to work for. Job advancement is a"
good,Working at Verizon was an awesome experience that helped me to gain useful knowledge in the area of business sales. It is a great atmosphere if you are a single or married couple that is able to balance work/life.
good,It was a great place to work.  Compensation and benefits were great.  They have flexible work schedules after training.  Some supervisors were less than ideal.
good,"Good pay"
good,not a bad job at working as a customer service rep you hear and see a lot of things and they never amaze but overall verizon is a great company. paid 10 an hour
good,"I worked for Cellular Sales, an authorized retailer for Verizon Wireless. The work environment is laid back and they give you lots of freedom. There is no micromanagement. You are required to work at various locations throughout the week. Schedules are made for 3 months at a time. Since it pays commission only, you have the potential to make good money, but only if you are constantly working, and working in the busy, high traffic locations. There were days I made lots of money, and others that I made no money. You are able to pick up and/or give away your shifts. There is no paid sick/vacation/personal/holiday time. However, for example: if you want to plan a vacation, since the schedule is made 3 months in advance, you can notify all of your coworkers that you are giving up your shifts that week. In return, you are notified when the shift is covered. Then, be prepared to return from vacation to work since you've missed out on a weeks pay. Not knowing exactly how much income I would bring in month to month made me uneasy. If you have no obligations and are extremely self motivated and willing to pull out all of the stops with sales pitches, then this may be a good fit for you. Otherwise, the team work, leadership, and overall work environment is very laid back and fun."
good,"I love the management that I have had through the years but I may be just lucky. In Washington there is not much opportunity and very little departments offer the ability to not be on location of your team/manager. The opportunities in Washington are limited and in order for any growth, requires relocation."
good,Great benefits.   Overall good place to work.  Retail hours are rough so plan on working weekends and holidays.  They are accommodating giving time off though.
good,"A typical work day was anywhere from 8-12 hours constant problem solving and  constantly changing from one job to the next."
good,Great company to work for but day to day it is a very competitive environment. Working overtime every week is heavily pushed but not necessary. The corporation however does have questionable morals on their stances on consumer rights.
good,Verizon is a cutting-edge organization to work for. It is a great place to advance your software knowledge. Company offers tons of flexibility. Great place to work.
good,Great culture.  There is a real feel of being part of a team.  We work hard under tight deadlines.  More is asked each day as Verizon trys to trim expenses to increase cash flow.
good,Verizon has been a decent place to work. The company pays very well and the benefits are fantastic. Work/Life Balance is a struggle as it is retail hours for the most part. Trying to advance in the company is based on your interview skills and not on your experience or background. I would highly recommend working for Verizon as a good transition as a sales representative to make good money and have good benefits prior to moving on to the job of your dreams.
good,"A great place to stay on top of your technical game. The opportunity to work on some of the latest technological advancements in the world. Its required to spend private time to stay up to date on new technology. There are 2 yearly reviews the results should be understood thoroughly. To be successful you must understand what management requires from you, there should be no misunderstandings."
good,VZ is a stable company with a very relaxed work environment. Compensation is decent but career advancement is a bit of struggle. Good for fresh candidates who want to start their career in a stable company.
good,"Always opportunities for growth and learning."
good,Verizon Wireless has been the leader in wireless technology network and has provided the ability to learn the rapid evolution of the wireless telephony networks.
good,"Good Solid Company to Work for."
good,"Great pay, for a draining job. Will not hesitate to fire for one month of low quality numbers. Tend to not promote from within. Salaries range from 40k-100k+"
good,Verizon is a nice place to work. The people are great and management is competent and tries to succeed.  Everything the business does is geared towards the customer.  Cost cutting will eventually lead to job cuts.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I was able to establish business relationships with customers."
good,Good Company.  Management varies. Advancement available. Fast paced. Good Compensation.  rapidly changing technology. Culture of change.  A good overall experience.
good,"You can go far. Plenty of opportunity. There can be a lot of silos, so cross functional teams can be difficult, especially when it comes to budgets. The company is lay off happy. There is always a lay off business case in HR for one department of an others. No rhyme or reason, and not based on performance. When it is your turn, you go."
good,typical day would involve logging into the equipment to assure all equipment in-service and taking care of out of service equipment. when new cell equipment added we were responsible for configuring the routers and associated equipment.
good,"Its a great place to work if you are young with a plan to work in that industry. I was quite frustrated working there with the political corporate behaviors but the best part of the job was the compensation, the benefits and the team members I had the pleasure of working with over the years. A typical day in Retail could be unpredictable most times but kept you on your feet."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. the benefits are great and for the most part, they care about the employees. like any other company though, they care about profitability and it can show at times."
good,Not a horrible company to work for if you can handle the day to day mundane duties; The corporate culture is very selfish overall. The supervisors on a local level were great.
good,"If you are great with people, love tech, and are driven Verizon is the place for you! You have a chance to make good money with Verizon in sales and also Verizon is awesome when it comes to trying to move forward with the company. Verizon is a great company to work for, great benefits!"
good,Workplace was enjoyable and fast paced. Fellow employees were great and food was always available. OT was also always available. Training is fun and management was great.
good,"Working for Verizon has it's ups and downs. There is lots of flexibility in your work schedule in certain departments, while others the flexibility is almost non-existent. The benefits are amazing, the biggest concern is making sure that you are noticed and seen otherwise people with less experience and qualifications get positions that you would have been a better fit."
good,"The benefits are the best I've ever seen and working from home is great. If you can handle a consistent threat of being laid off, it's a great place to develop your skills for good pay."
good,Must be self motivated and able to complete complex task with minimal amount of support.  Verizon has a silo mentality and it can be difficult to identify resourse (groups or individuals) responsible for given task.  Management is generally supportive in assiting with indentifying cross functional resources but road blocks still exist.
good,A typical day at work could be busy at times because of daily migrations.  I have learned a lot within the 22 years I have been at Verizon in the End User Support arena.  I have enjoyed my time at Verizon during the first 10 to 15 years.  The bigger the organization got the less it became enjoyable.  Management could have been more involved with directing employees to receive promotions in a timely manner.  The workplace culture is very fair.
good,"I worked for Verizon for over 10 years in Customer Service. The call center rep job was unfulfilling after a while. All calls felt the same after a while. "
good,"I work for the coin department which repaired and replaced the pay phones.  I also worked as a maintenance worker, which means I work in the underground and repaired lines that were out of service. I even work on fios when it first came out.  I learned team management since I was the team leader.  I was the liaison between management and the workers.  Sometimes, it can be stressful, but I was able to diffuse any stressful situation. The hardest part of the job was keeping management out of the way.  Working with a good group of men."
good,if you like a job that changes on a day to day basis or like to get paid for what you put in verizon is for you!! The pay is competitive great benefits
good,"Fast paced environment worked closely with construction, Real Estate and project managers to ensure we were improving cell sites while making sure the general population was safe around our towers and antennas. Hardest part of the job was the constant added projects and mistakes made by others holding projects up."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Completely different environment from a start up. Big and slow. They want to move fast but are slowed down by all their rules. Boss was from the start up and he was great.
good,"Great people at all levels of the company - joining make-positive is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together."
good,"The start of my day varied usually I would open with a manager or a sales rep, if a manager I would check the floor make sure all pegs have been filled , the floor is cleaned and ready for our first customer  and I would do an equipment count to make sure inventory is in order.  If I open with a sales rep I would do a floor check  and direct the sales rep in preparing the floor while I do the cash management counting the drawers, safe fund and opening the registers. I worked directly with the management staff as far as coaching the rep on operation mishaps, inventory processing errors, running operational  reports and I also made the schedule for the store including management staff. I was responsible for store appearance displays, repairs and also making sure the sales rep had what they needed to succeed. I think the most important thing I learnedis that delivery is everything , it is how you say it when coaching someone and everyone is different so learn your staff. The atmosphere at Verizon was a really laid back but professional  and I worked with a very diverse group of people , I loved it.  I think the hardest part of the job was getting use to the lack of accountability from some of my co-workers and the best part of being able help a customer or a rep with an issue and see how grateful they were."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. You'll definitively have to pull your own weight. Leadership will expect 100% and if you give do they'll reward you back.
good,"Overall is fine"
good,"Great coworkers. When I first began working at Verizon, I loved to come to work. The moral was high but began to fall off very steeply and made it hard to come to work. Constant management turnover was very troublesome."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. Friendly clientele and offers competitive commission structure. Management team is relaxed but they motivate you to hit your sales goals.
good,"I worked for Verizon for over 11 years. 10 years in retail and a little over a year in b2b sales. The retail channel is not a lucrative as it once was, but there is still money to be made i b2b. My position was recently eliminated and I accepted a sevarance based on my 11 year tenure, or id still be employed with them."
good,"Good company.  Still leader in its core offerings but trying to transition and catch up with competitors in secondary offerings.  The organization for the most part still does not understand the full benefit and use of indirect channels and is still hampered by its somewhat byzantine processes and disparate systems.  Exec leadership (Fischer, Stratton and McAdam) are all men I admire and would work for again in an NY minute."
good,Recommended workplace. Fast paced and competitive. Great compensation. Paid time off and great benefits. Highly recommended for highly motivated sales people.
good,"Again, great place to work if you are motivated and can manage downtime.  Goals are high and aggressive and the company tracks sales performance with a magnifying glass. If you can hack it you will and can make good money!"
good,"Working at Verizon is often fast-paced and dynamic. Though most roles fall into a routine of managing the status quo and gearing for change. The culture is built on team and company credo, and overall competitive as an organization in the industry and within respective departments and work groups. There is often opportunity for training and development, but it also depends on your management team. The tools are their for employees to take the lead with online resources and many people offer support. The hardest part is keeping up with all the changes in technology and ever expanding portfolio of products and services. The company incorporates fun with special activities, appreciation days, fitness centers and rewards and recognition."
good,"My one problem with Verizon was their Finance Transformation initiative, where they moved many Finance jobs (including mine) to another state and terminated the incumbents."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if you want to live where you work. To meet/exceed quota you have to put in a lot of overtime. They base your productivity on a ""scorecard"" that keeps track of everything you do. It's not as simple as ""sell until you meet/exceed quota"" if you don't do well on scorecard you can get penalized."
good,The cellular industry is always changing and evolving but upper management need to take a step back and focus on the real needs of the customer and get back to the best customer service.
good,I liked the job but could see they were going to layoff my department.  I had to pick a different company to work for to feed my family.  If they had not been doing nay layoffs I would still work for them.
good,The pay is good. The sales environment can be stressful with ever-changing expectations. Grow a thick skin because customers feel it's acceptable to treat you very poorly. Management is supportive. Advancement opportunities do come along occasionally.
good,"A fine work place got many talent people contribute to work on multiple kinds of web service of Verizon, most people are very friendly and helpful here."
good,Verizon is a challenging place to work with that provides opportunities for employees/contractors to contribute creatively.  This is because their processes change often and management churn tends to be high.
good,"Verizon is a highly competitive environment.  The only constant is  change.  I enjoyed working on the Executive escalations team, and helping bring resolution to customers that were ready to leave Verizon."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,It's been over 10 years since being employed here and was part of a company/location lay off which ended my employment with Verizon.  I was forced to gain other employment unfortunately.
good,"The best part of Verizon is the people. The family style environment made it that much easy, day in and day out to not only come to work, but perform your best.  Where they may have been lacking in leadership, was definitely made up in the overall vibe of every store I worked in. The day to day operation of a retail representative can wear on anyone, mentally and emotionally.  So having that healthy workplace culture was very important.  The most enjoyable part of the job is a toss up between the money and the company events.  The events were big because of the people you got to meet, and the feeling of being apart of something way bigger than yourself."
good,"Good benefits, fast paced work environment, stable  work. Need to keep in tune with changing management structure and changing technologies. Should be pro-active  to actively work for career advancement."
good,lots of overtime offered very little work life balance competttive pay and excellent health benefits 10 days of vacation not much more thata I want to say
good,"Title pretty much says it all. The pay is pretty good and most of the people you work with, however, you it will grind you down to the bone and there is a real problem with the corporate culture at Verizon in which they keep everything from their employees such as changes in plans and services until the very last minute. Sometime customer will know about things before you do because they will already run ads promoting them which in turn makes you look like a complete idiot if you're not informed yet."
good,Fast paced culture that requires someone who is excellent with connecting with the public. You must me able to receive feedback from your direct manager and be a team player.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Verizon. The pay was great and the benefits were good. However, they definitely do not care about their employees as people. I have never met a person who retired with Verizon. Once you are no longer useful to them, you are disposable. This job is great for making some money and saving up. However, I would take advantage of their tuition assistance and use it as a springboard to something better."
good,"Good pay competitive environment."
good,Verizon Wireless is a good place to work to gain entry level experience in a corporate setting. I have gained a great of experience working with the company.
good,This is a cut throat sales environment. If you aren't very talented in sales you will not like this job. You earn based on what you sell. Be careful not to work for an unreliable premium retailer.
good,I will reserve any further comments as I am not comfortable make a statement about current or previous employer.  It shows a lack of integrity and character.
good,"Verizon Offers a great first step into the world of Telecommunications. As an ILEC, Verizon operations encompasses all aspect of telecommunication operations, engineering and services contingent to both wireless and wireline platforms."
good,Long commute and raises are minimum but benefits are good. 401K benefits are matched. Health and dental benefits are competitive. Culture is basic call center environment.
good,I worked there for over 9 years. Enjoyed my time there. I left because I wanted to get into the training dept. They cut jobs and no room for advancement.
good,"I had spent just a very short period of time working at Verizon, we enjoy helping out customers over the phone with internet connection and Modems config using various type of programs"
good,"Each salesperson had their own desk and computer which made each customer interaction seem very attentive and personal, which was good. The system used to sell, activate, ring up, charge, and discount, phones is incredibly complicated and could use an overhaul toward simplification. Team members and team leaders are ALWAYS helpful and push you in the right direction and give you good advice. The workplace culture was results driven (cash driven) as commissions were the only way you got paid. The hardest part of the job was when nobody came in the store, which means that you actually LOSE money by not making any sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the great people who worked there and attending the monthly sales skills meetings for new employees."
good,"Learned how to overcome no and keep selling, hardest part of job was dealing with slow days because the more people I can talk to the more opportunities I have.  Most enjoyable part of job is turning a upset customer into a happy customer even though we sold them something else."
good,great salary and benefits - horrible inside pressure and no sick time other than FMLA - Once I became sick the pressure from the company became increasingly more obstinant
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Fast paced, ever changing, high pressure retail sales.  Lots of escalated situations with customers to resolve.  Heavy coaching culture. Constantly chasing a number and Verizon tracks every number under the sun so there is always a number to improve.  Great people to work with and if you can take the pressure it is a fun, rewarding place to work."
good,"Typical day is touble shooting customer problems, inventory management, selling devices. Learned about wireless devices, inventory management, customer service. Culture is informal, but fast paced if you are in a busy location. Management at store level varies, but upper level management is hands on. They visit stores and learn what's happening in the field. The hardest part is that a lot of people have an antagonistic relationship with their wireless carrier, they believe the company did not have their best interest at heart. The most rewarding was being able to solve a customers problem and make tem happy."
good,Landline Network better than Wireless.  Changing direction and RiFing older employees.  Landline is dying and the culture is changing.  Outsourcing key IT processes making them less agile..
good,Truly loved my job.  Was planning on retiring with Verizon.  Due to realignment my position was eliminated. I gave them 15 years and would have given them another 15.
good,"* Flexible work timing"
good,"The scheduling process can be brutal for single parents, and usually, when you first start you get overnight shifts. The benefits are very good but the management team can sometimes have a hard time trying to motivate their teams in the correct way. The policies that are in place sometimes make it hard for the customers, so it was hard not to feel bad when a customer was stuck in a bad situation."
good,"sales oriented"
good,"It is a great  place, but it can be quite expensive. Retail seems to be going nowhere fast. Great benefits, I have always appreciated my time at Verizon and it has provided a lot for my family and I"
good,"good management,but the manage is also good person and people in Verizon are also good. we can learn more from the company and concentrate just on your work."
good,"I really liked working for verizon because of the freedom that they give you with the customers. There is not a lot of hand holding and as long as you can put up consistent numbers, there isn't too many things they'll tell you."
good,"Fast-paced and innovative company, always one step ahead, secure financials and great benefits. Verizon has a great business strategy and a solid executive team that attracts top talent."
good,"Working for Verizon was a bit of a journey. It's commission only and it was difficult to make sales. The office had good team leaders and great staffing, they helped you with anything."
good,"My work with Verizon FiOS was overall rewarding but the uncertainty of where the company is going at the moment has made me very apprehensive to reapply."
good,This was a high volume inbound call center. The calls were very stressful but the benefits make a loyal employee. There are a lot of incentives but its hard work.
good,"A very relaxed work culture for someone looking for a good work life balance. Open to new technologies, which opens up many  opportunities for us to lean"
good,Verizon is a great example of corporate America. Many Opportunities but no one will hold your hand to the top. If have to take what you want and be very pro-active
good,"Vast, slow moving organization. One re-org about every quarter but not much actually changes over time. Many silos and not much communication from senior management at the department level."
good,Verizon is a good company to work for. I think the managers should not penalize the workers every time they got a bad review from customers as sometimes the workers cannot control the customers behavior.
good,"Travailler au sein de groupes internationaux requiert une adaptation permanente à d'autres mondes, et travailler au sein de l'environnement des télécoms signifie un changement permanent. En tant qu'acteur du monde des nouvelles technologies et owner de la plus grosse partie du réseau Internet, lui-m^eme en continuelle évolution, Verizon adapte sa culture et sa communication, presqu'en temps réel."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This was a great company to work for. I had the opportunity to interact with members. I also had the opportunity to learn something new everyday! I loved he environment and my co-workers. The atmosphere was great!!
good,"I worked in the field for 23 yrs and 10 as Management."
good,Verizon was a good company but to much mi9cro managing and your just a name on a piece of paper. benefits were a plus I can see how some people don't like Verizon.
good,"Lot of presser to make sales….  You need to play the good old boy system to get promoted. Its helps to be mobile.  The company is in a strange place now.,"
good,The company is adding more requirements while keeping compensation the same yet making it harder to achieve goals. Looking to leave company in the new future.
good,"Be prepared to work long hours, pushed to your limits and tested to always give your best.  The payoff is good and you will learn a lot by working for this company."
good,"Great pay, but not for a family person.Stress of work is expected although the paycheck is nice. The company does not take care of you. You have to take extra good care of yourself and your sales quota which sometimes means being ruthless."
good,Can be a great place to work if it weren't for the in fighting between departments. This tends to leave the customer out in the cold. CEO doesn't understand the work that is done by technicians and so he undervalues them.
good,"This job gives Great benefits!  However, the life/work balance is intense.....that's why I said for a single person.  You make great money, but work crazy hours; not to mention holiday hours....CRAZIER hours during the holiday season.  I remember when I got hired there 7 years ago, I was told to kiss my friends and family goodbye.  They weren't joking!  I haven't spent a Thanksgiving or Christmas with family in 7 years!"
good,"You have to be a self starter. You can set your own times, overall work pace is slow. A lot of complacent managers in the company, probably not a good place to be for a new grad."
good,"Exceptional company to work for, great benefits. Paid time off, competitive environment. Great place to work for, overall a company that I would recommend for a friend."
good,Fun Place to work. Verizon has a great training program that last 3 months. during that time Verizon make sure that you have the tools to sale and give great customer service. I never felt overwhelmed in my position.
good,"great company to work for. very long hours. great compensation. if you enjoy making money and being away from home and 50%! off your cell bill, go for it."
good,"Great company to work for, it does require to be able to adapt to change quickly. They attempt to provide the best possible work life balance experience."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for. There are opportunities to advance, however there are a lot of internal politics to overcome. So if you can do that, you can go far. I loved the people I worked with. My second family. I have had good and bad mangers. They have so awesome programs for for school and really good benefits. They have changed to more of a sales company. They let go all of their support staff. Over all I would say I loved my job. They just didn't want support staff anymore."
good,"VerizonWireless is a good company that offers good benefits.  The call center is a typical call center with your performance based on a lot of numbers.  There is opportunity for growth if that is what you are looking for.    With the work volumes in the call center, it can become overwhelming with call and call, but if this is your thing, a good place to work."
good,Great place to hone your interpersonal if you are a techy. Forces you to work on your temperament as clients can become unruly at the blink of an eye.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good job with plenty of room for advancement. Good compensation and benefits. Biggest downside is current managerial structure in the midwest. The current hierarchy has caused turnover to go through the roof. Too much micromanaging for anyone to be happy.
good,Should be more of a balance between work and home life. Being on call 24/7 takes a toll on ones life. Planning time off and coverage of other peoples work is rough.
good,"My typical day starts roughly at 5am, I was certified to teach new hires coming into the position. I enjoy teaching and learning new tasks. The hardest part of this position was keeping the learners awake at 5am... we did it though!- My excitement was knowing after spending 5 weeks with 20 learners and they graduate my class and was able to put to use the skills they learned gave me great satisfaction."
good,"Great benefits, the pay was not that good.  Management changed all the time and we ended up with a manager who never managed an operations team and it made it difficult to deal with them"
good,"The people are great to work with, but the managers have their own cliche. They have their favorites and they know who they want to promote within the company."
good,"You need to work hard if you want to hit the expected sales goals that you are given. Compensation for commissions changed a lot. Hands down, this is not a career job, but if you want good sales experience and can handle stress, go work here for a year."
good,"Very high pressure sales"
good,"A typical day of work was to knock doors and sometimes put stickers in each apartment or house for the sale purpose. The things that I learned in this job was to transmit confidence and trust in our customers in order to make a sale. The hardest part of the job was "
good,Great company to work for. Makes a lot of changes that don't make sense sometimes. Great benefits. Fun work environment if you work in retail. High Quota.
good,"The days are long and stressful, but the training is excellent. Quotas keep changing and turnover in the store is high. Being on the forefront of technology is exciting and getting to interact with customers is best part of job."
good,"Great company, but focus has changed in the last few years to being completely money and result focused adding unnecessary stress on its employees. Benefits are amazing"
good,"Overall, working @ Verizon has been a very rewarding experience.  Through the company's tuition assistance program, I was able to attend college @ night & graduate with my Bachelor's degree.  I have formed great friendships during my time in the company which is due to the family atmosphere that was always present."
good,"I worked for the company for many years, over the last few they have become very money and numbers driven rather than taking care of those who have helped make the company what it is today. Employee satisfaction is at an all time low and they are loosing or forcing a lot of experience and knowledge out the door. The last company who did that on this scale was Circuit City. Very concerning."
good,"Verizon has many good points and is  a solid company to work for. It is a nationwide company so being able to move through out the country and still have a good job can lead to many adventures. Through the position I have always had a clear idea of what to accomplish and my goal where i wanted to go. "
good,"Verizon was the first wireless company that I have worked for and overall it was a good experience. We went through a two week training program which wasn't enough. They tried to cram way too much information into you for the first week, and  just shadow another sales consultant for the second. Once you get the hang of the process it was very smooth for the most part."
good,"The Verizon customers are a fun bunch to deal with, some may be fairly sweet and give you no issues. You will however get a few callers that come on the line with a major problem and want to speak with a supervisor right away. Overall it is a good call center environment."
good,"I loved working for Verizon but things changed in my life and I wasn't able to work rotating shifts. Most of the management treated people with respect and gave a lot support for advancement,  A nice place to work if you like rotating shifts"
good,I loved everything about working for this company. The overall benefits were great. I got to work with technology and I didn't mind working even on the customer service end of the position (I was in sales). The only issue I had was with compensation. The goals that they set were to me not truly obtainable so the compensation as a result was not worth all the effort. It also doesn't help that CT reviews commission jobs as what it seems like their right to deduct about 40% of your earnings. I didn't feel like I could support my family with this company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Busy days with lots of customer interaction. Fast paced job with lots of perks.  Also lots of opportunity for advancement into other avenues of the company.
good,Can be a tough place to work.. Has good money potential but hard work life balance.. Great group of people willing to help each other. Great benefits too.
good,"Hardest part of job was inconsistent message from management and managers. "
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for. It was very face paced. I learned how to multi task and better my customer service skills. Management was very focused and expected a lot of their employees, they were there to help you be successful. The hardest part of my job was dealing with such a fast paced environment with different changes everyday but it didn't take long for me to adapt to the environment. I loved my job because i love helping people and making a difference in their day."
good,Verizon is a good company to work for and the benefits are good as well. Doing my time at Verizon I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and use it to improve my performance.
good,"Fun environment, always leaning new things, management is always there to assist, we all worked as a team, the hardest part about my day would be going home and enjoyed everything about my job."
good,Verizon Livesource was a 411 call center. It was a fast paced environment but it was pretty fun to work there. A lot of good people lost their jobs sadly when Verizon sold the call center to Frontier
good,In order to move up or stay competitive in this company you need to be adaptable. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable because nothing last forever here.
good,Overall a good company to work for with excellent benefits.  Positions and titles change often.  It is a fast paced work environment and highly competitive.
good,"I would say that with children at home, its hard to get off work at 7 or 8 pm everyday. The benefits, 401k match, and salary are fantastic. The career advancement opportunities are great as well."
good,"had a ton of fun, I started right before the finance a smart phone craze. Easy to sell when you have the best wireless service. Very competitive on sales floor, management played favorites. Managers  were very informative, fair, and seasoned sellers, simply put they earned their due."
good,"I enjoy working for Verizon. They have a great pay rate and benefits. I feel very valued by my immediate management. I do find it very difficult to advance within the company and in order to get recognized without sales number to speak to, you do a lot of extra work."
good,Verizon is an innovative company that offers very competitive pay and amazing benefits. the Verizon motto is change energizes us and with that you have to be willing to be very flexible if you want to be with them in the long run. They almost always promote within and it's easy to transfer. My position was recently cut and so I got let go but received severance pay etc.
good,"Good team work environment, many opportunities to learn new network disciplines, many opportunities for promotions in addition to work on special projects with great benefits packages."
good,"The employees makes working at  Verizon an wonderful experience. However, management lacks in the humanistic department. Employees are treated like machines. Verizon is a BUSINESS, that is only concerned with being #1 at ANY cost. This company laid-off more than 220+ people in July 2014. Verizon employees were notified of the layoff via UPS letter deliverance."
good,"Verizon is extremely good pay for call center work.  The down falls are the hours and the time it takes to advance in the company.  Many people take a decade to move up in management.  Also, union is strong but kind of crazy.   Work is good except the high focus on upselling and not fixing problems.   Too many people pass the customer on for someone else to solve the issues."
good,"I worked with a great group of people that always tried to take care of our customers, Verizon tried to take care of its employees but always made the bottom line come 1st.  Due to wanting to make a profit they closed over 5 call centers and many retail store in New England."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon provides plenty of career opportunities for individuals interested in joining a large, complex organization in the telecom/technology industry.  The company is trying to change its culture to mimic that of a true technology company.  The downside to this change is the amount of uncertainty in the organization in recent years.  There are a lot of great people that work for Verizon, and it's a great place to learn about the cable, telecom and wireless industries."
good,Great working environment. They support personal and professional growth. Plenty educational opportunities are offered through various avenues. life balance is promoted.
good,"Verizon has opportunities available for persons with both wireless and wireline experience. Better than average benefits, however mobility within the company can be rather limited. One would think that such a large corporation would have more chances for promotions with the company than they offer."
good,"My typical work day will begin with sales calls. Then I move on to the sales floor to begin helping customers. Over the years I've learned to multi task between sales and tech. The culture within is sales driven, and management assist overall operations. I truly enjoy helping customers solve tech issues."
good,Management has a difficult time communication a vision for the consultants they bring in and bring too many in who are striving for a productive deadline and list of tasks along with timeframe.  Indecisive management.
good,"pays well and make good money"
good,"Good company to work for, but movement to cellular / content services reduced need to wireless resources.  "
good,"Overall good place to work for. Hard to get the opportunity to advance. Not a good work place balance. If that can be changed, then it would be an excellent place to work. Also there needs to be more focus on the front line of the business."
good,Don't expect a fun culture ala Sourhwest Airlines.  I found that ---depending on the group or organization ----Atmosphere can lean toward unfriendliness during internal interactions ( emails conference calls and meetings).
good,"The daily grind was nice and I learned quite a bit while I was there.  "
good,"The job in the Government Affairs Department was always interesting and challenging.  The work could be rewarding but navigating the workplace itself was a daily challenge.  While colleagues were for the most part not ""standoffish"" there was very little collegiality and it was a challenge to get to know anyone outside of what they did professionally."
good,I really enjoyed the Job training. The Location was poor. I liked all the different people that come into the Circuit City  Store. And Attracting to our kiosk was a fun challenge .
good,Great benefits. Micromanaged and hours are frustrating. Great coworkers but overall company is very strict and had issues with FMLA for maternity leave for myself.
good,Verizon is great however the business is always changing and moving which prevents a good work/life balance on occasion. With the recent relocation requirements the hours and location of the business have become cumbersome to my growth as an employee.
good,"Verizon is a very large company and with that comes some bureaucracy. The HR team is extremely supportive if you have any personal matters. "
good,Verizon is known for training their employees really well; better than any other company I've worked for. It's fun to be around technology all day and helping your customers understand how to use it. The only problem with the cell phone industry is that the competition is driving down the monthly pricing which is forcing the wireless companies to save money by outsourcing their inbound and outbound call center employees. The safest place to work right now would be their Irving call center. There is a lot of room to grow on their new campus.
good,When starting with Verizon straight out of college I learned that we all come from different back grounds and have to find a common ground to complete any task. Managing a network is complex and stressful job and not one person can do it alone. Understanding that our customers value our options and trust our judgment.  Which gives them the ability to communicate with there partners no matter where they are around the globe.
good,Typical call center environment but they did do things to keep it upbeat and make us feel appreciated. Great entry to cooperate world to see where you may want to go with your career. Great pay & benefits but can be stressful and schedules aren't ideal.
good,"Each day technology is changing.  The environment is always changing, it challenges you to keep up with the telecommunications world."
good,"Excellent place to learn new technology,everyone is willing help and teach .The benefits are great especially tuiton reimbursement ,only negative is the shift work"
good,Job at times was rewarding but also frustrating in finding resolution for customer issues which would result in a win/win situation for the customer as well as the company. Career mobility was slow.
good,Fast paced.  Micromanaged.  Worked 8 hours with opportunity to work overtime if needed. Gained experience in wide variety of positions. Hardest part supervisors not understand to individual needs and a lot of favoritism.
good,"Great place to work.  I was exposed to numerous situations where I was able to learn and put in practice all my knowledge and skills."
good,"Being in the telecom domain this company will provide you lot of scope for fine tuning the system and invite new ideas. "
good,"Verizon is a great place to work, but they could do a better job of keeping hardworking employees and apply cost-savings measures in other ways besides reduction in force."
good,"A normal day would include show up to work on time get all your computer windows and everything up and running. Than help a customer see what they need go on there account and try to sell a tablet, MIFI ect. Things i learned on the job would be computer skills and how to work there system, also to close sales and be a tech and work on phones. The best part of working there would have to be the family environment there."
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for.  Great leadership, lots of training, they want you to be successful.  Lots of room for growth internally as well."
good,Long hours confusing management on supervisor level with managers and supervisors not willing to take escalation's from customers
good,"great company to work for just a lot of changes with the business and employees.  Definitely room for grown. crazy hours, working most weekends and also all holidays."
good,"Pay is good but good luck getting weekends off and seeing your friends and family. It's retail so you can't complain, but often leaves talented people looking for other positions."
good,"The company has the right idea on most fronts. They really push treating customers fairly - internal and external. They also provide good pay and benefits.The problem is, they take the whole ""Change Energizes Us"" motto a little too far. If you don't like a policy, just wait. It'll probably change tomorrow. Problem is, the same is true if you do like a policy. Their are even different policies on things depending on which manager you ask on a given day."
good,If you have a good management team then you will have a great time here at Verizon Wireless. If you have a bad management team it will be difficult. Especially if you want to move up in the company. Also you maybe faced with meeting unreasonable deadlines.
good,"I've spent the majority of my adult career with Verizon and enjoyed all of it. It's fast paced and there are a lot of great employees there. I would like to work for them again, if ever given the opportunity."
good,Working the past 8 years at Verizon Wireless was definitely an experience of its own. I enjoyed my time as a Customer Service Pro. I do miss my co workers more than the job itself due to the fact that we all became one large family which made it more like home instead of calling it a job.
good,"being a professional"
good,"Good to work for, excellent pay structure and benefits. You must be a high performing rep to be considered for moving up with the company. Scheduled at minimum 40 hours a week and its encouraged to work more."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work with diverced culture."
good,not suitable for experience.who want choose last company to settle then join company.no much growth in technology wise.
good,There are opportunities for advancement. The pay scale is nice. There are always opportunities for Overtime and Merit Bonuses.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A typical work day would really depend on the amount of traffic that the store would get. working with customers and selling products is the biggest part of the job. If no traffic we would make phone calls to potential customers to promote business. Management was fantastic and I learned a lot about the industry through them. Hardest part of the job is building your own business. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment.
good,"There any many types of educational opportunities at Verizon. "
good,"good workplace to be in as change is the operating word"
good,It was a fun place to work a real team environment. I enjoyed talking to many customers every day it was like meeting new people and I enjoyed helping people.but there were little room for advancement weak management and low compensation.
good,"Verizon expects a lot from its employees, but they do pay more than most telecommunications companies. The co workers are amazing, and if they were not closing the center in Rancho Cordova CA I would still be staying with the company."
good,"Flexible scheduling and good pay"
good,Good company with great benefits. Pay was well for current market and the followed all state and federal work. The sales were demanding but the compensation and support was there to help.
good,"Going to work in a customer facing outside job with VZ is demanding."
good,"Call center work, taking calls and answering questions. selling phones and going over bills. Troubleshooting phones and resolving customer issues."
good,"Great company at the start, Very great environment young and hungry, became proficient on wireless and sales goals and commission. Management was ok staff was great, not enough hours in the day. Customer interaction was awesome."
good,"Typical day: maintain products for sales to readily find, promote, and sell. Take in merchandise and research problems that arise,"
good,"You can experience a promising future with Verizon by following these rules:"
good,"Verizon (Business, not wireless) was a good employer and had good benefits (better than most).  My job was eventually sent overseas and that caused the layoff.  Not a bad company otherwise."
good,Verizon Is an energetic an fun environment. Management is intuitive and kind. The work is fun and rewarding. the hardest part is filling in the time between calls. The most enjoyable is helping a customer navigate all of their purchase options successfully.
good,It's a great company to work and all the time worked with updated frameworks. The co-workers are very help full. Working for a project called Regulatory. Have used all the latest frameworks in java.
good,"Verizon is an employer of high standards. Employees must be committed to attaining and maintaining these standards, and are well compensated for it."
good,"Verizon compensation was at the top ,work life was less than average when I left and, I have heard that it has not improved .The jobs a very challenging and require good critical thinking skills and time management and good computers skills and lastly good communications skills both written and verbal."
good,"Great company to work for great way to grow and develop into a new role which will allow you to grow as an individual. "
good,Very fast paced environment. Balancing work and home was the hardest. overall great company. A very good team environment and management was pretty awesome
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Large environment that is fun to work in.  Great benefits.  Has lots of fun things for the employees to do.  Round the clock hours so there is a schedule for everyone
good,This was my first position out of college doing B2B sales.  I enjoyed my time at Verizon and seemed to have good ongoing support for whatever needed and management was there to help in any way.
good,"You have to be okay with repetitive work and sitting all day. The work was difficult only when you had very rude people on the line. If management had it out for someone, they would constantly be listening in on their phone call."
good,"While working at Verizon, I used and learned multiple different sales techniques and each day was different. It was a very challenging work environment, due to the wide range of customer and accounts that I touched each day. As a solutions specialist, I was to analyze each account for possible savings and up-sells. Verizon prides themselves on customer satisfaction and we were to make each customer feel comfortable and valued, while making sure to meet all their needs. I enjoyed helping customers and pushing myself to meet the monthly requirements."
good,"Being the store ops consultant, I have my section in the back of the store where I package returned equipment (when equipment is there) and walk back-and-forth to the front of the store to pick-up returned equipment and (when asked) to assist with the FiOs customers. The hardest part about the job was the down time, sitting down in the backroom watching the time go by because I have no equipment to package. THe most enjoyable part about the job was learning some sales techniques which would have allowed me to advance in the company."
good,"Good company, competitive pay and good benefits. A lot of opportunity to advance. A lot invested in training new hires and current employees."
good,Verizon is a great company and has a great history.  My co workers were great to work with.  There are some issues with work/life balance and there are too many layoffs every year.  This makes the work culture unstable for employees.  The salary and benefits are the best and are underappreciated from the employees.
good,"Typical day in Verizon,"
good,"Loved the company. Great Benefits. Wonderful experience, No further comment at this time, Thank you, Would recommend this company to future sales representatives."
good,"Typically, a day at work consisted of a minimum of 40 calls, back to back, trying to resolve customer issues, review their services, and sell. The job itself has helped me largely with my sales skills. But, management was severe, and if you did not follow the step by step process, it would result in a write up. Sometimes, I feared for my job daily."
good,"On an average day, we would check up on our inventory, interact with customers, help them with all their inquiries/concerns/purchases, and maintain upkeep of the store. It was the former #1 busiest Verizon retailer on the east coast. The hardest part of the job was initially getting up to speed on all the software and ins and outs of the retailer. My favorite part of the job was being a part of my customer's enjoyment every time they got a new phone or got help in any way."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon but when we expanded our territory to include all 50 states, the service suffered.  They are still trying to catch up."
good,"Verizon as a whole is a good company to work for. There are a lot of changes happening in the Telecommunication industry. It has become cut throat, and the industry has a whole has become over saturated and uncertain."
good,Typical day is 8-6. Learned about the wirleless and wireline industries as well as dealing with various OEM's for cell phones and other devices.
good,"A typical day at work is login take calls handle outage , get in touch with concerned team."
good,"While at Verizon I had a great experience..The people were all nice and the work was fun."
good,"To move up in Verizon Corporate you need to be willing to push yourself to be better than your peers while also helping to develop them to be successful. Often times, the job role is not as rewarding as it could be, but the compensation is great in comparison to other jobs in the same spectrum."
good,"Great overall experience, you meet new people daily and get to help with activating a new phone or helping customers pay their bills, I loved being able to help people"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall, I enjoy this employer, though a number of career progression opportunities have been dissolved since my hire date."
good,"Personally great place to work.  Could use a bit more help in the area of some of the people they place in management positions."
good,"The balance of work and life is not practical here.  The hours do not let you enjoy your personal life.  The management is very one sided and not diverse.  The co-workers are great to be around, the salary is awesome"
good,Verizon is a great company to start a career in Telecommunications. Nice pay. Good Wages. Your co workers are the best part of the job. Finding new friends and new experiences.
good,"Being a long time employee at Verizon wireless, I was lucky enough to watch this industry grow a an exponential rate. The company afforded us with a great environment to grow as well."
good,"Learned a lot here, employees encourage to develop self and take courses. A lot of smart and fun people. On Friday's, groups get together for team building."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,This is an intermediate job while searching for a job in healthcare.  I am able to utilize some of my education and experience.
good,high stress  level job. you have to meet a lot of quotas. average handle time and many other things.  alot of training there is always free food and they make you comfortable.
good,"my last supervisor was my best.  very knowledgeable, competent and compassionate while still focused on results.  the b2b sales culture was not the healthiest in our region.  very cliquish and everyone forced to sell verticals like SMB market segement"
good,Verizon offers great benefits and pay to its employees but the hardest part of my job and the main reason I am looking for something new is because of the store hours.
good,Verizon is focused on the development of its employees. Benefits are top notch and education is a the forefront. A great place to work and the opportunities to advance are limitless.
good,"Good place to work, low on training before changes came out and the hardest part is the tech support.  Most enjoyable it helping the customers and getting to talk with a different variety of people and changing to match them."
good,"Great Company to work for. Everyone is very friendly and the company really cares about their employees."
good,"Problem solving professional with experience in corporate and small business environment., working with large and small groups.  Handling of all forms of technical issues. Working with the necessary groups to get those issues escalated and resolved. Working for the company 18 year and with IT department 9 years."
good,"A typical day at work is very predictable. You have your time on the phone and time for training if you need it. "
good,Working at Verizon gave me a sense of accomplishment and pride at the end of everyday. It was my first job that was outside the office and the experience has changed for the better.
good,"Great place to work. The lay-offs was the only issue with Verizon. Great company benefits, job culture, and the company actually paid for the last semester of college for me."
good,see my review below as to the nature and culture of Verizon.  for six or eight years that I was employed there it was the greatest company on planet
good,"A typical day meant greeting customers, assisting them and making sure they were assisted by order of arrival and directing them to the right representative. If all other representatives were busy or unavailable I myself would assist them in troubleshooting devices until a representative became available."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I was with Verizon Wireless for 7 years and enjoyed all the challenges that came with the job from releasing new products and being the one chosen to take specialized calls (LST, Hub, etc.) I was never given a reason for my release and would love to bring my knowledge back to the Verizon table."
good,"Very flexible, you can pretty much build your own schedule.  You can make as much as you want, but will have to put in the time and effort."
good,Goal Driven Company and Management applies goals. Sometimes there is high turnover because of high expectations.  Excellent benefits.
good,Company has great benefits but is lacking good management. Employees are trying to join a union to be more respected. Company is stressful because of their high prices they charge their costumers.
good,Verizon gives you an opportunity learn many different skills and technologies.  I would recommend anyone work for this company.
good,"This is a Good Sales Job especially If you want to Lean Technology."
good,Weekly changes in promotional products and services that are difficult to keep up with. Constant coaching on sales process.
good,"Maintain and install phone and video equipment for various customers. Trained new employees at job sites. Network testing of dynamic and static IP plus VOIP lines."
good,"Overall, I learned a lot and my co-workers became family. The benefits were wonderful and the work was hectic at times but I survived."
good,"Sales and Service division is fast paced. You learn to multitask while performing outstanding service. One of the best parts of your day will be speaking with people from all over the world. You will gain a sense of accomplishment by helping your customers resolve an issue or just by helping them choose the right product. You can never say your job is boring, with technology changing daily you will learn daily. Its not just a job but you are providing a sense of security to your customers. You help them stay connected with family, friends and the ability to reach the police and fire department when needed."
good,"Pay is alright, very stressful schedule does not allow agent to have a life. Working here you only get 1 weekend a month off. Workers at McDonald's get more weekends off than that. That's the only downfall. Wish"
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for, after leaving the US Navy.  The benefits were wonderful, pay & promotion opportunities great & opportunities to gain experience remarkable."
good,"it really depends what you are looking for in a job, if your end goal is to make money well you can make very good income. but i personally did not feel right watching customers not always being taken care of properly by my coworkers. these ""badgering"" customers that pay our bills."
good,"If you are able to travel or live near Basking Ridge, NJ, Verizon is a power house company to work for.  They have great benefits, their compensation package is competitive with the job market, their environment is fast paced and energetic.  A typical day at the job would be get ready for a new change directive, learn how to adapt quickly, support each other and work in team cross organizational environments.  The hardest part of the job is working across multiple organizations, the most enjoyable part is getting the project done!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was solving customers problems and getting good surveys. It left me with a feeling of satisfaction.
good,Verizon is a great place to work. It's technological focus on improving the way companies do business is second to none.
good,"Fast paced, challenging work environment. Long hours at work but rewarding. Excellent benefits and 401K plan. Great co-workers."
good,"As a Communications Technician most of my time was spent on customers sites maintaining systems and doing adds, moves and changes."
good,Great company that offers many many opportunities for expanding your skill set as well as getting a bigger paycheck through a number of commission tiers. The management is easy to talk to when there are times where assistance is needed.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I have been working for Verizon Wireless for 8 yrs and 3 months. A Typical day there consists of answering approx. 35 incoming calls from our business customers.We take care of any needs that our customers may need from, billing  to troubleshooting,  to doing upgrades to helping them run reports for their business. Everyday at Verizon Wireless is a learning experience so we are constantly learning about new system enhancements or promotions .The management team there is pretty layed back for the most part as long as you are doing your work. I would say the hardest part of my job is being able to be extremely efficient on your calls, vzw expects world call customer service out of there phone coordinators.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people with with their phones & technology ."
good,"On a good day at work there would be plenty to do, but on the slow days its all about making calls and trainings to make sure that we are in top shape when a customer walks through those doors. The work environment is fun when you work with the right people. The hardest part of the job is just having enough people to come in to the store so that everyone has enough contracts to get paid."
good,"drive 90mins (ea way) 5 days  week to start promptly at 8am.  a daily thrash of meetings/conf calls/travel arrangements to be coordinated with VP & Directors . "
good,Great company with room for advancement. Fosters a culture of acceptance of diversity and exceptionalism. I enjoyed my time there.  The flexibility was appreciated.
good,Would start work with most important and urgent proccesses. I would learn how work more efficient every day. I worked close with my management as would do some Special Handling requests that required their signatures. Very nice friendly co-workers that worked for years with them. The hardest part of my job was to do the escalation of Special Handling request after cut off time cause need to get multiple approvals from managements. The most enjoyable time would be to work on finding out why invoices would not pay what kind of exceptions are holding them up from payments.
good,Fantastic company with advancement potential.  Great with work/personal life balance.  Nationwide opportunities.  Great workforce of people.
good,"Verizon is a place where time can slip away. Everyday brings something new to spend time on and you have to keep everything else moving forward at the same time - People tend to pull together when there are issues but they also like to play the ""blame game"" so be careful. Mixed reviews around management - some are awesome others do not belong in management at all - My team and management was pretty good - I find that it helps when I am an open leader and keep my relationships built on trust."
good,Overall organization was great to work for. Management at specific sites did not embody the organization culture. I learned a great deal about wireless technologies and actually utilized my education. Hardest part of job was working with management and cliques.
good,Working for Verizon on a daily basis was pretty good. Stayed busy for the most part. The hardest part of the job was trying to change something that didn't work correctly.
good,"I had a great Team Lead and was usually in the top 10 in performance at the Tampa center. I did customer support for Verizon's FiOS system and believe the product is superior than the other choice we have in the area. Although it was technical support, we operated as a call center and average times were looked at very closely. I was happy at Verizon until I had to leave to go to Texas."
good,"Dispatched to End-User to either install, repair, or maintenance the POTS that included ADSL services. I learned that the customer does run the company in terms of generating revenue. I have had, and met some of the best co-workers, and still have life long friendships. The hardest part of the can be weather related, because not all of the work was indoors. When it's in the single digits, and one's fingers get so numb that you can't feel the wire you're working on. The other part of the day is when it is extremely hot driving around in an un-airconditioned vehicle, and having to take on the natural conditions like wasp, bee's, poison ivy, mice in the boxes, birds in the splice cases as well. Fixing what was broken became the best part of the day, and knowing that the customer doesn't have to call back in because the issue has been resolved"
good,Horrible work life balance great benefits. Once the contract with the union ends hours become crazy. Management sometimes don't know what they are talking about.
good,Great group of people to work with day to day. A very multi-cultural diverse work environment. Most challenging part of the job was balancing multiple priorities.
good,Fast paced and well compensated. Very stressful. Team selling is a must and can help significantly. In addition meeting quotas is expected. Must learn lots of new thing often
good,"Benefits and life balance are great.  Good teamwork developing new technologies."
good,"Fun place to work and the earning potential is unlimited. You can easily make $75,00 if you put your mind to it. Upbeat, energentic atmosphere with good management at east at the store level. Advancement from within is very obvious as people are always moving up the ladder."
good,Inspiring work environment with educated management. Active listening to execute growth and development. Showing motivation an dedication everyday to see the vision.
good,Verizon is a extremely fast paced environment which requires self discipline to adapt to the changes.  Most positions have limited direction and guidance.  The most difficult part of the job is the limited resources available for the growing demand of high priority projects.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Very good company and if you can make it there then you can make it anywhere! The Benefit or second to few and upward movement is avaible for those who are willing to give up their personal life and family.
good,Verizon is a great job if looking for corporate benefits of a fortune 500 company. Can be a bit sluggish to react the marketplace. Telecom growth is slowing down.
good,Answering customer incoming calls and assisting with billing and phone inquiries. Great learning experience and a wealth of knowledge was gained!
good,"Verizon offers great benefits to their management employees. If you land with a great team and team players, work will be fun and enjoyable.  Training is always on going as technology continues to drive that engine.  Tough to get promoted in today's environment with cutbacks and reduction in force."
good,The wonderful thing about Verizon is that you can move internally to another position if you wish to do something different.  As long as you have the correct degree and experience.
good,"everyone was so nice and welcoming, they didn't make me feel like a stranger at all. the best part of the job was being able to learn from the technicians."
good,In an everchanging industry with lots of potential for learning new things. Employee benefits packages and compensation goals were very attractive.
good,"Lots of conference calls with other channel leads"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"A typical day as a Sales Engineer consist of sales calls, project management reviews, customer presentations.  It also consist of team and status conference calls."
good,"You will come to work and have a very short meeting with your team to go over a topic of the day which can include new changes or best practice and then its off to the phones with very little down time in between. Everything from the calls to the accounts you access is recorded from the time your on a call to the time you place a call on hold."
good,Typical big company where you do you job and do it well.  Remain loyal to a company and then they let you go.  Would say they do a decent job of things
good,VZW is a great place to learn the ins and out of business operation. Provides an in-depth view of Telecom and Wireless industry.
good,"Good job and benefits, but Verizon is always trying to cut the Unions out. Local supervisors are good and want you to do well. Not much available for advancement."
good,"Typical day at work was coming in and working critical incidents for the high end customer base.  "
good,"IT department really has various responsibilities.  Primary focus is retail Point of sale and networking equipment.  It involves routine daytime travel with occasional overnight duties.  Very challenging technically.  Processes constantly changes.  The job has handy remote tools to make job easier.  Work life balance can be improved.  Overall, great company and a good place to work."
good,Typical day is assisting the customers with purchasing a new phone or device and activating it. Learned how to order and activate phones and devices and troubleshoot. Management guided your towards your goals. Co-workers were friendly and fun to work with. Hardest part of the day is not being able to complete the task if systems were updating. Most enjoyable is getting to help those who need your assistance.
good,"The culture of the company  was  more about the  company than about the  customer and helping, The compensation for the work was very good; however, it left little room to be customer base driven."
good,"great co-workers "
good,"If you like diversity in product and a lot of change, Verizon Enterprise is for you. The Verizon Brand is strong and positive."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon has provided me valuable knowledge and experiences.  I really enjoy my teammates and what we got to do together.  I love trying to come up with a solution for the customer in order to take ownership.  "
good,"Fun work place with very supportive co-workers.  Management was there to support us and help out. Opportunity  to grow and develop skills.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but given the type of business these needed to be in place.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom for creativity, working beside some great colleagues and learning from each other."
good,Verizon introduced me to several emerging and new enterprise networking technologies. I spent my first 6 years as a network engineer managing their contract services with the Navy Marine Corps Intranet. I learned to work closely with other companies under the larger contract supporting the DOD network. I had great co workers and enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was the shift work and schedule rotation. The most enjoyable part was my ability to use my analytical abilities to troubleshoot and resolve circuit issues. My last 7 years was with the project management office. Our team managed the installation and implementation of DOD networks. The hardest part of the job was managing high numbers of customers when staffing was limited. The most enjoyable was being successful under pressure.
good,Fun place to work with a fast paced sales environment. Numbers are pushed heavily. Depending on your store there is a decent amount of development. Management wants you to succeed. Overall it is a high stress environment with a focus on customer experiences and sales results.
good,"Verizon is a collection of traditional telecommunication companies.  The new Verizon will be built upon the company's wireless assets on which new content acquisitions will be overlaid,"
good,"It was competitive work place and we had fun at times too."
good,Typical day consist of insisting the technician and interacting with customers to help their needs with their internet cable and phone issues.
good,"Customer service is a challenge. Advancement potential and a good company, just a stressful environment. Putting more so i can continue and finish this page."
good,"I love working at Verizon, I've been there 7 yrs. I probably would feel differently about it but I have been driving back and forward to work the last 5 years. It has taken it toll on me over the years 90 mile drive  each day is to much for me on top of a 10 hr shift. The stress level sometimes can get high but I was a very solid sales representative"
good,"Amazing benefits package, probably the best I've ever had.  Sales is Salary + Commission which will work in your favor if you want to be successful.  Retail hours are all over the place.  Always short staffed."
good,"This company has great benefits. There are some problems with accountability, or I should say the lack of accountability. Overall, it is a great place to work."
good,"I worked in several different departments within the company, some were better than others.  I enjoyed a few of them, others I did not.  The company is not a family orientated, the one thing that keeps people there is the benefits and the pay."
good,I learned a lot at Verizon. Overall it was a great place just not for me. Management was a bit unorganized. But I got along with everyone.
good,"Door to door selling product"
good,"Verizon had great benefits. If you're looking for a career in sales with development then Verizon is the place to be!"
good,Great place to get your foot in the door. Great Benefits/compensations. Great management. Work/Life balance hardly exists.
good,"I liked the job mostly, but i would not make a career out of it. If you needed certain hours because of transportation they were helpful. I met a lot of great people."
good,Great place to work. Not a lot of room for advancement. Coworkers were great to be around and made the department feel like a family.
good,"I made tickets for customer and companies in CA, DE, FL and TX, so co-workers could fix the potential problems. I enjoyed working with the people in my company. I did enjoy making tickets, and getting the work done quickly and efficiently."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"my typical day at work is to get started at 8:00am. i call my customer and get their feedback."
good,"Overall, Verizon has been great to me financially and advancement opportunities. Good place to work but needs more motivational direction from executive officers and directors. Needs more engagement with front line employees."
good,"Great Pay, Great Benefits.  Consistently changing management and direction of focus that creates confusion for business customers.  Often the biggest competition is Verizon itself.  You can manage an account for years and lose sales to the retail locations due to immediate need from customer."
good,"Customer Service Call center, Learned to Trouble shoot systematically. They are on the Cutting Edge of TV, Internet and Phone Service. Enjoyed working with customers to resolve trouble they may have been having."
good,"There’s limitless creativity and opportunity to drive the next generation of technology."
good,"I have performed many skills over my career,  from mapping functional (BR's/SR's) to test plans,  execution, defect creation, root cause, troubleshooting,  follow through, implementation, documentation. I lead countless implementations, environment configurations and smart regression and progression testing in environments.   "
good,its a typical giant corporation with all the pros and cons typical of a large company. i worked there for 21 years and was laid off.
good,"4 out of 5 is good, not great. Good means that it is provides for my family without causing any significant moral dilemmas. The balance between work and life is very good, as we are expected to not be working when off the clock. The compensation is a rough point, as similar amounts of effort and productivity month-to-month can yield wildly different amounts of compensation, purely at the discretion of where management sets the monthly quota. Missing these arbitrary targets is what can cause no job security. Verizon strives to be a positive culture, although each employee is replaceable with a less-expensive version."
good,"Verizon Wireless is a growing company that pushes their employees extremely hard for results. If you keep your head up and focus on the tasks given, you will reap the benefits of a growing company"
good,"Fast paced, high quotas"
good,"Typical day at work would be answering inbound calls for our customers, provide explanation of their billing and credits. "
good,"Good overall compensation and benefits package but career advancement is limited."
good,"With excellent pay and benefits, and the rarely seen tuition reimbursement, Verizon Wireless was a fantastic place to work for many years."
good,Managed 7- 10 large corporate accounts throughout the country. Lots of Account Management and multitasking. supervisors are always there to help with any questions or escalated customers. Co-workers were always willing to help. Lots of hard metrics to meet.
good,"Some positions are more demanding then others, many bright talented people work there, management wants to hear ""yes"" more then the truth, very much employee uncertainty with recent layoffs, culture clashes between business units, inconsistent telecommuting privileges across the business, company shows no loyalty to its employees whatsoever, its all about the bottom dollar"
good,"Work was plenty, was fun with co-workers. Work was not hard.Learned to deal with lot of personality, but got along with every one. Did have good benefits, such, as health insurance, life insurance, 401k etc. Also at time had lunch for employees."
good,"Great health benefits and vacation time provided. Friendly working atmosphere with co workers and upper management. High quota requirements for sales reps with good payout, bonuses. Working with advancing technology and products to meet and exceed market demand."
good,"Your typical work day is not typical at all. You must be willing to work in a VERY fast paced environment where the majority of your pay is commissions based. You have good days and bad just like any other company. As a Solutions specialist you will be expected to assist customers based on a first come first serve queue. You must discover things about your customers that will lead you in a direction that enables you to create the best solution or solutions to their needs. You will get to work sign into your IPAD and begin taking customers from a queue. Sometimes you get very difficult or angry customers. Therefore, you must learn to diffuse the customer from escalating any further very quickly. sometimes you turn a very bad situation into a very lucrative and mutually beneficial situation. YOU WILL LEARN A LOT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL! This company has one of the best training and development programs in the country! You will learn everything from how to sell, how to effectively and quickly communicate, HR policies, benefits, key technical knowledge that you can use in everyday life, how major corporations hire, fire, interview, and operate, how to maximize commissions and profits, how to conduct an account analysis, technical skills with all kinds of operating systems that change, critical thinking skills, how to read people's body language, and general corporate business knowledge that's practical. Co-workers and managers vary by location and personalities are all different. You may get a GREAT management team or not. The same goes for co-workers. Their is a saying in"
good,Being in sales creates that competitive edge where you control how much money you make with the effort you put into every sale. I enjoyed this and changing up my sales pitch when faced with different customers and scenarios.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Verizon.  The environment is good, the benefits are great and middle management really seemed to care about us.  They are however offshoring any job they can at an alarming rate."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon has an awesome benefits package that will definitely intrigue   anyone. The management team looks forward to being helpful and supportive to all members of the team.
good,"I like to work the grown company and  learn something new and get quality to make my life changed."
good,"Great benefits able to transfer to other locations, great work/life balance. Wonderful employee culture. Competitive wages, management inconsistent"
good,"Verizon had a culture and business that benefits thousands of Upstate New Yorkers per year.  The rough client base didn't matter to them, it was get to work early, serve the client base, obtain a greater client base, learn every day, and go home to the family kind of community."
good,"Working for a Verizon Wireless corporate store (not any type of authorized retailer) was a fantastic experience. My biggest hangup was the work/life balance; constantly working nights and weekends took a toll after a couple years. However, I continue to stand by the company and the service it provides. A wonderful outcome of working all those hours, however, was making some of the greatest friends I still have today."
good,"Verizon Wireless pays pretty well and the company does sponsor events on company campuses. There is a high customer focus which I love but the efficiency standards do stifle some of the creativity that would be utilized to create a valuable customer experience or to even save a customer from leaving the service. Overall, it is a good place to work minus the micromanagement. The focus on minutes and seconds is unlike anything experienced in any other position."
good,I have spent more than 1/2 of my life working at Verizon.  The people I have worked with have been amazing and I learned a lot about myself and a lot about business over these years.
good,Company Executives are largely intelligent and good people. CEO (Lowell McAdam) is very good. The amount of Executive communication from CEO and CFO downward in the Org is pretty good for a Company this size. Office cultural is largely positive and collaborative. Company and industry is very competitive which creates an ever-changing environment that serves to 'keep things fresh' and challenging. If change does not energize you this is not a Company for you.
good,Verizon has been going through many changes in direction and leadership.  There have been multiple reorganizations and mixed signals on the direction of the various organizations.  Employees are tired and frustrated yet passionate about doing a great job and servicing employees.  You will experience layers of approval and delays in getting results.  Pay is at market for a large corporation as well as benefits.
good,"As an Event Coordinator, I was a liaison between the company and the business and making event promotions to increase company presence within the business. Sales and Marketing were two big aspects of an event coordinator in order to increase sales revenue within this position. Management was fair yet firm on sales targets and would encourage all employees to attend workshops or any learning materials. As a sales team, all my co-workers were able to help you with events or advice as well as material to help with your responsibilities as a company. Making the sale is always a challenge when selling recreational service but always very entertaining in using different methods for different target markets."
good,"Learned many things from management part of project team coordination and work culture."
good,"Typical day at work is greeting clients and assisting them with purchasing a phone and disclosing contracts and price plans, etc. You learn a lot with the company and they're quick to promote deserving employees."
good,"Verizon is an environment where everyone works together as a team.  I have every contact within arms reach. Most difficult  part of the day is  probably the number of consulting and negotiations I am involved in with regards to what products and services will aid in their line of work!  Probably, the most enjoyable part is reflecting on all the possible customer that maybe coming our way!"
good,"Internet Sales and Operations is a very serious organization - with the main perk being on the cutting edge for online sales and marketing. "
good,Union job and Benefits and pay are good. Hired as a Full-time temp employee but did not get offered a permanent position because union did not want to extend our contract with Verizon.
good,"Like any other high pressure sales job Verizon is a well paying company with many good benefits and a competitive salary/commission structure. They offer other venues in operations, customer service etc for those who are not interested in retail."
good,"A typical work day would start off with following up with customers. Preparing reports and reviewing large billing.  Preparing for future meetings with other business partners."
good,"Definitely a fun place to work that taps into your creativity while still giving you rules and guidelines. Management is very approachable, friendly and helpful. The only reason to leave honestly is for more money."
good,"Having been at Vz for 7 years, I was treated and did very well there.  However, their decisions to make changes is like most other monolithic companies, the leadership changes, so do the organizations.  I feel I made a 'difference' however it was not enough to be spared from a reduction in force.  That aside, overall Vz is a good company to work for, good pay/benefits and they promote a good life balance.  "
good,my work days are usually okay that i stay to myself. i dont really talk to others because there is always calls coming in most of the time. i have had about 4 managers while working here who i have really enjoyed working with. there is always help when you need it. i have learned a lot about being the best customer service agent that i am since i have been working there
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"maintenance for 30 years,am looking for part time work since I am retired,houerly wage is negotiable,if this is full time position I am open to discuss hours,"
good,"This was one of the best jobs I've had thus far in life in regards to compensation and benefits along with an amazing team atmosphere to work within. A lot of fun events for employees for appreciation as well as an annual bonus based on company's sales results of the fiscal year. A typical day at work would be sitting at a small desk of  your own while taking inbound calls for account management, technical support and other customer needs when it came to their wireless accounts. "
good,Working on contract basis so looking for permanent payroll job
good,"Verizon is a great company to garner business acumen.  There isn't much room for growth (especially in call centers).  "
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon Wireless. The Retailer I worked for had some very questionable upper management. My customers were the most enjoyable. My co-workers has their ups and downs but good people. I learned alot about phones and different customer service techniques.
good,"Unfortunately my employment is ending, our office is being closed.  However, over the last 11 1/2 years there's been a lot of changes and opportunities.  I wish I'd have been able to retire from Verizon."
good,I enjoyed working at the corporate Verizon store. Since it was small it was kind of a family. we all worked togther but still could have fun and help people while working.
good,Verizon supports continued education and provides the tools necessary to develop and advance your career.Verizon makes it a point to continue to better themselves as they work towards being a world class Finance organization. I would recommend anyone interested in learning how to work with Financial Statements and Financial modeling to apply to Verizon.

good,"great place to work if your a people person, like sports and entertainment. Open and honest management, friendly co-workers and customers."
good,Great benefits and compensation. Good place to work and develop a career.
good,"Fast-paced, productivity based environment. I loved the people I worked with, Verizon has a lot of very smart, hard-working, dedicated people. The hardest part of working for Verizon is the retail hours. The most enjoyable part of working for Verizon is the amount of high-quality individuals you will meet working with the company."
good,"Work days were always great. I learned how to change service plans, adjust credits to the consumers accounts. I enjoyed the rapport with my co workers. The hardest part about my job was the rotation of the schedule, those changes didn't allow quality of life."
good,"Great director and sales management. Great engineering. However, this big tanker has a hard time getting rid of bad talent, and poor management tends to poison the company. All you need is one bad apple with a worm...."
good,"Typical workday is facilitating customer governance calls for Service Delivery, Service Assurance and Financial Services Management.  What I have learned is improved time management skills in order to successfully multitask and wear multiple facets/hats required in my hybrid position.  Co workers are a huge support as they understand the huge responsibility in the support we provide to our customers in our hybrid role.  The hardest part of the job is the wearing a Financial Services Manager, Technical Program Manager and Service Manager cap at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of daily accomplishment in resolving an issue and providing the lessons learned.   Also, my fellow team mates are a tremendous support."
good,I have worked for this company for 10 years almost. I have worked my way up from customer service to manager and now finally Business Account Executive. I am looking for a job in DFW. I have enjoyed my company. However I am now ready for a change.
good,Easy going environment but always fun if you like a challenge. Great bonuses . Not so fun when you compete against people on your own team for prospects. Ping pong table in the office!
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This was a great position for collaboration and creation working with marketing programs.
good,My typical day involves proactively developing communication solutions for my give client base while addressing any service concerns the may have. I am also involved with increasing participation at Verizon host events and tracking revenue for several sales teams along the east coast. My management team has been very supportive and has publicly stated that I am a tremendous asset to their team. My present team in the DC area so the only interaction I have with them is via phone and email. I truly prefer to work near my co-workers as it contributes to a more cohesive team environment. My strength and favorite part of my job is meeting clients and developing a trusted long-term relationship. Resolving service issues is the hardest part of the job but I understand it is a vital part of sustaining a trusted partnership with clients.
good,"Selling Verizon products to consumers and business either by walk ins, or cold calling companies to close sales. Co-workers are friendly and look to help each other out.  Learned how to be patient with people, explaining the technology behind Verizon products. Work long hours during the holidays, and weekend but pay is more during that time."
good,"hardest part is dealing with constant changes.change in supervisors, no consistency."
good,Took new skills and lessons away from this position. Enjoyed working with many different customers from all over the US.
good,"Earning potential is extremely high"
good,"A typical work day involves a balance of coaching and developing members of management, while ensuring frontline employees are enjoying a culture that fosters fun and productivity. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of coming into the store, cleaning and turning on the computers to start the day. Counting your drawer to make sure money is correct, then open the store. Customers usually started pouring in. Being the only person in the store at opening could sometimes be stressful, but you just work through it. Once my fellow coworker/ and or manager came to work, it made work more fun. Our job was to sell phone and accessories, provide excellent customer service on the sales floor and when customers called the store. When our customers came in with technical issues with their devices, our minds were challenged and we used our skills to the best of our abilities to fix the bugs and leave our customers satisfied. My fellow coworkers and myself were very competitive and would make games to see who could sell the most phones in a day. My manager was young and very creative when it came to our ""One Day Sales"" every month and brought out the best in us. Our team of sales representatives were like a family and I couldn't have asked for better people to work with. At the end of the day, I left work to go home feeling more educated of my job, and most importantly felt like I did a great job."
good,Great experience and management. great customer service experience.
good,"A decent place to work. Great pay and benefits. Customer service can be difficult if it's not right for you. Management is hit or miss and it really makes a difference. Overall it is a good place to work, knowing what i know now I would still apply."
good,"it was great. I was learning more and was doing my training, learning how to do activations, credit checks, fixing the problem on the phone and helping customers. management was ok could have done better to help. my co worker was really nice. the hardest part of the job was it wasn't really hard.

As a an agent, I was able to improved me communication skills particularly in English both verbal and written and I have also developed and broaden my ability in dealing with different type of people in terms of sales and marketing. The management is very supportive to their agents and staffs. The hardest part of the job is convincing the prospected client to buy the products being offered and the most enjoyable part is learning something in dealing with different type of people."

good,I adapted to the corporate work experience quite rapidly and became a manager after several promotions and training programs  I provided ideas that were rapidly developed into sales techniques and was able to increase goals on several projects.

Two times a week I work 12 - 8 and close the store.  I have to balance the cash drawer, credit card reports, and print end of day reports.

good,"great place to work to get your foot in the door, great incentives, relocating is easy after a year, room for growth after you last 1 year in customer service, great benefits"
good,I spent 7 and a half years with this company. I can honestly say they were one of the best.
good,"Take calls all day discussing bill inquiry, plan changes or other customer complaints."
good,"Good wages and benefits."
good,"Never had a typical day. Everyday was different, never knew what the day entailed. I could be doing something as simple as a easy repair job or something as complexed as a 3600 pair cable count failure."
good,"loaded maintenance jobs "
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. However, your life can be completely different depend on your management."
good,"While working at Verizon I start my day by clocking in, checking emails, and then checking what phones we have in the back room. Once i have completed that I then begin to help customers with either a cell phone service, home phone, accessories, Internet service, and protect cell. I've learned how to run a store alone because 80% of the time I work alone. It has taught me how to solve problems without having to reach out to my co-workers or managers unless necessary. The hardest part about working with Verizon would have to be technical issues a customer may have with their phone. I love having the responsibility of running the store alone and simply helping my older customers that are trying to keep up with todays technology."
good,Working in the call center environment is very strict.  The benefits are good but the experience can be very stressful.  They are strictly numbers driven and good customer service is second.
good,"A typical day at work presents challenges and opportunities to overcome and achieve.  I learned that effective communication with the customer presents those opportunities to find ways that will enhance their daily lives with our products. Management works hard to make sure that our representatives are effective and on task.  My co-workers are great in the fact that they are willing to make it a team effort to obtain daily goals.  The hardest part of the job is angry customers, but, I have found ways to raise the customer's comfort level and satisfy their needs and solve their problems.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of being to able to meet our goals and see that the customer is thoroughly  pleased with the service we provide them."
good,"Received 60 to 80 calls daily in reference to account management, changes, challenges, and looked for ways to maximize the customer's experience. I loved the challenges and trying to solve customer issues while deciphering any billing issues."
good,"Verizon Wireless provides many perks to their employees including a game room, fitness room and an events team to assist in driving employee morale."
good,Started with 'Good company to work because it allowed me to balance my work and personal life.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Very nice place to work.  My coworkers were always team players.  One big family.
good,"Fast paced, lots of calls, good training, and fun company.  I enjoy helping customers with their wireless plans and resolving problems.  Great benefits and training for employees."
good,"Verizon was a great place to work for.  I had learned a great deal of Microsoft products while I was employed.  Majority of my coworkers and management team was genuine and looked out for each other.  The lack of resources and the need to do more with less was forever looming over ones position.  Typical day was to make sure we had no servers down, and or a game plan for a down server resolution."
good,"The telephone company is a very punctual place, arrival  after 5 minutes is considered late. Workload is received from a database. Troubleshooting is a necessary function. A technican must be able to communicate with various departments and appeal to dissatisfied employee as well as customers. The hardest part of the job is reading trouble tickets. The most enjoyable part of the job is fixing a trouble or satifying a customer."
good,Verizon Wireless is retail environment that is very aggressive with monthly sales goals.  It is very challenging at times where there is no foot traffic in your door to produce numbers like is required.  I love working with customers and learning about their daily lifestyle.
good,"Because we are understaffed, we are expected to work long hours to complete a heavy workload. During an outage, we've been known to work 24+ hours without rest to restore customer service. This is a high visibility position, a small mistake can cost you your career. We follow strict MOP guidelines and double check our work for accuracy. Management and office personnel are non-union employees and anyone working in the field is part of the CWA. This separation has had a negative effect between the relationships of the staff. I do consider my co-workers to be part of my extended family."
good,"- Challenging environment."
good,Took anywhere to 50-80 calls per day.  Learned a lot about telecommunication.  The management is ok and some are eazy to talk to very understanding.  Very stressful job and not much room for advancement but the pay is VERY good.
good,This is a workable environment. Management can be more effective in communicating information. 
good,In the billing department the company standards were high and kept high to assure the best experience to each customer and improve customer retention. The hardest part about this job is seating down for 98% of each shift. 
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. They have helped me gain alot of professional skills
good,Enjoyed my career there. The company allowed me to grow my skills and trained well.
good,Verizon always was looking to secure its market share with it technological savy and hunger for growing in it's field of publishing and marketing.  
good,I can't complain about my job. I thoroughly enjoy working here. 
good,It is a well known company . A typical day at work was very busy. I learned how to do sales and give exceptional customer service. Management was fair and co-workers are supportive. the hardest part of the job are the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping new people.
good,"If you are not opposed to sitting on the phone all day. Then this would be a job for you. You get to learn about various functions and software of the cellular industry. Management is ok at best. The co-workers are great. In fact, we still keep in contact. Due to upper management decisions the call center in Houston was closed."
good,"I worked for a authorized retailer for Verizon in Dallas area. A typical day was working a scheduled 6 hour shift. I would work on EROES website and CSOKI websites to help customers define needs of their Verizon accounts. I would sell additional items as well and was very organized individual when doing so."
good,"A typical day at work in a retail sales environment is very competitive but rewarding if you put in effort. During my tenure at Verizon Wireless I've learned the value and importance of working together toward a common goal.It makes ones work-life more enjoyable and fulfilling. Also I learned that a positive/memorable customer experience is what sets us apart from our competition when it all said and done."
good,"It's really up to you whether or not you succeed at this job. The quotas are competitive, but if you educate yourself on the products, you do well selling them. Also, you work closely with other reps and tend to build strong, fun work relationships. The retail hours get difficult at times, especially during the holidays."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Thrive in an environment where performance is linked to compensation
good,"Verizon was a great company for sales, the opportunities to increase your income was outstanding.  "
good,"I was faced with customers all day every day, but what walks into the store will not fulfill your quota in most stores. You need to be on the phone, actively selling. There are lots of resources and help. Lots of flexibility. Management supported me, co-workers worked as a team. For me, the hardest part of the job was being assertive about sales and assuming the sales. The most rewarding part was solving problems, helping customers achieve their goals, and nerding out with fellow techies."
good,"Its a great job with amazing benefits but the upper management is all about who you know to get to where you want to be.  Hard work, length of being there along with sales numbers don't mean much sometimes.  You have to know somebody to be able to advance with the company."
good,People were great but company moving offshore.  Weekly fear of layoffs.  Continuous lay-offs required fewer workers to do higher volumes of work.
good,"An opportunity to learn so much in telecommunications and speak with small business owners. Also, it was definitely an opportunity to multi-task and to be an independent thinker."
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon because it was fast paced and friendly.
good,"Typical day includes signing in to a computer and helping customers face to face. I learned how to talk to and educate customers on all products carried by Verizon Wireless. Management team is good and very involved, but when they are stressed and not in a good mood they show it. Co workers were great, very competitive, which i liked. they keep you motivated and turn into your second family. The hardest part of the job would be having to meet high quotas during the slow seasons. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to been working with a new face on a daily basis. Get to meet all types of people and new contacts, and hopefully learn something new everyday."
good,"Verizon was a great work place, I had a great time being employed."
good,"A big company, good benefits, nice opportunities, competitive salaries, great work locations"
good,Great service. Always felt confidant selling it. The benefits and pay are very competitive.
good,"I worked at Verizon for 30 years mostly in the administrative field. My job there included office functions such as working on the computer, creation and maintaining of reports, clerical aide to the Managers and supervisors, timekeeping, payment of invoices and other common office duties."
good,"The training that preceded my position as a customer care specialist was above average. The education on wireless products that I accumulated during my stint with Verizon Wireless was beyond compare. That being said, I saw myself no longer serving in an in-bound call capacity as I have been working in this field for the greater part of 10 years. I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience while with this company. Their benefits were outstanding and management was flexible and always accessible."
good,Aggressive sales skills required. Must be flexible with hours worked and able to multi-task
good,"Managing audio, web and video conferences for domestic and international clients using VoIP and IP technology."
good,"Typical day, taking calls, billing, tech support, global support. Meeting CRAZY numbers. They give you NO TIME between your calls to collect your thoughts and/or get yourself together. They want your call work to be extremely low & have HIGH average calls per day... I learned how to be patient & sympathize with my customers. My co-workers were awsome, my last supervisor, ehhh, NOT SO MUCH. Hardest part of the job was feeling like I was working in a modern day sweat shop, most enjoyable part was pay, BONUS & being up on latest cell phones."
good,Benefits are good
good,we worked hard for great pay. we completed jobs on time. I learned how to take instruction and to do jobs right.
good,"Verizon is a forward thinking and fast-paced employer. Upper and Middle management has work diligently to maintain it's workforce and generate new business in a challenging economy. As an employee during hard economic times I have found that most of my stress occurs after I leave work. However, like other employers, interoffice mobility and advancement has been limited within the company."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I have fun with my co-workers and we keep it lively. The hardest part about the job is not having every tool I want. I learned how to deal with an type of customer to someone that know nothing and not so happy customers.
good,District Sales Manager responsible for six corporate locations
good,A good company to start career with especially in the domain I'm working for. Provides enough opportunities to learn and explore new technologies. Harmony is maintained across the teams in company and definitely a good place to work.
good,good pay high stress. Little job security or senority advantages
good,Great second job! Very stressful though and unorganized. We would take hundreds of calls a day in regards to Verizon home services.
good,Wonderful people to work with! Great management and wonderful team.
good,"I work in an offline capacity, viewing and working trouble tickets for customer base. Work includes all possible resolutions, working with various backend departments to resolve client problems ranging from Telephone, Internet and Video issues."

good,intro to b2b
good,Overall the benefits are great some. Great place to work. Great compensation and they really care about the employees.
good,Strong growth and great opportunities! It's a great place to learn about product development and execution of new services.
good,"Great fun place to work. Wonderful employees, company provides a plush comfortable place for employees to work and provide the latest technology updates to complete job task. The work place provides consistant training on products and services to make sure employees are always update when handling customers calls. Most managers makes every attempt to work with employees. However, their are a few that needs to make improvement in the way employees concerns are addressed."
good,"Company has changed over the years as did there name. Not high pressured job in the construction side . But you do need to show a decent amount of production. Managment is fair in there dealings with personal, most coworkers have similar backgrounds at the same time being deverse. Pay and benefits above industry normal."
good,"The hardest part of the job was being a first level manager getting squeezed from the union below and management above. I was made to feel unappreciated, overworked and undervalued. It became a do-more with-less or get fired situation on a daily basis. I'm glad I was able to retire before it got any worse."
good,"Was a very good place to work. The benefits were amazing. Its retail hours, so nights and weekends are a must. Not great if you have a family that is active with sports and other activities. Most of the managers I worked for were great. You always get a bad one here or there no matter where you work. Overall, it was a great experience and a great place to launch a career."
good,"Excellent pay, the work environment however is stressful. Extremely fast paced, a lot of overtime, and schedules are not 8-5 they vary and are set on 7 days a week and holidays, 24 hrs a day. Facilities were not very well maintained (e.g. restrooms, break room)"
good,I enjoyed the time that I did have at Verizon Wireless in past as far as the employers & customers
good,"I worked 3rd shift in this call center environmnt for cellular clients. I went with the assumption that my position was going to be higher than a customer service rep. That never happened and I was disappointed. Other than that, its a very good company to work for."
good,No two days were ever the same. Great group of people and interesting challenges. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all levels of employees all over the country.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Assisting customers with billing, sales and services.Additonally helping technicians that are out on a job for a customer making any necessary changes to an order for the business customer."
good,I enjoyed my time with Verizon. I learned a lot about the communication business and had the opportunity to facilitate locally and other areas.
good,Good job while attending school.
good,Assist customers in the Verizon store with their phones and billing inquiries; rung up sales; worked as a teamplayer with sales reps on the floor to ensure the best experience for our customers
good,A provisioning agent was escalated because of the complaints of order managers in other centers and our manager agree of the escalation. Investigation was made by the Senior Provisioning who is an American that was present on the center at that time and they found out that the agent is not suppose to be escalated because that issue must be answered by the order manager itself to the customer not the provisioning agent responsibility.
good,"At the time I worked for them, the pay was good to raise a family on. Even for entry jobs. You felt like family and the company had compassion for its employees. Unfortunately, they like most have lost their real values."
good,Worked with other students or people my age from the area. Menu wasn't too difficult to memorize. Food was always excellent.
good,"This project is pilot process. So everything was new and unexplored. So we researched and found lot of good practices which are still followed in Verizon among Ethernet Provisioning team. With minimal support from ON Site Instructors, we excelled and generated value for Verizon."
good,"it's retail, so your going to work holidays and weekends, but overall the staff was pleasant to work with and I enjoyed working here. The sales goals are usually set unreasonably high, but there is money to be made and plainly of opportunity to advance."
good,I enjoyed the high morale with this company. I was scheduled open to close a lot and I had a poor life / work balance
good,Learn a lot about technology and new phones. Was able to establish good relationships with customers that knew me by name and knew their account in confidence.
good,I was in charge of placing over-the-phone customer orders for local and specialty phone directories.
good,I was responsible for assisting customers with Verizon Wireless products and services.
good,Customer service and sales to customers. My co workers were the best part of the job.
good,Overall decent company to work for. Compensation and training are good but there commission structer is ever changing. I know this is to be competative in the industry but it used to be a job where a sales rep could pull down 50000 a year and now they will be lucky to hit 30000.
good,"Great company to work for, just not in retail! Great pay, lots of advancement opportunities, but VERY poor work/life balance."
good,Good commission structure paired with a decent base salary. Plenty of tasks to keep you busy throughout the day. An overall stisfying work experience.
good,The typical day involved logging into the phone systems as well as your computer. After that the work flow would take place. The management team assigned work randomly because of the incoming calls. My coworkers were a great group of people. All of whom had different skillsets. Some were better on the phone while others were great order writers. That is where issues could take place. Management did a great job of spreading out the work so no one individual would be overworked. It had its ups and downs but the most enjoyable part of the day would be communicating with my coworkers whether it was work related or talking about life issues inbetween orders or phone calls.
good,Every day presented new and challenging issues due to the many changes that took place each month.
good,"Working in a retail environment isn't easy when trying to raise a young family but it was a well paying position and it was fun working face to face with customers and co-workers. This was the first position where sales was based on quotas and base percentages. The most difficult thing was how quotas and the base would change regularly which forced reps to have to chase their numbers sometimes. However, it was a fun atmosphere and co-workers were always willing to help each other close sales. I just wish the management team was on the same team regularly."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Really enjoyed my time working here. Company cares about employees happiness. High turnover rate due to constant changes in the workplace
good,"A typical day at work involves performing customer service for 9 or more hours a day, five times a week. The day starts with making outbound cold calls to businesses and other companies and ends with selling wireless service to consumers and businesses."
good,"I like my co-worker and managers. Working any retail job has it pluses and minuses. Your schedule changes every week, you work every weekend, including holidays. The pay is enough to live on comfortably but not enough to take any trips. Often times the store is understaffed, and customers are impatient and angry about the wait time. You can barely take a lunch break if you are lucky. It is a great job for anyone who wants to advance into sales. The management is great and your colleagues are really nice. However If you want to advance into a more challenging customer service or social service job you may want to put special thought into this job. So far I have enjoyed helping customers and problem solving....but I don't see any advancement opportunity for customer service (at least not in Boston)."
good,I currently work in a department that sets up long term payment arrangements for customers who are unable to pay their cell phone bill on time. There is little room for advancement in my current department but in other departments there is much more opportunity.
good,Taking inbound calls to troubleshoot wireless issues and address account issues. Taking from 25 to 30 calls per day. My coworkers are plesant and so is management. The hardest part of the job is the customers rate our performance and determine our raises. I love talking to people from all over the world.
good,"Loved my tenure at Verizon! It was a great company to work for until the last few years, what with downsizing in the 21st century that changed so many lives drastically. Sadly, it is the state of the economy, not the company, that created this situation."
good,Un dia de trabajo es variable dependiendo del Proyecto que uno esté involucrado.
good,A typical day at work consists of working with customers to find out their needs and wants to get them into the right device for them the first time.
good,"is a good place to work for, schedule is not working for my family"
good,"The most productive part of the job was communicating and researching information for customers. Organizational changes were often, so I've learned how to shift mindset."
good,"A fun, relaxed workplace."
good,"While at Verizon I was able to work in many fields - the last being business sales. My position was to support the business sales team for Major Accounts within the state of Texas. I enjoyed my job tremendously. Especially going out to visit with the customers - you finally got to put a face with a name. I had a great manager in the department and support staff also. My coworkers were awesome! We were all placed throughout Texas - Austin, San Antonio, Lewisville, etc., but most of the time it seemed like they were in the next cube. The hardest part of my job at that point and time was my commute - 1.5hr one way."
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers with any questions, comments or concerns. As well as helping the customers select the correct device and plan for what they need in wireless services. I learned from my experience as a Verizon Wireless salesman and manager how to communicate accurately with each different individual to create a great experience in my store. I enjoyed every aspect of Wireless sales and management."
good,"The biggest problem that I had was retail hours in this company. It took a lot of time away from family life, but I would definitely recommend it to single people."
good,"As a sales representative we are required to not only be a sales rep but to also know how to solve tech issues and handle billing issues. We are required to meet our quota and there is an extreme amount of pressure to do so in this economy today. It is very competitive among coworkers due to the quota requirements. It is a very repetitive environment as well. We are observed and criticized almost daily which makes it stressful. Overall, it is not a difficult job and the benefits are good."
good,A typical work day would be getting your jobs via blackberry to your assigned towns. Get in your work van that you took home which was nice. Co workers were the best. The most enjoyable part of the job was management never bothered you and helped when available.
good,demanding but rewarding. Union labor difficult to work with
good,great for those just starting out but phones will burn you out
good,This experience expanded my interpersonal skills and allowed me to be efficient with the time provided to complete my tasks.
good,Good Experience while working at Verizon
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is solving customer issues and learning about new technology.
good,"My typical day at work is fast paced, that require face to face communiction with the public. In my current position I have learned to be determined, and optimistic in everything I do. My co-workers motivates me to be the best employee I can be. The hardest part of my job is creating new ways to sell. But the most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers"
good,"Great place to work, Manhattan headquarters is right next to World Trade construction site."
good,taking inbound calls
good,Verizon is a great company to gain business experience. I am looking for more opportunities to increase my experience on a multi unit level.
good,"Retail side of the company takes a lot of time, stress management, and the ability to handle difficult customer situations, troubleshooting, and hitting many company initiatives with every customer interaction."
good,"Great place to work depending on the department you are in. Phenomenal training opportunities. For this particular position, employees should be moved roughly every 3-4 years to prevent burnout and encourage growth and development."
good,"This is a great job to get to know the public, interact with the public and your coworkers. It is difficult to find a balance once you start a family due to the hours of operation."
good,Enjoyed working at a company that prides itself on delivering the most advanced telecommunications services to its customers.
good,"Verizon Wireless is an outstanding company to work for. You learn tons of life skills as well as consistent on the job training development and inspection. If you apply yourself, advancement is definitely in your future. Great co-workers and some great leaders. I learned a ton and am very appreciative for the experience."
good,This is a great company to work for. The pay is great and the benefits are second to none.
good,VZW does a great job keeping employees trained on new equipment. The pay is decent and the benefits are great. The problem I had while there was in customer service became responsible for the actions of all departments of the business. No matter who was at fault customer service reps became the apologists for the entire company.
good,During my time I had access to several resources to advance and excel.
good,Great Company to work for with full benefits on your 1st day. Great tuition compensation that does not require you to pay out of your pocket
good,"Great place to work. This company has its perks and tries to make sure that their employees are appreciated for the work they do. In this position I am given the ability to help others interact with the world in the way of internet, tv, and home phone services. Employees are responsible for helping customers set up new home services and understand monthly bills with technology called Fios witch is Fiber Optic Technology."
good,I enjoyed my time with Verizon wireless. Unfortunately a bad manager can make your time there miserable. There are a lot of expectations that come from the job and in a store management position you are certainly married to your job.
good,Professional work environment that is well organized and has good opportunities for advancement and stability.
good,"It was not many opportunities to involve a great business tranforming in your life. I did experience that although it was tough, challenge and take time... we know, there was less and less value to sell assets in long run and we have to CHANGE!"
good,Good place to work. supplied me with everything i needed to complete my jobs. Gained alot of experience
good,"Although the work was at a fast pace and the company prioritized the fast resolution of any problem, they were incredibly supportive and interested in making sure every employee was successful."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work for a work from home environment, however management seems completely out of touch with the day-to-day operation of the tech support environment."
good,It was a wonderful job when I had it. Very short term since the owner had some personal struggles and his company went out to business. But overall a great experience. Long hours and tough on the body since we did outside sales during all weather conditions. But I learned a lot.
good,"Your team is very important to help and support for your job. It's important to you can manage your job process and complete your task."
good,Frequent reorganization or Reduction In Force - often in November for end of year termination/movement.  Some rehiring as a contractor often stipulated unable to be hire unless 6 months post RIF
good,Good place to work. Great benefits and pay. Provides numerous opportunities for advancement as well as on going education. The ability to move from position to position
good,"I spent the last 15 years with Verizon and I am so grateful for all of the experience, friends, and development that I have gained.  Excited to move to the next chapter in my journey, however I don't regret a single moment with Verizon.  Awesome company, some of the best leaders and employees in the world!"
good,"Diverse workplace, being prompt is very important. Lots of training available and you can get tuition assistance. The hardest part was the constant change, you would learn a rule regarding customers accounts and that would be revised in a month or 2. Communication was lacking at times"
good,"at times there was slow times where there wasn't much to do but wait for customers, the management was very helpful and wanted you to succeed for yourself and the company"
good,"Limited advancement opportunities"
good,Seen it all in telecom industry.  Everything is going wireless and fiber.  30 years given good package to retire.  I worked outside able to use bucket truck in good and bad weather.
good,The job was good and working remotely was a big help. The facilities are also very nice. However when i was there they were going through major management changes and it seemed like everyone was out for themselves. But I believe the job experience for each person is dependent on what manager you work under and your coworkers. It is a decent place to work
good,Good place to work  if you like making commission based off of sales. Upper management could be pushy when certain targets aren't being met.   Hated having to push HUM to everyone.
good,Tough starting in a sales role and then being able to move to another aspect of the business. I was in a marketing position for a short time before they terminated many roles.
good,"Good Company to work, we can get trained in any domain"
good,Great environment in data center. Senior fellow technicians care about knowledge transfer. Management is given some opportunities to cultivate job and knowledge growth.
good,"The supervisors attempt to make you feel less alone, since they have moved to a remote job.  The management is very involved in making the job fun and to lessen the stress of the job. They try to focus on a more work/life balance."
good,"Call center customer service."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Growing revenue and shrinking work force. They spend a billion dollars on their Network every 90 days but cutting salaries. If you get in, be careful because they operate under last in, first out."
good,"I worked in their business intelligence team, which was a mixture of their database, data science, and visualization teams. We all worked together in an agile environment, working on features. The work was project-driven and we had the option to work from home. I worked from home 2 days out of the week."
good,Company is very welcoming and sounds promising u til you become just a number and all supervisors treat you like that (just another employee) and management never allows you to move up
good,"Great company, Great co-workers, loved my job duty's and my co-workers. I had a great time working there dealing with customers on a day to day basis."
good,Great working environment. I learned cooperation and how to be a team player. Interfacing with different disciplines and working together to achieve common goals which is to provide the best network to our customers.
good,Monthly quotas were set in place for Solutions Specialists and Solutions Managers. Management staved the importance of team work and integrity. Providing a great experience for customers was all the motivation we needed.
good,It was a great place to work for career advancement. Very fast paced and not much leisure time. However it instills great communication skills and is a great place to shine in customer service.
good,Take inbound calls and assist shareholders with processing trades and providing tax forms and information they are inquiring about. I’ve learned more about mutual funds and front/ back end sales charge. The hardest part about my job is that it doesn’t have much flexibility.
good,Great job and loved meeting a new customer every day. Wonderful experience. I really enjoyed learning about new technologies that would come out frequently and being able to solve customer issues with there service.
good,"Arranged items in favorable positions and areas of the store for optimal sales. Upheld stock levels and proper pricing for multiple product lines. Researched current and past business performance using online systems and available reports. Effectively communicated and coordinated execution of the planogram with store management. Reconciled orders with financial plans and forecasts. Tracked shipping and updated weekly and monthly fallout. Opened and closed the store, which included counting cash drawers and making bank deposits."
good,"Started with verizon in 2010. T the time it was great. Smartphones were. Becoming more popular. There was lots of room for growth. Towards the later part, things changed. The. Company started investing in other opportunities. So.e of which didn't pan out. The company had to adjust and make cuts. I was not cut, however I left based on the layoffs."
good,Great Company and Atmosphere with Awesome Benefits and bonuses had To always stay up on Trainings and new Products and Services as well as  Technology
good,"Wanna make good money, make something for yourself and you have passion for tech? Do Verizon, just make sure that Location location location is important, because location equals traffic, and traffic equals potential sells."
good,"Normal day at work with a lot of information to learn at work. Management is nice with direct instructions how the job done. Culture at the work place is good with the employees. The hardest part of the job is getting the information to do your job, the most enjoyable part is getting a;; the necessary information and do your job right."
good,Good place to work.  Pays well.  Benefits are good.  Some jobs include ability to work evening or night tours.  Ability to work with others on various projects or teams.
good,"Verizon is a great place to work, learn the cutting edge of technology and see it at work. Be prepared though, for a reduction in your free time and work-life balance."
good,"Excellent be benefit. Work from home , above average vacation days plus personal days, 6 percent 401k, 8k tuition reimbursement. No other company I know offer such package. Parental leave for both mother and father. "
good,Company was constantly changing the direction we were going and what projects we were working on. Need to stay on your toes and learn quickly to keep up.
good,"Essentially a customer service rep for their business and government accounts. Honestly I felt like a 911 dispatcher as far as the amount of tasks/services you can do. Resources for answers are trash but it is what it is. Great benefits, pay was based off experience but HR was amazing. Monday-Friday and started off 11pm-7Pm but they bid for schedules every 6 months and it’s based off stats and seniority."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I owe my current skill set to Verizon. As Verizon evolved, they provided opportunity and training for their employees to evolve as well. Verizon offers ample family life and work programs to maintain balance between the two and excellent benefits, employee resources, and 401K matching. I truly enjoyed my time working for and growing with Verizon, it is a great company to work for."
good,"I left in the midst of major restructuring so I can’t say how things have changed. In general, they are moving towards having people at same location so great opportunities for those who can/want to commute to Basking Ridge, NJ"
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for. They treat their employees very well. Upon getting hired I was surprised to hear that you receive benefits on day one of employment if you are a full time employee, which is very rarely heard of, so for me  that was great."
good,My fellow sales reps were a pleasure to work with as well as local management. Overall a good place to work however the sales incentive goals kept increasing while the amount of support to focus on sales lessened. We were being asked to do more as far as tech support as they closed the positions that did that work while our sales goals increased.
good,"Very open seating arrangement, many large and small conference rooms. Remote connections work very well.Many training opportunities on company intranet."
good,Excellent Software Solution For Product Driven Businesses” Overall: Infor M3 has been helpful with providing us overall better work flows and increased productivity in many areas. The Finance software has aided us in more efficient cash management and bank reconciliation too.
good,This job you answer calls and troubleshoot with the customers. Then do basic customer service and bill and equipment resolutions. Meeting metrics that are sometimes unattainable is the most stressful part of the job
good,My last assignment at Verizon was a Managing Partner position with 6 B2B sales teams.  Verizon is a company this is always creating the curve by launching new products often.  The job is demanding as driving profits and results is a number 1 priority.
good,"I enjoyed my work and at that time, overtime was abundant. Some managers very flaky, but mostly a great group. Not sure what more I can say. I wish I could work for them again"
good,I loved working for VzW however i often had issues with lower management. Vzw offers gr8 benefits gr8 health options and can be a fun energizing company to work for I'd go back if I had the chance
good,Great Benefits and Bonus but low salary's. New open concept work environment but still does not encourage much fun. Culture has suffered in the last few years.
good,"great cell service - beats the competition.  Work hard, beat the competition, great service, best cell service, work really hard and you can go places."
good,"Verizon Technicians make great wages and earn every penny of it. They work days,nights, on call outs, and staggered shifts.Overtime is a reality for the Verizon Technician. Technicians MUST complete their work related training and become certified. If the candidate cannot pass this training,they will not advance in  the employment process."
good,Good place to work. The environment changes often as technology advances. They offer a lot of training for their employees. Job advancement opportunities are available.
good,"Call center supporting residential and business customers with Fios service. Troubleshoot internet, phone and video services, assist in placing repair appointments and replacement equipment. Reporting order errors and network outages."
good,"I loved working with sales and the customer relationships that I built."
good,"Exciting company to work for, always changing and fast paced. Great technology leading us into the future. Only negative is retail quality has diminished. Always worried about bottom line, trying to get the most work from the least amount of people. Also making it harder for someone with real selling skills to make money, commission quota is fixed to where you are capped. Hopefully, they'll figure it out."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Enjoyed the company."
good,"A typical day at work for my job position would be numerous conference calls involving Release Management and Audit Tool Development need for the coming Monthly and Quarterly Releases."
good,"It was a fun place to work.  they had an open floor plan and that created a fun culture.  Management had your back.  The only draw back was during acquisitions and change in business direction, it left many scared of being let go."
good,Verizon has given me the opportunity to develop myself in a variety of ways. Being able to lead a team of union technicians really helped me to improve on my communications and leadership skills. The pay at Verizon is greats as well as the bonus and 401K programs. VZ is really a great company to work for as they continue to lead the way and evolve into the future.
good,"Fast paced environment but is very stressful. There are merits that need to be met on a monthly basis. The call center as a whole can be very dramatic; however you go, do your job and stay out of conflicts, you will be fine. The pay  and benefits are all great but again this job could be very stressful for an individual"
good,"Nice workplace culture, okay schedules and benefits. Work loads fluctuates, training was great. Typical management but company policies are a bit strict."
good,"If you enjoy a highly charged, challenging athmosphere working with the best and brightes in the industry you will love Verizon.  The are #1 for a reason, this is a high perfomance culture."
good,I liked working for this company but i never got any growth or moved up. I felt my skills were wasted so i left the company. yes dealing with customers is hard but thats like that at every customer service job. I would of stayed if i knew a way to get another position.
good,"Great benefits while I worked there. I would have stayed with the company, except they didn't have any means of letting me transition from retail to IT/Networking side."
good,"Great benefits and good pay. Tuition assistance. Vacation, Personal, and sick time. Semi stressful quota. Certain markets determine treatment. "
good,You get a lot of sales experience and customer service experience because there are so many opportunities in a day. You get a lot of practice with interactions and learn a lot about how to connect with people you have never met. You learn connection is key when you are working a performance based job.
good,"Wasn't too keen about feeling like we had to join the union, but it was excellent pay for a fairly easy position. The incentives program for top employees was pretty fantastic, at least back then."
good,Typically working on a medium to large team to meet the business needs of the business and development directorate.  Verizon is undergoing a transformation to a Scaled Agile methodology and mindset in order to provide the best value to the business with the most outcome as soon as possible.
good,lots of training. opportunity to move with company. great benefits from day one. retail hours. fun new products. fun sales contest. workplace culture is great
good,"While at Verizon, it was a great work environment. It was a fast paste with great opportunity. Because of the opportunity to grow, the environment was fun and competitive."
good,Very good very hands on job very good experience learned a lot met a lot of good people there became very skillful in all aspects of telecommunications industry I would highly recommend this job
good,"Job was excellent, but no retirement packages or room for advancement. It's a challenging job in sales. Come ready to bring your A game everyday. Nice compensation for the hours."
good,"People should work under proper manager. Else it would be very difficult in Verizon to learn. I am not sure about the current status. Up to 2015 it was good. As per the status from 2015 i would say"
good,"I truly apricated the leadership at Verizon.  "
good,The company was great to work for in the beginning.  Working as a sales rep was incredibly different in comparison to management.  Upon moving into management it became a 24/7 job where you were constantly on call or working from home on your laptop/tablet giving you no work/life balance.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The job is pretty laid back for the most part, when it gets hard it's hard but still doable especially since you usually work in a team. Start at 6:30am at my garage then leave at 3:30pm so plenty of time for myself in the end, and weekends off. Don't count on overtime so much, this was assured to me but Ive only seen maybe 5 days overtime in the year I've worked here"
good,"Have to be at the corporate HQs to get promoted, work from home or at branch office are rarely promoted.  Friendly and helpful fellow workers.  Verizon also has the challenges of other large companies including difficult to create change or management is too focused on politics (vs. productivity)."
good,The pay can be great but the demand and stress also are great . The company changes often and work life balance is always something you have to fight for .
good,"Able to move up quick with patience and hard work. Unfortunately most of these positions are done remotely from home now. However, I believe they still conduct training at this site."
good,"The employees are great to work with and they have a healthy competition while at work. The work isn't too hard, but sometimes the managers micromanage you."
good,It was a fun work place but the pay wasn't worth it and we didn't get that busy. I had great employees and I had a great boss. If it would pay better I would still be there.
good,"I worked there a few months and learned a lot about products, devices, and promotions in a span of a week. Too much information to retain all in a span of a few days, but otherwise very laid back and helpful people! I wouldn’t hesitate to go back."
good,"Professional environment, great team work, lots of training available. Excellent benefits. Work environment can be stressful/fun/challenging depending on the day."
good,"The biggest issue i had working there for 20 years was work life balance."
good,"I loved my CAREER but the restructured and cost a lot of people their job. There was also a lot of favoritism and ""cliques"" at my time of departure but that will be at anywhere you work."
good,My location was a third party licensed vendor of Verizon products. The people and atmosphere were very relaxed and knowledgable. The pace of work was very steady because my tenure was during the holidays.They work with your scheule whether you are a parent or a student.
good,"Nice place to work and management will keep you motivated. You will have enough changes to learn new technologies and explore upcoming tech."
good,"There was no typical day at Verizon for me, but that's what I enjoyed about it.  There was consistency with the programs I was working on but there would also be unique opportunities and challenges each day.  I primarily worked from home but periodically would work from the office which was recently completely remodeled.  There were periods that the work/life balance got out of line but it wasn't a prolonged issue."
good,Verizon is a very good company with very competitive salaries. But I think it's designed for a person with probably a small family or no family at all due to work life balance.
good,"I worked as a contractor.  It was a great experience, lots of learning opportunities.  Most full time employees had longevity with the company.  Great for professionals."
good,"Verizon is a good place to work with competitive pay and good benefits. Your own drive and interest will dictate how far you can go in this world-wide, Fortune 500 company."
good,"It was a great place to work mainly because of the people you get to work for and alongside. The work can be stressful at times but nothing that some teamwork can't get done. I wish there was more of a greater feeling about being able to maintain job security or moving up in the company, but unless you had a contract through a collective bargaining agreement that was the only way to feel safe."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon. The management team was supportive, friendly, and fun to work with. A quota is given and you must work hard to exceed, but it is worth it."
good,"I was hired to be a project manager locally, but just before we kicked off the local project, it was deemed uneconomically feasible.  So instead of working locally, I was shifted from remote project to remote project and my management changed three times as a result.  This was not the work environment I signed up for."
good,Always faced with new challenge.  Managed global customer which allowed me to constantly evolve and find ways to make sure we were supporting the customer with the latest most efficient and cost effectively.
good,Very much like any large corporation...not a ton of urgency if you are any good at your job very relaxed.  Culture has changed a fair bit with the large amount of contractors engaged at the Irving location.
good,"Position required install and repair of voice and data circuits in local exchange network, safe operation of service truck, pole climbing, working aloft on ladders, team work with other techs, and satisfaction of customer."
good,Verizon was a great place to work but lacked proper communication in some areas. There is room for improvement with conference calls and properly including members of the team.
good,"It was was good company, i advanced a lot with the company it showed me a lot about my self and what i could accomplish. I think it is a great company to work for."
good,"Team work at its best."
good,"Typical day is on phone, call center job. Hardest part is the customers dealing with bills and trying to set up payments arrangement or even paying the bills"
good,"Fun, rewarding job. Great pay. Make your own paycheck , even if you do the bare minimum. Recognition always when you put in effort. Always busy. Can be overwhelming during holidays. Neat uniforms, free phones and service."
good,"As the summary states, you will be rewarded nicely from a total compensation standpoint. It’s a performance based company, almost all jobs have some sort of commission element or short term incentive...be prepared to work extremely hard for this reason, you have to earn the compensation every single day. C - level leadership is outstanding, and create a great vision for the company. Mid-level management on the other hand is not and can either enhance your career or be a roadblock depending on how well they execute the company vision vs. Their personal agendas."
good,good place to work but very stressful at times. Enjoyed working and developing employees. Attended monthly manager meeting in Vermont/NH. It was fun planning monthly employee gatherings.
good,"I value what I've learned at Verizon so much. Everything from my customer service skills, which were sharpened on a daily basis,due to customers coming to me with their problems (high bills, broken phones, not understanding how a particular phone works), to my sales skills that i crafted into my own after three years of learning from the best. I enjoyed working to meet a quota, as i'm a very driven person. I'm not only very adequate at talking to customers of all kinds, but i feel comfortable and enjoy it. Talking comes natural to me, so a conversation with myself is organic and direct. I've learned to help manage/train new coworkers (as i had worked there for 3 years), and my patience really flourished in those situations."
good,I enjoyed working there for nearly 19 years. Offered great benefits and room for growth if you are willing to relocate  Flexibility in some groups but not all.  Had the opportunity to further education and travel with the company.  Cant beat the wireless discount!
good,Was a  good place to work.  I was treated fairly and everybody has a change for success.  The job came with many benefits both financially and spiritually.
good,"you can work on latest and advanced technologies. can get insight on latest Telecom advancements. "
good,The salary is phenomenal. The stress that goes with the salary is high. Integrity is questionable when offering products to consumers that clearly are not able to afford any add'l household expense. Corrective action is applied if an offer is not made on every call regardless of the selling signals determined on the call...
good,"Loved working there when I did, but didn't have good work life balance options available for employees. They will say they do, but actually allowing employees to take advantage of those options is a different story. Good pay and if you are flexible a good place to work."
good,Working at Verizon was a great place to go to work at. I hope that helps. I would recommend others work their and i have. Their is alot of great people working there.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for as it is established as well as reputable. Theres a ton to learn and the company is invested in every member of their team.
good,Loved the people I worked with. Enjoyed my customer base and I enjoyed the relationships I was able to build while working there. Great opportunities to make a decent living in a friendly atmosphere.
good,The company offer me multiple opportunities to get hands on experience with customer service as well as the knowledge of phone and electronics. It became a valuable experience for me in interacting with other people and knowing how to talk to others in society more comfortably.
good,"Enjoyed my time with Verizon, its a good company to start your career with. The benefits were great, the downside was managements lack of involvement in their employees career advancement."
good,Solid professional work environment and culture. very woman friendly   workplace. benefits were on par with most major companies within the industry and I was happy to have worked there.
good,"required to work weekends"
good,Good job I enjoyed my time at VZW. Great coworkers and I had some of the best managers around. It is a stressful job but if you just have to be patient and learn the ropes.
good,"Verizon IT (Ashburn) is a great place to work if you want the flexibility to work from home, work flexible hours, or take days off as-needed. "
good,"The company was enjoyable to work for, but as time went on the company took on a new direction. The company put the bottom line ahead of employee experience. Many hard-working long-tenured employees were terminated because their hourly wages could be replaced by newer employees willing to work for less."
good,"Management style varied by group managers. Hardest part of the job were the fire drills and micro-management for data that wasn't used for several weeks later."
good,Verizon Wireless was a great opportunity for me.  They assisted in my development and career advancement.  I was able to partake in many programs and training's that I will be able to use outside of their organization.
good,"Great coworkers, most of them willing to help. Management is to be desired. Best thing to do is keep your head down and work and listen but don't disclose what was heard until all facts are gathered."
good,"A normal day at verizon for me would be to get my team together for a morning huddle, going over expectations and setting goals for the day.  Seeing to it that everyone achieves their goals and doing whatever it takes to get them there."
good,"Great company to work for. Incredible benefits.  However, the Managers are now just becoming very numbers driven without focusing on talent development."
good,Great company work for but they change the quote structure they made it hard for employee to hit quote . They have a great leadership program very big into the community.
good,"Great job to earn a decent paycheck but not to have a life, job wasnt secure and meeting goals became a overwhelming task. Management helped out when asked or saw a diminish in sales, higher ups didnt care how their employees felt."
good,Verizon is a fabulous company with wonderful people and leadership team. Employees are treated well and the benefits program is quite competitive. They know where they are going and how to get there.
good,Verizon is a great place to work and grow - you have to be willing to put in the work to advance.  They are a pay for performance company.  I have been promoted several times in my career at Verizon.  Their benefits are first-class.  I loved the interaction with people and their viewpoints.  The hardest part of the job was work-life balance - it's an exciting company and is always on the forefront of new technology and services for our customers so it can get hectic at times.
good,It was a very good job didn't fit the house for my child. I was a excellent worker but I couldn't work the hours she provided at first it was good then they added a extra day that couldn't fit my schedule.
good,"Our store had 3 managers at any given time. Yet there were always manager meetings going on. The store was poorly supervised. We even had an instance of one of the manager's boyfriends who worked at a competitor allowed to enter into the back room where all of our sensitive business information was kept. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I have worked for many different departments and teams with my 18 years with the company. i have learned many great skills during my time with the company. i was sad to go - but it was my time to expand my horizons.
good,"Take advantage of the College programs, one of the best!! You do not even have to pay out of pocket and they bring the school to you. The scheduling is not the best at first but if you work hard you can get a schedule you desire"
good,"Good benefits and overall good experience, some changes with leadership recently, it will be interesting to see it the new leaders can continue the success of the past."
good,I loved working for Verizon in all of my different roles. In sales and customer service the work life balance did not exist.  Once I was in operations with a set schedule things were alot better.
good,"Hardest part of the job is never knowing when you are going to get the call that your job has been eliminated.  Typical day depended upon your job title but most days were spent on conference calls and working thru emails."
good,"XO Communications was acquired by Verizon a few years ago and since we have become almost fully integrated it's obvious management at XO didn't know how to run a company so the growing pains for us have been numerous, but things are looking up"
good,"Verizon ran a tight ship.  The managers cared (at lease mine did).  The number of employees to work was tight, but manageable.  Using your vacation time was encouraged."
good,"I think Verizon is a wonderful place to work with great benefits. Verizon is going through a lot of changes right now with leadership, but the overall take away is that the customer is our focus."
good,"semi-autonomous"
good,"I always thought I would finish my career with Verizon. It was a great place to work and career advancement was always available. Over last several years leadership focus became foggy and office politics played an increasing role."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for. However, there are times when some things are overlooked if good numbers are there. Sometimes quotas are not achievable depending on territory if you are a B2B representative."
good,Not only was the pay good there was plenty of OT. There was paid training and generous PTO.  There were incentives such as gift card just for doing your job.
good,"Verizon produces some great products and has the potential to be a great employer, the executive staff really believe they are good to their employees and have their heart in the right place, the benefits package rocks. On a day to day basis this really doesn't propagate down and it feels like the company lacks direction. It's very difficult to engage with many of the benefits the company offers like their training and mentoring systems."
good,Verizon provides good working environment and training for employee development. Work life balance is good there. But the management there is not stable
good,Verizon positions is not a easy road to travel but it is a road worth traveling until you need to advance. The only thing consistent with Verizon is rapid fire change and the need to adapt in minutes.
good,"A typical work day in management is 10 hours.  Call center is results driven and can be stressful. Associates have no time between calls. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Overall a good company but the latest vision for the company is to operate very lean.  Morale is not what it used to be and the remaining employees are overworked.
good,Verizon changes to compete in the business place. The environment is dynamic and will expose you to developing technologies in a never ending flow. Pretty much every position will call upon you to grow with it over time.
good,"I have been working here from last 9 years, my overall experience is good and it adopts new technologies and ask the team to start working on them. You won’t find onshore opportunities"
good,A typical day at work would be considered very fast paced. I enjoyed working at Verizon.  They truly had great compensation packages and prizes.  The training at Verizon was one of the best that I have had.
good,"Great benefits. Ample time off, great health insurance, 401k matching, etc. Verizon takes excellent care of its Employees from a benefit standpoint. Hard pressed to find a better overall benefits package."
good,Diverse workplace with a competitive atmosphere. Product knowledge was always changing. Strict quotas and sales goals on a week to week basis. Long days.
good,Workplace was very clean and the service is superb. I would work there again. I enjoyed my coworkers and bosses. There is always room for advancement at verizon and I’m truly blessed to have worked there.
good,"Its all about power. You need to sell and stay  on top of the foodchain when it comes to sales, to move up. I was more interested in the skillset rather than my advancement in the company. It was a great learning opportunity. Thank you."
good,"Change in pay and overall structure of the busniess model needs change , can be great to work for outside of the retail space. New leadership practices needs to be implemented"
good,"It is a stable job, great benefits, good pay, and good time off. Being on the phones all of the time can be stressful though. When you are work you have to stick to a rigorous schedule that can't be diverted from. You have to spend a certain amount of time on the phone and at your desk. You do not have much leeway in your daily routine."
good,Fun and challenging environment with great benefits and pay. Can be tedious at times as most positions are retail. Very accommodating when it comes to work life balance compared to most retail positions.
good,"Verizon Provides some of the best working conditions, compensation in the telecommunications industry. The direction of the company is constantly changing and Verizon is on the front lines."
good,"A typical day involves consultative sales and up-selling current accounts. Helping to resolve customer issues with equipment and trouble shooting. Assist with billing discrepancies and get resolutions. "
good,"Had a good experience, responsibilities increased regularly for competent employees.  "
good,"Good place to work, work and life balanced environment. "
good,Becoming new clients go-to person on bettering their lives/business. Very flexible especially if you have a family of your own. Great benefits and 401k
good,"Verizon took the time to teach sales consultation and earning the right of the customer. As much as I valued that training, working retail did not assist with my lifestyle. There was not a set schedule to work around as well as having to stand 8-10 hours a day was hard on my body."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon was a great company for me to grow with.  No two work days were the same and the environment was always fast-paced.  What set the company apart from others were it's people and the workplace culture.  The most challenging part of the job was being able to ""turn it off"" to balance home and work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to shape and develop the careers of so many others while I was there."
good,Worked with Basking Ridge Marketing and Communications and had lots of meeting but a decent amount of autonomy to make my own decisions.  Did not see much of a path forward in the position so changed companies.
good,"Great Company to work for.  Career minded professionals should apply, however Verizon historically has the lowest pay scale when it comes to Project Management positions."
good,"fast paced, stressful, no activity during clock in, learned how to speak to customer and deal with their issues at hand, learned what to say in hard times and how to say it as best as possible"
good,"I loved working for the company. I have made a lot of connections within the company through different sides of the business that I will take with me throughout my professional career.  The commission based quota was unrealistic but that is expected in a major company like Verizon.  All in all, there is a lot of different routes to take within the company and they take care of their employees."
good,"Everything is based on your attitude and if you get a great supervisor. You have to be self motivated to excel. "
good,This company is the same as ATT fast paced and controlled. the Managers are better. the pay is less. But if you like controlled environment this was a good company to work for.
good,"Great place to work for.Sorry company down sized and center closing.great benefits , great management, good training for employees. "
good,"Ever changing, competitive,room for advancement.many people you work with are great. Constantly learning , new technology and different  task every day"
good,"State of the art advanced technology and learning opportunities are always available. Tuition reimbursement up to 9K a year. Very easy work culture, open seating, extremely big gym with instructors, classes, ping pong and generally an environment suited for intellectual well-being is always present. Good company and good people. The CEO is very cool, rangy fella from Sweden and has a great sense of practicality and humor"
good,Fast pace environment great co- workers great  pay.   I loved the customers and the benefits the company offers. I loved the training for the job.I would go back.
good,Network Engineering was a highly technical job with opportunities to work on the latest cutting edge telecommunications equipment. Training on most new pieces of gear is very brief and requires some extra study-time & hands-on to master.
good,"Typical day starts with back to back meetings until afternoon then work on deliverables due end of day or next day.  The day would wrap up with touchpoint call to prepare for next day's meetings.  The pace is different for different jobs but in general, most people are booked with WebEx meetings."
good,"It was a good place to learn about putting the customer first.  They do promote from within and award top performing employees.  I recommend, but be ready for many changes."
good,The pay was good and the benefits were good as well. The schedule was demanding and there was always pressure from upper management to perform even when you were doing well.
good,"I work with many colleagues who have been with the company for many years and they love the work and environment. If you like your work and are in the right team with a good manager, but aren't necessarily looking for new challenges, you will love it here."
good,Great environment with a relaxed work pace.  when customers come in you must be on your best zone and be able to push the product to make goals.  Hardest part of the job is remaining consistent.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good company to work for though they are going through manay changes that impact morale with all the packages offered to management/operation positions. Great compensation in sales roles through quotas can be challenging. Change is constant. Very metric focused. Benefits are excellent.
good,"Sell phones, work with customers, and discover their needs.  Based on their needs recommend the best solution to best fit their need.  "
good,"As an information specialist I was responsible for building codes needed by our engineering staff for provision of service to our business and local client base. I worked closely with engineers to complete service orders, verified service address information, updated our database and billing information"
good,Verizon is big on recognition and awards. They make sure that a job well done is praised and a thank you is received. I learned so much about what makes a successful team and how to develop our people accordingly. Everyone is included and we always had fun even with the long hours and being open 7 days a week. The benefits with Verizon were outstanding and helped to make the hours involved in retail employment worth it.
good,I've loved working at Verizon but there are rarely opportunities to advance anymore. I'm feeling burnt out in my current role and there isn't a desirable position to migrate to.
good,"In order management / Project management. Team leads and managers need to have their ego stroked all the time. The work is fast paced and constant. However, the company it self is a good company to work for. They do severance employees all the time, no job is safe."
good,"In comparison to an even ""higher tech"" company, I do think Verizon was not as flashy as it could have been. We were afforded some access to outside without leaving the building and the interior of the building had some good attributes, as well as cleanliness. The management team made a big deal out of team accomplishments which did create some cohesiveness. A bit fun, for the most part, until some employees started to get a bit too competitive and some proved to have applied only to take advantage of paid training weeks. I learned a bunch, especially for being an older worker, which was the one draw back culturally and always is in tech companies. Learning is my main goal, secondary to monetary reward."
good,"Enjoyed the work, challenging and quick pace; however, there were just not enough resources to accomplish tasks in the timely manner being requested which made extremely long days and often weekends without being compensated."
good,I enjoyed the five years I worked at Verizon. I learned a tremendous amount about Verizon's Enterprise Solutions to add to my tool box of skill sets. The hardest part of the job was navigating the numerous business units and red tape to advance the sales cycle. The most enjoyable part of the job was laearning about my Customer's business objectives and delivering enterprise grade solutions to meet these objectives.
good,"Verizon has changed a lot since I left, so I am not sure how accurate this will be.  Verizon is a good place to work overall.  They pay their employees well and are very good with training and development.  You can advance as high as you want if you listen to coachings and continuously try to improve yourself.  The cons are the hours (I worked retail, enough said.), and the goals that were set sometimes seemed unattainable.  With that being said, it didn't stop me from pushing myself to be the best I could be.  If you are interested you should give it a shot."
good,"Competitive environment , Learned a lot from attending different kind of customers ,,,their likes , dislikes daily lifestyles ,always updated with latest technology."
good,"It's hard to review a company that I have not worked for, for nearly10 years. Overall, it was a good place to work. The reason for leaving was downsizing."
good,Culture is changing for the better by the day.  Company was once primarily unionized which created a contentious culture between management and associates in some geographies.  This is dependent on geography.  Concerted efforts are being made to change that relationship and culture.  Compensation is top notch.
good,"As the recognized industry leader, we were always busy working to hire the right people. Never a dull moment and management was supportive.  Worked as a contractor, but never able to find a full-time employee role."
good,The company has afforded me 2 houses and 4 vacations a year. They paid for my Master's Degree and allowed me to acquire e a very diverse skill set. However the company is taking a different turn with different leadership that I am not quite certain of.
good,"This is a great job, you will be able to vacation and do A LOT. However, you will miss birthdays, holidays, and happy hour (because with this job alcohol will be your best friend)"
good,"Very typical of a large, complex organization.  There is some overlap between teams in the IT organization.  The Network organization, in general, is very strong."
good,"Overall, Verizon is a great company to work for considering the compensation and benefits.  However, if you work in the retail environment you must have strong sales skills.  If you work hard, the results will show in your commission payout.  As long as you are open to coaching and development, Verizon offers continuous training to enhance your skills."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Coached  techs day to day and monitored safety practices. Preformed safety monthly safety audits. communicated weekly with customers to ensure all work was completed.
good,Verizon offered an amazing volunteer severance package that I accepted.   I was a program manager with Verizon that allowed for working on for different customers every couple of years.   I loved the diversity the position provided. I am looking forward to new opportunities.
good,I enjoyed the 9 years I was there. The work was rewarding and fast paced. The ability to work from home when needed was great for some management employees. The company restructuring forced many of us to leave before we were ready.
good,"It has been a pretty good place to work until now. You have lots of freedom, you can set your own hours, do what you want."
good,The job was not hard at all; however it was very stressful to maintain a great work life balance and they are not that understanding. The only great thing is the pay and the benefits other than that I would of been left.
good,Managemen is less than helpful after they got rid of the kind ones.  Training is a blast with very encouraging staff to lead.  Overall a fun place to work but lacking in support from management when issues arise
good,This is a big accounting center that have hundred of accountants in the Verizon building. The management are still seeking the best way to manage so many people.
good,Bonuses available and once a year chance to win a trip for sales when I was there. Pay and benefits were good. Stressful with back to back calls at peak periods.
good,It was a great company to work for over 30 yrs ago but the company began to compromise their treatment of the associates later in my career. I worked in a call center during my last 15 years with the company and it was very stressful and was not provided adequate training to perform the job to my fullest potential. I was provided with training on various systems which are proprietary only to Verizon. Wokrplace culture is very diverse. Hardest part of the job is having not being able to provide the customer support required due to lack of training.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team.
good,"A great company to work for, great benefits, job security, and promotional opportunities. Opportunities for professional and personal growth; ability to earn degrees and learn in place."
good,"Progression in VZW Corporate changed from new hire in 2001 to 2010.  They provided job opportunities, benefits, and tuition assistance.   VZW experience gave me the experience and confidence to success in future career."
good,"I was with Verizon for over 14 years started as senior developer.  I have learned so much through all these years as well as made many  mistakes and lesson learns.  I had the chance to work with very talented people and as well as many technologies.  It made me whom I am today as very experienced technology leader.  Though there are many set-backs due to may organization changes because of the merger, I appreciated all the lessons learnt and all the friendship I made through all these years working for VZ."
good,"My workday is never the same as far as all the variables involved with meeting the needs of the customer."
good,Verizon has afforded me great opportunity throughout my career.  Verizon offers good benefits and salary. Verizon's  promotion opportunities are very favorable.
good,"Worked in the call center, however, the position moved to working from home. Work-life balance at the call center was difficult to manage, due to schedules and hours."
good,Good work culture.  Some what work pressure to meet dead lines.  Need to work minumum 50 hours in a week.  But very good exposure to learn new things.  Every month will  have new work so that will keep everyone refreshed and not bored to do the same work.
good,"I would recommend to Verizon to take all investigations seriously, and without partiality. By Verizon being one of the biggest cellular provider on the planet, they have tendencies of favoritism in the workplace. Other than that, Verizon is a great company to work for."
good,Although he didn’t pay well you got to work around Lil E called people schedule is flexible you were able to do overtime as you wanted and there was plenty of time where you could do overtime the environment was exciting they played a lot of music they had a lot of incentives the paid this was not enough
good,"Though there is plenty of work to do, very little autonomy is given to employees to decide their work flow. New management comes in so often that the direction seems to changes every couple of months."
good,I worked at an indirect dealer.  Pay was ok.  Managers are fired left and right.  I guess thats just how sales is sometimes.  The job itself is easy if you can talk to strangers comfortably.  As a manager your doing phone inventory daily. Opening and closing registers. Handling staff and scheduling. The usual manager stuff.  Problems I dealt with was not being able to get new inventory to keep up with the times.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Pros"
good,"Mixed, great tuition benefits & 401K matching. Promotion growth within limited."
good,Work with offering new IPT/CPE solutions while helping customers with reducing TCO and solving their issues on a daily basis. It was a enjoyable environment.  It was hard to get the company to support you on making sure customers request were met.
good,Awesome place to work  benefits were amazing they offer tuition assistance and a yearly bonus discount on your phone bill  gym and cafeteria at the center
good,"I design and manage the performance of In Building, Venue and SMC locations for the Network team. I moved from System Performance over 3 years ago because INB/Venue projects were all different and offered a greater challenge. "
good,"Good place to grow in Career, Management is friendly but decisions taken are not employee friendly. Work life balance is excellent and free work environment"
good,"My typical day at Verizon is spent following up on items/e-mails that require a follow up.  We have standing daily / weekly calls for specific projects and scheduled calls. On average, I would have 4-8 calls a day and balancing tasks that I need to complete."
good,Performance and metrics are at the top of the daily focus.  Work and meeting times unfortunately do not always balance out.  Easiest part of the job is delivery for customers and teammates.
good,"I worked for Verizon for many years. The benefits are best in class. The pay is decent. Because it is such a large company there is a lot of opportunity to move upward and around the organization. They do have high demands, which can be tough on the work/life balance, but a great company overall."
good,It was a long hiring process but I had a good experience at Verizon. My manager was good and would help you become a better employee. It was retail so the hours fluctuated but that's to be expected.
good,Working at Verizon Wireless was a great job for me at the time.  It helped me hone in on my salesmanship as well as become a better customer service rep as the two are very intertwined with that position.  Management was so-so and pushy at times but overall ok.  The benefits and compensation were different.  Working in retail just wasn't for me after almost a few years.
good,Company makes it difficult for even top performing employees to advance. Awesome pay and benefits for entry level position. great experience for first time workers or People looking to go into cellular sales and account management.
good,"I've learned translation, revaluation of 9 countries, create, merge and close an entity, reporting analysis, improve the administration and review large quantity of reconciliation accounts, also SAP"
good,"Meet multiple types of people and are exposed to many forms of music, however on your feet all day and you have to deal with drinking and kids both separately and together making for some annoyances."
good,Verizon has a fast pace environment. If you like to work and be recognized for advancement this is the place to work. The benefits are phenomenal and department bonuses are nice at the end of the year.
good,"Verizon is a great company. I have to give credit where credit is due. The reason for turnover is the many revolving parts. The working atmosphere is great and a lot of great people and perks involved with the job. I was able to Flex when necessary which means that if I needed to come into work 2 hours late then I would have to make that time up before the end of the week. This is particularly great when you have a family and children. They also have great benefits and match the 401 k up to 6% and are fully vested within 3 years! Down sides are that the job is very stressful. As we all know motivation will take you far but not far enough or long enough. Basically when I started I was excited and pumped and kept a open mind and positive attitude because I could see the company had made a concerted effort to take care of its employees. Verizon is very numbers driven so as a rep you are  constantly juggling a million things to meet those numbers. There are metrics for how many phones you upgrade,3 day repeat (how many of your callers call back within a 3 day period of receiving help from you), disconnects (how many lines you disconnect), ACPD (average call per day), Hold time ( how many secs you put a customer on hold), and it goes on and on. Everything you do is tracked and there are very high standards. It is doable but almost all customers that call in are irate or confused about something and its nearly impossible to pack everything into one call and not miss anything every time. Customer service by nature is stressful because you can not control the manner the caller will"
good,"It was a great place to work , just no room for growth.I really woul have stayed at this job if they offered me more opportunities. But overall it was a okay place to work."
good,The company was stressful to work for; you were expected to meet goals daily amongst others who were more pushy and competitive. It was challenging to work with that type of employee.
good,Very good company to work for with lots of different opportunities. very competitive and slightly old fashioned when it comes to work life balance. Overall  defintily a good place to start and grow with .
good,"Solid company. Work hard, get paid well. Not for the lazy person. Pretty quick to pull the plug on long standing employees. Many of the District Managers have major pride and ego issues. Enjoy that."
good,I would say Verizon is very focussed and concerned about the overall perception of the company. Verizon is very collaborative and they strive to establish and maintain a family like atmosphere.
good,This is definitely a fast paced environment in the chat department since you are working with two customers at a time. It can be stressful at times if it is busy or there is an event that is causing customers to chat in like an outage in an area or widespread device issue.
good,"Verizon has always been a wonderful work environment filled with excellent culture and a partnership atmosphere. Employees are often given one-on-one coachings to improve their performance, and commitments are created to help progress in careers."
good,"One of the best jobs I had"
good,"assistant manager skills- conference calls planning for daily numbers,"
good,Verizon is a good place to work and they provide top of the line benefits.  Very talented and dedicated people work there and try to help their customers daily.
good,"Good Environment and co workers when I was there, would occasionally see somebody famous stars while working there. Overall good place could been permanent but no openings was available at my time of hire."
good,"Times they are a changing everywhere."
good,"Typical day at the office consists of report generating, data analytic and customer interfacing.  From this I have learned to analyze data in a more scrutinizing manner along with working in a more collaborative environment to be more productive and influencing on product and processes. The culture in the workplace thrives and shows in personnel enjoying what they do. The only part that makes the job difficult is resources for certain projects are limited due resources needed when applicable but with this difficulty allows me to find a way to create a bridge for that gap in resource to complete the job task at hand which I find enjoyable."
good,"Verizon is a good place to work, advance, and learn. Like most big companies they suffer from too much pc in decisions, but if you are driven AND capable you should be able to prosper.  Down side is if aggressive revenue targets are not met there will be layoffs (RIFs) every few months, even when good revenues are achieved RIFs are a certainty."
good,review inventory available at location follow up with customer cold call for new business train new employees that are within their first 30 days. Observe employees that are with their 90 day probation
good,depending on your boss (just like any job) this path can be a great and rewarding one. Anyone over 18 can and should be a rep if youre interested in making commissions and proving yourself.
good,The job consisted on talking to people on the phone about their bills and also tech support. The job started out being a great place to work but ended being a shark tank due to the competitive nature of the workplace
good,"I enjoyed working with the people but Supervisors word trump yours."
good,The group of people I worked with was an amazing group. the company was very motivational. They continue to work with their employees and help them grow into strong sales people.
good,During the 9 years I was employed with Verizon I found them to be an excellent company to work for and I would still be with them today if our group was not relocated out of state.
good,Mgmt at the Colorado Springs location were amazing.  Manager recognized my range of skills and used me as a contact center architect and project manager.
good,You will be on your feet for your entire shift. the managers were great and always helpful.   fun place to work with great people.  Hardest part of the job is working with difficult people.
good,"If you are used to working for large corporations then you should expect the same type of culture.    "
good,Very aggressive sales targets and culture ensuring daily stress for all management.  Very rarely hear if you are doing well but always hear what you need to improve on.
good,"My duties at my recent job as Treasury Analyst was performing Positive Pay, Stop Payments, Bank Reconciliations, Asset Recovery, Unclaimed Property, Investigating Fraud, Research Projects."
good,My manager was awesome but managers changed often during schedule changes and many just didn't care. Calls were typically back to back with some slow periods. The perks were awesome. Time is very micro managed.
good,Evolving environment.  Very demanding requirements and intense at times however the company takes care of its employees with excellent benefits and pay.
good,"Verizon is a great company if you're looking for something with remote work possibilities and a fabulous benefits package."
good,Company is restructuring. Previous 17 years of working there was great. Alot of changes has come to surface with new leadership has changed. I would do it all over again if I could. Good company to work for if you have job security.
good,Enjoy the company very productive and family orientated.Open minded on new ideas. Forklift training within side the company. Small but very comfortable warehouse
good,"I worked Verizon almost three years and I have good experience as professionally as well personally."
good,Working with Verizon was great for the most part due to having worked several different positions.  As an employee I was able to move around learning different positions due to the management style Verizon had.  Once the reduction in forces started they continued with a lot of us loosing our jobs.  They would hire you back as a contractor for a short while then that would end as well.
good,"Log into all systems"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Very ""numbers"" focused."
good,Call center reorganization eliminated positions.  Great culture and presence in the community. Would have stayed if the reorganization had not occured.
good,"Good team leads workplace culture, stressful at times with call volume.  Hours not great.  Pay was commissions based. Detail oriented am]nd documentary.  Good place"
good,"Successful company. A typical day includes meetings to review project progress, new project opportunities and opportunity sizing. Benefit in role to have work at home flexibility"
good,"Typical days were rewarding because I was always learning.  I worked in several departments throughout the years.  I've learned skills for selling, collections, worked with money as a teller and learned clerical skills as well as data processing skills.  Having worked in so many fields I believe it prepared me for other opportunities in the future."
good,The opportunity was great to work at Verizon until there was a change in management. Allowing new managers to bring their teams from previous employers.
good,It was a great opportunity and it was a job that required my major.  It helped me develop the skills needed to advance in my career.  They also offered tuition assistance.
good,"The  company rewards you for your hard work, but work life balance is very difficult. The company has a tendency to burn you out very quickly. Not a company for a new family."
good,"good pay, a lot of over-time opportunity, training could be slightly better, and keeping your job shouldn't be solely based on surveys because there will be customers who will drop your surveys because they don't get what they want. Other than that its a great place to work."
good,"The flexible timings and good package are a couple of the many things that lured me to Verizon. Although I joined as a fresher, I was treated as Professionals from Day 1. There is no practice of addressing senior employees as Sir/Madam."
good,Laying out a plan and satisfying the customer and the company while installing or repairing services that will make the electronics and daily life be more comfortable for a home or business.
good,"Great place to start in call center experience, not too easy, not so hard, you will learn fast, friendly environment, always busy, at all times it will make your shift go fast."
good,Like most call centers you are held to adherence of your schedule and are expected to be on time. There is some flexible scheduling which is nice. Management kind of talks around issues and rarely knows how to do the job you're expected. Culture can be ok but hard to keep motivated when morale is low.
good,"Verizon has been a great organization to work for, the people and the corporate life has been great there. One take away is that as Verizon has merged with other companies, they have not merged there old systems."
good,I definitely do not have any regrets during my tenure in Verizon and very proud of my accomplishments and always will treasure the friendships I have created there.
good,"Call center experience doing tech support for the general public of firs customers. The experience with customers calling in wasn't too bad, not every call was perfect but it wasn't to terrible. Management could definitely use some changes. Less management involvement with call handling and more freedom for the tech rep to work in a comfortable environment."
good,Verizon was a great opportunity but wasn't my career position.  Fresh out of college its perfect.  Chance to make great money but not for someone looking to have work/life balance.
good,I have grown as a person since I was employed with the company. I am able to provide leadership and confidence to be successful to achieve company and personal goals.
good,Loved working with customers through out my career. Enjoyed the challenges of learning new skills and gaining more responsibilities. Did work few others had the opportunity to do
good,The coworkers are amazing management is decent the nature of the job can be difficult as your are there to resolve issues with every call so separating personal and business is definitely needed to properly execute this job just like any other customer service job but i have noticed that over a phone customers can be a bit more aggressive than if they were in your face
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Can be what you make it. opportunities exist to learn and grow to aid in advancement. Good 401k stock options. Hours flexible. Typical work days start off with scrum meeting to discuss the status of work completed, work to be completed, and any issues preventing work from being completed."
good,I am glad to have worked at Verizon.  I was able to work in different departments within the finance team.  This helped be to become more well rounded in Finance.
good,"As a sales rep, the job provides great benefits. They have a great training program. Management was my only complaint, turn over rate was very high, all the good sups were getting replaced by new reps that never worked in the call center environment."
good,"It's hard for me to give Verizon as a company a fair review.  As I mentioned, I am a sales rep for Verizon, but I'm employed by IM Wireless which is an Authorized retailer.  The benefits aren't great and neither are the hours, but I enjoy the overall job."
good,Good place to work great benefits and training. Great employees and supportive  supervisors. Great pay and time off. Great tools to do your job and always training to do your job well
good,Its high temp sales! Weeeeee!!! if you like that sort of thing. Which I did. It is good money if you are into the hustle.You have to suggest appropriate products to sell them so you need to ask the correct questions to find them. If you don't like to talk to strangers then it is probably not for you.
good,A great company to work for overall. You spend a lot of hours at work on the other hand and often times stay later then scheduled. Money is good if you're are willing to earn it. I learned a lot about communication skills and management in all facets.
good,Each Group is different - this is very dependent on your manager.  Some managers are great and some are not.  So if you are in a group where your manager is smart and fair - you will rate it higher.
good,"Working at Verizon was a goid experience overall. Customer base already expects to spend money, so closing sales is a bit easier than it is working for other carriers. As long as all metrics are it, the pay is phenomenal. Long days and sometimes nights.   However,  if you are focused it is a great job to have"
good,"I worked in a call center and it was a very fast-paced environment focused on stats and quotas. I loved the people I worked with, and the amount of PTO allowed me to have a work/life balance."
good,Able to be promoted to a supervisor. Able to help other representatives to grow within the company. Fun times when they did themes in the office. Nice coworkers
good,Verizon was a place to really learn much about advancing technology that was available to the consumer. It was a place to glean an abundance of  information and to sharpen one's trouble shooting skills.
good,"Overall good company to work for, great benefits, great people, and culture of employee development.  Although, there are too many job layoffs affecting good hard working employees."
good,"Lots of teamwork, good work environment, lots of movement in departments and teams. Friendly people to work with and willing to help if you need it. Good company meetings and information sharing."
good,"overall positive work environment space "
good,The pay was great but sales can be super stressful. The hours are around 40 ish but you are working retail so the hours are all over the place. Managers were great though and often coached well.
good,Great if you are a super star sales person for the opportunity to get in to management. If you can not produce to numbers on a superstar level you will not get a chance at management opportunities.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Highly engaged employees excited to drive innovative solutions for extraordinary customer experiences. Supportive leadership team and the company heavily invests in developing it's employees. Challenging work demands high energy, strong communication skills and excellent team work. The work, compensation and talented employees makes it a great place to work."
good,A great place to work if you have fulfilled all of the free time events. Excellent care in the training process. Friendly environment to work. Scheduling is a little crazy around the holidays!
good,"My review is slightly biased as I worked for a retailer. It was alright when it came to the atmosphere of the company. They definitely wanted to see you succeed. I didn't like that the training wage of 10/hr dropped to minimum wage and you had to struggle to make commission. All in all, the people I met everyday on the job were nice but the low commission being paid made the job not worth it."
good,"A typical work day would be to sell, upgrade, and sell some more. Management is great with a few bad apples but great overall. The culture is great, very proud employees. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with some ill experienced reps."
good,"Great company to work for, I just needed to expand my horizons and potential. Employees are compensated well, the benefits are great, I have loved my time with the company."
good,Great place to work with great benefits and opportunities for advancement.  There are many positions available throughout the company for those seeking to further their career.
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for.  Great benefits, good pay.  Management was great to work for.  Most holidays off and a good vacation package.  Would recommend."
good,sales driven job and very competitive. Management is invested in your success and willing to help. Overall a good company to work for and would recommend.
good,I was paid well for all my duties. I was given the opportunity to advance or move to jobs within the company. I enjoyed working for Verizon. I am saddened to be leaving.
good,Although you are able to make good money with the company it can definitely be stressful. As a tech expert we handle so many different objectives. The company has good culture and activities throughout the year to build moral.
good,"Takes care of you financially.  Strives for a great culture, but management misses the mark. Would love to see more of work/life balance.  Great people inside the company."
good,"This is a great place for beginner salespeople who want to explore their talents."
good,"Verizon likes to have layoffs during just about every holiday each year. It's an ok place to work, but don't count on a lot of career advancement for most people."
good,Excellent people to work with - everyone willing to help anyone to achieve their goals.  Appreciated the ability to move up without leaving the company
good,"Good salary and, in my case, good management. However, with the size of the company changes happen too slowly. Some people in IT are still in the process of becoming Agile."
good,"Great pay HOWEVER work/life balance is HORRID! There are opportunities to advance and there are several different avenues in which you can take. I think the work/life balance issue has to deal primarily with retail hours, especially over the holidays."
good,"not a career i want personally, quota requirements too, high, pushing the idea of consumerism, selling with fear, selling unnecessary products, culture of money"
good,"A typical day with Verizon meant meeting new people every day, each day on the job was a different experience, where I learned to adjust to different scenarios on a daily basis. Workplace was great, worked most of the day unsupervised, but the hours were very long and unpredictable."
good,You spend a total of 6.5 hours at your desk taking calls ranging from billing question to technical issues. I've learn how to use remedy which is a ticketing system for technical escalation. Management were engaging and receptive to your concerns. The workplace was friendly yet competitive. The hardest part of the job was the location. I traveled 54 miles one way for work each day. I really enjoyed the benefits and the knowledge I gain about cellular products and services and how to troubleshoot those products.
good,"I loved working for Verizon. The only reason I left was to pursue a career in nursing. If it weren't for that, this is a great company to retire with."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Recommend. If you don't like working random hours I'd stay away. I made good money and bought a multi-unit from my salary working there so it was one of the best working experiences of my life
good,Verizon allowed personal growth and provided mobility within the company to achieve goals.  Training was excellent and the management allowed self starters to accomplish beyond expectations without micromanagement.    The hardest part of the job  was life balance and the ability to not work 24/7 to achieve goals.
good,"Fast past, employee services on campus, interaction with all groups, open atmosphere. Can approach anyone so long as they are not in a hurry. Sometimes slow pace. Need tangible goals and objectives, an active Verizon store on premises, and other amenities such as a baseball field, need more outdoor activities."
good,"Great place to work, they have competitive pay and very understanding schedule  They're very understanding with balancing life and work. great parental leave benefits."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Pay is very competitive, opportunity to maximize and make more money with commission. Management is usually pretty helpful and supportive on the sales floor."
good,"my last position with Verizon was as a contractor and the last manager allowed me to ""do my job"". it was a great job but my contract expired."
good,"Daily attend meeting in furthering achieve yearly objective.  Other parts of the day is spent achieving requests from meetings.  preparation for next meeting.  Development of  solutions to implement."
good,"Mostly not ideal because half of the stuff they want you to sell is just garbage."
good,One of the best parts about my role was helping customers learn about new products and helping solve large issues on major accounts. I also enjoyed the co-worker engagement within the office.
good,"Fun place to work, Learned a lot in the customer service field.  I grew alot in my Business development and interactions. Have worked as an entry-level salesman to entry-level management in two different company's.  I have drive and discipline."
good,Take the good with the bad. Had some really good times here but it was time to move on once management made it hard to have fun. New leadership came in and began to clean house.
good,"Working for Verizon-GoWireless has been a great opportunity. The people are great and so is the manager. But I feel as though there is no room for advancement. It's a great job, but for someone who always wants the opportunity to pursue a career, the job only takes you so far."
good,"We work hard and are paid well for our efforts. My experience was one of integrity and positive attitude, but my leader was challenged when it came to recognizing changes in the market and reacting to it."
good,"- Call volume is consistent / you're always occupied."
good,"Verizon is overall a great company with fantastic benefits, above average training, solid processes and procedures, and a willingness to develop their employees."
good,"-Potential to make good money (50-100k) lack of social life balance"
good,"Fun, fast paced and demanding.  Long hours & rewarding.  Company provides sold training, good benefits.  Employees must be willing to embrace change, etc."
good,Verizon is a great place to work and advance your career. The hardest part is finding the right folks to get work done. The sheer size makes it difficult to to be 110% efficient.
good,"I t was a great place to work, however did not fit with my family life needs at the time. Frequent change of work schedule didn't work for me at that time having an infant."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The pay was excellent and they even allowed you to work overtime. They paid for my relocation . The sought me out from the Army before I was even interested in the position. The training was nice and allowed workers to come away form the job with more skills than what you come in with.
good,"good company, great people to work with. I work 34 years there before retiring.. Great benefits and security. I would highly recommend them as a great employer."
good,I had to leave because of a unexpected and serious life condition. But Verizon offered GREAT benefits and great pay to its employees and also had a good bonus program.
good,"Overall a great place to work, very fast paced, and very demanding of your ability to communicate with customers. "
good,Verizon is a great company to work at because the benefits are great! Medical insurance and time off when I became very sick was a Godsend. Management is usually understanding of the stress the employees undergo day to day because the company promotes from within. Most employees would complain about the long hours standing and always having to upsell products!
good,"They are a great company with good benefits, they take care of their employees. It is hard to maintain a personal life because of the hours and long stretches of days before a day off."
good,"Apart from the long, retail hours, this company was great to work for.  My manager hired me as part-time, but I was always being scheduled over part-time hours due to people not showing up.  The sales training if amazing and I use it to this day."
good,"Verizon is great place to work. My job required travel and relocation to Arizona, That was difficult to do for my family. Could not relocate and opted to stay local for my family's benefit."
good,"Great Brand; Great CEO and Leadership team; Innovative company and a fun place to work! Cutting edge technologies. Helpful people. Always on trend, forward thinking, great benefits."
good,I had a great 28 year tenure at Verizon with no regrets.  There are many opportunities in this company as long as you apply yourself.
good,Learned a lot about technology. Great coworkers. Sales based. But I can honestly say I learned a lot an I take that with me everyday. Customer still remember how I impacted their experience
good,"Growth opportunities, long hours, management was mostly supportive and wanted to see employees advance in the company. Gave opportunities to learn whatever you wanted."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if you're very flexible and have no or older children. You will need to be flexible with your work schedule. Also the environment can be very stressful at times because you are evaluated based on your calls and surveys. Depending on the supervisor you get, you will have little to no assistance with problem calls. They always want you to do better even if you scored all 10's."
good,"Work culture, challenging environment, Colleges, lot of R & D, growth according to performance, lot to learn in telecom industry, lot of opportunities to grow in field of automation development, continuous support from superiors"
good,"It is a fun company to work for at first. If you are a technology person and can deal with less knowledgeable people well, then you will do just fine! I would recommend doing as a student during college but not after college."
good,Nice place to work.Same work culture like in other Telecom companies.Job security is there.I am fine with the wok culture.Learning is an add on in this work environment.
good,My overall experience with Verizon is that it is a tough job. You have certain points to keep to with the customer and you need to keep in control of the conversation. I struggled with finding the information needed and controlling the call so my handle time tended to be high. Most managers were very good to work with. There where a few that had a tendency to treat their people like little kids. That was more stressful then dealing with a disgruntled customer.
good,"The call centers are heavily reliant on metrics, so you are pushed to meet them. They are all easily acquired if you work towards them, but you have to know how to manage angry customers and how to multitask."
good,Verizon has many opportunities and very supportive teams.  I have worked in multiple departments.  Network Engineering is less stressful than IT.  Benefits are good.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Installation and repair of circuits and land lines. Cant climb poles anymore due to neck .Verizon  has great benefits and a good working atmosphere. I worked there for 26 years and had 44 bosses which I had good relations with them all. I enjoyed resolving problems and the freedom of going to many customer sites.
good,"Closure of our department leaked out, and Verizon had to announce their decision 2 years prior of the closure.  While they provided all the tools necessary to apply for other positions, or obtain gainful employment with another firm - I didn't get the impression that they really cared if you stayed or left.  That was really the only bad experience I ever had in my 9 years with the company."
good,"Verizon is an large corporation that is slowly moving from a telecommunications company to an informations system company.  The fun part is the new ideas and corporate training available as the company tries to navigate into a new identity.  The workplace culture varies among the different organizations.  The work force is international in nature which is quite exciting as different perspectives  provide for innovative solutions. Technology has improved over the years to accomodate a global workforce as work collegues can litteraly exist around the world.  "
good,The workplace culture was great at Verizon until the call center closed.  I worked in the IT department and with no call center I was laid off. Otherwise I think I would still be working there.
good,"A good job, working on HVAC, generators, electrical, UPS battery strings"
good,I would come in and get my things to start  my  work day .  I would get a headset and go to a open computer. I was third party for Verizon Fios at the time and I would call people on the phone and try to sell the services Phone tv and internet ..
good,Verizon was a good place to work.  Local team members and managers/directors always supported you.  Good pay and great benefits package including paid time off and 401K match.
good,I was basically on phone meetings with customers for 75% of the day. The rest was to take care of what was discussed in these meetings. My customers were for the most part pleasant but there were some tough days especially when their network had an issue. Customers were appreciative but wanted quick action and responses. Management was composed of good people but they were too busy to interact a lot. The job was very stressful as we were on 24/7. The people that work at Verizon are for the most part professional hard working people that is a pleasure to work with.
good,"Worked for Verizon for over 10 years from customer service to assistant manager. Lots of training opportunities, can be stressful to achieve goals but I really enjoyed helping customers and working with others to achieve goals.  Retail hours were difficult with a young family and management styles varied greatly.  The business is always changing so if you like to constantly learn about new products this a great job for you."
good,"Great work, great pay, however management not always clear and ""up front"" when there is a layoff concerned. All peaches and cream before the ""last lay-off team"" raided our business. I believe that our carpet was pulled out from under our feet. All the overtime you wanted, plenty of travel, if you were the hardest worker. Loved my job there, the sales team were not to eager to contact and follow-up with customers."
good,"As a contractor, I was treated as a not-quite-second-class citizen. While I was there, I could have gone to HR over a couple of management issues, but it would have been the end of my contract so I kept quiet. "
good,"Above average pay"
good,Not I job I would have left with my work ethic and accolades.  Offices in smaller areas were being closed.  I had a wonderful experience and worked with amazing people.
good,This job requires a lot of time and a very open schedule due to working hours. must be a dedicated competitive person ready to make and achieve goals.
good,"Great environment to work people are awesome, management have a clear vision, great collaboration  within the teams. good aprroach towards complex situation."
good,I would say it was a pleasant place to work.  I would also say it is somewhat what you make it.  In the DRC we got things done as it is a non-stop work environment.
good,"I loved working at Verizon Wireless, I worked there a little over Twelve years.  I worked hard to become a Supervisor in the call Center and was an Acting Supervisor for almost a year but instead of hiring me and other peers that worked so hard for a permanent Supervisor role, Verizon transferred other Supervisors from different call centers to fill any open Supervisor spots. After spending over 12 years as a full time employee I was laid off with no option to transfer to any other position like they did the Supervisors from the other call centers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A typical workday began with morning briefings and proceed to workbench evaluations and customer engagement.  Management staff was standard.  Workplace culture was good and the hardest part of the job was the relentless competitiveness.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about new technology.
good,The business is changing.  Jobs are more plentiful in wireless and IT. The work can be interesting. New collaborative environment is good for some types of jobs but not all. Opportunities exist for new industry trends.
good,Offered amazing benefits. There were some attempts at providing options for advancement but due to nepotism in some departments it made it frustrating.
good,"Never thought I would work in a call enter, however this position taught me so many skills, kept us up on latest trends in technology, sales incentives for various promotions. Excellent training, good management. Structured environment, great work-life balance options, overtime."
good,Always a high call volume. Have to utilize multiple systems to assist customers. Management is always micro-managing which can sometimes be stressful. Management not always approachable. I love the Culture Club there. Hardest part of my job is the follow up process when dealing with escalations. Not always easy to reach other departments. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to resolve customers issues and they are happy.
good,Nothing really negative to say about Verizon Telematics. This industry has the potential to do great things. My day-to-day has it's challenges  but the overall growth here is great.
good,"Verizon is a large company that offers very good benefits, good pay  and some discounts for their employees. Depending on which part of the you that you work for, you may have different experiences with management."
good,"Be ready to work very hard to produce results. If your committed to hard work, Verizon will provide support and training and assist with your succession plan. Nobody holds your hand. You need to want to succeed. Verizon doesn’t keep low producing employees around. Culture is competitive and fast paced. Lots of opportunity to grow , great benefits and compensation. Verizon is trying to change to a tech based company vs Retail and phones"
good,"Verizon is a great place to work with awesome benefits. As a sales rep you have the potential to make anywhere from $1500-$6000 and up per month in commission. That will be determined by your store traffic and selling skills. I will say I had an awesome management team while I was there, as the majority of managers progressed from a sales rep, so they know how things can be and can sympathize with the reps. I left because I wanted to finish my degree, but at the time, Verizon didn't do part time hours."
good,"It gave me freedom to prioritize my work every day. Each day was different along with doing my daily, weekly, and monthly PM work. Being that free I could work all day and night to get the work done. Whatever it took."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Verizon, twenty-one years but was recently laid off due to position being eliminated.  I survived multiple layoffs over the years, but if you are not willing to move to a large city that will count against you.  Our department were one of the few that still had an office in a small community and I foresee that coming to an end.  If you enjoy large companies and growth this is the place to work.  If you enjoy a small company atmosphere where you are a person and your input is viewed as positive this is not the place for you."
good,"I have enjoyed my work experience at Verizon. The only complaint I truly have of this company is the pay grade scale. Verizon has not kept up with the rising cost of living, which forces seasoned professionals to look for employment elsewhere just to keep food on the table."
good,Corporate atmosphere was okay.  Job paid well with good benefits. Schedule was set not flexible. Training was adequate for the job.  Customer service employment.
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for 12 years, the call center in Tampa, FL is where I worked. I started off as Financial Services Representative, it was a fast paced working environment. After a few years the Financial Department dissolved in Tampa and moved operations to Tennessee, I was offered a position but instead decided to move to Technical Support, here is where I found my true passion as a professional, I worked in Technical Support for 6 years."
good,"Numbers driven, stressful environment. Technicians are union protected and have more benefits than the managers supervising them. Best job in the company is outside plant technician"
good,"Great company to work for with very competitive compensation and benefits. From paid vacation, insurance, 401K (up to 6% match), and they will pay up to $8000 a year for school for a full time employee. Advancement is limited once you get to management level, job can be demanding and stressful at times. Work life balance is a huge opportunity as well."
good,Typical day at Verizon is a very fast paced environment. I learned about connecting with customers from all walks of life.  It was a fun and challenging environment trying to position all of the products Verizon had to offer and get the most out of my sales.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Basic high pressure sales. Monthly quotas... Hard to keep up with how you're getting paid because of how often it changes. Long retail hours. Not practical if you have small children that you want to spend ANY time with. Good pay. Match 6% on 401k...benefits start day one as far as health & dental. Great co workers for the most part..but in any sales...there will be snakes.
good,"Forced to hit goals, such as with all sales job, but at times feel you are lacking the resources to meet more potential consumers. As well, Verizon has shifted towards acquiring new business to overcome the subscribers they have lost, which can be very daunting on the sales reps."
good,"Verizon is a nice place to work. I have learned a lot from Verizon. However, the time has changed and the culture of the company has changed over the years. It is no longer the same company it use to be. Now every 6 months they are laying off people since the company is not making significant profit."
good,Great place to work and have fun with all departments.  Going to work there was the best and would recommend Verizon as a place to work.  Benefit are great.
good,There are many there that don't make that much but they also don't put in the effort to maximize what they could make. The opportunity is there to make as much as you would like but the advancement is much harder to achieve.
good,Good paying job with good benefits. At times work was hard and dangerous.Climbing telephone poles in backyards. Working with no-motivated workers at times.
good,It was fun working with my co workers and manager. Helping my customers on a daily basics and learning something different everyday. We had department spreads and everybody looked out for one another.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. The benefits are excellent and they pay well. The store I worked in was full of great people top to bottom. The only reason I left is because I became too stressed out trying to meet high quotas.
good,Hyper competitive marketplace. Ultra fun internal competition from other stores and internal management goals. Loved the fast pace and the daily challenges.
good,"no advance, stressful always because they pushing a lot to sell their plans and accesories."
good,"Work 8hr days 2nd shift. learned provisioning and circuit testing during this period. worked in different departs also . worked in the Central office ,  State Plow , Assignment , I got along with my supervisors. work place culture was family oriented with GTE but was not much with Verizon. Hardest part was working outside for 5 years. Enjoyed working in the transport side"
good,at verizon there is a good work / life balance as there's the option to do home office at mangers' discretion. there's a  lot of carreer / learning opportunities as well
good,"All aregood to work over her friends,colleauges,workplace managing all good.Its good to work and very good environment."
good,upbeat environment with a lot of young talent. Great opportunity to make a living but the ceiling for advancement isn't very high. I learned a lot though
good,"Verizon underwent recent changes to seating capacity in NJ location.  Great improvements to desks and office space. "
good,"Verizon has changed in recent years and has become a high stress, highly volatile environment. There is a separation of quality and quantity - management's goal is to push as much out the IT door with little consideration on the impact to end users."
good,"Great place to work, great co-workers, stressful but still rewarding, company vehicle, laptop, cell phone, great pay, training, vacation and benefits."
good,Inconsistent between Corporate Locations and Customer Care causing many issues.Great pay overall. Lack of training for both store and customer care representatives.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Handled customer inquiries and issues sold value of  Verizon products and services  good pay and benefits can be stressful management not always helpful can be boring and repetitive
good,i enjoy to work in this company and enjoy to talk to customers. i have leaned how to managed a store and how to train the new person. Every month. out team will finish out target as soon as we can
good,Great company to work for. Fast paced. Good money if you know how to sale. Love the competive atmosphere. May be hard to get promoted unless it’s within your own store.
good,"A typical day at work: Come in at 9 am and pick up where you left off at from the previous day. around 11 am there would be meetings to attend. After the meeting you get an hour lunch break. Come back in at 1 pm. Go into another teleconference meeting for about an hour and a half. Then you would be able to get back to your work. Around 4:30 there would be another meeting that usually last until 6 pm. Then you would begin working again until 7."
good,"My time at GTE was the best -- great company, great management, good compensation.  Very loyal employees and management!"
good,"Generally, the corporate culture was to provide the best service and the customers would come/stay."
good,"You had to work all day when there was an Apple phone being launched, you would have to attend mandatory meetings every 3 months about 30 mins away from the store you worked at which sometimes it would be farther then where you lived."
good,Great job if you don't want to see your family at. very very very long hour and no extra help. Many divorces happened while I was there and drug abuse was also common
good,it was a good company to work for. The company is looking for ways for people to work harder and get rewarded less. Upper management can't even sell the product they push
good,Good overall experience at Verizon.I enjoy meeting new people and going the extra mile to make customers happy. I am ready to move on and ready for new opportunities.
good,"Boring job, hard to get things done quickly."
good,Many tasks to be completed at the same time at any given time. A pretty demanding work environment but rewarding when accomplished on time. Management and pay quite fair.
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"Great people work here and most times, what's expected of you is attainable. Often your goals and targets will be changed or moved or done away with completely. The carrot on the stick keeps moving and 90% of people who work there will never get a bite."
good,A good place to hone your skills as a network professional.  Hours can be long depending on the project and overall workload.  Exposure to many new concepts and technologies.
good,"I worked at Verizon for four years, and I thought the benefits were outstanding--the upper level district and regional managers were very sharp for the most part--they actually listened--and many took action to try and help those in true need of something at their store."
good,"Company is trying to transform into what it wants to be beyond a wireless carrier (cloud?, security?, telematics?, wholesaler?, etc) and is struggling with a vision, resources, and org structure to make it a reality. Several re-organizations over last few years so job security has frequently been a question. Often delayed response to competitors caused by management's concern that acting would result in not meeting …"
good,"you have to love call centers to do well in a verizon call center. it busy, stressful, and overwhelming. The benefits are top notch but you will work for them."
good,"Contractually Verizon agreed to have a Verizon employee on site to Provide support to ExxonMobil, in exchange for preferred provide status. Although a plus for the customer, not the most idea for an employee. I reported to Atlanta, Ga, although officed in Houston, Tx."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, I also enjoyed the location it was near public transportation which saved me money.  The compensation and benefits were great."
good,"Having worked for Verizon for 11 years I had never intended to leave. With the cell phone industry being as competitive as it is these days the company has lost the employee focus it had in years past and has continued to reduce the direct employee workforce as of late. Multiple customer service center closures and retail sales streamlining have left thousands of loyal employees jobless. If you can find a position that is stable or are able to relocate from center to center as they close them you will be compensated appropriately and will be provided with great medical, dental, vision, 401k, and cellular discounts."
good,Verizon is a good place to work as long as you are in the inner circle or close to a key player of the inner circle. This is a a place that if you have good connection the quality of your work does not matter. The pay is above industry standards
good,Working for verizon allowed me to make enough money to pay my current bills and get me out of debt. I love working with my team and working together to meet individual quotas and store expectations.
good,"typical day was opening store, completing compliance reports, maintain demo's on floor, check in and store all inventory. Support sales team and customers when needed. There really wasnt anything hard about job. Diversity was the great thing about the culture. It was hard to advance if you werent a sales person which they say we all are in the retail store. Being there for 17yrs I guess I earned the flexiblity that I had but meeting new customer, co-wokers and helping the management with our team and winning was very enjoyable. Unfortunately that ended with company wide lay-offs."
good,"Took calls supporting software and hardware issues in the Lucent/Alcatel 5ESS Switch."
good,Although we all have our own commissions to attain your peers are willing to assist with coaching one another in areas that you may be lacking or need improvement.
good,"Great place to work!  Benefits are top notch.  You can make good money if you're willing to work hard.  Difficult to move up past a certain level, but immediate opportunities are available."
good,"Verizon can be a wonderful place to work, it has cons like long hours and working on holidays but with that can come some very good benefits. The company pays very well."
good,"I am fortunate to have an excellent manager who cares and respects for people, and set a good example in daily life.  I missed the colleagues there, then reunited with some of them in my new job."
good,Great company to work at but organization was sent overseas. Rehired a s contractor no benefits half the pay. No paid vacation. With kids in College not the ideal situation.
good,"I am appreciative of the opportunity I had working at Verizon, because they had excellent benefits, like the tuition reimbursement that I used to help me finish my degree."
good,"If you can manage the hours & stress of sales, Verizon will reward you in accord. They take good care of their employees, and offer first rate benefits."
good,"Fast Paced work place, competitive atmosphere. Can be stressful. wasn't very accommodating for my hearing disability. Had to take Long Term Disability."
good,Good place to get your feet wet in the sales game.  Make sure you make it too work as they don't like call in's.  Must HUSTLE at all times and it is a cut-throat place to work.
good,"Verizon is overall a great company to work for. Lots of bonuses available, great work - life balance, competitive atmosphere, room to grow with the company. Management was inconsistant but overall good."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Part of a team responsible for the maintenance and operation of Verizon owned and leased fiber transport circuits of 10Gbps or larger; transport circuits were comprised of LIT services and DWDM equipment. Our team also worked with other departments to assist with workloads, troubleshooting, and various other tasks during downtime."
good,I love the Verizon culture. Overall the company is diverse and positive. The job is challenging and rewarding with great benefits for the employees. I like the job because I like to communicate with customers and co-workers.
good,Great place to learn and develop sales technique. Although the industry is becoming saturated Verizon is adapting to that trend so job security is a concern with recent layoffs and downsizing.
good,The Division was innovative and hard working.  Pursued a multi-million contract with the Federal government.  Corporate management was not forward thinking and turned down the opportunity. The healthcare division was sold to another corporation and staff was laid off or sent to the purchasing organization.
good,If you're great at sales then the pay is fantastic and the raises are worth while - bonuses too! The benefits are fantastic and the discounts are great. Awesome company to work for as long as you don't mind long work hours and no weekends off.
good,"Verizon is very organized and structured. Great place to work for single people with out children. High energy environment can be stressful at times. Workplace culture has a good team vibe, with healthy competition. The only cons come from workalike balance especially during the holidays. This is typical in retail. Advancement is difficult as well."
good,Day to day selling phones at a fast pace. The hardest thing is to get customer to buy accessories for their expensive phone.Managers are great at helping you to close a sell. Working with good coworkers & customers
good,Great company to work and make good money. If you are a people person or sales driving you will do well. Just keep your cool and enjoy the ride. You will love it or hate it.
good,"Verizon is a fine company to work for, but they don't understand the saturation in the market and expect unreasonable numbers from their sales reps. This goes up nearly EVERY month and your paychecks decrease."
good,"This was a very competitive job, which requires you to interact with multiple clients. You must build your client base to increase revenue. Selling is the main priority."
good,"Verizon has a great working atmosphere, they love to promote if you're willing work hard."
good,"Upward mobility, impressive compensation and benefits packet. Vast opportunities to advance in career.  Better work life balance needed with schedules."
good,When working at a call center all you are is a cog in the machine. Numbers need to be met and you are just a number.  No one was allowed to make a creative decision.
good,"great atmosphere and people, understanding managers and very fast paste. loved everything about this job. it was amazing wish i didn't have to make  military move to still work here."
good,"I spent 10 years in the wireless business. I worked for the 4 major carriers. Verizon by far took the best care of their employees. From benefits, to upgrade eligibility, and most importantly pay. My first month on the floor they ran a spiff and my commission check was 5000. While I didn't see that again 3300 was a fairly common occurrence. The managers I had genuinely cared. They understood that the job was stressful and if you needed a day off they would do their best to give it to you."
good,During my time with Verizon dial tone/landlines diminished drastically and emphasis became increasingly more on providing internet broadband service. Increased technology and less depth in technical support.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This company does a lot to try and foster growth within.  They offer on location training as well as remote and even give tuition reimburstment if the course is business related.  Even with this available though there are places that do not have leadership that helps foster that growth and can be a little daunting to find just where to start when it comes to climbing the ladder.
good,"There wasn't a lot of opportunities to advance in this position and those that were offered, weren't that attractive.  Not a difficult place to work at, but one can only last so long as a customer service representative at a call center."
good,Overall good experience and can recommend the people who has good zeal to perform well in a challenging work culture and can provide flexibility in working hours
good,a typical day at verizon usually consist of helping out customers with their mobile devices and also educating them on new services and technology. helping customers one day at a time.
good,"Its retail, its retail hours. The pay and benefits are great. As in any technology company change is swift and often. Biggest complaint would be some of the management. Occasionally you encounter a seasoned rogue manager that thinks they own the company. Which in turn can potentially create a negative environment. Otherwise great place to work"
good,"Verizon does have a lot of SLA's involved, however, if you are willing to put in the work, they have job advancement opportunities.  They consist of every department a person may want to go into and also have an annual bonus."
good,Verizon is a wonderful company to work for.   workers are friendly and family like.   the hardest part was sitting down all day. I have learned to be patient with customers.   Management was nice and coached everyone with the best of there ability.  In this department i liked how we could trade work days and hours with our co-workers. I was moved around to different offices and positions without a choice which is difficult when raising a family with young children.
good,I relocated from another center and was treated very differently.  I honestly thought I would spent the remainder of my working life at VZW but the change in culture and management attitude was more than enough to make me hit the road.
good,"Love working here, it has a very friendly atmosphere but it could use some improvements. The building is often dirty with broken elevators, no free coffee/drinks provided, very little room for promotion."
good,"I have been with this company for almost 4 years. The store atmosphere is great, I have a great crew working with me, and have a great District Manager. Being here this long I have seen a lot of changes not only on how we get paid, but a lot of changes with upper management, I personally have been through 6 different District Managers, which is not a good thing,  I have seen Sales Director's quit and be demoted with company changes. I would suggest to promote stability in compensation and upper management,  from the store and employee view, looks like a lot of chaos, pay structure always changing,  once employees start making good money on one comp plan it changes and is never for the better. Make employees want to be promoted and have stability in their pay and job security."
good,company was excellent to work for but that has changed. now the union is pretty weak and management runs  roughshod over its employees..excellent insurance and 401k matching has steadily became worse
good,"The thing I love the most in working for Verizon is that I get to work with people much younger than I. It made me bacome more open minded and not so stiff as I was before. "
good,This company is all about making profits by selling their services. It is a commercial company to it is very fast paced. Culture is good but pay can be subpar. Overall decent company to work for.
good,"a lot of opportunity for advancement, but poor leadership at most director positions and beyond. Spoken publicly the focus is on customer service, but through performance reviews and metrics it is a much different story"
good,"Great company, great training, great benefits. Aggressive sales targets, Verizon pricing structure is challenging to sell against "
good,"Verizon Gives you good benefits and pay. However, work/life balance have falling off. Management team will support as much as they can to ensure that you are able to have a work/life balance."
good,"Stable and sound company. Between the union and labor laws, equal pay for equal work whether you are Female or Male. Which is unusual these days. Great benefits."
good,"The pay is pretty good, the benefits are very good. Hours scheduled with someone with a family are not easy. A lot of nights and weekends which means away and missing family events. The quota is attainable and if good at your job can make great money."
good,"I enjoyed the marketing aspect of my job, was fun getting out in the community and interacting with other businesses in the area and working with community leaders."
good,good management great enviroment decent pay advancement is available but difficult due to the fact of people tenure with the company and they have first dibs at management postions
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon likes to relocate employees around the country.  Not everyone is in a position to move to another state (family obligations, job certification)."
good,"This was a really fun job. My coworkers became like a second family which made going to work less of a chore. The pay was good, but the hours  were long."
good,"Fast paced was one way to look at it. Managers were great, and your co workers became family. They changed so much I dont even know if its still the same way as it was when I worked there."
good,"Great company with great benefits!  Every week your work hours and workdays will be different.  Three out of four weekends will be spent working.  The workplace culture is great!  It is all about 'the team'.  Making quota is essential for job security.  You will be working with educated, enthusiastic people.  Every day is different with different challenges.  I have enjoyed working for Verizon."
good,Verizon is a fun place to work and management are very supportive and treat you as family. Advancement is a challenge as different department in different states are not very receptive to hiring someone within the company from another department in a different state for the most part.
good,"Weeded productive resources, letting productive contributors fend for themselves in the larger world.  Frustrating, but this is the current direction in the corporate world"
good,"When I started in 1966, this was a highly respected company to work for.  Our parent company was AT&T. My company then was known as Bell Telephone. Then became Bell Of Pennsylvania .  Then Bell Atlantic .  Then Verizon communications.  It was a reliable company producing a Quality reliable product .  we had very good benefits with reasonable work schedules .My job required a basic knowledge of electricity. The company helped me develop a good work ethic and sent me to good company schools to prepare me to work on various types of equipment. Since I have been away from this kind of work and this type of work environment I could not give a reasonable assessment of the company and what they are like to work for now."
good,"While the leadership tries hard to include activities to make life at work more fun, it is challenging to get anything to work as employees have different shifts and at time not able to participate due to short lunch break leaving little time if any to participate"
good,"Typical workday was working 7-5, participating on conference call, analyzing and monitoring trouble tickets."
good,"Great managers, work life balance but it's very corporate and layoffs happen a lot  if company is not doing well on Wall Street.  You will get good pay and a bonus at Manager level."
good,"Great place to work, there were lots of opportunities for moving jobs internally.  At the time the location was perfect, we were located by DFW Airport and could park at work if we needed to travel."
good,Great company to learn multiple facets of the organization. There were growth and incentive opportunities to motivate individuals  within a fast paced environment.
good,"Morale is very low especially with 2 layoffs per year on average."
good,"The compensation is great as well as the environment. However, the management isn't as great. It is very hard for me to manage my home life with work,"
good,"I loved the 27 years at the phone company.  Had a great run, 5 promotions in my career there.  When the merge came with Verizon, entire new game.  Verizon was all about the money and not the employees.  very sad."
good,I loved this job. However the grave yard shift at the time was not for me. This was the only hours available so I needed to seek other employment. The staff is great.
good,I loved working for Verizon Wireless. I worked for them for almost 4 years. Unfortunately my tenure was cut short do to some lay offs in November 2016.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Not as good as previous companies that it acquired. Current trajectory is unknown due to bad decisions by upper management who are not familiar with state
good,"Must be a people person. If you don't like people, This is not a right fit. You are dealing with a lot of clients trying to find solutions to their communication needs  Most of the long time supervisors are great. Senior mangers are great. "
good,"fast paced position and must have to motivation ever day to bring it. I learned the harder you work and the more time you put in the results will follow. Everyday was a little different from the other you must be ready for a slow day , to days were there are so many customers you had to be very efficient to keep everyone happy inside the store. Work life balance was the hardest part of the position. What you put in directly showed your results."
good,"Had the opportunity to work with identification printing machine called a NISCA Printer and used image editing software to edit images for printing on new badges. "
good,"The IT support staff are great people to work with who really care about making a difference in the customer experience. Like any global company, there has a been a shift to offshore job roles, If a job can be shipped offshore cheaper, the executive team will likely try to move it."
good,it was a good job no complaints just need more money at the time and wanted to relocate...  Thought about going for a managers position but seems a bit stressful
good,liked working with employees in developing them and helping them gain various achievements. fast paced environment. i enjoyed that other supervisors and / or leadership would routinely ask for my input or assist with the hiring process. sales and goal driven
good,"One of the best companies I've worked for, but I don't want to do sales any longer. Working retail the hours are tough, especially being a single parent. Plus I am looking for something that is more stable. The past few years, there has been a lot of lay offs. I'm looking for a permanent position."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon as a Solutions Specialist. The work/life balance wasn't great, but the job itself was fun. I enjoyed my coworkers and customers and the compensation was more than fair. The insurance was also stellar. "
good,"Worked with a team that was motivated and eager to learn in a busy working environment.  Co-workers and managers were pleasant, easy to work with and helpful which made day to day challenges easy."
good,"A typical day at work consists of installing and troubleshooting both residential and commercial voice, data, and video services. I have taken away good skills when it comes to troubleshooting data circuits, hubs, switches, routers, optical network terminals, and physical cabling. The workplace has a good environment and we all work together as a team. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be the physical aspect. There are times when we have to be very physically involved in order to complete the work. The most enjoyable part of this work is furthering my IT knowledge. Every job is different and I learn something new. I continue to enhance my skills every day on the job."
good,"I am very thankful for the opportunities Verizon gave me through the years with the company. I made a lot of good friends and learned a lot about technology. I held various positions within the company and ill say, its all what you make it to be. If you can balance aggressive work ethic with amazing customer service you'll be fine. It's not a place to park and collect a paycheck. Ideally you need to be career minded as well. Verizon gives you all the tools to succeed but you have to own your career and utilize them. Very corporate structure but opportunities for advancement are plentiful, especially if your willing to relocate. Over all a very good company and it you are mentally strong, take ownership of your career and don't mind the retail hours you'll be successful."
good,I enjoyed this position within the company. It is hard work and does require a lot of training and knowledge. There are some days with a lot of down time and other days that are jam packed with tasks to complete.
good,"Great Job with a big focus on metrics and less on family/work balance. Was very difficult to keep a marriage together as a retail GM. Otherwise, great for a single person."
good,"The company is huge on training and development. Tools and resources are great. Currently, my work day is to support our sales organization thru account servicing, complex issues, sales driven account activations and customer training and development."
good,"After working for  Verizon for 5 years I was hesitant to move on.  There is a lot of corporate bull, but all in all it is a secure job with a good paycheck.  The store I worked in had great management.  I wish now that I could go back and work for them again."
good,"Fast paced work environment sometimes stressful but makes days go by quickly. Work culture, everyone is willing to help you. Must be willing to learn all job aspects, sales, customer service, technical service, operational procedures. Good benefit packages and are often rewarded for excellent performance."
good,would strongly recommend to everyone. Hardest part of the job was work and life balance however great opportunities to learn and grow. Good compensation
good,"great place to work, no complaints aside from last team leader who had a very negative outlook about everything which greatly impacted the energy level of the entire team"
good,Time passes fast.  Nice working environment.  Coworkers are teamplayers and the schedules are flexible.  Manager is very understanding and easy to work with.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I learned many things from Verizon. The work culture is good. No pressure at all and good support from the colleagues. I enjoyed myself working with the Verizon. Great place to work.
good,"you can never do anything right, it is a managers job to find what you can improve at even if it is above their goals. having to find those words that make it on a thin line from lying and getting customers from saying no to the product you are offering. very stressful job but you get compensated great and great benefits. schedule sucks but you have plenty of vacation time they give you"
good,"Good place to work, decent opportunity outstanding benefit package. Verizon Wireless goes out of it's way to recognize employees and takes employee feedback seriously to drive change within the business."
good,". Check state of the business."
good,I started as a customer service representative and worked my way up to a senior analyst position.  I've also held a consultant position for over 3 years with the company.  Verizon has great growth opportunities for those who are willing to relocate.
good,Verizon has many trainings to advance self into management.  They do have many weekends and night time hours that can conflict with family time.  Verizon has cut down on man power which has given others odd hours to work.
good,"I started as a sale representative. I enjoyed the position, my direct reports and colleges. Although the days were long at times it was enjoyable and worth the effort most times. As time went on it seems the company changed its focus from our customers and maintaining a peaceful consistent work environment to being all about numbers. This shift  plus the commission adjustment (for the worse) made being in sales almost unbearable). The demands became greater as the compensation decreased. The moral was down and everyone was suffering. I soon became a manager and things didn't get much better. "
good,Great company to work for but at times difficult to advance. As with most jobs it comes down to who you know. Besides that the pay and overall compensation is very good
good,"Helped open store"
good,"The culture is great at Verizon, however there has been a recent decline in overall morale, as the organization is struggling to maintain the industry lead that it once enjoyed."
good,"Verizon retail is a quick paced team experience. Dealing with new mobile equipment and technologies it can be like working in a toy store. Personal experience would depend on your fellow workers and committed they are to a team environment, but overall, its combination of pay and excellent benefits make it a fun place to work."
good,Great environment to work! Changing culture ensures new innovation and collaboration with various cutting edge technologies. Typical day is organized and flexible. Learnt to interact with different levels of management. But the hardest part of the job was getting direction about the company due to its M&A activities. Enjoyable part was the campus.
good,"Verizon's IT staff are very good; work was very engaging and enjoyable. This was back in 2010, former co-workers (still at Verizon) have spoken of increased job insecurity following changes included an increased reliance on outsourced IT functions."
good,Fun place to work that had great benefits. But the company eliminated several positions that resulted in three people being laid off in my store including myself.
good,"As a part timer it was enjoyable, but they didn't have goals for a part timer and excepted as much from a part timer as they do from a full time employee. Otherwise the job was easy going and the people were nice."
good,IF it was available I would return to work with Verizon. I would look to work outside of retail but this is a great company for a college graduate. Great benefits and training to move forward.
good,It was a place where I learned many new things and also had a lot of fun. I learned few tricks on automation testing and that still helps me. Team building importance was realized by working with this client.
good,A large company with lots of resources for travel and training.  Actual environment such as telecommuting changes daily based on the mood of the VP of the group.  One day they feel everyone should be in the office even though the team is spread across the US.  The next day there is an issue with real-estate so folks share cubicles and work in the office 2 or 3 days a week.  Work-life balance is great as long as you have good work ethic and get your work done.
good,"you are rewarded for your work. great benefits and employee perks.  pay could be more aligned with responsibilities. culture is starting to change, more micro management, overall its a positive work environment"
good,"I got an opportunity to learn and work on different technologies like Oracle PL/SQL, AngularJS along with Java / J2EE technologies. Encouraged to participate events likes VES Worldwide hack-a-thon evens."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I worked for Verizon before and I enjoyed the job. However, most of time you will get micromanaged by managers especially if you're in retail. I would still encourage people to try it because work benefits are awesome and the actual job sometimes."
good,"Hard to advance within company without relocating. Leadership teams in local office are quite dysfunctional. Overall good company to work for, great benefits, solid culture, and good work life balance."
good,"Verizon is overall a good place to work. The pay is subpar from comparable positions at other companies, but they make up for it with really good benefits. The work environment is pretty relaxed, and I rarely had to work more than 40 hours per week."
good,My day started out with a conference call on most days at home or whether I was there. Then looking at my commissions statement to see where I was and where I needed to be. When I got to work I usually had a quick meeting with my staff to ensure they knew what we needed on a daily basis. After that I would spend time on the floor(80%) and the rest of the time in my office.
good,"After working at Verizon I have had an overall good experience. The pay, benefits and training all lived up to and beyond my expectations. Work life balance is very poor, however this is expected for working in retail. Management is for most part very good at what they do and quite likable. Advancement, depending on your location, can be easy or difficult."
good,"Very fast pace environment but also very rewarding. Potential to make a lot of money. Management are very encouraging and help when you ask them for help!"
good,Overall a good employer. Stayed up to date on all new cellular technologies. Verizon is very goal oriented and profit driven. It is a very diverse job place. The pay and benefits are above average for this market.
good,"XPO is a place where you can develp a core group of skills that will help you in your future career if your open to listening, learning and applying new concepts to business."
good,This is the one that got away. I loved every day I worked. It took a long time to decided to leave and start my own business because I loved this job. Come work and prosper.
good,"Stresful but benefits are good"
good,Fast paced and challenging work environment.  Enjoyed the time I worked for the company.  Limited opportunity for advancement.  Not having a set schedule affects the work life balance.
good,Not always as attentive to employees as necessary but good compensation for the most part.  There is a decent chance at advancement but management required college degree and they don't consider experience without one
good,"great experience with the company overall. competitive management salary, good relationship with upper management. The most enjoyable part was getting to know who your employees were outside of Verizon."
good,Buckle up because it's fast paced. Small window to offer up accessories. Learn the system so you can offer more accessory sales potential. Learned more in's and out's as I was heading out the door. Learn quickly and you'll do well
good,"Verizon has amazing benefits: paid tuition, great health care the first day you start training, 401K, stocks, and so much more; problem is you really don't have time to use ALL those benefits. Hours can be long on a retail level. You work most holidays, so the work/life balance is always a struggle. The pay is great but it gets old, and it's difficult to change positions especially promotion wise unless you're killing it in sales or know someone. Overall, wonderful company to work for, but you can feel stuck after some years and burnt out if you're exactly where you started 5 years ago."
good,"Great compensation and benefits. You do have to have a natural sales ability to really perform well. However, if you are willing to work hard they have an astounding support network and training program to elevate your skill set."
good,"Stale management unwilling to listen to fresh minds, "
good,"Cool place to work for with right work life balance but if you are a fresher then the pay package might not be brighter and the yearly increments might be at stake."
good,"My role for the company is to provide support and data analytics for the team. The goal is to help them improve their performance, overcome challenges and to continue promoting the positive cultures impacting performance.  I learned that success can be achieved with hard work and dedication by working wisely. The management has been great with minor areas of improvement, the people around are cooperative and are working as a team. The tough challenges are of those urgent client demands but these obstacles are easy to resolve with team work. Working as a team, looking at each others back are the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,This is one of those companies where you can be top performer and still not catch any slack. They are constantly on your tail. They are constantly coaching you on things that don't really matter. My Supervisor even admits that I can be doing perfect but the culture there is to always give something to improve on which is a pain because I am always working as hard and meticulously as I can to please everyone.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I loved my job while I was employed at Verizon. I enjoyed working with the customers that I had on a daily bases. The staff is amazing! I know everyone says stuff like ""everyone is so close its like a family"" at the store I worked at it was literally like that. I haven't worked there in a year now and I still have some of them randomly contact me just to see how things are going. The managers are the best managers Ive ever had. They go above and beyond to make sure you have everything that you need. If you don't feel comfortable with anything, doesn't matter what it is. They will help you with it. The only thing that I would say is advancement in the company isn't very good. You can advance you just have to work even when you are home. I was promoted but I felt like a worked an additional 40 hours taking calls and texts from customers after my 40 plus hour work week was over. I was never ""off work"". That was my choice though and it paid off in the long run because I did advance but just know you will need to really prove yourself to make it happen."
good,"days always went quick. enjoyed training and working with great employees and customers. quotas can be tough sometimes but mgmt understands. Yes, its a competitive atmosphere, but alot of nice people work there."
good,"good team work atmosphere,training always available,flexible work schedule,opportunities for advancement if willing to relocate,assisting customers with technology needs very rewarding,stressful to meet quota expectations,very diverse workplace and great bonus opportunities"
good,I was a contractor at this position.  My co-workers were very nice.  The hours were set contract hours.  There was not much offered in the way of overtime.
good,"Fiber transport and equipment on line and in person training provided.  "
good,"Verizon is a fast paced pace company to work for, providing all the necessary tools and training that makes any candidate and employee successful.Some options to relocate all over the U.S"
good,"Title explains the most of it. The store culture and management  team at my location are top notch, not everyone is so fortunate. This is a fast-paced job with competitive pay and benefits. The metrics and expectations for sales people can be at times lofty and difficult to attain."
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for that offers outstanding benefits and compensations. The company has recently started heading in a different direction that I foresee being catastrophic for it employees.
good,Experience at Verizon is a good one overall. Keeps you in touch with the ever changing world of technology.Most enjoyable part of the job is the interactions with people from all walks of life on a daily basis. Gratification in helping people find solutions to their technological needs.
good,Overall Verizon is a good company to work for. I worked for one of their marketing firms that handled alot of the field work. I say the hardest and most rewarding part of my job was to keep our customers from switching to another provider.
good,"Good start for a full-time job. Hourly and commission, which put you in charge of your income. Friendly staff, very home like environment. Sales orientated , must meet goals to work there."
good,days a filled with many facets. i've many things but current manager should not be running a store. my coworkers value the work i do and I will miss them
good,Overall good place to work.  Good work-life balance.  Good benefits.  Opportunities to collaborate with co-workers and move laterally within the company.  Good opportunities for advancement if you are willing to move into new areas within the company.
good,"Can be stressful and intense most days. Important to stay to yourself and don't become a victim of the ""high school environment"". Great promotion opportunities"
good,"Verizon paid well, benefits were great, I got good bonuses, my manager was very good, my lead was excellent.  Because I was in a remote office there were very few job advancement opportunities available to me."
good,There are many options for any individual to explore within the organization.  In retail you will learn a lot about handling a variety of clients and will have to adapt to many different personality types.
good,"Working here provides excellent medical benefits, although the competitive work environment and sales pressures can become hard to work under. There is also not a lot of opportunities to be promoted to new positions."
good,The people that I work with are very focused on getting things done and delivering.  My peers and staff are very hard working and focused on solving problems.
good,"Invest in your customers and create a five minute friend to ensure best customer satisfactory and minimal returns. It was fun and always changing, got to sell a lot of products and set up accounts"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Verizon, I excelled in sales well past my co-workers. Management is very controlling. They expect you to act like a robot and talk to everyone the same and in my opinion thats not how you accomplish sales these days. People/Customers like to be talked to like they're normal and thats why I accomplished what I accomplished in my opinion. Job Security is non-existant and management and District managers are always changing thus making their policy and expectations change monthly it felt like."
good,"Learning opportunity everyday"
good,I love working for Verizon. I just want higher pay. The culture is perfect. It is not stressful. Management is realistic and have your back. I work from home and everything is very flexible.
good,"My time at ADP has been very resourceful and beneficial to me professionally and personally.  It has given me the experience and knowledge to grow in the sales field while also maintaining a great work-life balance.  There is limited growth opportunity, however,  and I am looking to expand my role sooner rather than later.  Overall, a great place to round your skills and develop the techniques that can be used to be successful in any environment."
good,Good pay and benefits but the atmosphere is lacking. Good place to work but I got burned out. It's a good place to work for for a few years and build experience
good,"Great culture, technologically advanced and supportive. Regular hours, cutting edge, excellent benefits. Location dependent."
good,"Friendly, customer based work. Everyone got along, and we encouraged each other to meet bother personal and customer based goals. Incentive programs were good."
good,Verizon is an excellent organization to work for. For the technical support role it is inbound call taking address customer issues. It does take someone with a lot of patients to do the job. The job is more for individuals that want to focus on customer service rather than support
good,"Excellent pay and dynamic place to work, however the culture may consume you as you advance through the ranks. Long hours, high pressure expectation often follow suit."
good,The wireless industry is pretty ruthless with Verizon not being much different. Pay is good and benefits are great as well. As in any sales job you must show results or be replaced
good,"Cellular Sales relies on market managers to run their markets as if they owned it. The workers are all contractors with their own business licenses, and the business is paid rather than the individual. As long as you are willing to put in the hours and are dedicated to selling, you will do well."
good,Verizon Wireless has always been a leader in the telecom industry. They have worked closely with numerous vendors developing new advances in technology.
good,"Great company to be at."
good,Great benefits and training.  When your client leaves or reduces service and you are affected the company does not attempt to place you on a new contract.
good,"Again, the call center is a tough environment by its nature. However, I gained valuable customer service experience while employed at Verizon. I was a call center associate for 4 years, then I became a call center supervisor. The room for growth was great."
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon for  the most part but I didn't enjoy the pressure they put on you to sell stuff to customers no matter what.  The managers wanted you to come and get them before the customer left if they were not getting an accessory like a case and screen protector.  Plus you had to show them a lot of other stuff.  Half the time the customer was upset about their bill to start with and the managers wanted you to sell them more stuff.  I didn't like that.  Corp didn't approved of this and they sent out memo about it and I told the manager I wasn't going to pressure customers to buy stuff they didn't want.
good,"After working for the company 19years, my dept was moved to frontier communications. Once we switched to frontier, the business went down and several people lost their jobs."
good,Great place to gain knowledge of contact center operations. Great place to advance quickly based upon your performance.
good,Great Company CEO is big on Holidays and Payed Off time.  Family is first with this company.  They just want the job done on time and no excuses about its not done on time.  They work long hours and pay good for it.  Networking Engineering and Information Technology data is there money maker.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Management at Verizon was phenomenal. The atmosphere was always great. Friendly staff and customers. A typical day involved helping customers find a phone or other electronic device that fit his or her needs.
good,The company pays very well and has fantastic health benefits. They offer lots of opportunity for career growth and tuition reimbursement.
good,"Great place to work. Not too much advancement opportunities though. The training program is very thorough, and they teach you a lot about how mobile phones and networks operate."
good,"Never a dull moment, collaborative culture, a great environment to work at. Individuals working in Verizon feel very appreciated, however, it does not seem coherent the way professionals are trained and then let go."
good,"Great place to start job and manifest into a career.  Great place for working mothers and fathers, due to the unmatched benefits.  Excellent customer service focus, achievable performance agreements, and a leadership team with the know-how to execute all targets and goals to success."
good,"Amazing benefits and job advancement opportunities, as well as great pay. However, overall experience varies from store to store; your  General Manager alone dictates how good your day to day is"
good,"Worked with national retailers at their locations."
good,i learned so much about technology . I was a sales and customer service representative for 10 years. i learned how to trouble shoot all types of wireless devices. i also have to help customers with their bills.
good,"Retail hours"
good,"Compensation and benefits are better then most companies.   People are wonderful to work with. The downside is that the company is going through a lot of reorganization. People are being forced to commute further,"
good,"Working for Verizon was a good experience, you really learn how to deal and speak with all sorts of individuals. Most teams feel like a family and the opportunities for advancement are there, ofcourse some managers will be better than others at developing each employee."
good,"Long hours, high expectations, heavy pressure, but you are compensated well both in salary and benefits.  Upward movement if you are in the right geographical hub - HQ or major offices.  Excellent training. Hard to break from one silo to another i.e. Customer Service to Sales"
good,I was a 20 something year old with no college... And even though there has been many changes that I'm not necessarily in support of; I have learned many skills working for various departments as well gaining the experience and confidence to be a team leader amongst my peers in my current department. Verizon has also afforded me the opportunity to provide a life for myself and my family that I may not have otherwise been able to do so.
good,"It was a great place to work, co-workers had good communication skills and I had a flexible schedule. Also learned how to work quickly and efficiently in a busy work environment."
good,"Love working with team, all in one productive and friendly staff! Amazing clients and family oriented team members! Knows to stay 5 steps ahead of demand."
good,"A typical day at work involves account analysis for customers, finding solutions for their everyday life, and also providing technology solutions to make their everyday life easy. Store culture is positive. the hardest part of my job is finding personalized solutions for different people. I enjoy working with different people and talking to different people. I have learned to work with different people with different cultural background and different needs."
good,"A typical day of work cosisted of going on two to four face to face appointments.  In addition, I secured new business opportunities through cold calling.  I learned a lot about overcoming objections, optimum use of daily time, the keys to closing a sale.  The management was very supportive.  My co-workers and I operated as a true team offering each other with suggestions and knowledge sharing.  The hardest part of the job was commuting a long distance  for one opportunity.  The most enjoyable part  of the job was closing the sale!"
good,"On a typical day, I start my morning accessing the large orders I have and set a plan to get them completed before or by the requested deadline.  I then prep my team, assign and process and until completion or end of day whichever came first.  We stayed busy.My team was dedicated and hard working.  I enjoyed working with each of them.  The hardest part of my day was when I could not satisfy an order due to inventory.  It meant I had to disappoint a customer."
good,"Although I thought the union and management relationship was always stressful, the positions I held were challenging and enjoyable. I met some excellent people and some not so mature one too."
good,Good benefits and compensation. Employees are not shown appreciation and nothing is ever good enough. Very stressful work environment all about nummbers. Low moral and many people are unhappy with their jobs.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Compensation is competitive but you will work very hard for it. Culture is excellent and exhibited and practiced from the top down. Benefits are excellent and cost reasonable. 401k match and profit sharing. Lots of training and professional development opportunities.
good,"Very good company, which does a great job at retaining interns with a competitive salary. Seems to lack growth opportunities."
good,It is a fun career with great co-workers. You learn new things everyday. The management is really good about working with you on schedules.
good,It's a fun filled atmosphere with great co-workers. The management is very helpful with your schedules. You learn how to set up new phones and plans and how to base it off of your customers needs and wants.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this job. It introduced me to the world of tech which has no become a passion of mine. The benefits were awesome, the pay was great and the hours were not bad at all. i do believe that hey don't do a great job at hiring managers and supervisors that cultivate the best in the employees."
good,Overall very fun workplace. Phone calls can be stressful but management is there to help you in any way possible. Very oriented around making the job an exciting place to work.
good,If you like fast paced and good commissions then this is your place. Good benefits and room to move up is always a plus. The salaries are well place but the work/life balance can be a little rough at time.
good,"Great place to work, but unfortunately there was really no job security. We would go through a reorganization almost quarterly. Senior management could be supportive at times."
good,Verizon is a great operator that knows how to run a business.  They are trying to move forward to become more of a high tech company.  They have acquired a few new organization to help them achieve that goal.
good,"I emjoyed my time there. Great company great benefits. I refuse to say anything else but I am given a minimum. I was told that if you have nothing (else) nice to say, then don't say anything at all."
good,good company with great benefits and lots of opportunity for career advancement. very fast paced environment which allows you to learn a lot in a very short time. Like all big companies they are very time and metric focused which does add some pressure
good,It was a very stressful job but the benefits were amazing. I enjoyed the satisfaction of resolving complex customer issues. The hardest part was maintaining all performance metrics.
good,Over all this was a great company to work for. Verizon Wireless offers a GREAT benefits package & AWESOME pay. They have a great diverse atmosphere of team members & management.
good,I love working with the public that is great but l feel that there is no growth potential within my current employer. Time and time again the company looks to the public to hire management. They do not take the performance into account. That is why I am looking for a new position in sales and or management.
good,"Lots of foot traffic made the day go by fast. Great place to work learned a lot of new things, saw the technology world grow."
good,"Coordination with people from different countries"
good,A great place to be in. The work culture and mentor ship practiced in Verizon especially with the management cadre is impeccable. Training on the job is as good as it gets with a fortune 50 company.
good,"Meet new people everyday, nice work environment. Upgrade lines, learn things about  different devices and how they function."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,my colleagues help a lot during my training. the understand the fact each concept was new. order than that i catch up really fast an become one the best employee
good,"Verizon is a very BIG company and in many ways that may be its strength - it is certainly one of its weaknesses as well. Strategic decisions are often baffling to the rank and file and managerial communications are poor."
good,"Great company with good sales compensation, but growth is limited. Managers at the time didn't like being managers. Approve of company, just not management and work balance for them."
good,"If you work hard, you will make great money. Excellent benefits.  Not ideal for person with a family. You have to work all weekends and holidays."
good,Good company to work for. Just stressful post sales process. Made presidents club 3 years in a row but still stressed due to this positon. Changes are made every year. Room for growth.
good,Great place to start your career and blossom in to greater things~!  Management is always seeking ways to increase employee morale and enthusiasm..!
good,High stress job. Pressured by managements lack of caring. Keep a high work ethic at all times without thinking that someone is always looking over your shoulder and you will be ok.
good,"Supervised and monitored overall workflow for the department."
good,"Great company to work for, but the union hierarchy made it a bit difficult to manage a well rounded life. Overall the company had great benefits and perks for great performing"
good,"Over the time I've worked with this company I've been able to learn deal with all types of customers on a day to day basis. I've learned to analyze and gather information from every customer to make a customized recommendation. I've learned to manage a team of 6 representatives. The hardest part of the job was focusing on one single thing at a time, given the fast paced environment. However, I do love the sales experience."
good,Great Place to work and benefits are fantastic. Co-workers are a depth of knowledge and always striving to meet company goals and customers needs.
good,"I worked at VZW for 23 1/2 years, it was a Call Center Environment, Management was very challenging, my Co-workers were nice people to work side by side with, the hardest part of the job was it was repetition and no option for other projects aside from being on the phone, the most enjoyable part of the job was talking with people all day long."
good,"I loved working for the organization. It benefitted me on multiple levels to work with Verizon. Anyone who is looking for a challenging environment, Verizon is a great place for a long term career."
good,"With Go Wireless you gain communication skills, customer service and how to deal with escalations, you also gain customer's trust where they come to you in the future and ask for you because they are comfortable with you and trust you with their account. Management is great and very understanding of your avaialbiltiy and what you need or if you need help with anything. My coworkers are a great team player's we all help eachother out in what we can and help them with customers so that its a great experience and they know were there to help. The hardest part of my job is helping customers that come in and are upset but you try to reason hear them out and help them to the best of your knowledge so that you can resolve the problem. My enjoyable part of my job is knowing that my customer leaves satisfy and happy knowing that she has nothing to worry about and can come back with a worry free experience."
good,"Good Place to work  at Verizon , learned many things in life for balancing the life in all the situations and hope this will help me in placing my self in a good respectable position where ever i go in my life. Thanks to Verizon."
good,Outstanding place to work and build lasting business relationships. It is a very competitive sales environment and commissioned based job. We work in competitive teams to earn trips and other incentives to boost company productivity and extensive financial gain. The most exciting thing about the job is the customer interaction. Knowing that I have provided my customers with one the best and most innovative and reliable networks in the world.   When the customer is happy they tend to stay with the company and refer us to others.
good,"Enjoyed not having to punch into a time clock every day.  I knew my job and wasn't micro-managed.  It was a fun and professional atmosphere to work in.  I learned a lot from the position I worked in, however I feel I had all the skills and doing all the responsibilities as an analyst but still was not compensated or promoted to an analyst.  My management was great, especially the marketing and training organization."
good,"A typical day would be coming in, in the morning with work behind you. Dispatching on either your trouble or installation, calling ahead to see if there will be access. Meeting with the local contact and seeing what they requested is correct and if it will be extended or left in there  telephone room.On repairs asking whats wrong and troubleshooting circuit till resolved. It used to be management knew the job so if you ever ran into an issue they can guide you, not any more in Verizon.Coworkers are fine everyone helps each other out if they need help or assistance, Most enjoyable part of my job was helping and repairing troubles when the customer  has issues."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon allowed me the opportunity to get a Masters degree."
good,"Very little work life balance, but the pay is higher than the industry standards.  You are rewarded for hard work and punished for underperformance."
good,Ability to grow your skills through training and degree cost reimbursement. Great benefits and excellent pay. Not much overtime based on your group. Advancement is usually placed with those willing to move locations. Job culture is okay but could use some revitalization.
good,I've enjoyed working here for the past 11 and a half years. I learned to narrow down my problem solving skills. I've become more proficient in multitasking and customer service.
good,Working as a telecommunications expert for Verizon was a very demanding job. You have to have good performance week each month or you would be fired. For the most part it was a very quick paces there were rare occurrences when we would run out of records. However if you enjoy talking on the phone this is the job for you.
good,"Verizon has grown from its not-so-humble beginnings as a conglomeration of landline, European and start-up telecommunications companies to the U.S. mega company it is today. In the earlier years, there was much room for advancement and innovation and hard work got you moved in and up. Now, it's mostly red tape and politics, as expected from a company in the Fortune 500 Top 20. There is a saying, ""Our best is good enough for today, but tomorrow we'll do better."" That basically meant 12 hour days, weekends, holidays, nights...leaders are ""on"" 24/7. There is no ""down time."" The titles were inflated and the pay excellent, but beware the yearly ""re-org"" purges and giant career sucking sound coming from New Jersey. I do believe senior leaders have a sound, long-term vision for success and the people are earnest."
good,"good place to work. good benefits, great atmosphere. high stress call center environment, management can be very pushy, but overall great benefits and family oriented"
good,its a good company to be apart of and they do a great job of promoting from within. easy to get burnt out and the schedule can be very demanding sometimes
good,"nice company to work for, typical day busy on the phones, learned to take work orders, management was good, co workers was nice crowd, hardest part on the job, trying to collect meter reads for copy machines, the most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy."
good,"Company is continually changing but strives to keep employees happy."
good,Awesome benefits but working retail is a tough work/life balance.  Great opportunity for advancement if you like working sales.  If you get in the right store with the right team work will definitely be a good time!
good,"Data analyst position reviewing health payments from various companies.  You worked on your own accounts.  Most work done individually.  Lots of Rah Rah down time for company unity.  If you get the wrong supervisor who shows favoritism, they can make your life miserable.  The work itself was pretty satisfying."
good,The company has made aggressive investments over the last several years to position itself well for the future.  Market leader in wireless/mobility.
good,"many corporate awards to attract the best of the best"
good,Verizon is a great place to work and is an innovative company. I would recommend them very highly. The company has a pleasant working atmosphere and co-workers are very friendly. The part I liked best is that the company is always changing to keep up with technology so it never gets boring.
good,Constant tracking of percent to goals to ensure you hit your quotas. Fluctuating targets and metrics skew commission month to month. Fantastic benefits.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, and daily deadlines to be met.  Everyday is a challenge because of the volume of payments received each day.  The hardest part of the job is the level of communication.  Most enjoyable part of the job is learning something different and new everyday."
good,"Working for a technology company is great, and the ability to be at the front lines of new implementations is a key factor that I enjoy."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I worked for Verizon Wireless for 6 years. I provided customer service and sales suggestions to our customers. Knowledgeable in current technology communication trends is essential in succeeding.
good,"Overall experience was good.  I found not doing the same thing everyday very satisfying.  I learned how to deal with customers in a face to face manner, by providing excellent customer service."
good,"The company overall is a good company to work for, I enjoyed going to work each day and interacting with my peers.  "
good,"Encouraging environment."
good,"I loved Verizon. I had an unfortunate situation that put me at wits with the company but, I can't complain too much about the overall take away of the company. Professional environment, great pay and benefits."
good,great place to work and advance. some aspects of the job have management that has not moved in over 5 or 6 years. this can create the we have always done it this way vibe.
good,"Good Management, we are secured, my co-workers are approachable specially IT's and Supervisors but can't handle about salary because it's commission base, if i can't produce sales i don't have salary."
good,"A high pressured company with an excessive amount of deadlines, objectives, procedures and standards.  Benefits/pay are good with plenty of chances to learn and develop.  A lot of opportunity to move laterally to broaden your knowledge base; however, minimum opportunity for upward mobility."
good,its a great place to work. great benefits that start on day1. pretty good bonuses if you meet all your metrics. lots of days off but dont take them all at once. great oppertunity to move up within the company.
good,"Great place to work with lots of upward mobility.  The compensation is good, but the hours can be a little long.  Try to work hard and get promoted, or just know that you will burn out eventually.  Nobody works retail forever."
good,Verizon is good work place with a lot of fun and good supportive management. Since it a large company it has a lot of process to get something little done fast.
good,"Working for Verizon Business Technical Support was very challenging. I enjoyed working for them but there were times when I would get very difficult customers and being the sensitive person that I am I realized it was not something for me. But it did help me a lot. At Verizon I learned that the customer can tell a lot by the tone of your voice, that is where I learned the importance of smiling over the phone and of course assuring them that you are there to help them."
good,"It is a lot of fun with co-workers who become like family. Retail hours and overtime is very much required there though, and therefore, there is little to no family time."
good,"was a good call center to work at with paid benefits vacation, union dues were deducted from your check and you knew the union reps by name, and the work hours was great lots of overtime"
good,It's a good job if you're a hard worker. You will travel... a lot. If you don't mind a potentially long commute several days a week then it's great.
good,"A typical day consist of answering inbound call in a call center. How to time managements. My co-workers would say I am a hard worker and productive, open to learning new things. the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
good,A challenging position that frequently changed along with the technology used.  The coworkers were awesome but working for a large company had its downfalls as well.   Communications sometimes were delayed when rolling out new products etc
good,Verizon Wireless is a reputable and highly professional corporation which makes one feel proud to work there. Management always wants to see you do well and pushed you to do so. Coworkers are always friendly and the environment is exciting at all times.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,very good company to work for overall. people and teams worked well together. working with HQ groups was good experience
good,"Working in the call center can become very stressful. "
good,"It was like a family working in the retail store. "
good,"It's a good place to work if you're just starting out or if you're technically competent but don't have any real skills. Great pay for the work you do, but you're usually talking to angry people all day. Not much room to advance up in the company unless you go management. They do give you the tools to learn new skills on your own time either through their internal learning platform, or through their tuition assistance program; so if you're motivated you can learn your way into a better job. Overall it's a pretty good company to work for."
good,I made a career of the wireless communications industry. I had the opportunity to watch an industry grow from conception.
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon and was planning to spend the rest of my career there. Unfortunately due to company reorganization my position was eliminated.
good,"Overall Wireless To Go, while not without its faults, is a very rewarding employer. The company is small, yet growing nicely. The staff with the exception of a few bad eggs are nice people, and the owner seems to really care about his employees. Biggest issue is the lack of communication at times can be very stressful."
good,"5 jobs per day unless forced based on the ""needs"" of the business is a typical workload. When I originally became an outside technician known as a Cable Splicer the job was more inline with customer service having precedent over a numbers driver. There are two positions for the Outside Plant Technicians; Service Tech, and the Cable Splice who is responsible for the repair, maintenance, and installation of POTS from the Central Office to the end-user. That can  be from above ground work (IE) JUP, or joint use poles which are shared usage between the local power company, the cable company, and the local phone company. Which are the basic utilities companies. I currently work in the Potomac Region which is the largest revenue generator for the entire Verizon footprint. I would say that the company has taken a dramatic fiscal change once the new CEO had taken over who came from Verizon Wireless. I truly understand that businesses are in business to make money, because of the financial promises made to the Stake, and Stock Holders alike. Verizon has been good to me, because it has allowed me to not only work on my degrees, but I have also completed my CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications, and I have completed the Vulnerability Management class, and the (C.A.P.) class. The Certified Authorization Professional class. I also repair, install, and if necessary set DSL networks for the consumer, and small businesses. The Outside Plant Technician position does have a ceiling, and at this time I feel for me, and not just from a financial perspective, but also from a professional"
good,"I was not in the office I worked from home, but upper management treated me fair. I had no issues with any of my co workers. It was a fun place to work enjoyed working for my manager he let us do our job and did not question our judgment calls."
good,"love the management at this jobs got to meet a lot of customers that were very kind, and it is a self owned buisnees which is were i want to be one day so great life experience with that. it was a seasonal job but one that i would love to work at again."
good,I enjoyed meeting new friends and shopping there at the mall that we were next door to.   I also enjoyed talking with customers about there price plans and services.
good,"The atmosphere at the call center was pleasant. The leadership team always created a positive energy that motivated me to succeed. However, relocation is considered an incentive based on stats and attendance; than the need of the employees."
good,"good benefits,the quota keeps on increasing,to keep the job one must achieve 80% of quota and to make extra money one must exceed the quota,which is taxed 40%."
good,"My experience with Verizon was very interesting and fun for the most part. The company has arguably the best coverage and network performance, so although the cost of service is often deemed high, the quality of service would sell itself.  I learned a lot about the different ways to position products and bundle services during sales. I also had to opportunity to meet many unique and interesting individuals, from customers to employees as well. Most days consisted of greeting customers in as they passed by and build value with each sales opportunity. The only difficult aspect of the job was that there were constant changes in store managers, so there would always be a different style of leadership and teaching. Overall, the experience was quite enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working in sales and customer service. My daily routines involved opening and balancing registers,count inventory as well as put all products into inventory. Help customers find the right phone for them as well as other services we provided, such as Internet,Direct TV, Dish,Insurance."
good,"High performance Culture"
good,"It is impossible to get a job directly with Verizon.they were soo soos many many . and yes hynt. no way she said that. i did love that christmas tree. sometimes you should look santa right in the eyeballs. Because he has two and you have two, Some times tou are looking at the prizel"
good,Amazing company to work with.  Gathered a lot of experience and I was very happy to be part of Verizon Business employee for 9 years.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Very good company to work for. Very dedicated to training its employees.  The internal politics of the company seems to be the down side.
good,The environment and co-workers are the best part of the job. If you enjoy working in fast pace atmosphere then this is the job for you.
good,"Before being acquired by Verizon,  the company was known as MCI Telecom.  The company had an exciting and bold strategy....offer an alternative well priced service more competitively against the monolithic At&T.  The job was fun,  not difficult to learn,  face-paced,  and my hard work resulted in great compensation.  I loved almost every aspect of the job.  The hardest part was dealing with the quality of the service and the constant cold-calling."
good,"I liked working for Verizon. Work place was ok. The one thing that I loved about this company was its training, they provided constant, and seminars, on customer, contact, increasing phone sales, data products, and every time a new phone came out there was training."
good,"The team environment at Verizon is great! You are always competing to beat the next store and are constantly challenged every day. The challenging part of the job is dealing with hostile customers. Verizon does pay very well! It rewards its employees with compensation, awards, and vacation packages. I've learned how to communicate with individuals that have different perspectives and tempers. I've learned how to remain calm and think ""bigger picture"" when approaching ideas that may effect the team. I've also learned that the best way to achieve results is through employee development."
good,"working for verizon was tough, but it payed well.  I liked my hours, but the commute was brutal.  Job security wasn't very good sadly."
good,Overall it was great place to work. The hardest part of the job was being pressured my management to try to convince customers to buy more than what they came in to buy.
good,"Overall, Verizon provided a very positive work environment.  Sometimes it would get stressful but, as with all jobs, you have to make the best of it. Management could be great or horrible, all depending on the attitude of the managers.  But they can make or break the morale of the working environment.  In the retail sector, Verizon provides great benefits including good insurance, matching 401K, lots of perks and discounts.  And a big one...they reimburse or outright cover tuition for college, as long as the courses are pertinent to the company!"
good,"Verizon FNFT position, was a good paying position that supplied excellent training for this Tele Comm position."
good,"Working for Verizon has been fun and excited as well as a great way to grow, but I love being in management and usually it takes a long journey to get into just an assistant management position."
good,"Would assist customers as they would come into the store some had questions or problems with their phone, or perhaps looking to upgrade to a new phone"
good,"inbound calls / assisting customers with bills and equipment, troubleshooting there phones, and sales of equip and plans."
good,"I worked for many years, gain lots of experiences in the wireless industry and new technologies.  Was good place to work but too many changes and no training in occasion were not rec'd .  I had good and bad supervisors but over all was a good place to work and very good help out with school."
good,"While at work, I get to response to my co-workers spark to answer any question they may have about a customer account whenever they are unsure. My most typical day at work would be sitting for a long period of time between breaks to keep from losing hours. Whenever I am at work, I enjoy speaking with different people throughout the day who come from different backgrounds, who have different views about the company and some of them who do not speak English real well. When speaking with the ones who do not speak English real well, I have learned to slow down my speech and speak slow to where they would understand, and if they don't I would get them over to a Spanish Representative. Because my job is customer service, the most hardest part of it would be staying calm and be understandable of other people problems."
good,"As a cable splicer I had a great time.  Good pay and regular hours. Couldn't ask for anything better."
good,"Fun, fast pace environment with encouraging team members and leadership. Personal growth and development is the main focus."
good,"A first class voice, data and video company that provided a fine salary and benefits for both management and associate personnel."
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. There are daily challenges with customer escalations and technical issues that have helped to shape me into a more understanding and knowledgeable employee. Management is supportive of your decisions regarding advancement within the company or outside of Verizon. A typical day consists of troubleshooting devices and finding solutions for Verizon customers through sales. The sales team system is one that helps to encourage collaboration amongst team members.
good,typical customer service based retail job that is commission based. great place to work but did not offer stable work hours.
good,"Positive for current department: allowed to work independently, telecommuting, training opportunities, networking between departments."
good,"Typical workday is very high-paced and involves employees being able to wear many different hats (customer service, account management, cold calling, sales, training and support). Must be able to multi-task and have high energy and be able to hold conversations with customers. Those driven will be successful and make a lot of money. Work-Life Balance is non existent and some upper management is out of sync with current industry and telecommunication techniques. Needs to be thorough training and evaluations of direct leadership must be held accountable. Also, listen to direct feedback from front-line a lot of knowledge to be gained from these individuals perspective which will help in process of growing and obtaining quotas. Monitor coaching and feedbacks to keep morale for employees up and have accountability across the board."
good,"This is a very fast paced job. I learned many things here such as not taking things personal. When a customer calls in mad, they are not mad at you, they are only mad at the situation."
good,"Managing 20 or more techs "
good,Needs to ensure message is communicated properly down pipeline from upper level management to front facing employees.

good,"The company has changed a lot over the years from an trickle down money making machine to a very very tight ship. Verizon has cut back tremendously. Closed 4 call centers, laid off over 10% of staff, and has trimmed commissions and bonuses way back in the last 2 years. All while opening third party vendor retail locations and call centers drastically lowering the quality of their service and creating more work for the actual employees. "
good,minacs is a cool workplace. Most employees and Management were really good people. Helping Verizon Wireless Customers helped me build great customer service skills
good,Great cinoabt to work for with their salary and 401k price match.  Verizom wireless has an awesome tuition reimbursement program with a strayer contact inside of the office.
good,"I worked for this company for numerous years, and they were always a fair and good company to work for. Pay was great, the other employees were great, and they were always fantastic about working around schedules. Over the years, however, conditions degraded. Compensation based on commission was slowly degraded, and as management changed, conditions and inner relations started slipping. They are still a good company, and I do hope they isolate the few points that are causing issues, whereas they could turn it around quite easily."
good,"This was a job, that changed practically everyday. The overall commitment to quality customer service never change, but how we approached it and the measures changed as the needs of the customers changed, and along with it technology was in constant change."
good,Verizon definitely focuses OUTWARD on their customers as stated in the credo. They strive to keep the best customer statisfaction alive. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the ever changing environment (Products and Services) while maintaining a steady customer relationship you every so often deal with irate and frustrated customers. You definitely need to know how to balance your outside personal life with your work life when working in the customer service field.
good,overall a great place to work if you dont mind being pressured to sell. high expectations and targets. they make you work hard but they also acknowledge your effort with bonuses at the end of the year.

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"show up to work, create daily sales goals and go over daily opportunities. managers are all over you to sale anything anyway possible."
good,"The typical day consisted of arriving for your shift, setting up tablets, preparing the sales floor, and then assisting customer for the entirety of the day once the store opened. Obviously, as with any retail position, customers could be a struggle. Although the commission goals at Verizon were attainable, often times it was expected you strive for company goals that were not directly related to you pay creating a dilemma for sales reps  to pay themselves, or follow the company. Overall it was a typical retail job consisting of a high pressure commission based sales environment, but offered good benefits, matching 401k, and incentives."
good,"loved my coworkers, great learning experience, hard to move up, no consistency with supervisors, high volume of calls, great benefits"
good,"with my 14 years with Verizon Wireless i learned how best to work as a team player. Most important is to respect co-workers. "

good,"Dynamic fast-paced industry."
good,"It did not seem that the people laying off understood the implications.  I started working at NYNEX, and without changing jobs ended up working for Verizon, with Telesector Resources Group and Bell Atlantic in between.  During the '90's it seemed that they would hire anyone who could breathe, and when they wanted to downsize selected by salary or location, and as a result many of their internal systems stopped working.  I had to monitor the systems that fed mine so that I could tell the people who managed those systems how to keep them running, all because the people who understood them were let go without planning."
good,A typical day at work can be very productive; you can learn alot about the wireless industry if you apply yourself. Management and staff are wonderful and most employees treated each other like family. The hardest part of the job was being able to get a decent shift even if you had 10years seniority. The most enjoyable part was working together with my team.
good,Being a top seller in your store is the goal as well as making your region look good is the goal. I love working and the team at the store is a very close nit group that believes and helps each other out from the manager all the way down.
good,My job is to take inbound and outbound calls. I have follow-ups to complete for my customers. As a team we help each other due to policies are changing. Thinking out of  the box on a case by case basis. I love speaking to the customers and don't take offense to not  so happy customers.

good,"Although working or Verizon is not easy, it is. You only have to remember that the calls are not directed at you, but just anger that has to go some place because the customer is upset with an entity and you are the voice they can scream at. Plus not all the calls are angry ones, some are very simple and sweet. Its great pay, its great benefits and even the company tries to maintain fun at work to give you a break, because the business is serious and what they ask of you is serious business."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,Excellent place to work when you do not take into consideration the poor corporate culture. There are too many politics and advancement is dependant solely on who you know rather than what you know.
good,"Average day at Verizon is up and down depending on the day and what is going on like billing payments, billing disputes, sales, technical issues with phones. I learn a lot as far as dealing with customers and how to handle different scenarios and how to make sure the customer is satisfied. Management can be really hardcore if you are not making quota and doing you're job, if you are they don't bother you. The hardest part of the job is the retail hours and not being with family during the holidays and long hours during the weekends, and not being able to take vacation when you want. The most enjoyable part of the job is making quota and being able to look at the commissions check with a hard work paid off kind of attitude."
good,"Advised customers on all aspects of of Wireless services, resolve billing and equipment issue. "
good,"Enjoyable job, hard work, but satisfying. Great group of fellow employees to work with. Typical day started at the main hookup, proceeded to the customers home. Connected the fiber or ran fiber from the terminal. Installed power, ont, made connections, tested, cleaned up and satisfied customer. Couldn't ask for better co-workers, everyone would help you if need be. Learned something new everyday. Usual corporate management politics for the most part. Local supervisors were good to work with, anything above that and it was hit or miss."
good,"Very upbeat and positive atmosphere in the office. Everyone is energetic and helpful to one another. The hours were very long (9am-8pm) Monday-Friday and 9-5 on Saturdays, and there is a LOT of walking involved. Without a strong personality it may be very difficult to have success in the field. Would recommend only to the truly dedicated and persons who are not tied down by commitments such as family or other employment."
good,Great co-workers and management. Team player or individual accomplishment celebrated.
good,"Unfortunately in the last few years the culture has taken a turn for the worse. Once upon a time leadership looked for thinkers, it appears now they look for yes men.  Great benefits and compensation, but leadership doesn't care about the workers"
good,"A typical day included answering phone calls from the night before, checking Exec. Director's voice mail and email messages and processing anything that needed his attention or mine. Then, there were emails addressed to me to respond to and manage any to-do items in any of the emails. Then work on special projects such as budgets or org charts for the team of 300 folks. There was last minute travel arrangements to make for some directors and meetings to set up. I would look ahead a couple of weeks to see if there were any off-site meetings that any of the directors needed to attend and then make the arrangements for them. But there was always some last minute meetings where directors had to travel and arrangements had to be made. These trips often times included hotels - local and overseas travel."
good,Your goal was to get as many calls per day as possible and acquire the most money. Management was there to help you improve on your skills and is very supportive. Co-workers are always helpful when in need. The toughest part of the job was asking for money from the elderly that were struggling. The most enjoyable part was achieving the calls with people who were unhappy or mad but by the end of the call they were smiling and saying thank you.
good,"I learned a great deal and enjoyed my time as a support representative. helping solve problems for customer devices and training others was very rewarding. Will keep you on your toes as the constant flow of inquiries range in difficulty and time consumption. Some quotas seemed arbitrary, though i do see the upside to meeting and striving for goals."
good,"Working at Verizon requires a very flexible approach to each day. Frequently, there were urgent matters (usually problems caused by our end users) that would need to be addressed as soon as possible. There was also a general need for documentation and organisation of the network that Verizon maintained. These two needs made sure there was always work needing to be done. "
good,Verizon Wireless was a great company for which to work.  The job constantly changed due to the changes in technology and was very interesting.  The work environment was fun. Everyone at work felt as if we were one big family.  It was too bad the company decided to close our center.
good,A typical day at Verizon Business often times involved rapid response to matters for the facilities department ranging from HVAC issues to ensuring that all materials in the copy room were stocked and operational; I'm an energetic individual so having to multitask with competing priorities was a great fit for me. The most enjoyable part of working at Verizon Business was seeing the smiles on my co-workers faces as a result of my efforts.

good,"Verizon is a great company and offer concrete products and services, I've learned to lead my peers to perform beyond expectations. A typical day at work consists of fun, engaging and interactive environment. I learned how to foster superior customer service, and learned how the business model works. I assisted the management on several company projects and services with great integrity. Provided a friendly and systematic environment with co workers to help progress company outlook. The most difficult part of the job was scanning all products in store. The most enjoyable part of the job was to meet new people and serve them with great service and to see them happy at the end of the day."
good,Excellent pay and hours. Benefits could not be beat. People were fun to work with.
good,"Verizon is a great place to hone your customer service and sales skills. You encounter many different personalities on a daily basis and have to learn patience to deal with the general public. To many peoples' surprise, you can earn up to six figures if you are a good salesperson."
good,The department was highly productive and met all deadlines.
good,"I like that Verizon Wireless allows their representatives to move across different channels of the business without much of a hassle. They have many different events and spiffs for their employees to enjoy. The upper management, however, has lost their human touch for the sake of making results."
good,There was a lot of focus on being flexible and working as a team. Management is prepared with lots of trainings and workshops.  The company invests heavily in their employees and helps them to be effective in their corresponding roles.

good,"I was responsible for the following: all of the store inventory"
good,"Being that this was an incoming call center, there was no time to associate with co-workers. This was a fast paced environment and as a representative we only had 30 seconds per call. The hardest part of the job was the split shifts. The most enjoyable part of this job were the customers."
good,"Good pay and culture, my managers were outstanding. Not so great work life balance. Commissions tempt you to be dishonest with customers. Can still make good money and be honest though. Alot of politics involved in advancement."
good,"Management needs to be more understanding and not so hard on their employees.  They constantly monitor all of your calls, which is not bad, but they only bring up your bad calls.  Never your good calls.  Its bad enough you are dealing with angry customers, yet to be criticized by your Manager constantly on everything that you have done wrong on a call is not good for your morale.  Not every Supervisor is like this, yet one is.  Her name is Rebecca Brooks.  She is a BAD Supervisor unless you are one of her pets!  She is unfair."

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon has shown me every day that customer services is top priority when dealing with the public.  Most of my customers (although I only speak with them for less than 30 seconds most times) tell me that I have a pretty voice and have been very helpful.  I take great pride in helping people and do what is possible to help."

good,I have been part of this organization from last 3.6 years. it is a great place to work and i am learned/enjoyed a lot in my tenure here.cool work culture and no pressures at all life will be easier here.
good,"Well, I would come in and make sure everything is set inventory wise and make sure that the look of the store is up to current company standards. Then I would focus on customers whether it be troubleshooting their phones or answering account inquiries, I would always have a solution for them. At the end of the day, I pretty much have to lock up the store. I'd also have to make sure inventory and money are where they need to be."
good,"Typical day would be an 8 or 9 hour shift continuous customer interaction. Selling Verizon products and services. Daily coaching with management on how to improve sales process. As told to me by numerous people in management Verizon is a ""do company not a try company"" they expect you to meet and exceed. every single goal they set for you. High pressure sales environment."

I learned much in regards to telephone communications, sales, negotiations and the cellular industry. Co-workers were very intelligent, technical and friendly.

good,"Verizon is a stable company that provides excellent pay and benefits. My days are productive and full of learning experiences.

Being able to always adapt and learn the extremely various aspects of the business was the most enjoyable part of working for this company."
good,"My job duties varied and changed every day, depending on needs of the business.  I gained a wealth of knowledge and was afforded opportunities within Verizon Wireless that I never would have received otherwise.  I supported the Telesales Director, assisted the Telesales Associate Directors and Telesales Representatives, but also played a key role in partnering with Human Resources for Job Fairs, Go To Market for vendor fairs and table days, training for class planning and coordination.  My job is very multi faceted, very fast paced and it requires me to be a quick thinker and to maintain superior organizational skills.  The best part of my job is that it is so diverse and every day was an adventure.  I love the event planning aspect of it, from start to finish.  I love seeing my thoughts and plans put into action and come to fruition at our various events, such as awards banquets, top performer luncheons, off-site sales kickoffs, off-site Leadership teambuilders, etc. I became much more proficient in MS Office and gained extensive experience with the MS software.  The biggest challenge with this job is being able to work well with many different personalities and job styles.  I gained alot of knowledge and learned how to deal with people who were different than I was, but different is good, because I learned alot about myself and how to better adapt and work well with everyone.

good,The world of relay was always interesting. The typical day would never be boring based upon the needs of the caller. I enjoyed management due to their consistency.

It was sad to see how many people showed no respect towards the relay operator or the individuals who needed the service.
good,Love my co workers and most of the customers. Have learned a lot about the technology field that is growing everyday The hardest part is that the management team does not see the day to day work that people in the stores put in to save customers and make the Company something to be proud of.
good,Great place to begin a career.  Introduces new ways of doing business.
good,"Verizon is on the cutting edge of telecommunications development.  Although their presence is mainly in the US, inroads have been made into EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions over the last decade. Outside of the US their product range is focussed on business rather than domestic users, providing reliable secure high speed networks and overlaid with applications to integrate and enhance the customers digital profile."
good,"Typical day at work was grabbing customer as soon as the came in the door to provide a complete solution for them.  You job was to align with the customer, ask probing questions, and discover any additional needs the customer may have.  Additional needs may be if they are a business, need to port the home numbers, and any mobile data solutions."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Identified opportunities, overcame objections and built relationships in order to increase sales. "
good,"Great company with great compensation and benefits. Schedule with Retail job sucks in general. However, it is a great company with great culture. It is a good job with someone"
good,"Everyday at Verizon Wireless you learn something new and you were kept busy that made the time fly."
good,"Great place to work, Great co workers"
good,I assisted customers online with the Verizon wireless website.
good,"The company overall is great to work with, the work is just frustrating because everyone in the company has different answers."
good,Meeting and greeting customers as well as working the sales floor and selling to new and existing customers
good,"Verizon has great training. We are able to get help when needed. The area is quiet and calm, which is great for data entry personnel."
good,"I loved working for Verizon and the pay and benefits were awesome, the management sometimes did a good job of recognizing employees, sometimes they did not. The work/life balance aspect for a store manager does not really exist, and if you start in retail and want to move to corporate it is very very difficult unless you frequently leave your store location and hang out at the corporate office."
good,"When I first started at Verizon I worked in an inbound call center assisting residential customers review their monthly phone bill as well as assist them in establishing payment arrangements on their monthly phone bills."
good,Was a beneficial working experience due to the industry leading sales and management training that Verizon provided.
good,"The Consultant position is micro-managed but as long as you are performing your daily task, management will work well with you. Not much time for socializing but coworkers are friendly and helpful. Management makes themselves available to assist you with customers. Loved the weekly meetings to update on new policies and go over training modules. Wonderful job with great benefits and paid for education."
good,"Nice place to work and very good benefits.  Taught me how to work with customers and time management.  The days were sometimes long and could be stressful.  Customer satisfaction was the number 1 priority.  As a customer service rep, you had to be very knowledgeable and keep up with new and updated products for conferencing."
good,"Working with customers to get their issues resolved is the most enjoyable thing.   This being new in terms of customer service its great to develop skills needed to be provide the most excellent service as per JD Powers review and being apart of this is exciting."
good,"I worked for Verizon and ATT both. If I had to choose to work in the wireless industry again I would choose Verizon over ATT any day of the week. If you have a good manager they will work with you on advancements. I learned so much about KPIs and how to handle a corporate setting, corporate visits, etc. Co-workers can get a little testy especially during the holidays when we are all working long hours. Work life balance isn't great but it is also retail. Company states they are one of the top ranked companies for mothers but I believe that would be more on the corporate office side than the retail side."
good,This job was very quiet and laid back. The peace and quiet helped me get my work done. I was always able to handle anything that was passed my way. The manager was friendly and easy to get a long with. Daily I would gather up the mail and enter data as needed.
good,Full work days with a lot of pressure from management to sell.  Customers take up a lot of time with troubleshooting making it somewhat hard to sell.  Can get some great sales out but also have days with low sales.  Great benefits like health insurance and 401K. Tuition reimbursement and constant training.
good,"My ""every""day consisted of assisting consumers with their cellular needs.  Everyone was cool. Management, co-workers, etc... The hardest part was that there was no hard part. That made it enjoyable."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Excellent company to work for, benefits package was conducive to job responsibilities."
good,"I work in sales, my day was very fast pace assisting customers with their wireless needs. Management was helpfull and great on training."
good,Worked productively and learned lot of new applications about Infrastructure domain in this company.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with Verizon Wireless. My only complaint was the at will employment they offer. There really isn't any job security and if you have a life emergency prepare to fight extremely hard to even keep your job. I was out with medical issues for a month and came back to hassle and eventually led to termination.
good,A very good company to work for with a great compensation package.
good,"Each day my team and I were responsible to review every detail on each project assigned to us. This included: "
good,"A typical day would contain happy customers, handling calls come and go easily. Everything going at a good pace made the day go by faster. I've learned how to multi-task better than before. Managing time better. The customer is always right no matter what. Last but not least, how to focus. Management overall was great but of course, there are some things that you disagree with as far the job goes. The hardest part of the job was managing the time you have with each customer which proves to be stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers leaving them happy after the call."
good,"The Health benefits are the greatest benefit for working at Verizon. Little to no co-pay and great coverage.  At the moment the job security is not very good due to poor sales and tough competition. "
good,"Taking Calls at the Call center."
good,"Fun sales environment. Fast paced and ever changing.  Goals are attainable and challenging.  "
good,"I really enjoyed my 7 years at Verizon Wireless. I received gold standard training and worked with some excellent managers. I learned so much at this job that could easily translate to any other company or position. Also, Verizon Wireless pays their employees extremely well and the benefits package is outstanding."
good,Verizon is a good company to work for with good benefits.  The company is shifting it's focus more towards wireless and cloud computing and away from traditional telecommunications service.  This has resulted in many positions being outsourced.
good,You have the opportunity to make a lot of money if you understand the pay structure.
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. They offer competitive benefits and pay in addition to company tuition assistance.
good,"My job is to sell fios packages. My day consists of talking to customers, greeting them and doing account reviews or try to sign new customers."
good,"a typical day at work: Helping my team to sell more and motivate them. Always on call to help the team remotely"
good,"From that working experience I have learned how to sell someone on affording better service for their TV, Phone, & Internet. Management was there along the way showing me how to be approachable and sell service door to door. The hardest part about the service was selling door to door getting people to sign on with our services. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to the various places in Queens where I was able to explore areas which I haven't explored before."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"* Within short span of time, i got project to get all the input/output files in/out of my application and the system which we send get/send too. These information are needed to shutdown my application and to make it work on other application. It's a huge effort to pull out. Thousands of program i need to look at. But i did very efficiently and provided the info in short span. It shouldn't be given to me as i was new to that application when senior employees are there. I took it as challenge and did it and learn't it and successfully did the decommissioning of my application."
good,"I loved the environment and staff at Verizon Wireless.  They made sure that as new hires that we had the essentials needed to comfortably perform our assignments.  Also, as we became more seasoned in our duties, the hospitality continued.  The environment was fun due to games, activities, holidays and mini concerts that were held by staff members.  Overall, I really enjoyed the time I had at VZW."
good,Customer service good place to work lots of room for growth ....Management okay
good,"Everything is driven by metrics and surveys. Sometimes, reps will lose sight of doing right by the customer just so they don't a bad survey. I agree it is a good tool, but it waters down the customer experience. Overall, Verizon is a great place to work. Great people, great managers and awesome benefits. The hardest part is how worn down you get mentally after being o the phone with customers for 8-10 hours. The most enjoyable part would be the camaraderie."
good,I would take calls and help the customers with whatever account needs that they may of had.
good,Good place to learn the origin of Telecommunication and Data networks. Friendly co-worker like part you family
good,"I enjoyed my work there! It was very difficult to progress my career there, but the effort was recognized."
good,"Mijn werkervaring bij Verizon Business beschouw ik als iets zeer leerzaams. Ik zal nooit de dagelijkse internationale werksfeer vergeten met collega's vanuit de hele wereld en meerdere talen die met internationale klanten gesproken werden. Dit bracht mij diversiteit en inspiratie in me werk om verder te denken wat betreft hoe je iemand telefonisch of digitaal benadert."
good,"A typical day includes opening of the store with another sales rep, checking and scanning all inventory, meet and greet customers, identify needs of the client, take cash, check and credit bill payments, recommend plan changes and sell new equipment a long with accessories. Make constant follow up calls with previous customers and cold call new customers. Also responsible for running credit applications, discussing deposit if needed, and doing technical support on phones.  Commission pay only with benefits."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Verizon.  We all worked as a team and got along great.  We met our goals on a montly basis.  The hardes part of the job was to keep up with the consistent changes that could occur on a daily basis i.e. new equipement, policy changes, computer programming, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was going above and beyond expectations for the customer.  It was extremely satisfying to know that I had turned them around from being frustrated to a loyal customer"
good,Overall good corporate enviornment.Although High Managment turnover at my particular officemade working there hard.
good,Daily coordination with Construction and Equipment Engineers as well as contractors to meet deadlines regarding conversion of existing cell sites to 4G and upgrades to LTE.  Monitoring of 1000 sites to ensure target on air dates are met by the contractors awarded the Ethernet Back Haul conversions.

good,"Verizon was very structured and organized.  Excellent training, and great managers!"
good,"Every day is a new challenge when trying to meet the goals set for the day to accomplish my monthly target. Dealing with Customers from all walks of life, it is very interesting to see how some Customers think (i.e. wanting everything free)."
good,"I loved that job, to a point. They were great to me up until they laid me off for reasons I would rather not discuss. They clouded it around store closures, but that was not the case. I would have made that job a career for me."
good,hardest part of the job was the very few costumer that was unable to be helped. Most enjoyable fact was helping costumers life more easy.
good,Verizon was a great place to work. It all depends on the management team.
good,Verizon pays well with both hourly and commission for sales positions. High stress job with many metrics to meet or exceed. Work an average of 45-50 hours a week. 
good,"I learned alot about professional accountabilty, and the difference between being committed to excellence, and being complacent with just getting a paycheck."
good,The company compensates very well and is large so has a lot of opportunities but it is just very competitive.
good,"People called in with issue with the FIOS product. TV, Phone and Blazing fast internet over fiber.  I loved finding patterns to issues, creating ways to diagnose and identify quickly. Being able to offer first call resolution, at several points I held the highest levels in the company, as well as developing ways to deliver it fast.  I developed processes, with the help of other brilliant people to hit call handling times that where historically low, 1/3 of budgeted time while exceeding customers expectations.  Verizon had customer praise walls where customers regularly commented on excellence of my service.     "
good,This company has excellent wages and benefits.  Good working hours and overtime was available. 
good,"A typical day for me started with a pot of coffeee for my team.  Then a walk on the floor to assess any absences.  I would provide any materials needed for anyone that had been out.  Part of the day was used to monitor employee calls, discuss these and coach appropriately.  Meeting with co-workers was also part of the day to ensure we were all on the same page with the daily sales incentives or meetings to attend.  The hardest part was sitting in conference calls that took too long and had no benefit to the daily dynamics.  The calls were to review numbers and set quotas, which could have been done via a newsletter or email.  The emails were too many and much of it was repeated a few times from different people which took up too much time.  MY best part of the day was helping my team reach their goals and ensuring a safe and friendly environment to work in."
good,"Fun environment, but also very fast paced due to flux in customers. Some days are very busy while others are slow. "
good,Makes you feel that you are a member of a family. A typical day is taking inbound calls for troubleshooting. Sometimes you have to make outbound calls to customers who you were helping to finish resolving their issue. Co-workers are amazing. Everyone is on a first name basis; even the highest person in the center wants you to call him by his first name and always makes an effort to say hi when you pass him.
good,"Working for the company is always a learning experience, the do take time to provide training to all personnel.  Some of the upper management were more approachable than others and provide opportunities to grow.  It was great that they were able to heard our concerns and take them in consideration.  The kept workers inform of changes and ask for opinions to better the services. "
good,"	Assisted customers with their questions/inquires that they have with their wireless products."
good,"The Good:"
good,"I worked as a health and wellness intern in the corporate wellness side of the company. Verizon has a strong corporate wellness program and call centers have gyms staffed with nutrition and fitness professionals available to employees for a small fee of $15 a month. As an intern I provided fitness and nutrition assessments, personal training, nutrition counseling and health promotion program planning and implementation.  "
good,I enjoyed interacting with the public as well as my co-workers
good,"This is the place where I learned about PCI compliance,Vulnerability Management,Vulnerability Scanning,and network security. "
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for.  They instill great values in their team. The hardest part about working for an aggressive commission based sales company though is there is minimal to no work/life balance.  That was where I struggled with the management and my own personal needs.  I loved working for the company though, and the management was always willing to coach and assist with anything we needed with customers.  "
good,Verizon is a good Company to work at. VZW provides quality training and compensation is reasonable. 
good,"Was a great option for working with verizon. Home garage of van and mon-fri work schedule. restricted by union contract to certain work functions, but over all an easy way to work for verizon and learn the copper side of telephones, lots of inside work with business and residential, but equal amount of outside plant work."
good,"Verizon Wireless has a close set of team members. Everyone quickly becomes close and develops a bond. Most will be quick to come together and help one other, a few like to work alone."
good,"Good company to work in, friendly environment. Less work pressure."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I think this was an ok place to work, their benefits were good as well. I would work here again if I had to they had some good tools as far as getting you trained and ready for the job!"
good,There are lot of innovation going on in the company. I had a chance to work with lot of skilled people. There were rapid changes in the management style but I enjoyed my work all the time while working for Verizon
good,"Verizon is a wonderful telecommunications company to work for. There is a lot of growth opportunity. All of my co-workers were team players and we all worked as one at being productive and efficient. We always met our goals in the company's yearly cost reductions and continued to look for additional savings. No matter which department or level of management you had to contact or correspond with, everyone was very courteous and knowledgeable."
good,The hardest part of the job was attempting to de-escalate an irate customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy and interacting with my coworkers.
good,Verizon is really a great company to work for they really do there best to keep there employees happy in every way.
good,Great place to meet new people. Always changing environment with plenty of challenges.
good,"I loved working fo Verizon Wireless, i was able to meet awesome people working on a team as well as i loved interactiong with customers each day. the ability to lean and be able to be a leader was a geat experience. The hardest part of the job was with any customer service job, when you have difficult customers, but the trick of the trade is to emain calm and remember they are not upset with you but upset with the situation. I loved my coworkers and the bond that we form working as a team. I was able to make some really good friends which made the job easy to get up to go to each day."
good,Company is a great company to work for good benefits.
good,"It is a friendly and fast paced environment, excellent benefits and a lot of good advancement opportunities."
good,"Worked there through an agentcy. Pay was great, management was good. Positive team enviornment"
good,A typical day would involve conference calls and going over the account details and changes for the coming week and the stayus of multiple projects and any oustanding isssues that needed to be addressed.
good,"This Job is great but its geared more toward those who are single and have no Kids. The Pay is great the benefits are great but because of union rules they are allowed to force you into overtime up to 15hrs, which usually ends in u using an off day to make up for the OT demand. So those with a schedule full of Dr appointments and other things like kids who need to have you on a reliable schedule this may not be the job for you."
good,This job gave me empowerment for fulfilling my duties.
good,"When I landed my job at Verizon Wireless I was elated. Verizon has a reputation of being one of the best companies to work for. Unfortunately our office closed. I would work there again in a heart beat. The job was good, the benefits were very good."
good,"Every job was different with a different story to be told creating a continuous learning environment, Testing and trouble shooting was my favorite part of the job working through numerous offices isolating and fixing troubles that have been around for ever and to dig in and fix them (put them to bed) was satisfying, trouble shooting using, numerous testing devices using employees and management to work as a team was very satisfying and critical to getting answers and help when needed to meet due dates."
good,"Typical day at work begin with checking email to see what needed to be completed. Most of the work waiting for me only took a couple of hours to complete. I would ensure to clean out my inbox before lunch rather than chit chat and talk most of the day. Management tends to micro-manage lower level employees and ensure they had complete control. Lower-level employees were not allowed to make decisions on the spot and were told to go to management. This would not only prolong answering the customer, as employees had to wait for management's input which was not always immediate, this also lowered moral. The few friendships I made were the best part of the job."
good,Everyone I worked with were great and easy to work with. I work well with others.
good,Company has been good to work for in almost all aspects while working in the Hunt Valley area.
good,You will be very busy here. Verizon Wireless is a company that has high turn over rates when it comes to the call center. The management are all company people and follow their higher management instructions to the letter for job safety. They are not union so they can get rid of you whenever they want to. They are one of the only companies here in Southern California for telecommunications that is not union. You have no protection with them for job security. There was nothing hard about the job and they pay you well but ego's are high with management.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Travel to stores locations and help them with their merchandising, teaching them the principles of merchandising and increasing sales..."
good,"There are a lot of good people working at Verizon. A lot of very smart people whom I fear feel stuck in their jobs. Sometimes you feel like you're working in a government bureaucracy. The internal security folks are extremely oppressive -- you can barely do anything remotely creative technology-wise. In I.T., close to 70% of the positions are either offshore or onshore contracted to offshore companies. On the other hand, compensation is good."
good,Good communication and coordination with cross functional teams and able to handle all the project related issues and reports.
good,Competitive environment can sometimes lead to poor work/life balance.

good,"This department is where it was happening. Fun, lots of great people. Fast paced."
good,Help provide others with wireless solutions. Learned new wireless technology from the worlds leading provider. Manger was there assist with the consulting process. The industry is very demanding and the fast-pace can be difficult. Overall it was a great learning experience.
good,"You have daily stats that must be met which will be responsible for your future, takining calls, trouble shooting, handling all aspects of the cell phone industry."
good,"I was laid-off before the site was actually closed. But while I was there at that particular location, I enjoyed it tremendously."

good,Flexible company. Worked with both internal and external clients.
good,"Typical day is on the phone with technicians in the field assisting them with getting their job done , whether it be helping with outside facilities , working with engineers, sales people, managers, or just plain old trouble shooting with technical issues. I have learned you need to be patient and willing to learn and always improving yourself which I have done. Team work is essential for this job. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with technology, most enjoyable is knowing I have done the best I can and proud of it."
good,retail hours
good,"Working in a call center...it is what it is. They have good benefits for employees and if you have a good attitude, you can do really well."
good,I was able to win the employee of the quarter award. I was also able to win several other awards. I was also promoted to a Store Manager.

good,Learning daily about how to run a productive business and extend longevity.
good,Fast paced call center with competitive goals for teams and personal associate goals.
good,"The start the day was very busy with answering customer concerns reqarding their accounts and phone service. Learned how to set up cellular customer accounts, troubleshoot their technical issues and change customers phone numbers from one state to another, performed billing responsibilities. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling new equipment."
good,"I started working at Verizon Wireless under the various names it has had since I went to work for them. The changes in technology, system capabilities, policies, and job options all changed over time. There was constant change, which kept everyone on their toes."
good,Great company to work for originally. The bigger they get the more you become a number. Leadership could of been improved greatly.
good,A busy day where you have to over lap assignments Dealing with customers and co-works on a consistently. You want to give your best because you want to be loyal to your employer and customers

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"While employed there I enjoyed great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was customers that were irate. Overall, the compensation package was well worth it."
good,"Great benefits, good pay, good management. Corporate culture, however, does not lead to a healthy work/life balance. Preach ""customer first,"" but practice ""bleed customer dry of money."" Leads to low customer satisfaction and high employee ""burn out."""
good,"This is a great place to work. You learn new things everyday about technology and sales. I've really enjoyed working here, but the slow traffic in the store can really stand in the way of making good money."
good,"VZW was an excellent place to excel. Within a short 5 year period, I was promoted 4 times. Started as a customer service rep, then sales, supervisor, and finally became an Assistant Manager. Too much pressure placed on employees. Job was always ""on the line"" if you didn't hit a specific metric. A lot of politics and sneaky people in management. A lot of the employees do undermining things to get ahead. Promotions are now based on who you know and not how well you perform. Benefits are spectacular. Long hours. I wouldn't recommend working in retail with a family."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of handling over 500 inbound calls and providing our customer with the ultimate VIP customer service experience and a multitude of information. I learned how to multi-task, process information and handle escalated calls while working for the phone company. The management team was rather large, since our office was larger, they were always looking for new ways to liven up our working environment, they were very educated and knowledgeable. The hardest part of this job was the commute to and from work. The most enjoyable part of this job would definitely have to be the customers."
good,Great company to work for. Advancement is limited due to overflow of employees.
good,Responsibilities: Sole responsibility of customer service Shipping & receiving and
good,"I worked at the corporate office in Dublin, Oh for 7 years."
good,"While being in a commission sales environment, it can be stressful. However, I loved the challenge and I had really great customers that made my job worth it."
good,"Working for Verizon Wireless there was never a typical day each day entailed something different everyday, no day was the same with being customer service we handled billing issues, technical issues or plan changes. Having something different everyday made the job easy to do because it was never boring. Working in different stores was a blast making new friends with the coworkers that were in each store. If you did your job correctly you didn't interact with management which is why I was able to do different jobs within my own. I loved being able to learn ever aspect of the retail location from the back office to being a keyholder and acting manager when one wasn't on duty."
good,"A typical workday envolved facilitating new employees orientation, interviewing new potential candidates for supervisor or management positions. Suppoert local sales units in providing information on any new or revised HR procedures or policies. Dailey provide conflict resolution for supervisors and managers. On line computer training. Every day was a new and exciting challenge. I learned that good communication and teamwork yield success. Management is a teammate with a different title and different responsibility that moves the employee forward in the right direction through empowerment. Co-workers were youthful and enerjetic. The hardest part of the job was finding a stopping point. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relations, both inside and outside the company."
good,Typical is stressful on a daily basis
good,The work day began at 8:00A.M. A sales staff meeting was held one morning per week. Advertising Reps were expected to have appointments with current advertisers and some non-advertisers/propspects.Paperwork was to be turned in daily.

good,"Great compensation, great benefits, performance driven,"
good,Work begins at 8:00am when you get to your first customer. You are sent jobs on your Blackberry. All just jobs on your log are completed on that day. From day one until our final day we were constantly learning what it takes to install and repair copper telephone lines. We had regular visits by manager to our job site. We would also have gang and safety meetings at least once a month.Special safety rodeos were done twice a year. We had tech appreciation breakfast when we made our numbers. The hardest part of the job was getting cooperation from the support groups within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was solving customer's problems and just learning the craft of a telephone technician.
good,"I'm currently a customer service representative at Verizon Wireless call center. My daily duties include answering incoming calls about bills, payments, troubleshooting.My co-workers and managers make the job more desirable. The hardest part of my job can be the hours at time and the fact that I'm no longer looking for a job, I'm currently seeking a career in job."
good,"A very exciting company to join. You are paid for performance, which encourages long-term tenure with gradual pay increases. Benefits are generous with health benefits, free tuition for those continuing their education, as well as personal/sick, and vacation. Constant change, including the continual raising of performance metrics does not always encourage positive experiences."
good,"Thorough training that provides you good knowledge of your required tasks, starting pay is really good and gift cards for performance was very rewarding."
good,"engaging with customer's on a daily basis. Learned to manage time and be focused on a task, and how important it is to meet quota's and deadlines. The Management team seemed to be there when you needed help. As far as my co-workers they were great people. Hardest part of the job was being on your feet from 10 to 12 hours a day. The part I miss the most is the interaction with customers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Excellent benfits and pay, great team environment at retail store. Nights, weekends and holiday limit family time."
good,"Verizon is actively expanding its presence in wireless, virtualization and security. It has distinguished itself amidst a very competitive market sector and continues to develop its future vision. A major investment in fiber to the home has begun to pay off in terms of its TV and online services customer base. Its main focus is on wireless where it continues to be a leader."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company as I had an awesome supervisor, great peers, and good benefits. My only issue, which is a major one, is the job itself. It's a call center environment so you're expected to answer between 40-60 calls daily and meets goals at the same time. In addition, they claim there is growth for advancement but at the time, the director of the Hanover call center held customer service reps back from excelling to business support. I experienced this is which is the main reason I left."
good,Great place to work.Lunch time is mixed up of all cultures and eat what you like but pay from your pocket. Nice environment and nice working condition
good,The quotas can be unrealistic at times. Management was not always competent. Great income if you are willing to work hard and stay up-to-date on products.
good,"My experience was excellent until I transferred to another location. There I had a manger (N.H) that had a reputation of being unfair and toxic. Overall, my experience of 10 years were great with 2 years of misery."
good,It is a good company to work for . The work life balance is not good and it could be batter. Benefits are very good. I believe that they must work more on finding opportunities for their employees
good,"I worked in sales on the east coast and it was a great experience.  From a sales standpoint Verizon can have very aggressive goals for you to meet, but the reward is in the pay if you can be a great customer and sales person.  Always be looking for opportunities and the rest will fall into place!"
good,"Really skilled colleagues.  Physical environment allows for productivity."
good,Demanding projects that were challenging and rewarding at the same time.  Expect to put in a lot of hours as the workload can be extremely heavy.  Must be willing to work closely with offshore staff.
good,"A job worth having. Would have stayed at this job if weekend work was not required. Working for hourly pay and commission is very beneficial, saving on phones and phone bill was definitely a benefit."
good,great and exciting opportunities meeting different people daily and having the ability to help. networking  and bringing new business to help grow the compny
good,"Verizon in general is a great job. The pay is great and so are the benefits. Be prepared though to toss some morals aside, Verizon is very centered on making money, often at the customer expense. As long as you are ok with a hustle, you should be fine."
good,"A lot has changed but its still got a above average pay, good people and great benefits. It's a place were people still play favorites and not everything seems as they are."
good,"I enjoyed building relationships at work with my customers, teammates, and supervisors.  The benefits are by far the best out there. Towards the end, the morale begin to suffer due to the lack of compassion from upper management about the building closure and budget cuts. If I could do it again, I would but I would try advance sooner to avoid this temporary retirement."
good,"For 30 years Verizon (MCI) was a great place to work. I was given opportunities to grow and move up in the company. Unfortunately, a downturn in the economy caused my position to be eliminated."
good,"Really all about customer service and making the customer happy.  Completing tasks like promos , plan changes, upgrades etc.Along with daily problem solving for the same issues."
good,"-Fun place to wok"
good,Verizon provided a stable employment and offered various opportunities for growth. Some of the job responsibilities were stressful at times and fast paced.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good Company, but as with most large companies a lot of red tape and layoffs etc.  Lots of turnover and changes at Executive levels.   Really just several companies put together, Wireless, Cable and Internet with various technical and marketing divisions."
good,"Fast pace that offers opportunity to grow and learn new initiatives and tasks every day."
good,"One of the things that stands out the most about working at Verizon was the benefits. Not only did I get discounts on the products, I also received health benefits which helped tremendously."
good,The job as a 411 operator was fast paced and you were never bored. Benefits were great. The hours left alot to be desired and towards the end there was no chance for advancement. Unfortunately the center closed and we all lost our jobs.
good,Overall great company to work for plenty of opportunity for to make good commissions check. Have to be very flexible with hours to work and have open availability.
good,Managers decretion to adopt company policies had let to non uniform adoption which leads to dissatisfied employees. It has a history or reduction of staff and even has outsourced its IT employees over to Infosys.
good,"was a great  place to work,  Loved all my co workers. but the last couple of years got new upper management and was all about cost cutting. moving jobs to get rid of people with years with the company"
good,"Best employee benefits. Healthcare benefits, paid time off is generous and pay is good. Work life balance is not great, the constant changing schedule is not great"
good,"If you’re looking for growth and challenges, this is the job for you. This job helped me build my communications skills, computer/tech skills and made me a better salesman."
good,You help people troubleshoot their mobile devices and try to turn those situations into sales. I learned good team work and more complicated sales techniques. Management pushes you to sell products people don't necessarily want nor need. Work culture is what you make of it. I met a lot of great people and made long time friends. Hardest part of the job is discovering ways to position new products to make a sale. My coworkers were the best part of my job. Great fun people to be around.
good,"It was a really good job, but I wasnt making enough money honestly. The company was very understanding. Management was great the whole time I've work there."
good,Easy to work for company with flexible work schedule. Very customer focused and a fun work environment.  Very easy to learn the job and helpful coworkers.
good,The majority of the culture was amazing. I loved helping customers as well as selling and touching the newest technology. There was a sense of thrill when selling to a new customer
good,Company is good at communicating positive news with employees.  Not so good that is is old-fashioned and bureaucratic. Constant focus on cost-cutting sometimes gets tedious.
good,"The overall Verizon culture is great! It definitely comes down to management though, the first store I worked at was great! Employees were treated very well, but the second one when I moved was not so great. Very pushy sales managers that at times promoted dishonest sales."
good,"Working at Verizon was one of the better work experiences I've had. The environment was fun and as friendly as a sales environment can be. The people I work with took me in and helped train me on the fly as a first-time sales associate. The pay is well-regarded, but you have to be a 'go-getter' as some of the pay comes of commission sales."
good,Great place to work with exceptional benefits. The environment is great but always remember to take care of yourself. Gym available and Cafeteria with staff available to prepare food for the employees. You perform and they reward you. Overtime is offered throughout the year which is a plus. Fast paced and the internal employees are messy.  Attitudes of internal workers can be nasty and supervisors will attempt to hinder your progress. STAY TO YOURSELF AND YOU WILL EXCEL. Trust no one.
good,nothing crazy job gets old real quick.  like any other sales job they push product to customers that really dont need it and they care less if they are losing market share to thier competitors
good,"Great pay for the job, a bit of micromanaging and politics but the health plan was good and there were good benefits overall.  Very aggressive salespeople"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Boss always kept me on track, encouraging and teaching me more about sales. Generally flexible hours, and boss was very understanding when it came to illness."
good,"Fun when you have the right management and compensated for sales. It is a fast pace environment, with high energy. I enjoyed working for Verizon. I just wish they had alternating weekends and holidays."
good,"A typical workday start between the hours of 10am to 8pm. Start with a quick manager huddle the huddle the reps and set the tone for the day and expectations. One thing i've learned about management, not all poeple are the same and able to read your audience is keep."
good,"I have worked at Verizon for quite a few years and there hasn't been a day where you weren't challenged in getting projects completed and had to work diligently to overcome those challenges to succeed. It is a very productive workplace, co-workers know how to get things done but with it does have it's pros and cons.  The best pros have encountered are the benefits/compensation and the people I have met."
good,"Er wordt veel van je verwacht, intern kan de organisatie soms langzaam zijn terwijl er in het werk wel een hoog tempo gevraagd wordt, veel tijdsdruk. Compensatie is daar ook naar."
good,"very relaxed work and no work pressure"
good,The culture at Verizon allows you to both succeed and fail; based on your efforts or work ethic; and the people that surround you.  They allow you to advocate for yourself and maintain consistent employee recognition.
good,We have a small close knit team. we were production on a day to day basis. we all got along because we were able to communicate with each other in order to get our team goals reached.
good,Very busy fast paced environment with changing priorities and cross functional collaboration. It is a dynamic organization with a lot of changes in systems and processes.
good,"Excellent company "
good,I enjoyed working at verizon meeting new people and being tested every month to hit goals.I also enjoyed the different marketing strategies we came up with to increase sales and when they were successful how my team always was at the top of the sales chart.
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for. It has its downsides and upsides I enjoy the people I work with, the money is good and benefits are great. Company cares about its people, but like all big companies, it's all about the shareholders and the bottom line."
good,Very competitive work area with constant change in pay. Allot of turnover and uncertainty in future position and location. Little or no advancement available.
good,"Everyday was a schedule to the minute and no surprises. Role was simple, clock-in and clock-out. Great discounts for Verizon service as an employee and plenty of time off."
good,"Processes consistently change and you need to maintain the most current and relevant knowledge in order to successfully meet yearly agreements. The focus is always on balancing the needs of the customer, business needs, and staying within compliance of state/government laws, and internal expectations. "
good,"I was decently compensated for work at Verizon but had to work overtime quite often to get everything done.  There is little promotion from within at Verizon, mostly hiring from outside."
good,"1) Both customer and employee centric"
good,"Each day brings a new challenge.  Adaptability and flexibility is key to job security and growth, which keeps thing interesting and professional growth ongoing."
good,During my tenure at  Verizon it has offered me growth and stability. There have been many changes the last two years that has affected many positions including mine. I am still not going to complain. The company overall is a good opportunity.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is company that focusses on the bottom line and that is whether or not the sales numbers are met.  Verizon had a good compensation and benefits package including yearly short term incentive bonuses.
good,Loved all of the benefits i received from Verizon! They try and take care of their employees. They have high end facilities and fast internet. Only downside was the location and driving with traffic to and from work.
good,The shift process is the biggest con to the company.  You bid for your shift every 6 months and never until you get 5+ years of tenure you can plan on working weekends and having late hours
good,"It's hard to beat the pay for what you do and I have a lot of autonomy throughout the day. I have never had a better work/life balance at any other place I have been employed. The only downside to the position is that retail sales don't have much future left (that I can foresee) and the general atmosphere is declining. All in all, it is a very good place to work at."
good,Verizon was a great place to work.  Tuition Assistance was a nice perk and the ability to work from home was helpful. The work was challenging but rewarding.
good,Sales required you to meet quota and sell other third party supplies as well as services. No room for growth. We had to push sales of comcast internet and cable. Also upsale an Ipad on a customer who walked in for a trouble shoot. I like sale but cannot push an item to someone who's not interested in it.
good,laid back environment management was friendly.The hardest part of the job was nor being able to service he customer what they wanted. The best part of the job was being able to service the customer and help others.
good,"Upbeat work environment, while helping customers with setting up phones and troubleshooting problems. It was great to have the knowledge of the technology that is taking over with this day and age."
good,Overall it was a great experience and allowed me to work on my people skills.  Now most employees are going home based which provides a great option over commuting.
good,"The meetings could be cut back some, but overall the team environment is promising and exciting when everyone's passion is aligned. The culture is in a bit of a transformation currently."
good,While Verizon is a technology company the ability to make a career out of this position is slowly dwindling down as commission pay outs become smaller and the demand for online shopping increases. Great opportunity for someone fresh out of college or with a little experience but be quick to learn and get ready for change because this type of position will not be here forever.
good,Verizon is a great place to work. Work / life balancing can be challenging but the career is awarding. I would recommend this job if your schedules are flexible.
good,"Great place to work. Professional atmosphere and most all take pride in doing a quality job safely in a timely manner. Customers are first priority. Tours may be 7-4 or 10-7   or8-5   or 12-9 or possible nite tours. Safety equipment is required during outside or inside plant work. Such as safety glasses , hard hats, line gloves , safety harness or climbing body belts and straps to secure ladders. Training is provided and observations are done during training as well as observations on the job by field management.. Outside plant jobs require safety toe boots with defined heel for climbing of poles and ladders. Electrical hazard training is provided for outside work technicians ."
good,The District Manager is a excellent sales coach and knowledgeable on the industry. It is a customer driven business with focus on top performance. There is great potential to earn large sales bonuses. It is a very friendly and welcoming community to work in.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon and didn't want to leave, however the new CEO was all about restructuring and laying off at least twice a year. This proved to be a very stressful work environment not knowing when we would be next in the reduction in force.  No job was secure at that point. Workplace culture suffered and morale took a turn for the worse.  I made the tough decision of taking an enhanced severance package that was offered to all employees."
good,I enjoyed my time with Verizon.  I loved my role as I managed multiple projects- never a dull day.  Great leadership and team dynamic within our local market area.
good,"working at Verizon does have its challenges, but the rewards behind them are definitely worth it. Verizon is a solid company to work for. It really enhances your perspective on growing a business while satisfying the customers needs"
good,"Verizon is a satisfying place to work. The people and extremely knowledgeable and loyal, compensation benefits (I can only speak as a single person) and 401K match are competitive."
good,Great company to work for! Make lots of money selling phones! The commission is great! The hours are good. The benefits are great. 50% off phone plan and fios!
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I led a production support team on a web based application.  I analyzed users' daily issues and worked with them to ensure their needs were met.  Any code related issues, I worked with developers to make correction.  If any process I saw that could be improved, I worked with users and developers to enhance the process.  The hardest part of my job was to ensure meeting users' deadlines.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting the issues resolved on time."
good,Rebranding can be exciting.  Verizon is rebranding itself to be more competitive.  Things are constantly changing.  You must be flexible to keep up with the new Verizon.
good,"Verizon paid a very good wage for the Youngstown area at the time.  I was very grateful for the job."
good,"The hours of the job were great for me 7:00am to 3:30pm"
good,"I like the job.  The benefits are great, and the wages very competitive.  Diversity is one of their core strengths. Not only ethnic diversity, but age and gender diversity as well.  There’s an excellent balance of older, more seasoned workers and young enthusiastic workers, eager to learn."
good,"Pay is great but the companies clear nepotism is painstakingly obvious.  Seems the company cares more about their personal perceptions rather than provide a culture of fun, caring and engagement."
good,"Good experience, great coworkers."
good,Fast-paced call center. You need a high tolerance for dealing with potentially irate customers. They have terrific training programs and you get great support from your managers.
good,"for me personally, VZ was a great place to work. The compensation and benefits were very good.  I was able to have a long career with career advancement and development available to me."
good,"You will always be chasing the numbers and since quotas are the same in every territory regardless of differences in income, population etc. (a rep in Maine has the same quota as a rep in Boston) it can be very challenging to hit quota. However the pay and benefits are top notch so if you can stomach it and have no problem sacrificing personal time for work then you will do great at Verizon."
good,"This job had a wide range of responsibilities and problem-solving opportunities. I worked with several good teams and managers. Sometimes the administrative overhead became time consuming but overall, my experience was very positive."
good,"Verizon is focused on each employees satisfaction. Consistently conducting focus groups and skip level meetings to better understand the needs of front line employees. Creates and maintains a fun, comfortable atmosphere to work in daily. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with new information. A better system for communicating information to front line employees would be helpful."
good,"Verizon treats its people well and, for the type of work being done, the pay is actually very good. The benefits are competitive and the leadership does a decent job of making employees feel empowered to think outside of the box during calls."
good,The benefits keep you afloat a high-energy work environment. There were never any concerns with scheduling and worked well at adjusting for my school schedule.
good,"Great Place to Work"
good,great opportunity with really great benefits.... the company is very competitive with meeting the needs of their customers....The most enjoyable part is when they come together and celebrate the company successes
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Even meeting quotas sometimes isn't enough. Management needs work with people skills. Commissions structure changed multiple times during my tenure that created less incentives for the employees. If you're talented and strong minded, you'll make some good money."
good,"Overall great job to work for. Work/ life balance sucks, but the pay and benefits are amazing. Commission plus base is awesome plus you get discounts on service and accessories."
good,I really loved working for Verizon I definitely would work for Verizon again .  Verizon has great benefits  and the management is pretty good considering it moves around a lot .
good,"Ratchet place, faced paced, provide you with a lot of knowledge on how to talk to customers and how to properly use phone systems and computer applications"
good,"Working for Verizon was a great experience. My past managers were great to work with. The job is very fast paced, and mandatory overtime. When you are on call you are called all hours of the night, and expected to be at work in the morning."
good,There is not a lot of work life balance. There is room for growth if youre willing to relocate. They are starting to move a lot of jobs to at home positions
good,"Fast paced and sales oriented.  Experience dealing with customers was awesome.  Management lacked training of company policies.  Hardest part of job, selling products that customer did not qualify for.  Pushing the sales to the point of annoyance.  Most enjoyable part were coworkers and customers alike."
good,"No set schedule in a call center environment. Upper Management Changing constantly, Metrics within different department interfere with accomplishing targets. Employee development and  coaching was the main part of the job."
good,I worked in a call center. It was very busy and fast paced working environment. Great benefits including time off for personal life. A lot of incentives to reach goals.
good,.Dispatch 25 techs with multiple jobs. Approve previous day timesheets. Disburse  cables used on previous days work. Check current jobs for corrections/adjustments in routes. Pre-survey pole replacements or new jobs to be added to monthly schedule
good,"Currently, Verizon is going away from call centers run by the company. The office in Houston Texas, the largest in the enterprise, was closed in 2012. Many additional offices have closed since."
good,I loved my job for many years but my job was offshored and was replaced with a job I didn't care for while the benefits were awesome I was unable to move to another department which might have fit my skillset better.
good,...the decided that they didn't want/need an in house End User support team.   I have nothing bad to say about them.  I was given an excellent separation package.  I would recommend Verizon to anyone looking for a non-IT job.
good,I love working for Verizon but it has become more stressful with quota being at an all time high and traffic being quite the opposite. The company is great and has spectacular benefits. I am just needing a change.
good,Verizon is about working on a team and reaching your goal with the team.  i enjoyed my time with Verizon and might look at the opportunity  in rejoining the team.
good,Good place to work. Different work every day and always learning something new.  Hardest part of the job was some of the constantly changing objectives.
good,"Verizon provided table-top games and other stress breakers within their complex. Walking trails were plentiful and outdoor tables were available for lunch daily. Verizon sponsored cookouts, and picnics frquently for its employees."
good,"I've worked with VZ for nearly 2 years in the Customer Service role and enjoy the position. There is a lot of changes that are constant that you have to adapt to, along with a lot of micromanagement and little to no holiday time with your family. Great benefits, and good pay."
good,"I had a good experience at Verizon"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about technology. The company is a great company to work for and continues to evolve.  The hardest part of the job is the fast paced work environment, but the workplace culture is hands on and the employees are friendly."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is one of the largest companies I've ever worked for. As a telecom with a large union work force I was surprised to find some of the most inexpensive benefits costs I've ever seen. "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Verizon.  With a positive culture and integrity throughout, the Verizon customer service team is one of a kind. If you thrive in a fast-paced and constantly evolving environment, then Verizon is the place for you."
good,"take calls light selling manage billing accounts and take payments. make sure you stay  in compliance with the company key indicators. there are decompression rooms to relax , there is a mothers room for women carrying children , there are off site events for moral"
good,"Enjoyed working at Verizon, met a lot of people that are still in my life. It is a performance based company so results are expected. But they have great benefits and the ability to move up. Job advancement does take time and requires you to be the best at what you are doing in your current role. Unfortunately, if you have one person that you don't see eye to eye with, they can make the place a miserable place to go to work. And since everyone is so interweaved that one person can lead you to want to leave."
good,"It was hard to find someone available to assist with calls or lack of leadership, other call centers I worked took great pride in leadership and mgmt."
good,Like any corporation there is good and bad.  It's a large company so you can sometimes feel more like a number than a person. All the managers I had did a great job at providing positive feedback.
good,"Verizon is one of the best places to work at, excellent benefits and a very supportive culture, teams collaborate and peers assist each other. There's a lot of training and ability to work on newer technologies i.e. 5G, Virtualization."
good,I worked at Verizon for 18 years. It is a great company to work. They have a wonderful culture and there is a lot of opportunity for growth if you know where to look. I will always cherish my time spent at VZ.
good,I loved working at Verizon but sadly my store closed down and I did not get rehired at another location. I learned how to be a good salesman and to provide good customer service
good,"Verizon is a very good company.  The pay and benefits offered to their employees are very competitive.  The company has worked hard to make the environment more relaxed and to inspire collaboration.  Recreational opportunities have been created, i.e. ping pong table.  There is free coffee and vending machines/pantry on each floor."
good,Great benefits and pay. Performance based pay can receive good merit increases. Time off is great and most management is great. Over all a faily good place to work.
good,Lots of opportunity if you’re good at sales. Very fast paced with good pay and good benefits. It can be very stressful with all the metrics you need to meet. The hours were all over the place and would burn people out.
good,Verizon offers great benefits from day one and my work life balance is good. There is room to advance but you often must relocate. Apply for a job there.
good,Verizon is a solid company to work for. They provide you with great training programs before you go out on the sales floor. Management is great as well as there is room for advancement.
good,Verizon has been a great career for the last 9 years I have been with the company.  Make sure you love fast paced work environments bc things change to keep up with the ever changing world of technology almost daily!
good,"Every day at TCC, I am responsible for analyzing customer accounts, building relationships and helping to connect consumers to new products that enhance their lives. I learned how to analyze customer accounts, offer new products, while listening to individual needs and offer financial solutions that can help connect customer needs to company products.  The environment has provided me with several opportunities to work with many representatives and store managers.  I have felt encouraged to connect to my peers and learned many valuable problem solving skills from these individuals.  The only negative thing that I have to say about TCC involves the rapid changes that can occur in a blink of an eye.  You do have to be adaptable and if this is a struggle, then this environment can be difficult"
good,"Great benefits, great intentions, but too focused on specific metrics & often results in unethical sales pitches or unobtainable goals................"
good,Store was usually never busy so lack of sales (commission) but overall still a fun place to work at and a lot of room for opportunity. You just had to up sell whoever came in and make outgoing calls when days were always busy.
good,"Overall, Verizon is a great company to work for. Dept policies vary as far as telecommute flexibility. "
good,"Busy as a bee, not a great work/life balance for a supervisor, you feel like you're never off.  I would recommend it if you have less home life.  It was great before I got married.  Also, I hate working from home."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon provided the framework for my career in project/program management. In addition, Verizon offered on-site training for courses related to advancing my skills and development."
good,A typical day at Verizon was very team oriented and I communicated with many people every day. The managers were very understanding and worked with you.
good,"Verizon is an extremely big business with various business units. Depending on the business unit you are in will dictate the type of work you do."
good,It first started of quiet but as the day went on people will start to engage with one another. The hardest part of the job was knowing how to do the work some times because there was always something wrong with the data we were given so it just made our jobs harder.
good,Verizon was a fast pace working environment. The sales environment is very competitive with co-workers. Nice working for the best Network in the industry.
good,"The people were fantastic, the customers wore you down. An overall friendly positive atmosphere. If you work on commission in can be pressure filled but management is very helpful."
good,Drive assigned territory and visit 4 stores daily to drive sales and provide assistance for big box retailers. Territory typically would have a total of about 25 stores.
good,Loved working for this company. Reason for leaving was due to commuting and changes in company restructuring. Verizon gave  me an opportunity to help facilitate a fraud department to prevent financial loss.
good,"Provided technical support, billing issues, sales and training. I learned several things about cellular industry, sales and management.  Management was stressful.  They were always under pressure, which created hostile working environment for the employees. the culture became stressful.  I didn't not find the job to be difficult, just the environment.  Talking to all types of people from various backgrounds."
good,"A typical day at work would be pretty laid back, I worked at the call center side of things and we didn't have to sell anything, we could speak to the customers as if they were in the room right there with us, We had no script, meaning we did not have to follow any security guidelines to log our calls, whatever the customer needed we would be right there to assist them. If there was a issue we would get the customer to the appropriate department or higher ranked staffed member to take the call or whoever was on site during that shift."
good,"This company was great, yes it changed as it got older, but compared to everything else it was by far the best private company to work for, good benefits, good people, but getting smaller."
good,Verizon is a great place to work the benefits are exceptional and their understanding of family and life makes it eady to be employed with a corporation.
good,"Work hard, play hard. The company invests a lot into your work experience while part of the team. Management is young as a lot of veterans have been laid off or have moved on."
good,Great benefits but commission structure based on sales goals that are set so you don't exceed quotas to make great money.  Management opportunities are rewarding but rare
good,"I liked working at Alorica because they helped me grow. The trainers were crazy unprofessional but that's most companies now a days. They would talk to us like children. Telling us that the only reason we got to production was because of her and that she was the reason we got our bonus. The way this certain manager spoke to us was wild but my main trainer was actually pretty great. He was straight to the point, open, willing to listen and made sure we understood everything well before moving forward."
good,Over all I didn't care for Verizon but the pay was good and it was very very close to my house at the time. The eating area was nice and the food was up to date.
good,"i was working in video streaming project that requires private cloude implementations includes Linux VMs, VMware/vcloud with NetApp. very fast phase and technology orianted project."
good,"First 7 years were amazing!!! The last year the culture changed immensely when ""leadership"" changed. I am all about learning from my leadership team, but when the approach becomes disrespectful, I knew it was time to find a different passion."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great benefits including free dental, fair and weekly pay matching 401 k and free vision. Cons includes micro managing, Attendance line is a terrible joke."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for such an advancing and successful company. The job itself was decently easy with great compensation. Management could definitely use some progress, but there really isn't much to complain about."
good,Verizon is a great place to work and very diverse. I have learned a lot in my time there. Management treats everyone fairly and just. They offer great medical and health benefits.
good,"Fun place to work, however had opportunity with work/life balance.  Career advancement was an opportunity, as Verizon started offering more At Home jobs."
good,I worked for Verizon for 15 years and held multiple roles. Verizon provided the training and the leadership to help me grow professionally and personally. I would highly reccomend Verizon as an employer.
good,"Great Company... Great Benefits..... Great Opportunities ... Great Exposure and Awesome Training in Customer Service Arena!"
good,"Overall, Verizon is a good company with opportunities to advance your career at certain levels. Currently, the company is going through a mass transformation to address a lot of the legacy growing pains (i.e. systems, processes, business lines) to improve the overall operating structure. Once Verizon gets through the transformation the work/life balance should be better."
good,Fun to learn of the new products and talk to customers about them.  Computer system keeps good track of all the customer's activities and notes so what they did at one store is easily seen at another.
good,Instead of investing in their employees they try and get rid of them as soon as they have an issue. I tried hard and even made employee of the month as well as was always in the top few in sales.
good,"Good company with attractive pay benefits. Professional environment with good work-life balance. Still using some of the legacy systems, typical telecom company and not proactive about new technologies."
good,"If you like working from home it a great job, no gas to waste, mandatory overtime and okay benefits, working 8 hours a day, incentives for employees and contexts too"
good,Loved working there. Good life work balance. Great co-workers. Competitive environment. Great benefits. Management needs work. That includes executive s too.
good,"Workday started off with daily meetings on sales quotas and new products, learning how to sales and mange customers account , very friendly and productive workplace,"
good,"As a college graduate, Verizon as  helped in getting the answers to any questions on my own. They gave me freedom and software to explore the Verizon and enhance the technical skills."
good,We can explore more on new technologies. I had a good team members who will help. We can participate on hackathons which will give chance to explore new technologies
good,"A typical day consist of bring up multiple system, logging into applications verifying health checks, searching ticketing systems and alarming systems, reading email, and joining daily meetings on subject matter, troubleshooting issues within servers (Linux and Windows, setting up maintenance, training if needed, shutting down systems for maintenance, writing procedures for MOPs(Method of Procedures)"
good,"This was a bullpen environment with opportunities to learn grow and advance.  I learned much about cell phones and working online in a call center.  It was hard to keep customers happy with the answers we had to give them.  However, overall it was enjoyable to know more people in the community and to work with the public."
good,"Great place to work. Worked there many years and then needed to leave for personal reasons.If I could obtain a new position at this point, I certainly would go back. Very difficult to find jobs as a middle age woman now."
good,Great Benefits very little upper management support. culture are great in diversity and not much of a advancement opportunity unless you are well known in the company.
good,"It was a good place to work, really enjoyed my job.  Great benefits, pay was okay. Flexible work schedule, management was good about having to schedule last minute time off.   I would recommend Verizon as a place of employment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"plenty of opportunities in sales, support and operations,  you map your success by pursuing your own career goals.  Company sets objectives and your role is to meet and exceeded these with as little or a lot of help as you need."
good,"Verizon has a clear direction and is dedicated to achieving the goals it sets.  Verizon provides excellent benefits including healthcare, insurance and an employee savings plan.  A great company to work for.  May frequently be too large to accomplish goals without obstacles."
good,Worked with a strong team that was mostly managed well.  Very high stress levels due to maintaining the entire core network as well as supporting application connections that was outside our team's viability/training.  Doing all this with a smaller team than industry norms.
good,No complaints working for Verizon Corporate. Enjoyed my fellow employees. Managers could be overwhelmed at times and it trickles down to the reps but overall decent place to work.
good,Something shifted from when I started to when I left the company.  The company began focusing on the bottom line rather than the company and seemed to get into the race of keeping up with the joneses.  There were a lot of questionable purchases and went from being a leader in the industry to a follower.
good,"A bunch of super smart and dedicated people working together in a fast paced environment. Collaborative. Generally an open door policy, lots of support, training and opportunity available. Lots of exciting things going on."
good,"enjoyable and interactive people at work"
good,"Verizon is a good place to work. There is plenty of room for career advancement. They pay their employees well. They are constantly changing the way they do business in order to keep up with the times."
good,great place to work. great work life balance. leadership was great. great benefits. overall it was a great experience with a lot of learning opprtunities.
good,"This is a great job to have especially for someone looking to start a career. They have amazing benefits, 401K and tuition reimbursement. I very much enjoyed working here but I had 2 young children at the time and they could've been a little more flexible when it came to things with them. Honestly I would probably still be working for them but we ended up having a family tragedy and moved across the country and couldn't get my transfer together fast enough."
good,Company offers great training opportunities for growth and advancement.  In addition they have outstanding benefits and compensation.The employees are great to work with and extremely dedicated.
good,"I worked at Verizon for over 21 years. The company pays well and has outstanding benefits. I learned a lot there and the training they put all employees through is top knotch! Verizon's tuition assistance helped me finish my Bachelor's degree AND start and complete my Master's degree, a truly outstanding benefit! I did last there for over two decades and was a proud employee of the company, that said for many years now Verizon has been cutting headcount and having regular layoffs. It's a great company to work for, just have a backup plan."
good,"Verizon was a good place to work. They made sure you had the correct training to be able to excel in the company. Work culture was really fun, my store we all were really close. The hardest part of the job is having a disability like I do they don't really care if you have a doctors note or anything like that I mean it is cooperate after all. But other then that It was a good place to work for."
good,"great company , very demanding but we had a great team. id love the chance to work for them again.  great pay great friends and a lot of hours. great team"
good,"Verizon is a great place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is camaraderie amongst the co-workers.  The hardest part is seeing co-workers leave, whether retiring or due to layoffs.   Management is laid back.  The expectations are high.  I have learned that work ethic is vital to any employees success with any company."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. The people are professional. Your objectives are clear and reasonably set and measured. Systems are somewhat antiquated considering Verizon is a technology solutions company.
good,Providing telecommunication services for hearing & speech impaired clients was very rewarding.  Company provided excellent benefit package. MCI acquired by Verizon during my employment.
good,At verizon theres always opportunities to grow and expand your career. The environment is fast paced and supervisors are always willing to answer questions if in need. training is extensive and gets you prepared for the job
good,Really good company to work for with excellent benefits and bonuses when goals met.  Excellent shifts but where based on tenure and performance in customer service and technical support.
good,Verizon allowed me to pay my bills and have a life outside of work.  I made some very good friends and built strong work relationships that have developed into strong friendships.  The work culture is somewhat supportive and very competitive.  The hardest part was unsatisified customers and the best part was that it allowed me to earn a living.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great employees, upper management only care about the sales, and the quality of the sales was going down because of the pressure of getting company 10% year over year grow."
good,"Verizon Wireless has lots of opportunities to grow and advance. The benefits are great as well.  Call center life is not glamorous, so if that's what you're looking for, this is not the job for you. They set expectations and they hold you to them.  One of the hardest parts of the job is a socializing at work, getting to know your coworkers because you are expected to be taking calls all day and you don't have 30 minutes or an hour to mingle throughout the day. One of the most rewarding parts of the job is the satisfaction of seeing how you are impacting one customer at a time."
good,"I might've stayed with the company had I been offered more competitive pay or given a chance to move into leadership sooner. The work on the phones was too stressful, after a year and a half I deeply dreaded going in to do the job."
good,"Verizon' workplace was competitive, though enjoyable, as follow peers helped with job duties."
good,"Verizon offers an amazing benefits package ,they match your 401 k 6%at 100 as well as educational $5000.00 tuition reimbursement. the medical insurance is amazing even for a family simply amazing!! "
good,It was a stable job and allowed me to provide for my family.I could work seven days a week if I wanted to which enabled me to make quite a bit of money.
good,The position was challenging and demanding while supporting Vice President and Executive Directors. Activities included handling executives calendar; preparing expense reports and simply making executives day run as smooth as possible.
good,"Overall the company is worth working for and you can find your happy place there. They have amazing benefits, great salary scales and are overall a very good employer. The people within are great and you definitely see a culture of friendship internally. "
good,Fair company with opportunities for growth.  Eight to five job where I was coordinating health and wellness programs for all employees.  Very supportive and valued health of employees.
good,"Programmed report-generating software"
good,"Call center very  fast pace high stress environment, due to nature of the business very high turn-over, very good concept with high regard for customers, can provide more options for loyal customers, motivation within environment"
good,Calls were consistent. Stressful because your performance was tied to ratings. To obtain advancement you would have to be willing to travel. My management was very good. Training was top notch.
good,"Verizon has been a great company to work for. The pay is competitive as well as the benefits. However, you are apart of a large corporation so you feel more like a number than an appreciated employee."
good,"Verizon has a competitive workplace with competitive pay and benefits.  Strong knowledge of the business ,technology and working hard is crucial to a successful career."
good,I worked for a great company for 10 1/2 years. I enjoyed customer service talking with people and business's helping them with any question. It was great to know different colleagues every 6 months along with supervisors. The incentives were great along with lunches and treats provided. They supported family with business very well.
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for, but the customer service role was difficult to enjoy. They take great lengths to ensure that you are not abused by customers, but it will still happen. I had started looking for other work when it became apparent that there was no advancement. Then the call center I was at was closed, and I was one of many who did not have the option for internet at my house to become a home based agent. I left before a solution could have been found because I felt it best for my family, but given that the management at Verizon took a real interest in the employee, I could see them having found one. I just could not risk the alternative. You bid for your shifts every 6-9 months, and its based on your rank amongst your peers. I worked nights and went to school in the morning so it never mattered a lot for me. The majority of people who work evenings don't rank well, which can be frustrating."
good,"I worked at Verizon full-time as a contract employee in the H&W department.  I enjoyed my job and all the people I interacted with, but my position had no chance of advancement or growth."
good,"Most days are fast paced day."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was a great company to work for due to the vision the company had and how the company treats their employees. the company in itself does promote from within
good,"I gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in the utility construction and fiber-optic industry."
good,Provided T2 support to technicians supporting FiOS broadcast video services. Hardware / software implementation. Troubleshooting complex issues. Collaborate with vendors on product enhancements and bug / fix resolution.
good,My daily work duties are monitoring active faults. Create work tickets from alarms . Isolating network outages. Creating company wide alert for network outages. scheduling traffic affecting planned work to resolve network faults and outages. Trained new hire employees.
good,Overall good place just hard when you have a huge family. Always room for advancement and the pay and benefits are good. The company wants you to learn and they will invest in you.
good,"Enjoyed working as a team member with Security department.  Some managers were very informative and learned from team.  Managed anywhere from 100 to 130 security officers, also enjoyed traveling to all sites to complete company audits."
good,"I enjoy the workplace culture at this job. The company has great values with a great corporate team. I learned professional, sales, and analytical skills. The hardest part of this job was meeting tasks expected.. such as completing ""x"" amount of calls trainings every day. This position also does not work well if you are only part time because it is hard to meet sales goals. If I could recommend anything  to this employer it would be to have bonus advancement opportunities for associates that have years with the company. Overall great place to learn communication and sales skills."
good,Overall I love the company it’s a great place to make new friends get to know people and send them out with new things that you know will  benefit them the work environment  is great and ovral it’s easy working for Verizon because we have the best network. Our product basically speaks for it self.
good,"I wanted to work in different field. I aplied for the job at verizon for sales Representative and I know which was very challenging. Transferring job from Restaurant Management to Sales associate was a challenge for me but I was leaded so right that I learned it on ease and became the best new coming salesman of the year. I was given an opportunity to be an assistant store manager where I succed to manage store in efficient way. The hardest part of the job used to be very long hours sometimes. The most enjoyable part cowerkers eating lunch together. Surprises bonuses by an owner."
good,"The company is very performance driven which helps to keeps things from becoming stagnant, and the compensation is excellent."
good,I was fortunate to have a great management team to work for my entire career at Verizon.  A great management team can make a big difference in the motivation within the work day.
good,"While working at HQ locations, Verizon provided me a good work/life balance, a mostly competitive salary, nice PTO and benefits, and a challenging job through the years."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. I have learned a lot from working with them. you have to have interpersonal skill to work for Verizon to better yourself
good,Good place to pitch your tent!  Once you have proved yourself they turn you loose to influence growth and support your assigned territories.  You have to stay on top of commission payments yourself if they are part of your bonus's.
good,"Very fast paced and quick thinking job. I learned a lot about critical thinking and creative problem solving."
good,"Verizon was a great experience and I learned a lot while working there. The only draw back about Verizon, and this is like any large company, is that you are constantly under the shadow of being RIF'd. That's a bummer, but a reality of large corporations."
good,"Great company enjoyed working there built a lot of great relationships"
good,"The job was not bad and the pay was great but the job itself is very stressful."
good,"Trots att företaget gick i Chapter 11 år 2000 och många namnbyten på vägen till nuvarande Verizon, var företaget ett bra och stabilt företag att jobba på."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon has good benefits and health plans.   Tuition  assistance gave me an opportunity to further advance my career.  Environment allows for collaboration among teams.
good,"Verizon is a very good company."
good,"Great benefits and competitive salaries"
good,Interact with customers about their phone necessities. Make sales and suggestions to customers. Cold calls on down time. Good environment with good co workers
good,A typical day at work was challenging. I liked learning and being able to see a project completed.  There were people at work that you could go to when you needed help getting to the route of a problem.  I also was more than willing to help my co-workers when they needed help too.  Management would go to the workers that could and would get the job done.  The hardest part of my job was trying to get our work schedule properly managed and equally divided.  The most rewarding part of the job was being able to successfully complete any task that was given to me along with helping other co-workers be able to do the same.  Also having a good salary & benefits package.
good,Verizon has been a fantastic place to work for the compensation/benefits and work life balance.  However the opportunity to career advancement is a detractor
good,The job challenges you to aim higher. The growth potential is there only if you are willing and able to relocate to their center's of excellence. The benefits are excellent as well as the starting pay and annual bonuses and raises. The company also give incentive bonuses based on your yearly performance.
good,"Help customers who have issues with Fios product. "
good,"Qorked for this company for nearly 7 years now. Always been treated well. I've been able to advanced my career and I would love to continue to work and advance with Verizon"
good,This is a great place to get started because they provide a lot of on your own training. If you can find a good manager and someone that knows the system it will make you successful.
good,"As management, I was required to review the previous days numbers with other leaders in the district to discuss what may have worked well and how to implement those actions moving forward.  Following a meeting with the sales staff for the day to discuss our plan to execute and maximize the day.  The most difficult aspect of the job would have been keeping the reps motivated to wanted to not only meet the goals, but exceed all expectations.  However, the most enjoyable to part was interacting the our clients and offering solutions to the wireless needs."
good,"Verizon is an excellent company that is going through many changes as the environment changes, the market changes and the wireless technology becomes more prevalent. "
good,"Very stressful environment, but the job does provide for your needs. Great staff. Must have strong mindset and thick skin to survive. Opportunity for advancement,  but difficult to obtain."
good,answering calls all day was sometimes overwhelming in addition to dealing with customers. If you are passionate about customer service it is a good company to work for. They had a lot of activities for the employees. benefits were good too. The schedule was not flexible with my school so that was the reason I left
good,The company has great benefits and chances to learn and grow as an individual. The company has great workers that sometimes are overlooked. Some management individuals do not get the praise they deserve and some are over praised. Would I return if given an opportunity? Yes.
good,"Enjoyed what I did. The culture at my location was great. I was a top performer. Most people who didn't like the job or how ""rigid"" it was  resulted from not being able to do the job or not trying to do the job. Everyone loved the pay/benefits but didn't want to work for them. I loved it there. However the company is going through major changes now"
good,"Verizon had a ping pong table, a walking track, and a workout gym. It was fun to come to work. I learned how to work with people in a pleasant way. This was a good company to work for."
good,"Working at Verizon has given me some great opportunities, work - life - balance.  I enjoyed working at the company, but feels like job security is minimal. At would like more job security as I am a hard worker and feel that I always put in 110%."
good,Company is looking for Voluntary head reduction and looking at my options. Been with company since June of 1989 with no regrets. Hoping to find company that is as good or better.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Very good company culture, promotes from within and steady benefits, employee evaluations and opportunities to advance."
good,Salary is good. Chance for upward movement is possible. they have good training in place for management and non management. Tuition reimbursement is great.
good,Was a great job with a lot of incentives. Learned a lot of technical support info. Management was excellent and really helped me to grow fast in the company. Most enjoyable part of this job was benefits and the co-workers.
good,I worked for Afni and Verizon was one of their clients. They had very good training and offered decent wages compared to other companies in the area. If you are looking for a quick-to-hire full-time job with benefits this is a great place to start.
good,"Verizon is obviously a large, wealthy company and treats its employees well. There is advancement beyond the retail level, but competitive. Store manager can easily average 6 figures. Great benefits and pay. I can't think of a retail job that pays nearly as well, maybe A&T Wireless."
good,"Overall great experience. A lot of things changed towards the end of my career.  Many management changes, people getting promoted that did not know how to do the job."
good,"One of the highest compensation packages in the cellular industry (Great 401k, Good medical, dental, Rx and vision).  Plenty of opportunity for growth"
good,"They do a great job at picking great candidates as sales reps.  I definitely received top notch sales training in a commission based environment.  I definitely honed my sales skills while working there.  I became more confident in my skills as a sales rep and realized my capabilities.  The management team is inconsistent at times and they don't always lead by example.  They praise the reps who are not deserving and don't sell with integrity, when that is one of the core values of the company.  It also seems like the management team spends more time with their own career development and advancing themselves instead of developing their reps to advance to the next level.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the bureaucracy being employed by a big corporation.  Sometimes it seems like there's a lot of red tape involved to get to the next level.  I enjoyed all of the people that I worked with."
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for. The company has gone through a tremendous journey as it has transferred its IT department from the beginning stages of computer technology and evolved to integrate with all the current technologies and tools. Like most large companies that have been around for a long time, it has an extensive embedded base of legacy systems and that has been one of the most difficult challenges... how to decouple the legacy from the new. "
good,"Pros"
good,"Verizon is building the future. With wireless becoming the main form of connectivity, they put resources into they’re infrastructure that lets them be the best year over year. If you’re looking for sales in a retail environment surrounding solution based selling this is the place to be. Delivering a superior customer service with everyone walking through the door. You will have your service customers who need basic phone help. You will be asked to sell to everyone. Drive the products Verizon has to position how their products can fit into the customers life."
good,Good place to work at. My co-workers were great and my supervisor was fair. You just can't be honest because it will cost you your job. It's a shame that that's the way their managers are with their employees.
good,"High functioning, fun environment.  You work hard and play hard."
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for 10 years. There was never any typical day when you work in such a fast pace environment. Your constantly meeting different people on a daily basis, building relationships and making sure that you provide excellent customer service while also being knowledgeable of the products and services. Management varied but for the most part there were managers who cared about their employees and had a desire to develop those interested in pursuing other positions within the company. There were also managers who were only interested in performance and chose to micro-manage. I worked with people whom I built great relationships with. We always had the desire to succeed, achieve our goals and help each other when necessary. We respected each other. The hardest part of my job was work/life balance. In Retail the hours of operation can be demanding and don't  always allow you to be available for family, sickness, holidays, etc. until you've been there long enough to earn the time needed to request specific time off. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and exceeded sales quotas as well as building relationships with my clients, managers and co-workers. Overall, I Loved my job and the overall culture and diversity Verizon has."
good,A good place to work but your responsibility is take care of your time. Lots of incentives to employees and bonus annually. Have the ability to move to different departments.
good,"Great company that focuses on integrity and a positive customer experience. Prices are high, but the best services always come with a price. Products are top of the line. Understanding and helpful co-workers. However, the work/life balance is somewhat unrealistic. Be prepared to have minimal time for other endeavors/hobbies and they are very strict about quota. Overall 9/10."
good,"Verizon was a great company. Management could have made things simpler so more metrics could have been made. Other then that, great experience and environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"wonderful customers and employees"
good,"I have enjoyed my time working for VZW. However, the last few years have had many restructuring and I was moved around twice. I have chosen to take severance this time and that is a great benefit as well."
good,"A typical day at work starts with reviews of prior days tickets.  We all work independently so it's left up to each rep to review and resolve issues of the prior day. "
good,"It was fun working at Verizon. I met a lot of people who turned into family. They offer a lot of discounts, perks, and benefits. I enjoyed the health and wellness activities, as well. The gym is onsite."
good,"This was a great company to work for, the advancement opportunities were plentiful. You must be careful of snakes as in any job or career, the manager felt threatened by my presence and I gave him a way to backdoor me unbeknownst to me."
good,"Excellent working team, extensive training program and fair management evaluations."
good,"Verizon is the place to be if you're interested in making a difference both personally and professionally:"
good,"They really are a great company. You get great discounts and you will have awesome benefits.  The hours are guaranteed. The lunch breaks are an hour. The uniforms are chill. www.verizonwireless.com, check it out yourself."
good,Verizon is a great place to work with competitive salaries and excellent health benefits. Recently there have been some structural changes within the company and overall morale has been affected
good,Gained a lot of good experience here. A lot of opportunities to experience new technologies and work on projects at the forefront of communications development.
good,if you are in sales this would be a great job. its fairly easy but stressful at the same time as you are pressured to meet certain quotas every month  which determine how much money you make and ultimately if you are ever to advance in the company
good,"Verizon Great opportunity to test my skills. As a contractor you got left out of Team building evets.  "
good,Provide for a good place to work! Excellent support and tools to do your job. Relaxed environment! Provided proper management team for support! Always good opportunities for jobs!
good,"Verizon is a high pressure company focused on results.  As with any company it all depends on who you work for.  Verizon is a technology leader and strives to maintain that position."
good,"Verizon stands by its credo., and core values. "
good,Verizon benefits are GREAT.  Management was always fair when making decisions ---- Competitive environment --- paid holidays and vacation -- professional environment --- Good place to work because of the experience
good,I worked for Verizon as a Customer Service Representative/Technician in several of their stores.  The work atmosphere is very stressful and micromanaged.  There was a lot of pressure to upsell to every customer that we assisted. Customers could be very rude and demanding.  There was a lot of competition and issues between employees trying to meet their quota.  If quota was not met the managers would write the employee up and if this happened 3 times the employee faced termination.
good,"Fast pace hard work , enjoyment in customer and work. Tough but fair management. Most enjoyable part is the friendly people. Hardest part of the job is working in any climate"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,good hourly pay and competitive earnings for sales. nice quiet and stress free environment. good employee training for new starting employees. Its a great way to earn a living.
good,"Good Company ,Great people and a good work environment. Will recommend as a place of employment. No public transportation so that makes it hard to access."
good,"Working in a Verizon store is very exciting , thing are always changing . There are always new product coming out every week, it is exciting to keep up with technology. Verizon start every day by trying to please every customer and sell to their needs."
good,"I loved working there, but they relocated all Finance to Florida so after 16 years I had to say goodbye. A shame they didn't value the talent they had enough to keep people in place instead of going for a cheap young workforce resulting in a loss of knowledge and expertise and lots of turnover."
good,"Good pay and benefits bad schedule and high stress level.  Back to back phone calls, numerous changes to day to day duties.  Benefits and pay are the reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,Fast paced environment and time flew by.  Enjoyed having a variety of tasks and working with a global team.  Management was supportive and training available to learn new things for advancement opportunities.
good,"This company cares about its' employees. They offer competitive pay and benefits. The culture is diverse, friendly, and engaging. I've learned a lot about customer service."
good,"Very good benefits and reasonable pay. Very good training. Culture pretty relaxed. Hardest part of job is just being on phone majority of the time which will obviously come with escalations. Could see how some could get burnt out on this type of job, but some may not. Also, good amount of time off given for vacation/sick sick time. Company does seem to be in a restructuring process, though. My call center closed along with several others. So, biggest criticism is job security. But overall, I had a very good experience with my time at the company."
good,"work life is great if you can keep up with quotas, "
good,was a great place to work. learned a lot in my time there. don't love the new management but that is to be expected anywhere.  marketing team is awesome
good,"While Verizon can be a great company to work at, the company always tries to change in order to maximize profits. This makes sense as it is dependent on sales of its services in order to thrive. The company has great benefits even if you're part time. However, if you're anything but sales, there may come a time that they will dissolve your position and lay you off. The good news about this is that when they laid me off, they gave a great severance package and do try their best to find a new position for you. Some of the issues also come with the company culture which talks a lot about teamwork but in reality, it can get pretty cut throat. There is also the possibility that they will call you in on a day off just for a single customer."
good,"This company can be everything you ever want in a career wrapped up in one organization. The best thing about working in the VZW environment is that you can start down one career path but have the ability and opportunity to move into other fields of work or areas of concentration based on the needs of the business. Because the company is so large and goes through regular reductions in force and re-organizations, if you are mobile and open to learning new responsibilities you can advance quickly to middle or upper management positions. However, once you find a location that you would like to ""settle down"" and stay for an extended period of time you MUST be skilled and capable in the functional groups and positions available in your region/area if you want to have secure long term employment."
good,Management worked with employees to ensure we had flexibility to complete our jobs.  Work with internal and external customers to provide excellent customer service.
good,"The company was ecstatic about growth and development, especially from within. By day one I was challenged with new learning opportunities that helped me develop my skills as a sales leader. Verizon provided me with the basis that would be my sales career thus far."
good,"I absolutely loved my Sales position at Verizon. My boss was outstanding and always very supportive, and encouraging. The workplace environment at times was a little tense, as is any commission based career."
good,"Overall, great company. Period.  I would recommend to any smart and energetic person willing to adapt to change at any time to apply.  There are a lot of great opportunities available at Verizon."
good,I loved my job but didn't necessarily care for some of the managers that would micro-manage. Also the company looked for outstanding employees but if you failed in one area they would be all over you with a write up.
good,"Verizon was a great place to work, good environment, immediate rewards for extra sales and good customer satisfaction reports. Unfortunately they do make sudden business decisions."
good,"Verizon is a great place to gain sales experience. Offers good benefits, 401k savings plan, and tuition assistance for those who wish to further their education."
good,"Definitely a great place to start off your career in Telecom and Management."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,It was fun. The supervisors were too hands on. But overall it was great. Large work areas. Quiet rooms for when you need a break.  Lockers for your personal items...closed in work areas..all call centers should have that but with high walls.
good,"Verizon provides great benefits and services.  Good office work environments. Due to market shifts, changes, and needs job security not as secure as in the past."
good,"The only downside is the longer you are in a position the harder it becomes to get promoted or advance. Your best bet if you want to advance in bounce around every couple years. Once they find you good at something they have a hard time letting you go. Seniority is not really looked at for advancement. Great benefits and the pay is on par. The work can be redundant but it is rewarding and can help spring board you to your next career. Excellent training, very little to actually promote progression and advancement."
good,"Everyday the opening manager unlocked the building, ran an inventory check, looked at the daily goals and posted them for the sales representatives that came in later that day. "
good,Verizon was a very good company to work for and offered very competitive benefits.  Verizon is a forward-thinking company that had the ability to continuously diversify to keep up with a competitive landscape.
good,"Overall, it was a great work environment.They offer plenty employee benefits that allow for work/life balance. Employee training is consistently updated and it ensures that employees are very knowledgeable about products and services."
good,"As a contracted PM, I was given exceptional compensation. I was also granted flexibility and management had full confidence in me and my abilities. I was also able to and did work remotely 100% as I was a virtual PM. The only drawback was that contractors were not treated very well insofar as we were excluded from team building activities and events."
good,"It is challenging at times and there are a lot of expectations to meet, but you get to meet a lot of new types of people and interact with a lot of customers."
good,The company is amazing to work for my issuesare with my immediate supervisor. She was childish and caused a lot of drama. Her supervised played favorites and allowed this typeof environment
good,"You can work for yourself, although you have to meet daily goals. It’s achievable if you’re working in a good location with lots of foot traffic. I enjoyed my time at Verizon and would work for them again if given the opportunity."
good,A typical work day was very challenging and exciting. We needed to meet a daily goal while helping customers with any issues that they had. Maintain the store appearance and daily inventory. Management was always helpful and provided us with all the tools and information to get the job done and for us to exceed expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to help customers and teach them about the culture and products while learning as well.
good,Verizon helped me to further my skills and training.  Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to move to another department before I was laid off.
good,Working for Verizon wireless I had to learn the business and how to run a business. It has also gave myself great customer service on multiple levels. Knowing product knowledge so when asked questions you would know it on the spot. Working with B2B and Small Medium Business and understanding how to help with are communities with youth plus the homeless. How to have a great work place culture plus keep it fun everyday. Working to find ways when customers are upset or unhappy with product or policy. Working with great people and having fun while doing it is great and make the workplace enjoyable.
good,Really enjoyed working at Verizon. Always challenged with interesting projects that allowed you to feel that you made a difference. Many opportunities to learn and grow. Always changes either in your responsibilities or management which kept things fresh.
good,typical day would be selling the products inas walk ins came into the store. Handled payments and helped make sure service and experience always went well. Also to ensure the customer always left with a smile.
good,"They are focused on continuous improvement.  Verizon gives people the opportunity to improve as well.  If you are looking for a dynamic workplace that is ever-changing, this is it."
good,"overall a great place to work it has its pros and cons but salary and benefits outweighs the cons. the job had great benefits, meals, paid time off, holiday pay"
good,Great commission structure and great pay out. Verizon gives you the opportunity to earn as much as you can with all the tools you need to succeed. There is a lot of opportunity for upward movement. Great teams to work with as well.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The overall company is pretty good and takes care of it's employees, the management at certain levels has issues. but no one is perfect.  They offer career advancement and reimbursement for school"
good,"Great company, challenging and fast paced. I enjoyed being apart of a team where I could develop career skills and work towards bettering my position."
good,"Very little training is available except “on line” which they expect you to do on line after hours. Problem being a normal work day can expand to ten hours or more. There is little or no consideration in this regard for the employee who cannot spend extra time in the office, since training must be completed on computers logged into on premises connected to secure systems."
good,"a good place to work with fast paced technology.  great place to learn new skills in relation to telecom, no matter what position one has.  very competitive."
good,I revived my MBA with no loans.  They are all about Results. They have high expectations that is why you get a high producing employee from VZW.  They also have the best benefits and are concerned about the employees.
good,Overall the environment was easy to adapt to. Management seemed to care. People were friendly and the job opportunity was good. The best part of the job is you are always busy and you get something new to work on each month or so.
good,Verizon is ahead of everyone else in the wireless industry. Very detail oriented and KPI driven. Can be high pressure and is not for everyone. Good people to work with!
good,"Job security went down the drain, so I retired. but had great benefit/. advance opportunity are hard to obtain, especially if you dont know anyone. Your hard work didnt take you dar"
good,"It is a relaxed environment and you usually make friends with all the coworkers, even with management, whether you're tech head or not. If you're into sales and it's a career path you truly want, go for it. If it isn't something you're looking forward to, then at least use it as an opportunity to develop some interpersonal skills, which is what I can accredit to the company. The hard part of the job is, of course, the customers. People can be skittish, ungrateful, or even unreasonably harsh, especially towards salespeople. Along with the requirements to sell certain products that don't really have much value or need while holding your commission hostage can be quite distressing. However, not all customers are bad, most can be enjoyable to talk to while you set their account. And as I said, the job does help develop interpersonal communication skills and it is still good pay if you can make a good commission check."
good,"As normal  as every work day. I learned how to manage high work and life balance and some of new interesting topic about my work."
good,Verizon is a very good place to start up a career. Multiple avenues for ongoing education and if your open to relocation there are several career advancement opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed my career at Verizon. I had as many opportunities as I was willing to find for advancement, The management culture was welcoming and supporting."
good,Verizon is a good place to work. The benefits are some of the best offered. Job can be stressful at times as with any customer facing job. Schedules change every 6 months. Tenure and performance dictate schedule.
good,"Daily i would come in earlier in order to prep the day with printing the new promotions sheet, update goals, get goals sheets ready to have my one-on-one`s with my reps."
good,Many well managed meetings to cover all aspects of the project status.   Lots of available resources to rely on.  Very friendly and professional environment.
good,We we're in the same building as Comcast work as a call center agent billing taking payments cutting service on cutting service off technical issues answering questions it was an okay environment the manager I had was nice and I have nothing bad to say about the company
good,"A typical day at work included receiving my work load for the day. Interacting with customers to provide them with satisfactory service."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working with Verizon.  It was a fast-paced environment usually consisting of multiple meetings per day and the remainder of the time managing projects and tasks.  Typically it is not a 40 hr work week, and work/life balance is often challenging. The quality of management varies from group to group.  It's a competitive work environment which results in figure pointing and a lack of accountability.  Management played defense, rather than offense.  I did enjoy the professional atmosphere and the people I interacted with on a daily basis."
good,"I would go in and make sure the store is ready for when customers arrive at the store, and by this I would see if all the displays were working, making sure no trash was laying around, all lights are working, and that all accessories rack are full."
good,"Very Busy call center, no down time in between calls. Must be very accurate on all breaks and lunches in reference to logging in & out of the system timely. No compassion from management, they are all about numbers. I learned a lot about the technical industry and they provided you with an extreme amount of training. Also they paid 100% of tuition is paid for if you plan to go to college. Overall it is a great company to work for."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,One the best companies but please be prepared for constant change and updates within. I have learned and grown so much working here that I know I'll be equipped and qualified to handle my next venture
good,"Our segment didn't have much management oversight.  We were at liberty to work our own way at our own pace.  Attire reflected the laid back atmosphere.  Jeans and a polo are the normal outfit on the floor.  Hardest part of the job came in 2018 when we acquired over 30% more sales representatives, and we had sold off Florida, Texas, and California.  This made the sales pond much smaller, with lots of hungry fish."
good,"I started out in sales, moved into management, then later progressed into training.  I really enjoyed the job.  I was hoping to retire from VZW.  "
good,"Verizon had a nice atmosphere.  They kept their employees motivated with incentives and games. I liked working with the company, their hours just didn't fit my home life with two small kids at home at the time."
good,"If you live anywhere in United States where the surrounding population is over 100,000 people you will love it. You just need steady customer base in the given or chosen area."
good,". Non stop work up to 10 hours per day"
good,"employee appreciation days, nice cafeteria options, good breaks and benefit. great training not rushed and they prepare you well before throwing you to the wolves."
good,The office space is nice and comfortable. I work from home once a week which is good. Most of my team is remote so hard to work together via conference calls.
good,Working in the offline portion of the call center is the best place in my opinion. The atmosphere was business casual and the work  was consistent. The hardest part was balancing the required productivity numbers and providing 100% quality assurance at the same time.
good,Verizon is a great company to work at and it was very fun and fast paced. I learned a lot during the time I was there. I feel like I could have advanced in the company had I not been laid off.
good,Don't get caught up with slow movers. Always be looking to move up or lateral.............The company appreciates hard work. Lot of perks. Would love to go back.
good,"Good colleagues and good work life balance, great culture and team work. Equipment used are good, clean workplace. Great benefits. Bad thing is too concentrated on stats"
good,"Have gained great knowledge working among experienced people. Working with those people was fun and they showed friendly attitude."
good,i loved it. I trained new reps & watched them grow. taking escalated calls was very challenging. the culture was great. There was always something to de-stress the day to day activity.
good,Great place with great opportunities. Advancement became stagnant due to other centers closing down. Amazing work life balance that I have yet to come across in any company.
good,"I think with better management it would have been a better place to work.  Sometimes people get promoted up the line and they aren’t ready.  Anyway, It was ok."
good,Verizon is a fast-paced and continuously changing work environment that keeps up with the demands of the global needs of its customers and digital performance.
good,"Verizon provided the salary, benefits, and time off to live a comfortable life. They treat their employees with respect and the culture is supportive, collaborative and fun (most of the time). However, the company is shrinking and advancement is difficult without being willing to relocate often. I would have stayed if I hadn't been laid off."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing at this place. My role was extremely flexible with work life balance which was my main motive for sticking around.
good,Its was great. training was great. the pay okay but I was working sub-contract business not literally Verizon......................................................................
good,Verizon Wireless is a great place to work. The benefits are great plenty of PTO and employee discounts. I will say the management is very lack luster. I was in the same position for a long time due to crabs in a barrel. No matter how hard people try the only way out of my department was to leave the company. Outside of that you will have a blast working for the company.
good,"Days went fast and were very busy with tracking 150 to 250 projects at any given time. From calls from customers with existing system needing to be maintained to new customers calling for a new solution. I learned to multitask and work with a large variety of people and teams often with totally conflicting goals. Learning to balance the competing goals was often a delicate and difficult task.  In general the upper management allowed me to do my job as I thought best. Open door policy always gave me the option to ask for help when needed which I usually got.  "
good,The only way to get through the day is to capitolize on every easy happy interaction (it so much easier to sell something whe you are liked or respected) and turn every negative interaction into a good one solve the problem.
good,"Overall Verizon was a good company.  They provided great benefits and decent opportunity for advancement.  I wouldn't highly recommend, just recommend"
good,Great company with a lot of great benefits.  They do a large amount of training due to the continuous change in the business the hardest part of the job would have to be the hours but the pay was very good and over time was even better And the atmosphere of the different store locations was always quite pleasant
good,"Verizon wireless is a great company to work for. They have awesome benefits with opportunities to grow within the business. Every job has good and bad mangers. The company is a who you know based company, not what you know, and that can be very frustrating at times. If you get a great supervisor that wants you to grow and you listen, you will go far within the business."
good,"Verizon is a large company and slow to move.  It has a telecom culture of go to the office every day and little mobility with-in the company.  It has great benefits including a fitness center in many of its locations.  Leave vacation, personal and sick are very good.  Vacation starts at 2wks and goes up after many years of service to 3 and 4."
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon and the people I worked with.  The benefits were good and there was training available.  Work wasn't too stressful and projects are well documented.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"I enjoyed my 18 year career at Verizon.  They have strong leadership, great benefits and competitive pay. The leadership team expects results, but are fair and provide the tools needed to succeed."
good,"This was the first company that trained me in call center experience, I learned a lot about customer service and handling escalations here as well as the team like atmosphere."
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for 19 years. I started in customer service, moved on to technical support, spent a year in sales, transitioned to the credit review team and worked my way from rep to supervisor in that department (and the many iterations it went through over the years). If you've worked in a call center before then you understand the atmosphere. Lots of people working lots of different shifts, very noisy, fast paced and at times very entertaining. Also, very stressful (at times), repetitive, sometimes lofty goals and expectations are set (which can change monthly so getting used to change is essential from day one.)"
good,"Love the company at first, and especially love the people I worked with. Company compensated you well, and the benefits were amazing. If people up top didn't make poor decisions because of greed the company will still be great."
good,"From 2000 to 2017 - I was a Implementation Manager for the Verizon Enterprise Ordering team.  The office environment experience was pleasant. There wasn't much time to socialize in the office due to the number of Enterprise / Medium / Small domestic and global implementation projects I was responsible for at Verizon.  It was the same for the entire ordering team.  We were responsible for coordinating and scheduling sometimes several activation and being on conference calls for each customer at all times of the day and night overseeing each activation.  It was a fast pace environment to say the least.  Because I interacted with all levels of management, both internal and customer base I became very confident at my job.  All the managers I had the opportunity to work under at Verizon were very fair and encouraged a take charge attitude.  The hardest part of the job was the 250 e-mails I received each day from internal departments, but mostly from customer project managers.  And, scheduling circuit activation's at all times of the day and night."
good,It's like any other sales position; it is all about sales and numbers at the end of the day. The managers are always dictating sales dollars and meeting quota.  It soon stopped feeling like it was about the customers
good,"I enjoyed my job with all the different customers "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,verizon is great place to work if you don't  have bills very comparative with great benefits to take advantage off. great company friendly people and great culture
good,Lots of training provided to complete on own and virtual classes.  Terrific benefits.  50% off mobile usage and discounts on accessories. There was rarely job postings for my city.
good,"It is very good company, We can learn more. I love my job. The hardest part is my wife is in dubai, i m in chennai. for that only i am looking job in dubai."
good,Enjoy the fast pace and pay is great there is very little support and room to grow with cellularsales  Overall I give the job a good rating because of money and flexablilty with scrdule
good,"Verizon pays well, and is a good place to work overall.  However, if they also have have pretty regular lay-offs in certain lines of business.  I would stay away from work in the Telecom business unit"
good,"This industry has changed much over the years. Less of a sales job as previous years with no 2 year contracts. Instead all financed device payments mostly, which involves much math that most people get confused about. If you are a peoples person you will do great! If not, stick to a cubicle."
good,This is a very fast paced and challenging place to work.  You need to be able to multi-task to succeed.  The company has reorganization too often and reduction in force.  I never intended to leave the company but was caught by reduction in force.
good,"Good job fun but stressful good pay great benefits, a lot of hours can make your money if you are willing to work for it!, great people sometimes you may have to move to another store"
good,Great place to start a sales career and to gain experience in a rigorous field. Loved the weekly training sessions to stay on top of the new products and plans. Great co-workers.
good,Managers always on your back forcing you to shove products that customers don't want/need down their throats just to push sales.  Pay was sufficient plus they have a great tuition assistance program.
good,It was fun working in this company plus the benefits and salary package are good. I have enhanced both my technical skills and customer service with the help of this company.
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers.  You will work with every type person, from professionals to artist to blue collar workers to retired people.  I enjoyed finding and supplying their needs."
good,Definitely gained much needed knowledge to advance in company and future career opportunities. Management and retail team was definitely a pleasure to work with.
good,"Good place to work.  Had a positive experience.  Would recommend to others.  Retail sales is tough, the industry has become a lot more competitive and has put pressure on Verizon."
good,"overall Verizon was good, payed competitively. my team of co workers that i was placed with were great. benefits were good. they had a ton of training available."
good,The Team collaboration was good and the company environment was friendly. Team lead supported a lot. The equipment required for the project was provided sufficiently.
good,"It was an IT network job 24X7X 365. Fast paced high energy."
good,This is a good company to work with. Training was fairly easy to learn and apply with customers on the work floor. This company in my opinion was a great help with my customer service skills.
good,Very much a team oriented environment and they do what they can to make it easy for anyone to communicate with corporate and feel like they are heard.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Learned how to review accounts and read customers to find personalized recommendations for their needs. Sometimes felt a little pushy but that can be the nature of commission based companies.
good,"Fantastic job and company prior to last merger.  GTE was the best, Verizon with Bell Atlantic merger was also very good.  When a company starts outsourcing and selling states and doing away with services it does not make for a good outcome."
good,"Very challenging projects, exceptional Group Manager and very strong supportive, Group Director. "
good,work days were always productive and educational. Always something new to learn whether it be installation or repair. The company is always growing proving new ways to get customer quality service. management is fairly decent despite the politics betwwen the union and the company. the hardest part of the job is working in bad condition which were out of the conpanys control. interacting with customer to make sure they are satified with the companys product and the work performed.
good,I rather not provide any reviews of my company. I am looking for part time additional work to provide my family additional finances for extra curricular activities.
good,"Verizon is being challenged by the transition from existing as a growth company to the product becoming a commodity.  Everyone in the US who needs a mobile device has one.  The market is saturated, and the differentiator will be technology and services.  Verizon is working on dominating those categories, but until they do, margins are thin and budgets are tight. They remain the technology leader - 5G, SDN, NFV, LTE - and that leadership will continue."
good,"check emails talk to customers, discuss voice traffic."
good,"Already entered this information about this Company. Please review it and copy and paste the information. "
good,Verizon remains at foremost a technology driven company with high ethical standards. Most impressed by the integrity of management. The industry has become commoditized and growth limited to product innovation. Product innovation is challenging at a large company when speed is critical.
good,"I found during my employment with Verizon Wireless, that the statement ""The Future is Yours!"" was truly the case.  I started as a temporary employee and was soon hired as a full-time employee and moved to the call-in center as a representative.  Excel worksheet shortcuts that I produced to help me efficiently and quickly calculate prorates and other billing calculation questions for customers were noticed and quickly evaluated and implemented for other representatives to use.  Overtime was open at all times whenever need.  When I need time off due to illness for me or my family it was given.  I would recommend Verizon Wireless to anyone who can work without being micromanaged and has an ambitious, ""go get them"" attitude."
good,Verizon was a great place to learn how to manage people and time. They provided excellent training and workshops to prepare you for handling employee and customer issues. They focus on customer care and providing excellent service
good,Its a great place to work with flexible schedules and good benefits. the training is also superior to others. good amounts of time off walking in the door.
good,"Great Place to work if you have a good manager. Though networking for advancing your career can be tough, meaning you really have to know people. Culture is very fast paced."
good,The hardest part of the job was the hours and the inability to get time off for vacations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you worked with and the customers you met over the phone.
good,"I enjoyed my work at Verizon and would work there again if possible."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. I learnt a lot of new things here. New technology, challenging projects and above all how to work in a fast paced environment."
good,Great benefits when I was there. Company culture is positive. Promotion opportunities via sales experience. Solid comp plan and rewards opportunities for sales also.
good,Objectives change daily and weekly so everyone was kept on their toes.  It was a competitive environment but everyone still worked together to get their job done each day.
good,"I loved the environment. Always a push to learn and achieve more. Co-workers were always helpful. Management treated us well in our department (unlike TMO). If I had the chance to work there again, I would."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"answer incoming calls, call be monitored and graded, moved around in different teams quarterly, hardest part reaching daily goals. environment was good, team oriented."
good,Verizon has great benefits.  Verizon could work on their work life balance because as a manager I am expected to be active 7 days per week including when you're on vacation.  Pay is very good.
good,"no comment, great  experience I enjoyed the experience very much. I especially enjoyed helping the customers and the fast paste of the job. I had a great experience."
good,Typical day varies. You must sell contracts and phones but it isn't too hard. You meet some nice people and management is awesome. You have a lot of freedom also which is nice.
good,my typical day at work starts with team meeting and the tasks to be completed within deadline. I have learned how to compete with others for points which are awarded based on type of work submitted.
good,Sales representative selling to all new business in assigned territory. all business to business prospects selling wireless communication devices. Division closed.
good,"It was a good place to work and hectic during the day and less"
good,"Overall it was a great work environment. Verizon really takes ownership of the work environment and culture to facilitate an awesome experience as an employee. The deterrent for myself was the way the company treats customers, and even worse the expectations on the employees to treat customers poorly. I could not get behind this part of the company, so I left. But working there besides that was good. You cannot controll your schedule though. Schedules are reliant on shift bids, as a church goer I do not work Sundays and I was told I better win the shift bid so I could go to church... otherwise I would have to work Sundays if I lost the bid for that shift. In my eyes that is wrong, for religious purpose. But I understand their culture is that you have to be good enough at your job to bid for the ""better shifts""."
good,"non stop work day from start to finish"
good,"Competitive, yet fun experience working with teammates. Great benefits does come with job enrollment, I did learn a lot about competition between large businesses, as well as about products."
good,Verizon Wireless offer's one of the best competitive compensation and benefits package in the industry.  One of the best companies I've worked for in my career.
good,"Verizon is a good company for someone who wants opportunity for advancement, and to build a career. The company offers extensive health benefits, competitive pay, tuition reimbursement, and great discounts on their products and services. Sales has become more difficult to flourish because of unreasonable goals set by higher management, which has lead to a more competitive, cutthroat work environment. In my experience, management cared more about the store numbers than helping their employees succeed. Verizon is overall a good company, however it does need to implement new coaching techniques for their management team so their can be a more positive work environment in the store channel."
good,"Great pay, benefits. Hours are contingent on call volume. Little to no room for advancement. Great job if you can handle high pressure, stressful and fast past environment that is always changing within the competitive field. The office atmosphere can be stressful but fun depending on your office and management."
good,"I learned your attitude may effect your job performance. It is important to have a positive uplifting attitude. Respect everyone and respect their authority, should they be in position of authority. We are all part of the same team working together. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with wonderful people. The hardest part was maintaining professional courtesy when customers were hurtful and disrespectful. You cannot take things personally. Be confident. Work smarter, not harder. A typical day at work consisted of arriving to work as scheduled, performing job at a professional skillful level, taking assigned breaks and lunches. Meeting job and office objectives."
good,"The pay and benefits were great!  You just didn't really have time for family and/or personal needs.   When different phones would launch, we would have to set up for the rush of people so we would end up staying til 12am sometimes, then have to be right back before 5 am to manage the crowds.  Pay was awesome, but it is like we lived at the store."
good,"Verizon Wireless is a great place to work. They pay well, have awesome benefits and the environment is very positive. Their training is extensive and they treat their employees very well."
good,"The fact that I was answering calls at a call center was my only real issue. There is too much sitting, I need to be moving around. All of the managers were great, except one"
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for. They provide ample opportunities for career advancement., educational improvement and additional training that you may not get with other companies."
good,"I have been retired for 15 years ( retired at 30 yrs of service) so I'm pretty sure many changes have occurred since I left. Vacations and choice of hours went by senority, but you could change shifts with others an request specific days off for appts. etc. I was also Involved in the union as a steward and then an area vice president sitting in on bargaining."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overall great company, provided coaching and training to get you to the next level. Compensation was good. Recognition For outstanding performance consistently given including trips, Christmas parties, ect."
good,Verizon Arena is a good place to work although working security is sporadic and dependent on season. The people I work with are fun to work with and from the same background as myself (military associated). Its not a job for everyone but everyone could do the job.
good,good place to work but frustrated by constant reorgs and changing direction/business strategy.  There was also very little opportunity for advancement
good,"The work was very fast paced, challenging and demanding of strategic thinking, customer service and commitment to quality.  Because of the time demand in conflicted with my ability to finish an undergraduate program. Finisihing that program was of utmost importance to me so I elected to leave the company to facilitate school completion."
good,"I thought it was controlled, you knew everyday was a day of meeting"
good,"Overall a great place to work especially for a first job. Good sales experience as well. The opportunities for advancement feel limited to retail. The people in retail have been there many years typically before working a regular schedule. Meetings every morning don't feel super productive, but my coworkers and management are very good people, good to work with."
good,Verizon Wireless offers great pay and benefits but the retail hours required can make for a difficult work/life balance. It is a demanding job that will leave you exhausted at the end of the day.
good,I worked for Verizon and associated telephone companies for 31 years. They provided excellent pay and security with excellent benefits. i supervised installation and repair with 18 technicians.
good,"Great company..  I only wish the vision and roadmap were clearer. Seems like we are making one step forward and 5 steps back.  The indecision and some not so strong decisions made at the Senior and Upper Management level really drained lots of resources, cash and now put the company in not such a strong position.  Bottom line is there will be cuts of headcount as a consequences of not so strong decision in past few years."
good,It was a great company and I enjoyed the work culture. Verizon lacked benefits that was one of its biggest down falls. having no 401k no health insurance while having a growing family made it really hard to look at Verizon as a career.
good,I worked for the company for a year. I had to relocate but in that time my transfer was per stress. The manager at the time did not like me and try everything in his power to make me stay. The company so called went on a freeze and they expected for me to move back when i already signed a new lease. It was stressful and heartbroken but i actually don't mess the place due to pressure they pushed in a nice way to sale items i wouldn't buy.
good,"Verizon is very productive, but at the same time they allowed you to work at your own pace. Very little micro managing took place, left you on your own and as long as you meet certain quotas and criteria, you were good. Only problem was when they transferred our department out of state."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits. Verizon provides its employees with great benefits health/vacation/and schedule flexibility.  This type of flexbility makes it easier to have a nice work and life balance
good,The 10 years with Verizon helped me learn face to face sales in a fast paced environment. My benefits were excellent and I'm very grateful for what it provided for my family.
good,I am blessed to work with great people. I have been very fortunate to have been with this company for an extended period of time.  The company has been very good to me and also my family.
good,Really enjoyed working there. People are great to work with.  I enjoyed the atmosphere of the people and the place was family friendly.  Opportunity to grow.
good,"VZW is a great company to work for.  Great Pay, Great benefits, and all the training you could ever want.  Even managers will help coach you to be better."
good,"Will always have work. Great management and communication with employees and customers. Great place to learn different types of things. Lots of data entry, but a great place to improve."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I would recommend working with this company, fair with salary, benefits and work environment. I had the pleasure of working with the company for over 29 years."
good,"I get to work with a very diverse team, that ensures that we all meet our goals. "
good,"It would come and go in waves. There were certain days when there was not a lot of traffic thru the door, and on others it was very busy. Needed to be able to answer questions on multiple levles for customers and be able to help troubleshoot at times. Was a team environment to a certain extent where you were able to go to others when you had questions, coworkers were almost always willing to help. Managers were willing to help motivate you if you were struggling or had questions."
good,"Working at VerizonWireless enable me to blossom into the Cyber Security field. Here I was able to Performed Security Event Logging and monitoring, Defined signatures that generated alerts based on different thresholds, Performed vulnerability assessments, and SOX based audits as well as a host of other responsibilities that inspired me to focus on this field."
good,"it was work at the time, had its up's and down's but I am willing to give it a go again. I am a family man and I am in need of a job to further my career"
good,"They are shifting, markets are unstable. Good for starting your career but it is very uncertain.  They change policies and standards overnight. You need to have a plan b always"
good,"The work life balance was optimal and they really place an emphasis on diverse opinions and cultures giving all people involved a chance to learn, grow and provide their opinions. It is hard being a transparent company when it is so large, but Verizon communicates as clearly as possible. The hardest part was my company was acquired by Verizon and we were not sure of our job security for the longest time. The most enjoyable aspect was the benefits. Amazing benefits."
good,Excellent company when it comes to pay and benefits. The only down fall to company is when people get placed in positions they don't deserve so the culture that was once strong can be affected. Other than that a GREAT COMPANY!!!
good,Great place to gain experience and also having to opportunity to make some great money.  A great place to seek job growth and take advantage of their great benefits
good,I have already provided a review for Verizon and will not provide another one. See previous review of Verizon as this whole process is too time consuming.
good,Verizon is the place to work for those in search of a career.  I worked there for 23 years and only left because I was eligible for early retirement and the properties in Indiana were sold to Frontier.  and I would have lost all of my retiree health care benefits.
good,"I love working at Verizon, the way you can make as much money as you want was always the motivation for me. The management across the company needs to be looked at. I would go back to work for Verizon if they reached out to me again."
good,Good Company to work with. Promotes growth. since it has a global footprint it has an amazing blend of cultures. Ethics is something thats strictly followed and i appreciate that!
good,It is good company to work for. The work culture and work life balance is good. Again it actually depends on the team which you are aligned to. The yearly hike is descent enough.
good,"If you have to work in a call center, you will be hard pressed to find a better one.  Management is nice and willing to help when needed.  Pay is good.  As always, customers suck."
good,"Awesome company but it varies depending on your location and management. Some locations could have everything in place and running smoothly while others could be completely in disarray. The benefits, pay and perks I feel are above average and Verizon is always looking to transcend boundaries so the company itself is amazing. Work/life balance can become a challenge but most management are very understanding when it comes to personal matters and life. I'd over rate this company very high in my book but could always be better."
good,"Was a great environment, with many benefits to being apart of the team. The company provided a comfortable atmosphere, and allowed each employee the freedom to be themselves."
good,Great company to work for but the market is shifting and if you're not mobile to move for promotions then you maybe suck in your current role.  Would really like to see Verizon bring some of their new business ventures to the Indianapolis area.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Your co workers are what makes Verizon Great! The schedules are what makes it difficult. You don't have time to complete the things that you need to do because you have tasks that could or can be done differently with more efficiency.
good,"Fun, busy, stressfull at times, good pay and discounts.  Have to have a lot of cell phone knowledge, good customer service skills. "
good,"Opportunities to make a lot of money in Rexburg, it's one of the top paid tops I believe, good coworkers, management was bad. A lot to learn with transactions."
good,Verizon is a great company for those willing to work hard. The benefits and training are top notch. They push you hard toward achieving the goals of your job for the company.
good,As part of the cellular industry Verizon is constantly adapting to the needs and demands of the industry so there is always something new to learn including technology which was the fun part. It is a highly competitive and demanding environment which is not for everyone but if you enjoy being compensated well based on your performance then it is definitely a company with that potential!
good,"Customers make or break your attitude but the culture emphasis is on controlling what you can, many benefits to keep your attitude up, culture committee and leadership stress support and culture"
good,I enjoyed working with the staff in manassas we where a family that worked well together the customers that i had was the past part of my job they made going to work exciting and fun and worth going and willing to help them with what ever they needed and know that they left with a smile on their face .
good,Job for the most part was decent. Great pay! The majority of the team was more like family. Great benefits not to mention getting to play with the new phones.
good,"You will love this job. I had fun selling to people, and meeting new faces. It was quite fun. My co-workers were great. My management was not so great."
good,"A typical day for myself included, Marketing, Sales and product knowledge. I was a SME(Subject Matter Expert) and was able to know in depth of all the products and services. Best part was servicing the customer's and seeing them fully satisfied."
good,Overall it was a great job but I was laid off in December 2016 after 14 years of service. I enjoyed the position as it was demanding and great place for growth.
good,"Me and my friends had fun working with Verizon. I like the compensation they were giving. I just dont like the atmosphere when you were in the production floor. IBut its cool, I had a lot of friends. I learned from them."
good,Pleasant environment Valhalla location.  exceptional benefits package and union job.  Make good money 401K match tuition reimbursement and more superb
good,"1. Very supportive team members"
good,Competitive environment where culture is built around succeeding daily. Yesterdays success doesn't determine tomorrow's success. Daily goals to attain commission targets.
good,"Company has always been good to me. They recognize their employees for a job well done. And they address any problems that arise in a professional manner. No man is ever left behind, they are always very understanding."
good,"Verizon was for me one of thee best companies to work for over 20 plus years, so long as you are an employee that knows how to fly under the radar. It was for me a great work experience to come in everyday to figure out problems, work outside the box as we were trained & expected to do. Great pay, Great benefits."
good,"I have nothing i want to say but just because i have to put this review i am going to write this, its a great place to provide food for your family great working place friendly management, nothings else i want to say."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good Benefits "
good,"Opportunities for growth.Great Benefits ,Tuition Assistance program, training opportunities galore.  I had a great 24 year career at Verizon."
good,I liked that I never knew what my day was going to be like.  I really enjoyed working with multiple departments to design  complex solutions.  The biggest challenge was the amount of processes to complete a task.
good,One of the best companies that I have worked for. They established a great culture that is centered around integrity. I worked in different channels of the organization and I can tell you that it's a great place to work. It can stress you out sometimes but they show you that they appreciate of your hard work.
good,I really enjoyed this job and left work everyday feeling satisfied about accomplishing and learning something new. The employees are awesome to work with and it feels more like a family the longer you work there. The hardest part was growth and advancement with having to be in the position for a year before we could more around and try something else
good,Handled approximately 100 calls per day. Executed great communication skills and problem solving tactics. Resolved customer billing inquiries and technical issues.
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon very much great pay great benefits good people and if you like overtime well you will see plenty of that I had great mangers and I had some mangers that you wondered how they managed to get their pants on in the morning  because they could not manage people
good,Great Job and great benefits. They micro management a lot of time so it makes the job very tedious sometimes. They also make you make calls if the store is slow.
good,"•	Assist customers with their accounts"
good,Nice work place to do great work and also good place to commute. I have learned a lot of circuit related things. All seniors are helpful. Management people are also very friendly.
good,"When Verizon opened their Lake Mary office they hired a bunch of really smart, well-qualified people (including me). Then they gave them jobs that had belonged to non-technically-savvy people for 10+ years. The result: lots of smart, bored people sitting around doing busy work."
good,"As any customer service related job can be, it was extremely stressful, but also rewarding. The center I worked in was a great atmosphere, with colleagues, and supervisors that truly cared about the job we were doing."
good,"A typical day consisted of starting with a start up meeting or training with associates in order to clear gray areas in promotions or going over salesman customer ettiquite.  In charge of making sure all inventory was accounted for, shipments were received systematically, and that inventory remained stocked throughout the work day.  I was responsible for money counts, deposits, and closing of the store."
good,"Nice place and atmosphere to work."
good,"Verizon is a solid company with solid benefits and an established corporate culture. "
good,Typical work day involved working with customs to resolve hardware and software issues. Management was fun. The customer interaction was sometimes hectic (opportunities). Best parts of the job was half off on cell phone service and being and Android trainer for new users.
good,"Generally bright upper management leading fast paced environment.  Some groups less motivated...contingent on manager."
good,"The days were very stressful, time on the phone was always spent trying to do what you can to not mess up your metrics and was not always focused on helping the customer"
good,Verizon was a place that did all they could to keep the moral level and energy level up for their employees. I feel they did what they could to appreciate the employees.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Overal awesome company to work for. In the Milwaukee district, Its a lot of favoritism in management.  Important things get sweep under the rug until its too late.  Watched great employees get let go because they spoke up."
good,"Verizon Wireless, a company that requires outside of the box thinking. Providing solutions that win win  outcome. The kind that benefit the customer, but also support the return on the employers investments! Consistent schedule changes impact the performance for the employee. Tenure weighs the same as performance, which causes much competition, loyalty for those in leadership. Benefits can be worth it alone, however if compensation don't motivate you then that may become a challenge"
good,".Good Work Life balance."
good,Working as a sub contractor was an amazing experience. I learned lots about Infrastructure Cabling those years. I was sent to BICSI and passed levels 1 2 and Technician.
good,"Great company culture with a forward momentum. Benefits are extremely competitive and compensation is great. The sales jobs are not that easy so it isn't for everyone, but if you are good at what you do and you continuously grow, then you can make a lot of money."
good,"Fast-paced environment with opportunity to advance. However, if you're starting from the retail environment and trying to branch out, it can be difficult. Biggest complaint is job security. I was laid off from my position and found another position internally within 30 days, then 6 months later was laid off from that position as well."
good,"Great work environment, management is very numbers driven and motivates it's workers daily. A typical day at work consisted of building relationships with clients to gain referrals. Learning the products, plans and new marketing offers."
good,I will not be placing any comments here...I do not want to put anything and indeed should not be forcing me to type anything..I will be keeping my comments to my self.
good,When you work for this organization just adhere to your work schedule and don't be late or call out sick.  They are not flexible with the schedule at all.
good,"This company is all about the bottom line. Productivity is key, opportunity to learn technical telecommunications skills are available."
good,"This is a fast paced, demanding, ever changing environment.  The industry is flat in it's growth cycle, and the customer base is traded back and forth between competitors."
good,verizon requires much of your energy. not much work life balance as the needs of the business drive your life. they compensate well and the benifits are great. just be ready for a daily challenge!
good,"Good work environment, fast paced, hard to move into other sectors of the company. Recommend for a good sales, customer service, and tech job!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Wonderful company to work for.  Great benefits, compensation, insurance, skills training, etc. Wide range of different areas for achievement and advancements."
good,A typical day at work consisted of logging into the phones and answering incoming calls about billing questions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers without losing your temper.
good,"A typical day at work is fun and interactive. I go to my friends and talk with them a little before my shift starts. I usually arrive 30 minutes before my shift to prepare myself and the tools that I use. I've learned a lot of things at work, how to be flexible, efficient, accurate, patient, and understanding. I became a part of the management team for around 5 months since the account had to pull out of the company for some reason. Management is fun and very understanding. We always make sure that the agents comes first and we find ways to make the floor fun and interactive. "
good,"The hours of the call center were vary hard to work for with having a family.  I had an hour commute to work which made the job hard, with being a union office there was little flexibility."
good,"Great place to work , very well paid, advancement opportunities and great benefits. be ready for a quick changing environment. Overall great culture to work in."
good,"you have the opportunity to make ALOT of money in this company. If you are good with sales, this is the job for you. Great benefits and compensation packages."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"For more than 100 years, Verizon has been at the center of the communications revolution. Verizon is one of the largest communication technology companies in the world. We help people, businesses and things communicate better. The digital world promises consumers a better, more connected life, and we’re the ones delivering it. We make it possible for people to stay in touch and businesses to connect with their customers. We’re also bringing technology and hands-on learning opportunities directly to kids who need it most. Our goal is to inspire tomorrow’s creators to use technology to build brighter futures for themselves, their families and the world."
good,"I would say it was a great company work for, their is wonderful benefits, great supportive management team, and culture is great. The only downfall is that they want you to work lots of overtime and not really a steady schedule unless your in the call center."
good,"Verizon provides work life balance. The pay if very competitive they offer matching 6 percent to invest into your 401k. The only problem that I would have is no job security, if your aren’t in the sales part of the business you are liable to be laid off."
good,"There are many different types of people that walk in to a wireless store. this job has taught me how to think like other people, its hard to deescalate a situation without putting yourself in that persons shoes and really evaluating the situation from both sides. This job has also taught me about myself, in this environment everything is always changing from one day to the next. Along with those changes comes adaptation and the ability to learn new things before the competitor. There's no room for errors and a Verizon manager has to balance the store traffic with the new ideas and processes on a daily basis."
good,"I have worked for Verizon Wireless for 17 plus years and was laid off due to campus closure.  Company gives many opportunities for employee's opinion and gives good compensation and rewards, however, work demands and performance reviews are very tough. It was growing industry for past years but is now slower with high competition."
good,"The best thing about Verizon is the people, the culture at Verizon is diverse and fast moving, with room to grow if one wants to, I enjoyed working for Verizon."
good,"VZW is a great place to work. Great compensation and great company benefits. Company is results driven, must have great results to be successful in VZW."
good,"The big league in wireless.  The world leader in wireless and digital communications.  Much is expected, but if you excel, you will make much more here than anywhere else in the industry."
good,"Good benefits and pay"
good,Good place to work.  I have been with the company for almost 17 years and been through a lot of changes. Some were good and some were bad.  More good that's why I was there so long.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are starting out, or in a position that you LOVE. The benefits are great; advancing is questionable. Sometimes if seems to rest on who you know."
good,"I learned a lot and developed a lot of skills.  Before getting laid off, I was able to attend online University with Verizon Wireless paying for it.  I was there 16-years before I got laid off.  They are still closing centers down, which is why I would not advise a friend to take a job with them."
good,"Verizon definitely pays very well and has extremely good benefits.  They do, however, work you to the bone, the jobs are extremely stressful and you don't get much advancement and currently job security is up in the air due to multiple closures including stores and call centers."
good,"Fast paced job"
good,Fast paced day trying to get network/customer's cell phone issues resolved. I have gained great knowledge of cell phone network. Management is supportive. Workplace is fun but fast paced and challenging. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with all the changes with the rapid changing technology. I enjoy when I have resolved a customer's issue and the customer is satisfied.
good,In general the compensation and work environment is very good. As it is a retail job the emphasis is on sales and even the customer service people were expected to help sales. I thought job security was good until my position was eliminated.
good,"Verizon is an all around secure company to work for.  I work on the wireline side, and enjoy it.  They are constantly putting you through training and refresher courses.  Good people and management."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great Place great people managers are great enhanced my sales skills working with them loved going out to dinners with the co-workers every one is great just looking to do better in my field and progress to a better more steady career.
good,This position had great pay and benefits. Personally it was too corporate for me. A very small fish in a big pond. I felt very anonymous. I lost seniority after returning from maternity leave and was not able to obtain a shift that I was able to accommodate daycare
good,A typical day at work consists of providing various solutions to customers as they enter the retail store . Informing customers of new and innovative products that might help improve their individual lifestyles . Meet monthly quotas on a consistent basis by finding opportunities to add more products to their accounts .
good,"Great company to work for and work life balance is great. I have  a better understanding about Wireless Network and products. I've also learned a great deal about Vendor Management, Supply Chain and enhancing my technical skills, using Microsoft suites and visual tools such as Tableu and Qlik. Also working with a variety of teams  such as; IT, network, Marketing Operations and etc."
good,This employer is okay to work for. They are great with salary. Management has some work to be done.It is very fast paced and training could be better.
good,To much focus on metrics and not enough time spent on the actual deals. The company was to focused on SFDC and not focused enough on helping the team sell.
good,"Verizon is headed in a great direction, and there is lots of room for advancement if you apply yourself. How far you go is largely dependent on your drive to succeed. Verizon has a good culture and embraces diversity. My only complaint would be it can be hard to juggle work life balance in an industry that is running 24/7, but this is a fact of the industry and is not limited to Verizon."
good,"Overall the job was great, the company was good and they compensated fairly. The management styles varied and were often so different it was a bit of a ride, a frustrating ride at that."
good,You cannot beat Verizon's benefits and pay scale structure. The health care and flexible schedule options make it easy to manage your work life balance.
good,"Verizon is caught in the transition from operational and traditional product delivery (and billing) to seeing the horizon of true innovation, advancements at the fringes of the market rather than tweaks around the center."
good,"The best part of this job are the benefits & peers."
good,"this store i worked at was very busy so i had to serve many customers and help them with their cell phone needs,  dealing with irate customers was my thing calming them down was easy and got to fix their issue."
good,A typical day was to take calls and resolve the customers issue whether it was with their bill or something with their device or their service. Hardest part of the job is when they're going to leave Verizon and you have to try and save them. Most enjoyable part is when you're able to resolve the customers issue and they're in a great mood and you get 3 a good survey from that customer. The management is good they really want you to use your tools and resources so sometimes they wont help but if you've exhausted every option then they will help.
good,"Work life balance is terrible, you will work all the time and have one or may two random days off and the compensation is gradually going down the hill. However, it is a great company to work for and everyone is one big happy family."
good,"Great company to work for.  Great environment, excellent benefits, and plenty of room for advancement.  It was a high volume call center jobs and that made it difficult at times."
good,promotions within resulted in employees that were not qualified to be managers. I would work for that company but not for that department. I truly valued the benefits of working for Verizon.
good,"This is a great company to work for, and the work culture is great. However, as with any retail sales position, there is little work/life balance,"
good,"Verizon is a good place to work. The work/life balance is difficult to manage in their retail stores, but they do try and are conscious of the challenge. Field is ever changing, but training is outstanding and ongoing. Advancement is almost exclusively done within the company. Expectations are high and are profit-driven but the rewards are significant and go beyond compensation."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,"Working in Verizon was nice, and environment and culture were encourage people to innovation. "
good,"A typical day at work started at 7:30 or 8 in the morning.  Due to the company catering to both domestic and international customers, days often times lingered to 10-11 pm on some evenings."
good,"I was a customer service representative. I took inbound calls and helped customers with their existing accounts.  Billing, Orders, Moving service.  Recommended bundles (phone, tv, internet)."
good,Offers flexibility to move around and create a career. Solid benefits. Company responds to wall street and strives to be a leader in the industry.
good,Rue 21 was the first job I ever worked at and it was really fun. I met a lot of people and coworkers and I had tasks to do everyday whether it was cleaning or putting stuff out for display.
good,the work and life balance is great. Compensation is great when you first start. Job security is great but the advancement seems to come too slow. Management is very understanding. The culture could be better because we don't do anything team related.
good,"i worked there for a year, the staff and management in the building i worked in was really wonderful. since the merger i happened as i left most of my experience was tons of people leaving verizon due to the frontier scare"
good,"Verizon is a good to work to explore our skill and gain knowledge on different technologies. I have been working here since more than 2 years, as a middleware admin, supporting applications which are deployed on Weblogic and WAS application servers"
good,My time with Verizon was above and beyond expectations. The work environment was very relaxed yet always engaging. Would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Sent out user guides and schedule times to cover training with personnel via phone. Contact customers to explain Products and services that they have subscribed to. "
good,Great people Great compensations!! you work under stressful conditions but are able to interact with great people.  Management can be to pushy at times but overall great place to work!!
good,GTE no longer exists as was merged with several  other companies and became Verizon. Nothing else can report here as you can not get this job.  Things changed dramatically when company became Verizon

good,Able to assist customers concern and provide all information needed. Enjoys working with the public. Detail oriented individual who is skills in multitasking. Ability to prioritize job duties to get work done accurately and effectively. Able to work in a team and enjoys a challenge and strives under pressure.
good,"hours were great, good union benefits, management went downhill after a few years, turned into a unhappy workplace, co workers were fun to work with, great friendships"
good,A typical day at Verizon is monitoring and testing Ethernet circuits for customers. Learning Ethernet is an ongoing process because the product is pretty broad. The hardest part of the job is every customer wants their service fixed all at the same time. I do enjoy my job because its challenging.
good,"Verizon offers competitive pay and benefits, and provides an ever changing work environment with lots of opportunity for advancement. The quotas can be challenging, and the expectations unrealistic, but lower management was usually someone who recently was in the same position, so they were always willing to help and team sell. The hours are normal retail hours, which mean you are drained dry during holiday season, or at any special release (iPhone release for example). Customers are terrible and demanding, and there isn't much in place where employees can defend themselves from harassment or unfair treatment by customers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,The management is great and if you work hard you will succeed. Promote from within and have great employees that will consistently provide you with the tools you need to succeed
good,"I should not have left the company but I did.. I had personal things going on in my life. The benefits are untouchable. I hated the shift-bids, you bid for your schedule every 6 to 12 months. Pay was decent for this area."
good,"Verizon Wireless offers competitive advantages."
good,"I had great managers, always understanding and easy to talk too. Company was better before it was bought out by Verizon, much better under World Com and MCI"
good,Verizon is a rewarding company to work for.  Your hard work and dedication is rewarded with a great compensation package including base pay and commission.  Benefits package including 401K with company matching and tuition reimbursement.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. They know how to operate efficiently, and it's a great company to learn from. They have great benefits, but they tend to overwork or expect many hours from their employees. They don't have the greatest work life balance, but it's worth the experience. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Learned plenty from Verizon, it was a temp job of two and a half years, longtime hiring freeze.  Other than that made lots of great friends and learned how to better serve my customers in all areas."
good,"I really enjoyed the concept of this job, taking phone calls and having conversations with people to resolve their issues but they place their entire value of their employees on randomly generated surveys that for some reason seem to favor the few bad calls you'll get per day. Once you get a few negative surveys and your approval rating drops below 90% the management expects you to recover quickly or you may as well have a countdown on your head till termination"
good,"I can say, out of all the C.S. jobs I have had.  This company offered a lot to their employees. From excellent benefits to compensation even growth and opportunity.. I actually had the opportunity to work from home. Might I say what a fabulous experience. As far as time off, You have ample time off. In the door 160 hours and work accomidations if need be. It's all about how you manage your time. They invest a lot in their reps just like the network. HOWEVER... Customer service is what it is. Any company you sign up for . With the way technology is moving in the industry . It's a higher demand for help in this area. You MUST know how to take it one call at a time. Seperate your emotions. For some it's easy for others it's a challenge. If you have done C.S. For 8 or more years ON THE PHONE please make sure you still got it. This field can be physically, mentally and emotionally draining. Which can cause self destruction, poor performance, extortion of company given time, followed by attendance issues."
good,"I have been with VZW since 2010, and unfortunately they are closing my office down which is sad. I love all the people I work with. I have been in charge of various groups of employees to develop, and train them to provide a quality, efficient, consistent customer experience!"
good,"Good company to work for with good benefits."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. I enjoyed the people i worked with as well as how Verizon treated their employees. I didn't like the hours that I was scheduled to work because they were not flexible. Overall its a great place to begin and advance in your career.
good,"In my experience Verizon has excellent work/life balance."
good,Everyday I come to work and learn something new. The best part of the job is working while having a comical conversation with my coworkers.
good,Verizon offers a good benefits package to its employees and attempts to create a diversified culture. There weren't many options for advancement unless one is willing to frequently relocate to other areas. I enjoyed the time with my co-workers and helping our government customers.
good,"became very repetitive not challenging, way to much politics involved, seems like for advancement they already had people pre picked so interviewing was a waste of time"
good,"Working at HQ has its advantages over any other location within the company, on-site gym, cafeteria with many meal options, dry cleaning, etc., that you won't find in most any other VZ office. "
good,"Great benefits and close to home. Was at first easy to accommodate a work schedule, Always changing. Not enough staffing. Great team builder activities when there was time, co-workers were like a second family."
good,Very good advancement.  I enjoyed being able to have face to face conversations with the clients.  The struggle to make a sale through the educational boundaries with customers was not easy.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make the monthly quota or sales no matter the cost.  To me it was more important to keep them as a loyal customer than push them to purchase something they would eventually leave the company for.
good,"Being a customer service representative is one of the hardest jobs out there. Not because the job is physically demanding but because you are dealing with an extremely wide range of people from all different parts of the country and all different backgrounds. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I really appreciate that opportunity with, the work experience and skills provided. It's a great place to look into working for with benefits that actually suitable for many one applying for this position. Certainly a while organized work force environment."
good,Good place work and grow.  Compensation is great!  You can have several careers.  Performance based place.  Clear direction.  Many opportunities
good,"The managers are really supportive, but the sales people are rude and don't work as a team, they only look out for their own benefit."
good,Team has to be interactive and the management should support and provide support if there is anything that we cannot do. Team should collaborate with various team members and teams as well to complete the work.
good,"Accepting inbound calls"
good,"Verizon is a great first job it really teaches you how to work, what does a job look like and really how your supposed to attack each day and be aggressive."
good,"I am sure if I did not have to leave for the reasons that I needed to, I would still be there. it was a great place to work once you figured out how to balance everything. once you figured out the shift that worked for you and your family then everything was great."
good,Nice place to work where I learned a lot. I learned the new technologies and my colleagues and management were very supportive.
good,"Very satisfied with my job overall, had numerous responsibilities within my 7 years with company. Was promoted 3 times and happy with management training and compensation."
good,"The threat of layoffs, or centralization outside of California, is ever present. In the mean time, you can expect to work hard, eat lunch at your desk, and get hassled about vacation requests. The pay is good and the bonuses are very nice."
good,A typical day at work was very busy and full of challenges since every situation was different and involved a lot of details and many issues.
good,"pleasure to deal with vendors issues and solve their problems, feel great to resolve customer issues, and suggest new ways to handle issues. Vendors very understanding."
good,A typical day at work would be very mild pace call flow. Working with a variety of customers with similar issues and being able to handle and getting the problems solve. I learned how to manage my time on calls and also learned how to handle different calls and learned how to work on different systems and screens to be able to assist the customers. I love working with my co-workers they where very helpful and understanding when dealing with new team members. I really didn't find anything hard about the job but I really enjoy most coming to work and getting my job done and working with the customers and resolving any and every issue they had.
good,Retail sales at its most basic form. Unit sales plus ancillary sales such as data per contract and accessories per device were standard metrics measured and compensated by the company. A base salary plus commission was the pay structure in which I understood and excelled.
good,Personal growth achieved with the ever changing environment that adapts to the changes within the industry. Enjoyed working with good people and appreciated the learning.
good,"My position was allowed to WFH 2 days a week.  Loved the variety of tasks I was responsible for. I had a very fair manager, until I switched teams and my position became virtual, this new manager was set in the ""West"" ways which did things differently than the other regions."
good,Help representatives to grow in their perfessional  life. set monthly and daily goals to help reps achieve company and personal goals. Not to mention Help customers and deescalate customer issues.
good,"The call center is a place where you have to be on your game every day.  Like any call center the duty is to take calls constantly and to perform at a high level.  Anything from billing, to technical support to general question come up each day. Management is something that could improve but most are supportive.  Co-workers understand the job and work hard.  I get along with pretty much everyone that I interact with. The hardest part of the job is probably getting the answers and support when needed.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people both customers and co-workers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I work with amazing people. The job itself is extremely stressful but also rewarding. For the most part, management is great. There is always one or two that give you a struggle."
good,"I had a great experience working for windsor workcare, my coworkers were great as well as the doctor. I lost interest in the medical field so I no longer worked for the, m because of it."
good,"First experience at a call center, so I don't have much to compare to. Strict time management, good and bad managers (luck of the draw), learned a lot about communication skills and how to provide over the top excellent customer service. Training was exceptional and if you are able to utilize the skills learned in training you will succeed. Benefits awesome. Definitely take advantage. Some co workers picked up the pace more than others. Reason for leaving was hours/ work/life balance. Just didn't work for my family and I."
good,Some days could be very intense and demanding. I've learned how to work under pressure while providing good service and maintaining great customer support. I strived in the pressure environment and looked forward to those days were my skills would shine. My co-workers were professional at all times even when differences on how things should be completed and processes should be implemented. But the hardest part is when the different personalities would clash while trying to achieve the same goals. The management group for the most part has a very good knowledge of the products and network. Which made the job easier to complete because they would put the employees in the right position and assigned the task so they would excel. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the task assigned to come up and work to the customers satisfaction.
good,"I've been working for Verizon for nine years and I have had many hats whilst my career. Biggest part of my job has been to always identify the correct key stake holders in order to solve complex issues and learn to delegate whilst still remaining in charge. Biggest achievements was my client re-signing of the contract for another three years due to service management efficiency. I enjoy both, working in a team; and individually. My management values me for strong ownership skills and customer dedication."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. You will work a lot of hours, and be comfortable with working with escalated customers. Although I feel the company is improving in this area of customer retention."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. They have great benefits which you receive on your first day there. As long as you work hard you can make a decent amount of money. Definitely the best company that I've worked for so far.
good,401k contributions are matched 100% up to 6%. Health benefits still include a copay option.  College and Adoption reimbursement available. Employee Assistance Programs also available for life events at no cost to employee.
good,I loved it here until things started to change for the worse. Good place to learn new networking/troubleshooting skills.
good,Provides good opportunity for entry level persons to advance.  Gives yearly bonuses and and provides outstanding benefits starting while in training which is great!
good,"A typical day working at Verizon is always changing. Your always meeting new people, always doing different things, and a great place to develop different social skills. The job can be fun with all the people you meet and can be difficult when dealing with people that have problems due to another sales rep. Management really depends for any job honestly but overall management does the best they can. The main thing that I liked about the management is how they worked with my school scheduled. Working for this company was a good experience and decent pay."
good,"Set schedules, time off was amazing. But not much support from management. Fast pace work environment. Stress level was severe."
good,Very productive place to work and expand your skills. Compensation is good and opportunity to move into other positions are commonly available.
good,"Good company with good benefits and pay. Challenging work, and hard work is rewarded. Upward management opportunities."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for the benefits are awesome! If you perform well there will be many opportunities for career progression. As a customer service advocate in the call center, the typical day consists of brief team meeting before your shift, taking calls, and working with supervisor and floor support to assist in making every customer experience a positive one as needed. You will learn how to effectively position information to customers while working in a diverse ever changing industry. The company is very performance driven so be prepared to work hard and commit to providing great service. The job is demanding and stressful at times every call may not be a great one but as long as you demonstrate effort on every call you'll be fine."
good,"Working at Verizon was a positive experience over all, working in a commission based environment made the job mine. I was only responsible for me, and if I didn't take care of myself I didn't make money and I let my team down in the process. So hitting my goals were fairly easy, everyone wants to make money!"
good,"My experience at Verizon regarding the day to day life was always very organized, structured, deadline driven, goal oriented, and team atmosphere."
good,"The pay is great, the benefits are great, the people are great. However, you're scheduled to work a minimum of 45 hours a week, which is always more than that because you never get out on time and since it's retail you work every weekend, all day long."
good,hard work - good pay. They train you for any position that you apply for. Be prepared to work 2 weekends a month every month.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Worked in the call center assisting customers with all different types of issues. I learned many skills and enjoyed learning new things. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers, however that was also the most rewarding by being able to resolve their issues."
good,This was overall a great job to have. Great pay with good benefits. The quotas were obtainable which was a nice thing and a good overall environment.
good,Verizon is a good company to work for.  The pay and benefits are pretty good. I recommend getting in and getting out once you have gained the experience needed to go further.
good,I worked at Verizon for 17 years. I held many different positions and had a lot of learning opportunities. Verizon made it easy to move up. I started off as an Administrative Assistant . I worked with different departments within Verizon in order to resolve customer's issues. I was also part of a department that assigns jobs to field technician. i was part of an elite group of administrative assistant that worked on the roll out of FIOS in Massachusetts. I was promoted to Sales Representative working with Business and Residential customers. I was a 2008 Presidential Club winner for exceeding my sales quota.I also received awards for customer satisfaction. I had many in depth training on products and services that was essential for Verizon customers. I was trained to understand and became a specialist on the many products that Verizon offers. I made many lasting friendships. I worked in a great team environment. Training was in house which made it easier when you have a family. We did not have to travel far. Tests are given after training before you become certified on new products. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if you have a job when the Union and Verizon contract expires.
good,"Use to be a great company, but it still a good place to work. The business was changed by the CEO of the company, only time will tell if the CEO was successful. Compared to other job this was a great place to work"
good,Gain skills in life that will carry you forward in any career you choose. Great benefits and pay. High expectations due to being a pay for performance company.
good,"Good place to work for the younger generation.  Retail hours are brutal for many different reasons.  Co-workers are the reason individuals stay as long as they do.  Management is based off micro-managing, which pushes many people away."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for.  They provide an excellent compensation package (401K, profit sharing, paid time off, excellent consumer perks, etc.)"
good,"Great company to work for, management is excellent, the pay is great.  The hours are not great for families.  I had the 3pm to midnight shift and ultimately could not continue working with Verizon. I've heard they have changed their hours and are only open until 7pm now."
good,"Once was a great company to work for."
good,"During my time working at Verizon, I learned a lot of customer service skills. There was a lot of training and a lot of knowledge being given. The training was put to good use for very good customer service. The training has serviced me well thru out the years working at Verizon."
good,Too many call metrics and constant changes but benefits are good.  Job creates stress and pay could be higher.  Customer Service position involves dealing with many unhappy customers that we are being forced to retain.
good,"Productive Workplace, great co-workers, learning experience, plenty of room for development. Verizon has taught me how to interact with clients of diverse backgrounds and how to successfully manage a business."
good,I have learned so much about people at this job. The atmosphere is amazing.  ive learned about taking care of people. doing first call resolution and addressing the concerns of the customer
good,I really have nothing to say but be fair to the employees at all times. You never know who works for you and how much of an influence they have on the company itself.
good,Call center representative for many years learned different systems over the years.  Received great training in all areas of systems and policies and procedures. Would have loved to continue my career with them.
good,"Working within a retail location of Verizon wireless was exciting and eventful. Consistently high foot traffic which teaches to be more active and proactive when addressing issues and promoting solutions.I was required to learn as much as possible about the new and up and coming technology while also realizing there is a need for recognize the hold so that I can smoothly implement a transition for my class attendants and customers. The technology world is ever changing and it is impossible to know it all so it was crucial to work as a team to pool our knowledge and support each other in growth, product management, and value. Customer satisfaction is always a must and being well informed is the best way to ensure success. This was always a priority within my position. The most difficult effects of this position within Verizon wireless, is the schedule. This is due to Verizon's consumer demand and commitment to customer satisfaction. This presents itself as a pro and con because more hours is more opportunity but it doesn't allow time with a family. However, it is the perfect position for a transitional college student, providing great benefits, networking opportunities and constant recognition.This was an overall, beautiful, experience."

Hardest part was interference hunting. The most enjoyable part was satisfaction when helping to resolve a problem for a customer."

good,"While many of my coworkers did not like the work, I really enjoyed working at Verizon.  My favorite thing about working there was learning something new every day. I also loved the days that I had the opportunity to work with customers, or to help with training both new hires and existing employees."
good,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Politics does exist, but has subsided in recent years in favor of team ethic to do right by the Customer. Management does support employees but few opportunities for vertical advancement outside of headquarter locations. The job I had lacked growth and variety."
good,Atmosphere was great with supportive management. With hard work there is room to grow and help to you there. I enjoy engaging with customer and problem solving the most while working with Verizon

good,I learned so much and made some very good friends while employed.  The collaboration and teamwork was wonderful.  The management was very supportive also.
good,cell phone industry is cutthroat and its hard to sell when everyone is taking customer base. Pay should be increased if we have to deal with such harsh customers.

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,My job consisted mostly providing 2nd level support to Verizon customers. I learnt a lot on values of support and solving technical problems in a systematic manner by analyzing multiple possible faults within the client or network side. I had the ability to have the freedom to relay my challenges to my managers openly and vice versa. Biggest challenges within the job would be while working with clients who are incoherent or incommunicable. I liked that management made it possible for employees to have breaks and freedom of work area as long as daily targets are met.
good,"A typical usually is high call volume and very competitive. Management stays attentive to employees and assist as much as possible."
good,Great company.  Always on the forefront of technology and cutting edge thinking.  Strong work culture.  Always felt appreciated as an employee.

good,"It was my first GM position. With it came the insecurity that nothing would occur without me, and I had to learn that others knew the job that had to be done. I worked many days, no weeks, from open to close. It was a great experience in trust. The crew was fantastic. I overdid everything. They must have been so patient with me. I can never thank them enough."
good,"Verizon is a very professional large corporation that understands that it’s the employees that at the heart of the corporation. Verizon supported the success of their products by providing consistently and constant. The medical, dental, and vision benefits were standard, but the 401k and other investment benefits were above normal. Management was supported by training. There was huge growth potential in the company. Projects were always plentiful and offered to all levels of employees. I participated in any and all that I could.  After being with Verizon for ten years, I was very close to my fellow coworkers. The hardest part of my job was when it ended. Our call center was moved to another state. The most enjoying aspect of my job was solving my client’s issues, the training and the camaraderie."
good,The day starts from 8am and ends at 6pm.  Daily monitoring of RF and Network KPIs to improve the customer experience on their mobile devices.  Reporting bugs and issues to the OEMs as they arise.  Management a little tough on the engineers and constant pressure to get the metrics lower.  Co-workers dedicated to moving the metrics lower and winning the baseline tests between the other operators.  Hardest part of job was coming up with creative ways to get the KPIs lower.  The most enjoyable part was when your area won their baseline results and had an improvement in KPIs.
good,great place to work many different opportunities within the company. room for growth. very helpful staff for knowledge. excellent training program as well
good,"Workplace was fun when it came to other co-workers; everyone got along with each other and the place was always very well organized."

good,This a great place that provides benefits the first day. This is a typical call center environment. Everyday provides a new experience dealing with different people.

good,Offers a great opportunity for college graduates with engineering or technical degree. Bachelors degree is a must have to advance in the company.
good,Great people to work with and great salary and benefits.  Work from home was encouraged for my position due to after hour cut-overs. Fast paced environment requires multitasking and prioritizing the work.
good,"Good  Workplace,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Come in open the store, do the registers and count the phones. When the store opens help out the customers, you get one hr lunch and the rest of the time on the floor selling. "
good,"This is a job that is not for everyone.  As a sales representative you are asked to do a lot, but the rewards are great.  Its a lot of stress as you are required to meet performance objectives day in and day out, but they do give you tools and promos to help get there.  This is a job that requires focus, attention to detail, and a daily motivation to excel at what you do.  Your management team will really go to bat for you if you show that you are invested in your career."
good,"Always did right by the people, had onsite cafe, Gym, made sure everyone had a personal desk, open learning groups, and lots of parking."
good,"Verizon has a large array of benefits: advancement opportunities, excellent health and retirement benefits, and top-notch training programs. The most difficult parts of working at Verizon are the customer interactions and the hours. You don't get home until after 9 p.m. some nights, which can be difficult with small children at home. Customers can become hostile, but that's also the most rewarding part of the position, turning a hostile customer into a happy customer."
good,Verizon hires great people and you get to work with a lot of different people and personalities. Very fast paced daily schedule. Great benefit offers.
good,Schedules based on seniority and performance. Great co-workers and a solid management staff make for a pleasant work environment. Some of the best health care benefits I've seen in any industry.
good,"The retail environment is very competitive, hours are demanding, and very little schedule flexibility during ""holiday season"".  Great place to work for students that need tuition assistance and and working parents that need good health coverage.  Promotion opportunities can be limited and usually require relocation."
good,"Having provided industry leader Verizon with excellence in both project management and customer service, I am offering your company more than 18 years of experience and an extensive portfolio of achievements.  I live by the credo that ‘failing to prepare is preparing to fail’ and as such, I have tirelessly prepared for my projects and my customers in order to showcase the very best of Verizon’s catalogue of services. I have immense pride in the customer relationships I have built and saved along with the successful projects I have led to increase Verizon’s market share."

good,Verizon provided a great group dynamic. Their employee compensation and benefits were exceptional. In very stressful situations there was great support and and procedures in place.
good,"My ONLY reason for leaving Verizon was because I became a single dad with two boys and I could not accommodate the work load expected of me.  It did take me almost two years to find another job that made me ready to leave."
good,"Was going to retire from WOW. I was responsible for anything and everything to do with supervising my team. Hiring, scheduling associates as well as projects. FCC testing, maintenance of the systems."
good,"Good company with outstanding benefits. You can attend college and obtain a full degree while employed with Verizon. The company will pay your tuition in full. You must maintain a passing grade otherwise, the class will be at your own expense. Not too many companies offer this kind of compensation. A good friend of mine is pursuing a Doctorate Degree on Verizon! How awesome is that. The educational benefits alone are reason enough to join this fast paced competitive company. A few challenging areas to work around, but if you are positive and have a good attitude you will overcome the minor unimportant issues and go for gold, like a full college degree, trade school or some type of certification to enhance your marketability."
good,"Verizon is a wonderful place to work if you are motivated, skilled, open to management directions. The compensation is without peer, and top results are expected."
good,"Supporting big customers can be stressful, yet it leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment.  I learned how to handle multiple complex issues simultaneously and how to work closely with a diverse set of skills from different people. Management was good during my career and my co-workers were even better. the hardest part of the job was trying to separate work from home life.  This is made all the more difficult working from home. The most enjoyable part of was the people.  These are the greatest people in the industry and have the right attitude."
good,"The hardest part of the job was that it could become monotonous at times."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon Wireless is a great opportunity for anyone willing to discover their own potential. Your success is dependent on you and the company is an open door for advancement in multiple fields.
good,"A typical day could include a few new site design visit, calls from various vendors looking for guidance on jobs in construction, several site visits to jobs under construction,  release materials for jobs getting ready to go into construction, a job bid walk, calls made to vendors for updates on jobs under construction, order materials, process purchase orders, approve payment of purchase orders."

good,Loved this job the company the culture.  I enjoyed being at Verizon every day there was something new to learn a new adventure to embark upon.
good,very corporate environment.  over promises and commitments lead to political issues within the company.  Very difficult to get anyone to contact you back and move on projects.  Lots of red tape and security clearance makes working here tedious.
good,"Worked on two major initiatives, entry of a Bell Operating Company into the inter-exchange voice and data arenas, and, later, implementation of the FiOS TV FTTP initiative"
good,"Good company great benefits"
good,"Above average compensation, unique culture, overall good place to work and gain knowledge related to telecom industry."
good,Typical day would be to come in with badge entrance from this point until you leave every motion is monitored.   As a sales representative in todays world speed and offering is a must and this job took it to the highest degree.  The problem I found is the lack of management skills and training added to stress daily.  Incentive once you got passed this was awesome it afforded me several acknowledgement trips and a lot of material gifts that I enjoy to this day.
good,"Enterprise Solution has a broad range of solution capabilities, Hosting / Cloud / Colo to meet customer requirements."
good,"Good Place for work, "
good,Verizonwireless is a good company to work for but as a sales rep and in any sales job you need to sell what the companies major focus is at that time and the commission structure changes frequently
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"There were no typical days working with Verizon except for when you were teaching a course.  In the early days it was a great company but toward the end it became a free-for-all environment.  The old adage of ""Not what you know - but Who you know""."

Also learned different aspects from all the different entities of the customer that we serviced. I had several different managers through out my yeas, for the most part they were fair and easy to work for. Most of my co-workers were a joy to work with. The hardest part of the job were some of the un real due dates of some of the jobs, but we always managed to meet our goals and objectives. The most enjoyable part was when we would finish a big job and new that the customer was pleased with the results."
good,"The company provides excellent benefits, I have met great people in co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving a customers' issue. I learned multi-tasking skills and the ability to actively listen. I also developed patience."
good,Verizon is amazing when it comes to benefits and making a decent amount.  Retail hours get old and it is hard to move out of retail once you start in it.  Managers have their favorites and it is more of who you know rather then what you know that allow you to get promoted.
good,"Worked there for several years, benefits are good and I enjoyed learning new applications for telecommunications"
good,"Numbers driven business, learned alot about wireless industry. It really depends on your management if you are successful or not. Co-workers were good. The hardest part of this job was to stay motivated when things aren't going well"
good,"When I start working for Verizon, it is still local phone company ( Bell Atlantic ) , I started  as contractor for the CABS application system, that is the billing system for carrier for long distant company ( MCI, AT&T....) , and joined the company as employee after 2 years.  I have learn a lots from this company, not only IT technical skill,  but also management theory.  Verizon offer great opportunity and personal career development assistant for their employee, plus the benefit is great compare with other company in the same industry."

good,Wish I was still there and lived closer to the campus. Great teaching institution
good,"Typical day at work consists of providing customer service over the phone to customers.  Helping with bills, equipment orders/sales, device and network troubleshooting. Learned many different techniques in dealing with customers, such as, de-escalating situations, explanation of products and services, contracts, etc."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking inbound calls from business customers and end users with a range of support transactions, from sales to technical troubleshooting. I learned valuable customer service, management, and sales skills which I will carry to my next career opportunity. Management was a hit or miss, it's a competitive corporate environment so, it helps if you know the man/woman that has influence. Throughout my career at VZW I was able to meet great human beings whom cared about the customer and took pride of their work. I also met individuals whom only cared about themselves, did the minimum work to keep a job and negatively impacted the morale. The hardest part of the job was accepting the double standard culture. On one hand, I work for a ""for profit"" company that prioritizes profits above all. On the other hand the company attempts to drive the message that it's all about the customer, but the policies in place are not customer friendly.One has to drink and believe the cool-aid in order to sleep at night. The company also has a ""corporate cannibalism"" culture where you work with unethical backstabbing individual that will look for a promotion or financial rewards for someone else's work, and those are the individuals that get the promotion, very sickening!"
good,"Supported field technicians for Verizon Biz. Mapped locations on the computer to protect fiber lines. Worked in a group size of about 12 people, half contractors, half permanent employees."

good,"Great benefits. Very inclusive corporate culture that rewards hard workers. Plenty of training and resources available to employees. A wide array of career opportunities open to just about anyone who wants to explore their potential in the retail, business, and government sectors. Verizon is an innovative, always evolving technology company that sets a solid foundation for employees of any background and skill level."
good,"Daily duties including making inbound and outbound calls to customers cell lines regarding payments to accounts, assisting customers with making hardware and software repairs to equipment. I learned how to do telephone and telemarketing sales, use the phone-operating systems in call centers and multi-task in a business-professional setting. Working with my former coworkers was a great experience to learn different selling techniques from a diverse(in age) group of people. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives and benefits offered to the employees. The accolades made each day worth it."
good,Monitor contractual arrangements between Verizon and Enterprise customer base to ensure all terms and conditions are being met
good,"I started out working for Contel Telephone Company, then the name was changed to GTE and now it's Verizon. It was a very good company to work for. Co-Workers and Management staff were"
good,"Great team atmosphere"
good,great motivation at work as well as great co-workers. I leaned how to be a better person with customers and had a better opportunity to show my self driven skills as well as to work as a team.
good,"I enjoyed my co workers as well as the management.The benefits were wonderful(health,life insurance,401k,dental insurance,etc.).The offices I worked in were all very nice."
good,"The days here are not as challenging as I would like, but it's a good place to start. On a typical day, you will do Circuit Updates on spreadsheets, on whiteboards and teleconferences. The co-workers are not a close as I am use to but they are good at their jobs."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for as far as compensation and benefits (excellent as a 1st job or for single students), full tuition assistance and discounts with plenty of big name companies. I have had the honor of working with great people as far as management and coworkers."

I have developed skills through continuious trainings, working with different teams and members. I have developed friendships with some co-workers that will go beyond my tenure with the company. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistency, morale and culture within my current location.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping resolve issues for customer and making them happy."
good,"•	Inbound Call Center"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Awesome benefits, Awesome Co-workers, Awesome Culture. Stressful job, work/life balance is hard, stressful at times, however wonderful career starter."
good,"Great atmosphere and people! Lots of opportunities for growth within the company. Busy, fast paced, challenging workplace."
good,Not a bad place to work but get ready for a pressure cook environment and the occasional very upset customer.. It's a daily reality. Compensation is fair if you stay very busy and hit your numbers.   Your managers will expect you to be 100% flexible with scheduling and you will work long hours.
good,"Verizon was a great place to work in you were not in a hurry to advance your career. They tend to be a little short sighted. The benefits and pay are first rate.  My Teammates were great to work with, upper management did not always seem to be on the same page the workers were on."
good,Answered about 40 calls a day.  Enjoyed very much helping the customers.  Always learning new products and promotions.  Great pay and fun atmosphere.

The work environment was very nice."
good,"Very rigid company to work for, but excellent pay and benefis."
good,Excellent management and opportunity for learning.  Good communication between client groups.
good,I really like working here but you can get call center burn out. good side if you work hard you do get rewarded. down side your schedule changes every 6 months. managers are usually pretty good. every day brought something new.
good,Management is highly flexible which allows workers to balance the challenging and demanding industry with family/life.
good,After assisting our customers with their service a little game will probably let us exhale tension and stress.
good,"Various responses to emergency HVAC failures, electrical & plumbing issues, routine maintenance. Teamwork was encouraged but seldom occurred."
good,"-My typical day at work consist of an exponential amount of time on the phone talking with existing clients as well as potential clients. The discussions tend to include eliminating problems, minimizing issues, providing a solution to their problems, and overall developing a lasting partnership with the client. "
good,I was able to work from home and have access to all our equipment and to maintain and upgrade. Was able to work with our customers remotely and fix most issues remotely unless it was required to be on site. Work all  daily tickets and worked and managed all projects and calls remotely.  My work was never boring as there was always a new challenge that some had and worked it with our team.
good,Verizon was a company that was fast paced.  It had a lot of excitement.  It was a constantly evolving environment with lots of positive changes.
good,Excellent company to work for. Feels great to be able to meet customer needs with the best products on the market.
good,"Good Company -- Lots of rules"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I love the Tech side of the business. Very Long hours and fast p[aced place.
good,Great company and management but at certain times  there is layoffs in the company
good,Verizon is a great place to work for people interested in sales. The benefits are excellent and you get compensated well based on your performance.  It is fun and interesting working with technology. You are constantly learning new things and adapting to changes that technology brings.  It is great place to work for networking among the city you live. The hardest part of the job is also the best part; working with the public can be stressful at times yet can also be rewarding.
good,"Sell, sell ,sell... Customer service, customer service, customer service. That' the culture at Verizon. A typical day is reviewing emails for potential sales oppurtunities, if an opuurtunity presents itself call them or email the potential buyer to learn more about their needs and attempt to setup an appointment to earn their business. Management was very supportive and the co-workers all smiled all day long. The hardest part about the job was the weekend  and long hours. Working from 9am-9pm was not ideal and also working on Sundays. The pay was the most enjoyable."
good,Verizon was a great place to work. Friendly employees and staff with awesome health benefits and paid time off. It is easy to move up the ladder if you are focused and work hard. The scheduling is not a good idea if you cannot move your life around every six months. Work/life balance is not a priority for this company.
good,A typical day for me at Verizon is performing daily & monthly assigned duties along with any additional duties that may come about on a daily basis.  I have gained a great deal of reconciliation knowledge since working at Verizon.  Management has always made themselves available when needed.  Verizon creates and atmosphere where you work closely with your peers to obtain a common goal.  There has been nothing overly hard about the job.  I have always been given the opportunity to figure things out on my own or work closely with my peers and management to figure out difficulties related to my assigned duties.  I enjoy the fact that your duties evolve as technology changes and you are an active participant in implementing the changes.
good,"This work environment is challenging and fun. It provides a lot of room to grow and learn different skills envolving people, programs, and technology. My co-workers are fun and very inspirational. The hardest part of the job is probably angry customers. I love being able to actually make the angry customers happy because I was able to fix the problem."
good,typical day consisted of taking constant phone calls. All Verizon customers called in regarding billing or just needed help with their phones.
good,"Working at Verizon was the best job I've had to date. Training to make sure the employees were comfortable on the job was exceptional. "
good,A typical work day would consist of resolving dialup and ADSL clients internet connections. This would consist with verifying anything between noisy lines to dead modems. Management trains well and are able to provide support when needed. The hardest thing I remembered was working the 3rd shift.
good,"Prepared Test plan, Test Scenarios, Test cases and Traceability Matrix by reviewing Requirements Document, Use Case models and used HP software change management tool and CVS version management tool, Was part of the BRD and SRS preparation team, played a major role in suggesting inputs for the development of Switches for Trunk Group Network for Wireline Application, Verification of WOW website functions with ADA Guidelines and Section 508 Compliance Testing, Used Load Runner for performance testing of IR’s and providing the results to the development team and automated auto dispatch process using QTP."
good,I worked as a sales representative that was required to work closely with small business customer. The job required customizing products to fit the needs of the business.
good,Trained and explained issues to end users. The most enjoyable part of the my job is taken care of my end users.
good,"I worked for Verizon Wireless for 6 years. I began my career at Verizon Wireless as a greeter and worked my way up to a sales consultant and was transitioning into management. I learned so much at Verizon this company truly does raise effective and successful sales consultants. The culture of the company as a whole was what I loved most about it, if you want to live a corporate lifestyle and are majoring in Business this is the company that will train you and make you successful in the business force. My favorite part about Verizon Wireless was my team, and our sales trainings. Verizon truly does invest millions of dollars in hiring the best trainers from New York and New Jersey to make us successful which in terms brings in plenty of revenue in your pockets. The only thing is you must work hard, working hard is something I am a natural at I would not had survived 6 years in such a high performing and high demanding company had I not been such a hard worker. However work life balance if you have a family can be stressful. That is when the working hard  can impact your family life at home. Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for and I am truly blessed to have had such a great opportunity!"
good,"Received incoming calls, requesting help with bills and paging equipment. Created invoices and resolved customers issues."
good,"This place was amazing in the beginning, great work life balance, excellent pay and benefits and really cared about its employees. I left because toward the end there was no work/life balance at all. If it didn't benefit their goals then it wasn't important. Was also passed up on 3 store manager positions and was in the top 3 candidates each time and was told by 2 DM's that HR would not allow me to advance because I did not have a Bachelors degree at that time."
good,A typical day at work consisted of reducing disconnections and training new hires.
good,"Handled all administrative aspects of the sale including: completing customer contracts and warranties, pulling products from inventory, accepting customer payments. "

good,"Verizon is hands down a great company to work for that has endless potentials for their employees. This company pays great, offers tuition payments in full and has great benefits. This job requires some very serious commitments from their employees and can be stressful at times."
good,"Benefits are the best in America. No question about that. Advancement is poor. You have to know someone to advance. You can be the best at what you do and be the most diligent worker but unless you're in with management, you will not advance."
good,I only left this company to get out of retail and back into outside sales.
good,"A typical work day would consist of assisting internal and external customers via telephone, e-mail or interoffice message in a professional, helpful and courteous manner to resolve service issues with landline telephone services. Various positions within the company taught me the value of excellent customer service and teamwork. Cases often required assistance from other entities, which is where patience and persistence became a valuable trait when cases could not be resolved with a transaction or two. The most difficult part of the job was when service issues had to be escalated and management had to be involved, but more times than not, service issues were ultimately resolved by the associates. That being said, the most enjoyable part of the job for me was being able to work (independently) with minimal supervision using various computer systems to analyze and resolve issues as quickly as possible."
good,interesting experience with excellent benefits and coworkers.
good,Signing in to our phones and be prepared for any calls. Co-workes from previous shifts let us know whats going on and we continue what is left.

good,"The Quality Control team put together great group of people with unique background.  Many things have changed since day one but all of the team member were able to make adjustment or change without trouble.

Learned a lot about the structure and workflow of digital media process and its market."
good,"Throughout my time with Verizon Wireless, i have learned many things that have changed who I am for the better.

My last supervisor was horrible and liked to intimidate his employees, and the reason I left the company, I could not get off his team with the shift bids.

If a technician was on a job and had no service it was my responsibility to correct the problem quickly.  I was also in charge of damage repair and unforeseen problems.  I was very proud to be part of a very small but talented team.  I was the newest member on the team so when the layoff came around I was the first to be let go, regardless of my numbers being the best in my department, my perfect attendance, and my supervisors being very pleased with my performance."

good,"You encounter a lot of people everyday. You diagnose their situation and try to come up with the best possible solution for your customer while trying to maintain certain metrics. I've learned a lot of patience, developed the skill to communicate with people effectively, and the ability to think outside of the norm to help people. Management likes to micro manage their employees but also make sure that they are getting the most out of their employees. My co workers along with management function as a unit and work as a team.

The most enjoyable part is when the sale is complete and the customer is satisfied with their device and service."
good,"More or less a taste of the corporate world,those who advance aren't necessarily the most qualified or knowledgable. Day usually consists of helping out customers with service and sales, trying to make sales out of anything. Co-workers are among the same age range,makes work more enjoyable.

What One manager though was OK or good another my not so depending on what team you are on you will get different reactions from management...

good,"On an average day for a call center supervisor priorities frequently got muddled by conflicting requirements.. Though company is very customer focued sometimes the demands of day-to-day operations could hinder the ultimate goal. Excellent people to work with, most are hard-working and dedicated.

Most enjoyable part of the job were the people and benefits."
good,"Verizon was a wonderful company to work for with excellent benefits, and friendly co-workers.

Management requires strict reporting of sales opportunities to provide forecasts so they may in turn, keep the shareholders informed of monthly, quarterly and annual results."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work monetarily, however the rewards come at a price. The work can be demanding physically and mentally. As a cable splicing maintenance specialist I worked in all environments (typically alone), all times of day and all weather conditions. My training was to troubleshoot and repair faults in the telephone facilities where ever they might be. I also worked directly with the consumer to restore residential and commercial telephone and internet service."
good,I loved the people I worked with at Verizon. They offered great benefits and a nice working environment.

good,"Verizon Wireless is a challenging environment with opportunity for advancement with great perks such as 401K, Weekend Shift differentials and a solid work schedule that is flexible for work and life balance. Typical day at work is answering in-bound calls from customers to resolve technical and billing issues. The hardest part of the job is sticking to the script that is required to resolve customer concerns. Not all customers are the same in that regard. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of resolving a customer's issue and knowing that you helped improve their relationship with their product."
good,"A typical day at work would consist selling and trouble shooting wireless devices. That in and of itself requires and solid knowledge of each product and the accompanying wireless plan. working with VZW I learned the importance of continuous training and staying on top of new information. The management varied, some managers were above exceptional and others seemed to be absolutely clueless. Over my co-workers and I developed pretty solid relationships, so much so that we would even tag team to close sells and pass sells to struggling sells rep. The hardest part of this job was giving each customer the most complete experience without spending to much time and losing out on money."
good,"Verizon was always offering training, classes very great benefits"
good,There are office politics but then I haven't worked in a place that doesn't have politics. The managers I have worked with so far are very good on work/life balance. There are times when I have to work late but they are also very understanding when I need to work from home. Sometimes directions can be a bit confusing and vague.
good,A typical day would be to make sure my team and my store is run at the top levels. Meeting or exceeding our daily goals which in turn will push us to our overall monthly goals.
good,Upon arrival I would log into all systems. I would then see how many new troubles dropped into the Potomac area and if ther were any outages. After obtaining that information I would then start making customer calls to troubleshoot. If I was not able to resolve the problem over the phone I would then schedule an appointment for a Fios technicain to visit the customers premise. When my workload for the day was completed I would share with my supervisor any complaints or supervisor callbacks. There was not really a hard part of my job. What I enjoyed about my job is knowing that I was able to satisfy some customers by getting them back in service the sameday.
good,Great people worked for the company. The job itself was hard (lots of angry customers) but it was nice to always have smart people to work around. Company gave me opportunity to complete a degree and helped me advance my skills in the area I went to school for.
good,"Pay and benefits are excellent, though the stress and hours aren't the greatest especially when you're a student trying to finish your degree."
good,Verizon Wireless is a good company to work for if you can get in under the right position. The company tries to make the very stressful customer service work fun by offering incentives such as team partries or time off the phones. Although the company has great benefits a customer service call position is really under paid for all the things agents have to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the job for me has been meeting and building relationships with my peers.
good,Great job and provided great experience. I loved the day to day work jobs and my co-workers. Management was great. I think the hardest part of the job was that the Verizon tries to act a certain way but end up acting the way they don't want to.

I answer about 60-70 calls a day from inbound callers about their bills,, features, and troubleshoot their device issues when needed. My co-workers are a very supportive group of individuals and we all get along great and help each other make it through the day. Being at Verizon for the past 5 years I have learned a great deal about the wireless industry and what it takes to operate a telecommunications company. I have also learned that the telecommunications industry is every changing, some ways for the good and some ways that may be perceived as not so good for everyone involved. The hardest part of my job is making sure everyone is a part of a win-win situation, especially when the customer is irrate and a solution seems impossible. But I love the challenges that the job presents. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people and resolving their issues."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. The management team really care about the employees and their well being. The benefits are awesome and they offer plenty of room for growth.
good,A typical day for me now as a Supervisor is managing my team and their performance. Daily review of customer satisfaction and productivity numbers. Weekly and monthly review of all metrics and analyzing for trends and creating action plans where necessary. In past when I was managing projects I would have weekly meetings with project teams to review our plan and where we were to prepare for presentations to senior management. Also presented on Outsource Partners I managed. The hardest part of the job is having to release someone that has potential but just will not come to work and try. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing others succeed and achieve their goals and advance. My coworkers are some of the best people I have ever worked with dedicated to doing the right thing and customer satisfaction. Which is what made Verizon Wireless great.
good,Pay and benefits are great. co workers were very nice. Sometimes the call volume would get high. I really liked their training and how they let you get profeciaent with one part before teaching you another.
good,"Typical day at works consists of meetings offsite with customers and several internal and external conference calls discussing business drivers and requirements to move proposals through the sales cycle. I also spend time to cultivating new prospective customers to add to the base of accounts. The meetings help to position with VP/C-level and uncover needs and business challenges to integrate our IT solutions. The hardest part of the job is the extensive processes for sales cycle and getting a quote/agreement to customer quickly. The other challenges are being responsible for more than just selling. Account managers sell the solution, place the orders, handle service management, and project management for the accounts."
good," Responsibilities include catering to customer’s inquiry regarding Device (Renewals, Upgrades and New connections), Plans, Features and Options."
good,The people and work was exciting and rewqarding. My department was being downsized to move work to a new department. We were a group from the MCI company that had be retained to manage the Verizon Business units until they were merged into Verizon systems. Great place to work
good,Typical days consist of coming into work and trying to meet sales goals for the day while dealing with customer service issues. Management changes very often and there is a poor work life balance like most other retail based jobs without a set schedule. Overtime is expected almost all holidays or during any sales or promotional offers.
good,I enjoy working for Verizon. It is a great company with great people. My workplace is very comfortable and my management is very understanding and accomodating. The hardest part of my job would be maintaning balance. My job requires both sales and service of customer accounts. At times it can be difficult to acheive the balance between the two functions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the reward of making a sale. It is very satisfying to know I helped a customer and made a difference in their business.
good,Great place to work but didn't work here very long before I was at CACI
good,"great pay and compensation, little ability to have a work/life balance"
good,"Busy call center environment, always teaching and upgrading information on new products and service consistently. Management engaged and friendly, hardest part of job is shift bids... changing hour 2-3 times a year."
good,"The day consistes of inbound calls where customers are assisted with account management, updates, recommendations & resolutions. There are several trainings to ensure we are current with device information & best product to refer to customers, customer care focus to ensure customer satisfaction. Many supportive managers, with a diverse group of co-workers willing to assist whenever possible. The hardest part of the job is probably positioning negative impacts to a customer's account. The most enjoyable is hearing a customer give accolades about the company or the great customer care they just received."
good,"Verizon is an excellent but difficult company with which to work. There are many opportunities and you will learn the technology and business industries simultaneously. A typical day varies immensely by position and how much traffic there is. Management vary greatly in personality and management styles, but anyone far up the chain of command is knowledgeable. Coworkers are fun and most have degrees and or have management and leadership backgrounds. The hardest part is staying up on new products, services and promotions, as well as being motivated during slow or unproductive times. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know and use all the cool stuff as soon as (or even before) it is released."
good,A typical day at Verizon Wireless consists of giving the best customer service and turning every meeting into a sales opportunity.
good,"A typical day involved helping customers manage their account, from applying payments to activating new phones or replacement phones as well as basic troubleshooting and being a customer advocate. The people there were nice, the hardest part of the job was helping or attempting to help rude people or angry individuals that had called in alot. In contrast the most enjoyable part was learning the new technology before the general market saw it."
good,Everything is balanced. Not much of workload i suppose. It has a healthy environment to work.
good,answering inbound calls for customers about concerns wtih their personal accounts or troubleshooting their equipment if they are having issues with any devices.
good,"Meetings,Presentations,status calls etc"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great benefits and flexible hours, variety of locations to work, strong sales experience is beneficial to potential income, personality is a huge benefit to success"
good,"Great compensation, and incredible training. Great place to work if you want to make money."
good,"If you're a people person and don't mind being stationary for 8+ hours a day/doing repetitive motions/de-escalating situations while trying to brand your call, then this is a great company to work for. If you're in one of the 'Center of Excellence/Loyalty' centers, there are a lot of additional expectations placed on you, however, in addition to your standard duties."
good,I had alot of fun and i learned a lot of new things working for verizon. it helped me boardin my senses and helped me see that there are different types of customer service
good,"I have grown so much with this company and have had so many incredible opportunities offered to me during my tenure. While it is a great place to work, it isn't an easy place to work. Work/life balance is very difficult to achieve, as it is a performance based company and above and beyond is often what is required to get the job done. The best part of my job is getting shoulder to shoulder with my staff in the trenches and showing them how to get past their opportunities. There is no greater reward than seeing the light come on and having an employee come up to you to share their success."
good,* Routine work based on job title..changes were expected per the industry and manageable
good,"Lots of good memories, fun people to work with, a lot of pressure when it comes to sell, but overall a great working team, I miss them."
good,"As a customer service representative, you will gain experience in a diverse culture. You will learn the ins and out of troubleshooting devices, review billing errors, upgrading equipment and selling new products throughout the day. The most effective part of your overall work day is wowing the customer to earn a perfect survey for performance evaluations. The challenging part of the position is learning to adapt to many situations as each call will be different."
good,I really loved Verizon Wireless. The company was overall excellent. They took care of their employees as far as benefits and bonuses are concerned. Some of the Supervisors we unprofessional and ruined the whole experience. Sometimes the culture was more about who you know rather than what you know. I worked their for three years and loved it until a supervisor ruined it all. He is now fired but unfortunately I could no longer take the abuse since HR would do nothing about it. They paid for two years of my education. I cant complain!
good,loved every minute working there just wish they paid more and were still open!
good,Verizon is a great place to take things that you've learned in school and put them into practice. Ability to work with a lot of different people and management styles. The benefits were the best. I ended up leaving because I thought I was going to be starting with the Air Force and was disqualified right before my start date.

good,Verizon Wireless was a great company at the time. Depending on your manager how flexible they were with work/life balance. I was fortunate to have a lot of great managers. Unfortunately they had a very big lay off and let sr. people go.
good,Love that job. Verizonwireless is a company to work with and to grow with.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I enjoyed working for this fast paced company. It allowed me to set my own goals and work towards them as an individual. The salary and raises were commensurate and the benefits were the so far the best I have experienced.
good,It is my belief that Verizon Communication is a giant in the telecom community. This company has steadily improved their market share by implementing an array of products that enhance the businesses and lives of their customers. Over the 12 years that I was there I never had a dull moment. This company continued to trend forward and allowed expansion to greater possibilities beyond the scope of plain old telephony service.
good,"There was no time to sit around and do nothing as the work load was extensive. However, I did not mind working because my colleagues were great. It was also a place to learn more and to add to my telecom experience."
good,Very fast-paced workplace. Pay and hours worked was great!
good,Verizon is very generous with their benefits package. Great place to work in terms of pay.
good,"Verizon believes in it's credo to act with integrity, but you will need to be open to change which is the only constant with technological advancements"
good,"It's hard to find a job/place where you can find amazing management. They are well trained with very good positive attitudes, and mostly professional. Employees range from a little bit below mediocre to decent but you do have a well liked working environment. Almost everyone is supportive and that's all you could ever ask for, its not perfect but at least they strive to be. Overall a very good experience, highly recommend working here."
good,"Keep the customer as a priority."
good,"Excellent Benefits, Typical Day work 8 hrs of communicating with customers via phone or on-line. Paid Vacation and Holidays, Training available at all times. Yearly Bonus and performance driven raise."
good,Was a very fast paced job with multiple different aspects about the daily workings of the facility. Workplace culture was very inviting among the employees and especially the management
good,"I worked a lot of hours, but got paid very well. Overall it was worth working 60 hours a week for the money I got paid. The insurance package was outstanding."
good,Great flexibility and pay with the ability to work remotely in some instances. I enjoyed a great career before accepting a voluntary severance package.
good,"Exceptional Benefits Package "
good,Overall I really enjoyed working at Verizon. My experience helped me become a better salesman and understand what customer service really means. The company rewards those who want to work in order to become successful.
good,"A great organization that fosters a number of great products and solutions, I would recommend thid company that enjoys a fast paced environment and great commissions."
good,A typical day at work was very educational and family oriented as well as a positive environment. The position does present it's challenges in which they provide the proper help needed.
good,"fast pace work place with constant change and lots of flexibility when it comes to managing your time, if you are one who are good at multitasking and excellent in providing customer service this is the place to be. you will be benefited great with great pay, great benefits and other career opportunities."
good,"Good  "
good,Its a good workplace. I enjoyed working there. Management was encouraging to explore new things. Compensation was also as per the market rate. Recommended
good,"Very innovative company that grew and helped grow the use of wireless services/products in society."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. The Verizon business side offers a lot. The only thing I dont like is the contract to hire portion but that is the way of most engineering jobs these days.
good,"Leader in communication and technology. Culture, Flexible work time Benefits, Open space environment, Flexible work time Open space environment. Its a great place for growth and career development"
good,Only problem I have is that you make less money each year and quotas keep going up. Alot of people who have been with the company for years are leaving because ofnthis.
good,"Outstanding benefits: 6% 401k, profit sharing, disability/maternity/paternity leave, benefits, health/dental. Great people, competitive environment, many different channels to move to, great room for growth."
good,"Good work place, lot of potential to learn various technologies; Good benefits. Good for work and family balance. Keeps up with latest technologies and  good focus on customers"
good,"Really enjoyed working at Verizon. Very challenging and satisfying. Always a sense of accomplishment . Never a dull day. Worked with many other qualified technicians and engineers across the U. S. Had opportunity to be lead tech on many projects. Example, FAA LINCS, Chase Bank, Bank of the West Voip conversion projects."
good,"I LOVED the challenge, being a part of a huge company, and all of the learning for the first year or two. Most Supervisors were so busy with thier workload if someone needed more help then the standard once a month (and at the most one more time a week for 30min) that they just didn't have time. If you are meeting &/or exceeding all metrics and can't balance even one for 3 months then your expendable even after years of being there. So many of my coworkers tried their best to plug in and meet the challenges. Some succeed but many found the machine ate them alive. I'm still a customer and it made gave me so many skills but I would never do i6 again."
good,"Interesting workplace,The hiring process was flawed and on-boarding as a contractor left me without access to data to do my job. I was hired because, I ""had the longest resume""."
good,"It was a cool place to work the team was good. I enjoyed the team they make you feel as a family, lot was accomplished and we still had a good time."
good,Had very good experience working. very good team had learnt alot from the team. balancing work and family was the best thing at the same time had lot of fun working with the team
good,"I left because Verizon sold its holding  in Texas to Frontier and I was transferred to Frontier.  Overall Verizon is a very good company to work for, loved coworkers there"
good,The company provide a wide variety of opportunity to grow as a professional. It also provides a space to approach others with ideas to help develop new ideas to seek development.
good,"Great place to work, only thing they didn't do is offer paid vacation. Owners are hands on and really good people. Great hours and they are very accommodating to where you live"
good,"Work hard, be accountable to your results and efforts and don't make excuses. This is a place that celebrates hard work and dedication to the overall goals of the company."
good,I like Verizon it’sa good company they pay off commission and they no hourly wages so yeah it’s ok Verizon good in the hood. All hood from the Bronx to Brooklyn to Queens
good,Its pretty fun but competitive. There are some spiffs depending on location. Customers are hard to deal with for multiple reasons. You get up to date news on company pa
good,Just relocated to Denver after my divorce with my wife decided it was best to move to the mountains and engage and use my sales talents in a much broader environment
good,"Work experience gently introduces you to the world of work. You get to learn the do’s and don’ts, get work place savvy and learn to navigate your way through the jungle of office politics. Vitally, it’ll give you an idea of the skills you might need to thrive in the workplace."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A great company to work for. Management was very understanding and willing to work with you. Benefits were great. Compensation and incentives were also great.
good,"If you can exceed Verizon's sales expectations you can make a lot of money. The ability to advance is amazing if performance is good, job security is amazing pretty hard place to get fired from."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Verizon, I had awesome co-workers and great managers, the training was long but if you pay attention and try your hardest you will succeed in learning all the portals required for customer service. Yes it can be stressful due to the call volume, the customer's ranting, but you CAN NOT take it personal. I like the fact that you can decorate your area to make it feel more comfortable and reduce your stress levels. The company offers great benefits that start at day 1 which everyone loves. The company tries to be fair by giving those who do their job well an advantage when choosing their schedule but honestly that system does not work for everybody which is why some people leave. For me I was in school and a mother and not so stable working hours is why I left. Every six months your schedule may change. The pay was really well for a customer service call center environment. I would have loved to grow with the company because they do promote within. Overall 4/5 for me."
good,Good company to begin your career. Nice environment. Good Perks. But it also depends on the team you are into. Luckily I joined a great team and I was able to learn a lot
good,"good culture, solid technology, leadership and management.  There is many opportunities for advancement.  Partnerships with other leading technology companies to help provide nice solutions for business clients"
good,"At Verizon, a Lineman has a dangerous job. There are many factors taken when doing the work we do to perform it safely and efficiently. I enjoyed that on a daily basis, although I was an expert in my field doing the job for more than 31 years. I still had to treat each job as a new one in order to perform it safely. I enjoyed doing quality work and coming up with solutions when problems arose. I enjoyed looking back at work that I  completed and being proud of what I accomplished. My Goal is for whatever I work on to look better than what it did originally"
good,"It involves growing with a company where I can continue to learn, take on additional responsibilities, and contribute as much of value as I can. I have been working as a Java Developer."
good,I have been with Verizon for about 15 years and have been happy with the company and the benefits that are provided. The benefits are above any  other company.
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for. I was able to strengthen my sales and networking skills through their use of KPI's and customer retention practices. The overall culture within the company was friendly and motivating. I had a great team in which we were all able to connect and help each other grow. What made the job fun was the challenge of reaching our KPI's. Nonetheless, helping people with their plans and setting up and connecting their devices was a satisfying experience because it can be an annoying process for the customer if they do not have a great sales representative to help guide them."
good,"typical workday start with scrum call where review of the current assignment, progress and new task assign. plan to meet target and delivery of production date.reaching out other team member to discuss issues and then focus on completing the task during the day."
good,"Great company,  position no longer available. Move towards the wireless side of the company. Management was easy to work for and encourage those to move up ."
good,"You get lot's of paid training and mock calls before hitting the phones. Once you do, you have TONS of informational resources to draw upon. In between phone times you get coaching all the time in a frame that helps you improve. As any call center there can be cliques, however, I found that to be less the case in groups of highly motivated and successful teams."
good,"Technology always evolves and environment here adapts to change well.  You have plenty of opportunity for growth as long as you apply yourself and stay aligned with the right people. The pay is great, but (depending upon the position) the work/life balance could use some improvement."
good,Great place to grow and progress if/ when granted opportunity. Took a while to solidify my position however perseverance prevails. Hard work and dedication will guarantee job security.
good,"Lots of opportunity for engineers in any aspect of mobile communications.  Excellent mobility within company. Good management.Heavy bureaucracy, though."
good,Work with customers regarding phone plans and phone devices. Understand customers needs and wants to find them the appropriate solution. Get to work with a lot of different people and gain customer service skills.
good,Building computer software. very conducive place to work with up to date Equipment. management was quick to respond to equipment replacement  and accommodate employees schedule. The most enjoyable part was the friendly working environment
good,This place was fun and great to learn to build work experiences.  Good working environment in general with colleagues.   This was a typical 9-5 job.  Managements were very supportive of their staffs.
good,"Great work culture, but sometimes it was hard to get a good work/life balance. There were plenty of resources available should we need them. Overall, it was a lovely company to work for."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Company is good but management still has old ways of working. Too much command and control managers. Management needs to adopt new ways of working and be strategic and less of a tactician.
good,"- Positive atmosphere"
good,"It was nice working experience with the company for 3 years and would look forward to work with them in my future endeavors. I was part of the innovative team and got to learn and work with new features like interacting barcode scanners with WPF applications, Working with IOT devices."
good,I would recommend this job to someone. The company has really good training and incentives for employees.I felt that I was apart of a team working with Verizon.
good,its a gud place to work on i would recommend work culture there good work family life balance would suggest this place to work and for learning new technology
good,"Overall Verizon CAN be a great place to work. Honestly, the quality of work is determined by the store manager. This company has a lot of change, some good and others bad. if your store has a slow month and quotas are high, please expect 0 help from the higher ups. Ultimately I would recommend Verizon, but I would also suggest to talk to other store reps to get an idea of how that stores managers operate before taking the job."
good,Great company to build a career with especially if you connect with new products & technologies.  The complex was recently remodeled to a bright & open office environment which led to productive & rewarding work days.
good,"Good money, OT available if you work in sales. Management generally has your best interest in mind and will help you learn the sales process. Overall satisfying job."
good,"Nice company to work. We can have better work-life balance. Not much growth in the career. Workplace is good.  Flexible timing, no restriction."
good,Good company to work with opportunities to work and learn on cutting edge technology. There are several resources available to help you find the best possible solution to your needs.

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,"Good place to work , flexible work locations could would at home as needed. Verizon had good benefits, fair pay and provided the tools needed to do you job."
good,"Verizon is a changing company so you must change with it. Sales roles are demanding but also rewarding. They definitely pay in the top 3rd percentile for my area. If you're mobile, flexible, and can deliver results then you can expect plenty of opportunities to advance. The retail environment is like most but pays exceptionally compared to other experiences I've had. The direct outside sales roles are much more demanding."
good,Great company to work for and start a formidable career with.  All you need to have is a good knowledge of the products and promotions.  Use this company to get ahead.
good,It's been a while since I worked there. But when I was there the company had a really great training program. They provided an abundance of resources to be successful. They also focused on developing the agents for their next role. I was young when I work there but if I know what I know now I would have stayed.
good,Each day I would be in charge of delivering the team a sales message bast on growth and revenue that provide solutions that fit customers needs.

good,At Verizon you will have a very busy day working on the phones and interacting with employees and supervisors. This company has great  health insurance benefits as well as discounts with their service. They offer good promos as well.
good,Verizon values their employees and wants to help them be the best they can be.  I enjoyed my years at Verizon and only wish it was not over for me working there.
good,Verizon was good to me and it’s a nice place to work.  They provide plenty of opportunity to move up and grow plus take good care of their employees.  Thumbs up 👍🏾
good,Verizon is an overall excellent company to work for.. the calls can be overwhelming at times but the pay and the benefits are well worth being an empoloyee
good,"Very good pay with benefits but also a very stressful demanding job. not for the ""cashier"" mindset.  Always fixing issues, problems. Always have to meet sales goals/qoutas that constantly change. You control your paycheck, so you MUST always possess a positive go-getter attitude."
good,"Nice place to work"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was learning experience.  If you are driven you can grow in this company but not everyone is built for this job; it can be stressful. I enjoyed the group of people I worked with.  I was fortunate to have supportive supervisors but you are expected to work independently with minimum supervisor assistance.
good,I loved working at Verizon. The management opportunities to grow in the company were less than inviting but overall I enjoyed my time here. I recommend working here if you want to get your foot in the door with tech support and to earn valuable experience in consultative sales.
good,Fast paced and can be very stressful Call Center. Does have a full cafeteria. Training is provided. It is a 24/7 call center. A typical day is signing in and start taking calls. Calls are monitored and there are scripts.
good,Great place to work.  If you like politics you'll get ahead in that atmosphere. I made a lot of money working there.  Flexible work schedule and awesome 401k.
good,This job taught me a lot about customer service and also great communication skills for sales. I learned how work well with others while still being in competition with them for sales. This job also taught me how to speak well and be proficient with sells. I enjoyed being talkative and getting great bonus checks.
good,"My time at Verizon was good"
good,"Truly a ""For Profit"" business, however, the management team really does seem to care about the front line crew.   Occasionally, I ran across a manager who was primarily focused on the numbers but they seemed to work themselves out of the business.   The managers (upper levels) who really tend to focus on the people stick around a bit longer and seem to be more successful.   I really enjoyed the store level culture and had a great team.   I choose to work at a particular store because of the way I was treated as a customer before being employed there.   I remained there because they allowed me to focus on my customers.   Occasionally, I felt, that cooperate policies prevented me from really doing what was right for the customer.  Most often I was allowed to do the right thing for the customer.   That made them happy which, in turn, made me happy.  Overall, a very positive company and positive work experience."
good,"Excellent work place where you get to learn and implement various technologies. "
good,Verizon has good development growth programs for those who show interest in moving up. The management team are all very helpful and knowledgable. Easy for one to shadow and pick up on what there is to learn.
good,Good place to work and everyone’s a team player .. this was a contracting role but it felt like permanent cause mangers and coworkers were really friendly and helpful.
good,Great place to start at the bottom and work your way up. The work place environment was outstanding. The customer service aspect was great as you got to meet a lot of people and help them in the technology field.
good,"Great work/Life balance and they pay for your education. For a call center it does not have a high turn over rate. Relaxed work place, and they allow for you to choose different schedules so you not distressed."
good,"They take good care of their employees. They have great benefits, including year end bonuses.  The call center is very diverisfied and the management is great to work with."
good,"I was able to balance career and life. Compensation was good. Verizon pushed you hard to excel. Communication was key to the company, but often misinterpreted because it's a large scale company."
good,Decent place to work if you like corporate structure. Its simple you sell phones dont worry about having to know anything about a cellphone most people dont when they start.
good,"I like to work with verizon because they are so organized company, and they deal well with me and I do not have any issue in my job and I received my payment in certain day"
good,Verizon was a great place to work.  They provided me with the flexible schedule to be both a mother and a professional working toward an executive career.
good,"Great place to work if you like experiencing something different everyday. No two days are ever alike, there is always something new to learn with every customer interaction."
good,"Company shifting from a numbers/results focused engine to a behavioral based retail environment. Coaching and conversations are based on maintaining the same behaviors thru each customer interaction vs pure numbers attainment. Store hours make it difficult for work/life balance due to fluctuations in store hours/schedule. Great benefits. Fast paced, people friendly work environment if you build the right culture on your team."
good,Working at Verizon was a great experience all around. Only complaint I have is that the compensation was too low compared to the cost of living in Florida.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Working for Verizon in the Seattle area was an amazing experience. I would recommend anyone that is interested in learning how to discover customer needs or someone that is looking to advance their knowledge in a business to business position this is a great place to start. I've seen many people that I started out with continue to advance with Verizon and be rewarded with amazing opportunities. As well as provide for their families. The work atmosphere can be stressful.You have to be able to manage your life and your work life. Be mindful to understand that when you're at work you're working. The management team at Woodinville location was amazing they were very accommodating to our sales team. I felt very fortunate that there were many coworkers dad had been with Verizon for 5 to 10 years in a multitude of different positions with a vast knowledge of the industry and how to educate new sales representatives and customers.
good,I am thankful to have an opportunity to work and learn from my colleagues and management over years working with verizon.  I have enjoyed working at verizon and have made a number of friends during my stay with verizon.  thankyou verizon.
good,"The expected was not there , spontaneous warm environment that i was glad to be apart of and would continue if my situational progress was better , overall more than i can ask for."
good,"All about the bottom line-revenue I retired from Verizon a year ago nd I do not feel obligated to rate this company.  It is a far different company and culture from when I first started,"
good,"Verizon is a great place place to work.  They offer flexible working arrangements when applicable.  Competitive salary, bonus and benefits.  I would recommend Verizon as a place to work."
good,"During my time with Verizon was a great experience I learned so many great things from my management , great learning tools to help me succeed with the job ."
good,"Great place to work.   Fast paced environment. Great people.   Many good times and great coworkers. If I had the opportunity to do it all again, I wouldn’t change a thing."
good,It's a call center job so there are the normal stresses that come with that. The Supervisors and Senior Managers do a good job of mitigating that though. And the benefits are the best I've ever had.
good,"My favorite was working as an Economist. Hardest job-but most fulfilling and rewarding. "
good,Its a great company to work for. It has job security. you can make great money if you know how to sell and have patience . benefits are amazing as well
good,There is no formal road map to advance your career.   They have limits as to how many people can be promoted to certain level at the regional level.   You learn a lot and the benefits are excellent.  If there was more room for advancement at a regional level I would have given them 5 stars.
good,awesome company. great culture. good management. people are nice and pleasant. nice company to work for. will highly recommend..............................
good,Great benefits and pay with some outstanding leaders.  My time with Verizon taught me valuable skills as Verizon is consistently one of the top companies when it comes to training it's employees.  Skills learned (especially in leadership roles) are transferable to other industries.
good,"Great benefits and bonuses. I the nicest coworkers, manager and director. When the new CEO came on board, the layoffs began. Severance was great and they even gave an additional severance package to never work for Verizon again."
good,"Great group of coworkers made it easy to adjust. As someone with no prior sales experience, it was an easy transition into the role. Management assisted whenever they could as well."
good,"I hired in right after the CEO of MCI took all of the money so former MCI employees became Verizon Business employees and all of their  retirement money was frozen.  If you weren't on the Verizon Wireless side which was the revenue generator you constantly worried if your job would still exist.   When they merged Verizon Business with Core Verizon, that is when the political shenanigans began.  Hopefully it is much better now.  This was in 2012"
good,"It is a great company. There is the opportunity for growth. However, professional patience is key. If you want to grow and be compensated while doing so Verizon is the place. The tools are made available to you but hard work must be put in and a positive attitude must be worn."
good,Don't do to much but receive decent environment to work in here. Would recommend anyone who is in sales at the moment. Managed are excellent and no one hounds you.
good,Extemely stressful job due to the type of customer interactions. Also the push to meet certain matrix can make or break you. Good support and push to succeed
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Always training employees and providing advancement opportunities. I started as a sales rep and was able to earn a retail support position. Couldn't be more grateful for the opportunities that have been awarded to me."
good,"My work at Verizon, was enjoyable, communication amongst peers was promoted, location to facilities had easy access, 45 minute commute door to door. Interacting with Field Techs very rewarding."
good,Verizon offered the best benefits package out of all of the companies I'd work with previously. Slow to no promotional opportunity. Some management allowed a flexible work style.
good,"Verizon landline was a great job, I worked there for more than 20 years.  As long as you do your job, and are reliable and responsible, it will always go smoothly."
good,"Need a new line? no worries we've got you covered. Hows your data holding up, let me make sure safety modes on to assure no overages charged. "
good,"work is stressful but i like the culture of Verizon "
good,"Focused on satisfying our customers, making sure they are happy with their products; and our services that we have provided for them. You have a limited amount of time to speak with one customer so you have to make sure to answer all questions and concerns within the allotted necessary"
good,This job was a great one! The employees and management are really friendly and help graciously to build you up as  person nd  a team member. They want to see you win in all aspects of your life!
good,"Dealt with a lot of irate customers, but that came with the territory being in Customer Service. The culture there was excellent and I would definitely suggest to others to work there."
good,"I enjoyed meeting different people everyday and was challenged by their individual needs. The diversity in the staff made the atmosphere light and easy going.  During busy times, all members of management were readily available for support."
good,Getting to help clients out and making sure their experience is beyond exceptional is the best part about this job. But there are those people who just do not care about everyone and end up putting a bitter taste in clients and fellow reps.
good,"love it. Great place to work, if you get the chance take it and make the best of it all.  If the commute was not so far I would still be there today.  I would go back no questions asked."
good,Verizon was a great place to work overall.  I was paid a great salary with a yearly bonus and given the leeway to make decisions interdependently.  The only reason I left was due to a re-organization and a mandatory move.
good,"Verizon provided an open work space - which allowed for more personable interaction with people and team while in the office. Ultimately I worked from home due to distance, scheduled calendar meetings and customer appointments. I learned to that in order to communicate effectively and proficiently you must follow up emails with phone calls to ensure questions or concerns are being addressed in a timely manner.  Management - was very respectful and engaged as needed to help push and engage resources necessary to escalate matters as needed in efforts to meet business needs.  Work culture was somewhat disjointed but cohesive enough to complete tasks with the right people escalating. The hardest part of my job was getting through Verizon process' as they are not always clearly defined and accessible due to change of people and no centralized repository for information.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers to understand their business needs and engaging the proper internal resources to make the plan come together for both the customer and Verizon. Which resulted in new contracted sales revenue and closed deals!!!"
good,"Verizon is all about the customer, and making sure its staff takes care of their customer Verizon does a good job at taking care of their employees. They have amazing benefits to offer their workforce from, tuition reimbursement, parental leave, profit sharing, 401k/Roth match, adoption assistance, and numerous discounts with Verizon and other companies. Though most jobs with Verizon are high stress jobs, they do have a very competitive pay that is worth the stress and demand of the job. Verizon is a very forward thinking company and continuously changing and you must be willing to embrace the change you are going through, since part of Verizon's mission is that 'change empowers us'. Overall, Verizon is a great company to work for and I would suggest the company to anyone!"
good,"The job was worth it. A work day consists of 8 hours of assisting customers, finding sales opportunities, constant talks with management the hardest part is dealing with upset customers or the limitation in help we can offer in the store"

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,This company is decent. they paid really well and gave bonuses. downfall us the high pressure of sales. Also a very structured schedule not much flexibility.
good,I worked in the Dublin OH corporate call center started out in financial services then went to customer care from 2006-2012. The hours very as far as start times you bid on times you want and depending on how good your stats were would determine your shift. The company at the time would have lunches catered in and even games and photo booths to keep  morale up. Now customer service call center Associates work from home and have better pay now.  I think this was a great place to work. The benefits were outstanding.
good,"Great place to build a customer base and repore. High energy is best, problem solving is a must. Be a team player in a competitive work zone.........."

good,"The company tiself had great benefits, pay for position and work environment. The downside was that as a call center, it was EXTREMELY stressful depending on your department worked in. Dealing with irate/angry customers over their mobile devices and cell phones was enough that if not used to it or able to brush it off, would in fact induce panic attacks & even a couple heart attacks to workers who were not as well fit for the positions. You need a special type of personality ot let rude, angry, irate people either roll off the shoulders or just see past the negative feel of some calls.If you can handle that, are driven and able to balance the slew of dozens of work performance metrics ( which sadly some contradicted and offset each other) then you had a chance to go far. Great yearly bonus incentives and generous overtime pay were great and encouraged high work morale."
good,"Good company to work, nice salary, bonus, nice team, working conditions, they allow working from home. Big IT shop to learn a lot from other team members."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon. I enjoyed assisting customers with customer service issues, technical issues, and choosing the right device (mobile phone, jetpack, tablet, etc) that would take care of their needs.With this job you learn to be patient and to listen to what the customers are saying."
good,"The working environment Verizon provided was an excellent place to learn the different aspects of the company.  There was numerous chances of advancement with the ability to be trained for the new department you transferred to.  The benefits that were offered were top notch, not many companies were able to match what Verizon provided."
good,"Great place to work! Great autonomy allowed, however, regardless how great you are at your job frequent quarterly layoffs occur for those employees hired at will states!"
good,"At verizon they give you ample time to do vzlearn to better yourself, the culture is good, management is ok but it depends on who you have for a manager, they also have management classed that you have to take to enhance your management ability."
good,"Verizon is a great place to start a foundation, when it come to starting a career. From the time I've work there there management was great and work life could be no better for my kids. The reps I support help make me love love to come to work. The reason is because is get show and help some one new everyday and in return learn from them. The hardest part of my job is to support 2 call centers and retail as a single IT person completing all my task within 40 hours a week. Verizon in my eyes is one of the greatest companies to work for, and I'm glad to be a part of."
good,"The company was a really good company to work for when I worked in the call center, with more flexibility. Verizon also has great benefits for their employees and families."

Managed complex and changing travel arrangements."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Good place to work I would recommend it to a friend. This can be difficult work if you think it's going to not be stressful or a cake walk you have the wrong company. Be prepared for long hours.
good,"The work environment was very competitive and had awesome incentives when the store was ran the right way , but once the new district manager ,came in and pushed people away by transferring every to different store to change up the work place, everyone slowly quit or went to a different company like Sprint or at&t."
good,"With the current transition of work toninfosys culture has declined "
good,"I started working for Verizon as a sales representative back in 2014. The commission was great. I was looking at $4,000 commission checks every month plus my hourly and over time. The culture of the store was awesome. We had team builders every other month for us to build relationships with eachother. On top of that we carried out monthly competitions for rewards like giftcards, extra money on checks, and coffee, lunches. I felt like being in the sales department helped me learn a lot about communication, discovering with my guests and using that information to upsell each guest by giving them a solution. Verizon gave me the opportunity to move up in the company. As a sales rep, they started teaching me the dynamics early on for a leadership position and after three years, I made the jump into management. I made it my goal to create great culture in my store. Happy sales reps equal more money in their pocket and mine as well. As a manager, I spent most my day coaching and mentoring my employees. Jumping into their sales and helping close down the solution for them. I also was the lead for our business partners, which meant reaching out o local businesses to bring in sales. I helped with inventory, tracking profit loss and building the schedule as well. I'm grateful for Verizon in giving me the tools I needed to guild my leadership skills."
good,exciting and challenging position...always learning something new with the constant changed in technology...at the time VZW was the lead in wireless technology and service
good,There was always room to grow and move. The company worked hard to take care of their employees. The job can be stressful but it's all worth it. I loved this job
good,"job changed over the past few years. I did work directly with a sales team until November 2017.  We were all consolidated to work as one group, no longer worked directly for a sales team which I really enjoyed. "
good,"The work culture at Verizon is great. I learned so much from Verizon. The training was very involved but made me the representative that I am today. I was very sad to find out that Verizon was leaving the Henrietta, NY area and I was even more upset that I did not move with the company. It was just not doable at the time."
good,You can contact me to know more....Just kidding...its a fun place...As long you have the skill make the best of it! Your skills are going to show and its all about being yourself.
good,Opportunities for advancement depend on what field you are in. Excellent health & education benefits. Excellent time off program. My position was relocated otherwise I would still be with the company.

good,"Good place to work.............filling this out tho is annoying, and then it gets picky with what you type, like really? I’m just tryna get a job bro.........Finally"
good,"Despite frequently dealing with angry customers, overall not a bad job. Employees are trained very well on all they need to be successful at their job. Position is very metrics-driven, and stats are very important to success, advancement, and employment. Management is a huge help, and really fosters a team approach. All management is promoted from within and coaches employees to be their best."
good,"Nice place to work fro female employees."
good,"I left to pursue schooling, Great overall company, if you are hungry to succeed to you can do so with Verizon. Great structure and great training to prepare you for the job"

good,Typical day was very fast paste. I learned the ins and outs of wireless communications. Senior Management has been changing frequently. Workplace culture was enjoyable.
good,This is surely a great place to network and possibly get you to the next level if you connect with the right people. At times it can be a bit much with so many metrics that you have to meet.
good,"I was with Verizon for 18+ years and enjoyed my time with the company enough to move across the country to continue working for them.  Great company to work for as a woman and part of the LGBT community. The new layout of the offices is difficult to adjust to, but the open floor layout seems to be the way many companies are going."
good,"I enjoyed the job and my associates. The compensation was fair and almost solely commission based so your drive determined your salary. I went from training to too sales fairly quickly and was offered a shift manager position after 3 months, as well as a store manager position within 1 year of employment. After that there was really no more room for advancement within the affiliate."
good,If you can deal with a rotating work shift then this is a good place to work. Verizon went out of their way for their employees and always had activities to relax and entertain. Their training is great.
good,I learned a lot about myself during my employment. Working at verizon taught me how to use my multitasking skills and customer service skills. Over all great place to work and respectable upper management.

good,"Great working environment pay was wonderful and hours where great. Learned a lot from my reps to customers looking forward to rehire soon, also willing to relocate"
good,the job isn't that easy to be honest. the customers expect you to always have an answer or an alternative. the staff at work can be awkward at times but overall it feels like high school and its really wired at times. the workplace can be stressful but the hardest part of the job is not trying to get frustrated when the customers keep arguing over the acts that are displayed on record. i myself am a Verizon customer so i have been in their shoes. the best part of this job is getting that satisfaction of knowing you helped out somebody in another state and making their day. who knows maybe they will make you smile as well its a flip of a coin. you dont know what your going to get

good,I worked for a division that was purchased by Verizon.  Once they took ownership they allowed us to continue to work as per set standards. They took the time to understand what and how we did our day to day functions.  Once they complied the information they returned with some suggestions on how they saw we could improve.
good,An ideal workplace for people who value work/ life balance with great compensation. Decisions take a while which can cause bottlenecks but once a project is greenlit things tend to move fast.

good,"Verizon has been a great company to work for the past 20 years. The company has always had a strong commitment to supporting women in the workplace, to include career development, leadership opportunities and life balance offering benefits for family leave and family support. My kids were very small when I started with the company and Verizon has been there to help me raise my family and for that I will be forever grateful."
good,Had a good time here.  My day to day involved dealing with clients and the advertising program for the Yellow pages.  People were fun and clients were easy to work with.  Google came and wiped it all out.

good,"The culture at Verizon has evolved in the same ways as many other companies of its size and in the same relative industry.

good,"Working here is like any other call center job. There is room for advancement but you have to go through a through interview process and references.

good,Verizon prepares an individual with extensive trainings to work in any field. Verizon provides extensive coaching in having a strong work  ethic that enables you to succeed within the company and outside of the company.
good,"I have been with the company for four years and love my job, at times it can be stressful mainly because of the focus on the customer is always right and we have to maintain metrics. Sometimes the customer are challenging and it is not always their fault, we have vendor centers that don’t do their job and tell the customer what they want to hear. Then pass the buck off to corporate employees to tell them the truth. I have moved many times with the company."
good,"Wonderful benefits and pay, but the retail side is very demanding.  If you have a family it is very difficult to juggle both.  Quotas can be very demanding and hard to obtain at times."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"great environment "
good,Must have a very competitive personality and ability to perform outstanding customer service. A team first mentality makes the job more fun and competitive.
good,"A typical day at work would be to first make sure that the customer is well taken care of. Rather it be with a purchase of a new phone or trouble with accessing material on the device or technical support. What I learned working at Verizon is that you set the bar for your own success. If you come into a job with the right mind set and dedication to be success, then it will show in your performance. Management there were very helpful. They took time out by finding ways to expand our growth within the company and it lead into our store being named the top store in our division at the time. The hardest part of the job is that you have to spend a great amount of time working and less time with family. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to have store events within the company where we could all bond together and build healthy relationships and learn from one another."

good,"Typical day involved communicating with various office personnel such as construction and design engineers, real estate staff, installation managers and upper management. The hardest part of the job was convincing team participants to produce required documents in a more timely manner.

I loved training and coaching the reps and solving customer issues and escalations.  I loved the operational part to the job as well,  working on the inventory and merchandising.

good,"Typical day at work was reading over emails and getting the things needed for working on my pc. Management was great."
good,"My typical day at work was to check and release my representatives' time for payroll. Monitored the representatives calls, spoke with escalated customers and provided feedback to the representative.  The workplace culture was stressful. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the stress of getting all of my work completed and balancing spending the time coaching my reps. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the representatives. I also enjoyed talking with the customers."
good,"yes great  company and health plans good business "
good,"Verizon has been a very good company to work for overall.  I have no complaints.  I am not sure it is going to be a company to make a career in the future.  However, it is a more dynamic place to work than I think people give it credit for."

Upper management is forcing everyone to do more with less but it is impacting our customer base. It is great to play a part in technological advancements .
good,Benefits package and career advancement were excellent. Competitive salary and growing company. I learned a lot at my time with Verizon and truly enjoyed the people and culture.
good,"Great benefits and managerial support.  It was challenging, but was welcomed.  I was proud to be a part of GTE/Verizon.  They gave opportunities for advancements"

good,"Verizon Wireless, the discounts, and health benefits are awesome. However, the job can be stressful because you don't get direct help when you need it"

While I enjoyed this position, at the time the opportunity for advancement was only lateral and while attaining a new title offered no higher pay."

good,"worked in retail and call center environment great workplace environment, great training, great discounts for employees,great benefits, made alot of long term friendships at Verizon"
good,VZW was a great career. It was a great career advancement and able to fully grow. Easy job for the money. Having to change schedules every 6 months to a year could get stressful.
good,I have enjoyed working for Verizon for over 13 years.  At times it can be stressful and there is a lot of reorganization within the company but great benefits and great management
good,Working for Verizon Wireless was nice.  I met a lot of great people. They pay competitively and provide a professional workplace.  They train you well.

good,Assisting customers with upgrade eligibility and allowing them to purchase accessories over the phone. informing on what they are eligible for and what services are available to them.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The day always started an hour before the store opening so we could get the inventory done, clean the store and get the register ready to go. The first thing we would do was stand outside the store and greet customers and get them interested in our company if they were with a different one or get them excited about our new products and services if they were already with us. I personally had a really good, positive and inspiring manager which was really helpful during the day if i struggled with a sale or just anything in general. Personally i think the hardest part of the job was just greeting people since i was not used to it when i started working there and the fact that the meetings they had were late at night and you couldnt miss it even if you had an emergency or you could get fired. The most enjoyable part of the job was the amazing co workers i had, they were all really nice, always positive and willing to help eachother."
good,Working for Verizon can be hard at times but very worth it at the end of the day. I appreciate the motivation and the up to date knowledge of my supervisor and manager.

good,"My experience working at Verizon Wireless was very exciting,sometimes slow, sometimes fast. I started with a company called Alltel, that was purchased by Verizon Wireless. Altel customers  "
good,Everyday is a day to work aggressive. Verizon salary is mainly sales; the harder you work the bigger the reward. Verizon pays great and you have a opportunity to make bigger money with commission.
good,"Good company to work for but too many changes in commission structure, which hinders how much you could be making. Management teaches you a lot of marketable skills, but you take a pay cut going into these types of positions."
good,My experience at Verizon was enjoyable. I learned a great deal about telecommunications. The culture was great and I had a good relationship with my managers.
good,I worked here for 28 years and retired with  great benefits and a handsome package plus a 401k. Great people and opportunities. Not the same company .

good,"Verizon Wireless is a very prestigious company to work for if you like working with the public. A typical day at work would be to meet and greet customers to determine their needs. Management was culture oriented, friendly and pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was not finding enough time to spend with each customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was making my customers happy."
good,Call volume was sometimes stressful. I enjoyed turning calls into a positive experience for customers. The hardest part of the job for me was the technical/troubleshooting part.
good,Overall Verizon was a great company to work for. I would consider working for them again however on the more Technical Side and not customer service/ call center setting.
good,Verizon relay was okay work. I enjoyed the work except for the language some people would use. I was laid off and the company stopped using relay services in Memphis.
good,Typical day consisted with calls from clients to discuss issue and request for new service.  Verizon educated me on how call center representatives should handle calls from clients.  Understanding and empathy. I have met many people throughout my time at Verizon. It was hard work but there were times and memories throughout the years.  That I would not change for the world.  The work was hard but many lessons learned and Verizon made sure you were educated.
good,"There is manadatory overtime, but the compensation is well worth the extra hours.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  It is sad they began to transition out of the home telecommunications market."
good,"My time with company was a job I gave everything for and feeling was not reciprocated. Will say nothing bad of the company I gave 6.5 years about and keep it simple, Thank you."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,I was placed at Verizon Wireless as a temporary assignment. I learned alot there.  I wish they would have had temp to hire.  Verizon Wireless included the temp employees as the Verizon Wireless employees

good,"Work is challenging and fast-paced. Sales targets are aggressive. Be patient, do not take customer complaints personally. Resolve customer complaints."
good,"VZW was a great place to start my corporate career, I got excellent training, worked with awesome people, and learned an immense amount.  I feel that I would have stayed longer if my sales territory was closer.  If you have a chance to work with VZW I would recommend it!"
good,great medical benefits and tuition reimbursement. Also costs for medical and dental were very cheap. Holidays were horrible. You also get a wonderful 401K package.
good,"Overall, it was a great learning experience and a huge sale milestone. Truly miss the way the company treated their employess and never made them feel as if they weren't important."
good,The company has closed several centers including mine. I'm not a home based agent. There are some people I've meet that are now considered family. A typical day is logging in and taking calls for 8 hours.
good,"I don't really have an opinion for most of the things you are asking about. I was a contract worker primarily doing a data conversion. I did enjoy working with the management team, and my primary supervisor was truying to get a position approved at the warehouse closer to San Antonio so he could offer me a full time position."
good,"Very good work environment friendly people, good leaves package, good bonus package, training program was good the job location was close to my home feel safe."
good,"Cons-"
good,Working at Verizon was a good experience. Work monday thru friday with some saturdays for overtime. Verizon is a Union job unless you work for wireless.
good,"I don't remember to much about this company. I as there over 10 years ago. I guess it wasn't to bad, if it was I would not have stayed very long. Like I said I don't remember to much."
good,"Very nice place and nice customers, although it's a kiosk don't expect too much business compared to a free standing store, customers do come though and you get a decent amount of business it's a little hard to hit goals though"
good,"Ensure invoices are received, reconciled and processed for payment."
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon.  The development of team minded employees is excellent. The flexibility of being able to telecommute worked great.  The relationship with the upper management was cohesive and caring.
good,average company to work for.  fast paced - I had to report to several locations to perform my diesel mechanic position.  They do not have a crew of mechanics at each location.  Money is good and the people you work for as well.  Good atmosphere.
good,Another great company to work for. Plenty of room for advancement. Great benefits and compensation. Promoted within first with great training and resources.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon, I learned quite a bit while I was there and the managers I worked with were great and supportive which is great in an organization."
good,When a customer comes in you are expected to sell new lines every time.  You are also expected to sell at least $90 of accessories.  It was required that we consult a manager to let them know our plan to upsell to the expected $90 and to let them know our plan to upsell and get new lines.  We all worked well as a team.  Work days are stressful because of quotas.  The hardest part of the job for me was meeting the quotas that went up every month.
good,good people..good benefit...good payscale...no parking allowance..good location on bus lines.....new contract every three years.............................
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,Fun place to work! I learned a lot about the cell phone industry and sales techniques from Verizon. The pay was great. The work place is very competitive which made it hard.
good,This was a long time ago. This company helped me to learn how to hone my skills at sales and management. It was very fasted paced being in the customer service industry.
good,"I really enjoy working here, flexible hours and everyone is in a good mood when they come to see you (since it is their break). "

Wouldn't love to go back as a contractor, to help with providing excellent customer service both external and internal."

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I really wanted to make this the only time I would have to look for work, but as fate would have it Verizon sold out to frontier. I had a sick mother at this time so when I was laid off it was okay."
good,Was a good place to work. Traveled a lot. Management was very good and let me handle my business without getting in the way. Would work for Verizon again.

good,not much to say but is a good company to work for  will like to stay and move to management but i don't think they really prepare you for that .but i loved it while i was there
good,"My typical work day of week begins with checking emails from the boss, corporation and peers, which helps me stay well informed about my team and about me.  Once checking email is complete I access Project tracker tool, to check the status of projects, new assignments, change or update in assignments, etc. I also attend a weekly team meeting over WebEx where I update my progress along with other mates, to my manager and team members; discuss issues in achieving project goal. Along with constant interaction with my team, I make sure I have completed all necessary communication for the week via email and through Project tacking tool."
good,"This company has many great benefits. I enjoyed working for Verizon. Unfortunately, their IT department is under constant reductions due to budgeting and automation."
good,"Verizon is an overall good company for which to work."
good,Verizon offers great benefits and decently competitive pay for what you do over the phones. However expect that you will learn a majority of your job while on the phone with a customer. So be prepared to learn good multitasking and stalling skills while you convince people you are an expert the first time you are doing something.
good,learning opportunity-latest and greatest appliances to work on. the staff is always on hand to answer questions and peer review work before submission .
good,"I was at Verizon communications for 5 years and enjoyed the connections I have made."
good,i have work the company for 9 years and it is a ongoing learning experience. The culture is great. The work environment is great. The people are great. The management team needs help in developing their people skills.

good,"great place to work overall, had many employee benefits and the company made you feel like you were family. loved who i worked with and the environment"
good,Great place to work! Good benefits and good people. It was tough to come up in the company but overall great experience but need to keep my options open due to the closing of the center.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon has provided me with a solid foundation for my career. I started with the contact center in Rochester NY, then relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina because my center was closing. I appreciate the relocation benefits that were provided. However advancement is easy up to a certain point, after that it becomes more rare. At that point it is easy to get burned out."
good,"Verizon gave me the tools to advance else where in my career. They offer excellent employee benefits but, very little job security. On strike every 2-3 years."
good,"If your not a phone/sales person this job is not for you. Calls are listened to weekly and scored. Love working the group of people, they become your family."
good,"Great place to work! Great peopleProvide professional and courteous customer service on a daily basis"
good,"Great place work, Co-workers were like friends, Benefits, Salary, Flextime Kids, Vacation time were great. Quota was high at times, Mangement all over the place."
good,"Worked for company for thirty years various jobs started s operator, then was general clerk and my final job was repair technician until i retired in 1980."
good,It was a fun experience. Most of the supervisors and workers had positive attitudes. They made sure the employees always had adequate training for each task that was asked.
good,"Left because I relocated, wish I could have continued to work there. Worked in different schedules and they have a employee friendly facility. Always a good place to go."
good,"I learned a lot and was challenged in a competitive environment. Good overall experience. I did not view it as a career, but it built my skills for future sales jobs."
good,"Verizon is a call center. You have to have some great time managment. "
good,"Good Place to work with Verizon"
good,"Loved working there, but can be stressful. I really missed my friends there, but working at a call center was not for me. They treat the employees well."
good,"Management"
good,A typical work day consists of taking calls and assisting customers with any needs.  At times it can be stressful but they management make it fun for us.
good,I didn't work for Verizon direct. Only through cellular sales which were a premium retailer and was not good at all. I wouldn't work in this industry again.
good,I worked in the IT group of the Tax and Finance organization. This group has a strong commitment to succeeding it its mission through dedication and teamwork.
good,"It was enjoyable to work for this company when I did.  Had a chance to meet some great people I worked with and enjoyable customers that come into the store.  Hardest part of this job at the time was trying to get people to buy in on the text messaging packages.  At the time no one really thought to do that.  funny to look back now on this stuff and see how much more common it is to use cells phones for texting, emails, internet, and everything else we do today on a daily basis.  Who would have thought!"
good,"Great place to work, great culture and work environment. management was extremely helpful in accomplishng my goals. a lot of products to sell. Management as always nees work but overall great company to work with."
good,"The company is growing and changing,  During my years of service I held several positions and developed professionally to the fullest of my potential."
good,"The money and benefits are great , but they own you absolutely no life/work balance . work weekends nights forced OT  holidays. Every 3/4 years contract negotiations are very stressful make for hostile work environment.Plus strikes are not fun"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,You never knew who you were going to talk to.  The job was predictable but the management was good and keeping us on track.  Hardest part of the job was being able to really get to know the customers.  I would take at least 50 to 100 calls a day and not speak to the same customer again unless I was following up for something for them.  The best part was helping people with what ever they needed from their cell phones.
good,"Verizon was a very fun place to work, very flexible with an employee friendly environment. I was able to learn my job duties and train other's that came along after me because I built that trust amongst my peers."
good,Verizon wireless was a great place to work and if the location I worked did not close down I wold be there still. It was a relaxed environment where management tried hard to make your job easier.
good,"The co-workers you meet their are great! They are like family. Also, the events they have during holidays and special days are really cool. It really brings out a positive atmosphere."
good,"Verizon stays at the top of the technology game, so being an employee means staying at the top as well. Management team is great at coming along side to help develop skill sets and grow team members toward organizational and personal goals."
good,I learned a ton working here. I went to trainings and always felt part of a great group of people. I still often think about this job and would love to get back into technology.
good,"I really enjoyed the job but the commute was too long. I had a week of training on sales and customer relationships, I had a week training on how to train employees and time management."
good,"A typical work day would consist of taking calls and although tedious, I gained a vast amount of patience. I also learned how to properly discuss situations with customers regardless of their stress level."
good,Honestly- I don't remember it was YEARS ago. I just remember working the 11pm to 7am shift . It was hard at first to adjust to. my son was little and it was hard to get home intime to get home to school
good,An awsome company to work for but work life balance isn't great at all. You are always at the mercy of answering management calls. I would get calls at 10 at night about daily numbers that could wait till the next morning.
good,"This company provided directory assistance for another carrier. Work was easy, only minimal computer skills needed. Friendly environment. No benefits at all"
good,The company afforded me to complete by educational goals.  I was able to complete my Bachelors of Science in Business Management and my Masters in Business Management.
good,customer service and sales based position where solutions are provided for a large customer base. opportunity for growth and learning. can be high traffic at times with constant learning of new products and services
good,A typical day at work involved meeting with programmers and end users. The hardest part was getting the end users to realize they couldn't get everything they wanted immediately.
good,"Many daily phone calls and tech issues to support, great staff and organization to work for. Benefits were excellent for this company, workings hours were decided open your rotating shift."
good,I was with Verizon for about 18 years!  I started with NY Telephone in 1990.  I was hired as a Customer Service Representative.  I got promoted into management and then a year later got promoted again!
good,"I think Verizon is pretty good. customer service tech support cell phones upselling laptops, computers, batteries, phone covers, they are really nice I recommend."
good,"Very good benifits"
good,Sorry I do not feel like writing a review. This should not be something i am forced to do. I should be able to skip this if i so choose. Not everyone likes doing things like this.
good,"the work culture very dynamic, we were alsmost working in 4th to 5th gear. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"Liked working there, great enviroment and great people to work with."
good,Good place to work with plenty of opportunities for advancement. Constant coaching and development. The telecommunications industry is very competitive which means constantly trying to retain customers.

good,Excellent company to work for. The benefits were excellent and the job culture made it a pleasure to work there. The hours were flexible and there was much opportunity for advancement.
good,plenty of room to grow your career. career orientated company that provides lots of classroom and online training. good pay and benefits. schedule tenure and performance based.
good,"The culture in most stores is second to none, but as much as a love my work family, I would like to see my real family a little more. One usually work one or two shifts, 9-630 or 11-830. Upper management is really political and you'll have to play the game with the in-crowd in order to get promoted."
good,Started out as a temp. Proved myself and got hired on as an employee. Things were going great and then the lay-offs started. I managed to survive the first few rounds but my position was eventually eliminated.

good,I liked working there. They pay very well and have a great enviroment for their employees. I would recommend to anyone who is wanting to go into Retail Sales.
good,"Company is sales driven with opportunity to make addition money via commissions.  Management can be either very encouraging when you are selling  or sometimes be demanding when you have not sold enough due to the managers standards or they feel you have not done enough even though you would have them involved.  Have chances to move into management, but not many other sectors of Verizon Wireless at the beginning."
good,"Enjoyed working at Verizon, promoted twice and was able to take advantage of good benefits which included a 6 percent 401k match and tuition reimbursement"
good,Awesome benefits.  Would retire from my position if it was not relocating to another state.
good,"Working was steady and I had good coworkers. We worked at a big hospital in Brooklyn and also covered small clinics in different areas."
good,"I worked in sales. If you thrive at sales, Verizon is a great fit. Management wants you to succeed, compensation is generous, and the benefits are awesome."
good,"this job has great benefits, great pay.. this is shift work so it is great for someone that does not need to follow a set schedule. it is a fairly normal shift work type job. Environment is good on certain teams.  Some supervisors are better than others. Overall a good place to work at. And again, great  pay!"
good,Enjoy proving excellent customer service experience. Also enjoyed fun day. Management was great providing update on new products and excellent communication with employee's
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Learned a lot from the management and my colleague. All the training and mentoring was great.  Working with tenured and experienced engineers will encourage you to learn more and work hard.
good,"Great job for entry-level people looking to add a splash of professionalism on their resume. Decent pay, during training is $9 an hour, then progresses based on your skill level."
good,Pay and benefits are wonderful. The discounts on all the products that Verizon offers as well as the many discounts that you get from other companies because you work for Verizon are amazing. Verizon has been closing a lot of stores and call centers creating concern about job security.
good,Enjoyed it while I was there. They are big advocates for domestic violence which I am proud of. They are big on family and well being. I think all of my supervisors and co workers cared but it was too stressful for me
good,"Liked the benefits. 401K match was competitive.Health care was better than another company."
good,Overall this was a great place to work especially if you are just starting out in IT.  You can get a lot of training and are exposed to a wide array of systems and processes
good,Very good company to work for. Pay is good if you put in the time and work. The workplace culture is diverse and family orientated all in one. No micro managing is also a plus.
good,I love the people at Verizon - the culture is good and everyone works together as one unified team. The management and tolls to get your job done are up to speed and always keep up with technology.
good,"Verizon pays very well compared to other industries and companies in the wireless business as well. Management is generally very supportive of development and coaching to improve sales skills. Great place to launch a career in sales or customer service even if you don't plan to stay in wireless. Company is constantly changing so you must be able to adapt but this is a great skill to hone. Biggest downfall is working retail hours. One weekend off a month, scheduled varied between opening and closing shifts."
good,"This is a numbers based business. You need to always keep this in mind when looking for employment here. There are great opportunities, however your daily and yearly numbers can be very stressful."
good,"I love working at Verizon, but the commission/quota structure is rigorous and hard to achieve if you are not a super aggressive sales person. Management and peers are awesome to work with and definitely try and help you to succeed. Definitely a work environment for those looking for aggressive sales and are highly competitive."
good,Nice place to work.  Enjoyed co-workers.  Must multi-task.  Received customer service requests by phone and email.  Left this job because former employer called and wanted  me to come back.  Offered pay increase.  Was unsure about future at Verizon due to contract renewal pending.
good,"I worked for 27 years in a number of different positions within MCI/Worldcom/Verizon. The last 10 years I traveled a lot which became a burden on my family life. That is why I took a job with Atos. I managed 20+ facility engineers across 6 states. We took care of Data Centers and Central Offices Infrastructure i.e. HVAC, Generators, Fire Systems, UPS's and facility maintenance/construction. Management was good to work with and permitted us to provide input for all aspects of the Facility Infrastructure. Leaving the job was probably the hardest part, the best part was my team of engineers"
good,I have learned lots from my time here. I was in a client facing role most of the time and provided award winning customer service and solutions. I also helped with the back end logistics with the company
good,Il y a beaucoup de pression pour les objectifs a atteindre
good,You choose the shows you can work. They always have several each month and you can show up to them after your day-time job. Most of the time you have to show up by 5:00pm and stay until 11:30pm. You are on your feet all night and get one 15 minute break. Depending on the concert depends on the type of customers. The employers are very nice and most of the employees are good to work with too.
good,Overall working at Verizon was ok. It had its perks for working their. You would get a yearly bonus and they also compensated you with great pay. I did not like the schedules changing constantly.
good,Not a bad place to start your career. They provide excellent training and they encourage collaboration. It is a sales job so you are expected to sell.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. Make sure you constantly work on career advancement otherwise it is easy to get complacent and lose ambition. The pay is above any other place.
good,worked for teletech handling complaints for verizon long distance.  I would receive tickets and troubleshoot issues to correctly diagnose the problem and fix or submit the issue to the appropriate department.
good,Good company to work . Nice team to work with. Nice work culture. Co-operative team. Can have work-life balance. Good learning path in Mainframes technologies.

good,Verizon is a great place to work for. they have an awesome workplace culture and the hardest part of the job is handling difficult customers. Everyone is great
good,Verizon was effective in giving training and providing advancement opportunities. I would recommend someone to work there. A family person or a single person would enjoy this job.
good,Verizon was a great company to work for. The benefits and pay were competitive. There was always new trainings not just for the current job info but life trainings as well.
good,"The benefits at Verizon are great, but they are always changing things so job security isn't always there. It is a very competitive work environment and everyone is extremely driven."
good,"Verizon Wireless was an Hourly Pay plus Commission type of Position. The wireless sales consultant role was a hands on, sales and service position that consisted of customer facing consultative sales approach to uncover the hidden opportunity in each transaction."
good,"It was great in the beginning, but as the industry got saturated, the pressure to sale went up, and the compensation was lowered. Gained a lot of knowledge about the wireless industry. Often rewarded with free lunches and cash rewards."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon.  It was a union job, which has it's own pros and cons, but overall, the pay was great and the job was relatively easy.  There is room for growth, however, most roles are awarded based on seniority and not skill."
good,"Management is amazing the days can be stressful, but the pay is great. Customers are easy to get along with and also can make your day awesome. The one thing I enjoy about Verizon is the yearly bonuses."
good,Very exciting.  No two days were the same.  Employees were like family.  We always worked together  to reach the same common goal which was excellent customer resolution.
good,I performed consultant duties but this is not my current position. I have been with GEICO for 11 years so my work experience with Verizon is vague and distant.
good,Didn't like being on the phone. This was my first call center job. Learned a lot. The pay was great and I learned a lot. Pretty stressful but again great pay.
good,"From the very beginning, my training with Verizon was very extensive & fantastic for a solid start in sales. From presentation, word choice, attitude down to product knowledge, Verizon's training is the best I have experienced. "
good,"Great place to work.   The only reason I'm not still there is that they consolidated locations so they moved many of the finance jobs to Tulsa, OK."
good,"Great benefits and great salary. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,It is a okay place the work. I just think they should pay most money. Some of the management is not the best.  The project manager is pretty nice.......
good,Good place to work. Great benefits and good time off. It was a pleasure to help people that needed help. I would advise anyone looking for a job in the retail industry to go work for Verizon.
good,HHGregg was the company I worked for that had a Verizon inside the store. Verizon was fun but HHGregg itself was lackluster and closed down. Location was a poor choice for that store.
good,"Position consisted of answering customer service calls, routing customers' issues to the repair bureau, problem solving. The workplace culture is one of being a member of a team."
good,"Too many lay offs. Long hours to meet goals. High quotas, not enough sales incentives to win deals. Highest price solution 100% of the time. New technology deployments are delay unnecessarily."
good,I was always learning new systems for Verizon. But my supervisor was always there to help and teach me the right way. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers when it was put fault. But I loved helping customers at the end of the day.
good,Fast paced with a lot of up sides to the positions. When you are hard worker you can advance far in the company. Spent many years within the walls of verizon and went through many changes in metrics and overall business change.
good,I had an opportunity to work in several rotational positions and gained a lot of varied experiences. Many opportunities were granted for increased responsibilities and annual bonuses based on performance was a great incentive to always give 110% effort.
good,get to help out customers and other technicians. management can be better especially that they have no knowledge of what is necessary to complete a job.
good,"Great place to work as far as the culture, work/life balance is not a priority. The hardest part of is getting an interview. The best part of the job is having all of the tools and resources and support you need to be successful, the rest is up to you."
good,"Great pay and opportunities to move around and learn new skills.  Management lacks proper skill set.  The culture is focused too much on reporting to upper management, resulting in slow decision making and execution."
good,"Verizon was very fast paced and competitive. You would take care of 30 to 50 customers a day ranging from bill pays, troubleshooting to sales. The management was pretty supportive and the pay was really good."
good,"Great company to work, great benefits and good management travel is required because of sales location Manager is very good in managing and very flexible and considerate most of all very trust worthy"
good,Verizon is a very good company to work for.  The benefits package is very competitive.  The employee portal is the best I have ever seen.  They do a very good job at communicating their goal and vision for the company.
good,A very fast paced but competitive environment where you can learn and make good earning depending on efforts. Management is good and hardest part is its very fast paced but best part is you get well compensated for your efforts and hard work.
good,place to work. There was always new promotions and management was always helpful. They gave the best training so we could help answer any questions customers had.
good,"Working at Verizon there are a few challenges to overcome.  Quota, maintenance of customer experience and upkeep of the store.  It is a good environment to work in.  The people I work with are good.  Management is far as well.  Everything is based on numbers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great talent and great leadership.
good,"Honestly, my experience there was 15 years ago. My experiences then versus to what the culture may be like now might not justify their current inclusion practices."
good,My typical day would be to plan out my days visits and send my reports to corporate. I would then go into the field and visit at least 4 to 5 locations in a day to provide supervision and conduct observations. I made the culture a fun and exciting environment with contests and leading by example. The hardest part of the job was training new representatives. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people throughout the day.
good,Bell Atlantic Mobile is now Verizon.  It was a pretty dynamic atmosphere as we were a large national company with lots of opportunity.  I was recruited out of Verizon by Conectiv.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for when it comes to the pay and benefits. It is really hard to manage a work life balance because your schedule does change every 6 months. You can go from getting out at 4:00pm to getting out at 12am.
good,This was a fun internship one of the best ones I've ever participated in. The people were fun to work with and easy to get along with. I really enjoyed the work and the projects that I completed.
good,I enjoyed my years at Verizon and made many a good friend.  Customer service was the most important and enjoyable skill that I learned in my 36 plus years.
good,We worked together and was a big family. Yearly bonus was great. Phone discounts were a plus. Great opportunities for advancements. You were always busy.
good,Productivity assessments based on unfair metrics with too much focus on customer opinion even if not applicable to the given situation!...............
good,I learned a lot about the communication industry while working at Verizon.  Management was mostly very supportive of the employees.  The fact that I was in the union helped in continued raises and time off.
good,"Great place to work, very well organized. I was well trained for the position. I have hopes to be rehired. I quit to start a family in 2003. I was empowered to train new employees."
good,the job is incredibly challenging but you are able to learn a lot from the position that you can use in your every day life. it is a management training program so pay is all performance based
good,"I have no comment for this section. Working at Verizon was fine. I thought the support was good, pricing fair and work conditions very adequate. The only issue I had was that were constantly re0assigning accounts. Not good for the sales people or the customers"
good,productive family friendly coworkers flexible work schedule. great moral. Different  jobs in call center and each person is trained on all jobs.   lots of overtime available in each department.
good,"Very fast pace, competitive, self manage work environment.  The corporate culture allows for great exposure to a diverse segment of the marketplace and resource sharing that provides for significant personal and professional growth."
good,"Although the customer service dept. closed down for the region it was a good place to work. I can be stressful at times otherwise the flow of work was fast. It did require alot of knowledge of the company's cell phones, policy etc as you had to troubleshoot phones, provide billing info etc."
good,I tracked down customer related problems and Assisted customers with inquiries while providing excellent customer service. Management was awesome to it's staff
good,"Had good experiences with the company, management, and coworkers in general, but the job itself (call center customer service) is mentally and emotionally taxing. Be prepared to experience emotional dissonance daily."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Work culture is friendly. Team and teammates are very supportive. Work environment is very much productive. Like working with verizon again if Got an oppurtunity.
good,There is always something more to do. You will work for the premium price you are paid. Management is always keeping your teams fluid and increasingly busy.
good,"Verizon Data Services India is a excellent workplace for technology enthusiasts, who would want advancement in their careers, and also a good work life balance."
good,this was fast paced sales. you have to be technical savy and keep up with all the trends. You must interfaace with the public and be on your feet most of the day. you must be willing to fill in when short staffed on the sales floor

good,"Cool place to work, learn and experiment new technologies."

good,The design process and steady pace is very satisfying and involved. To learn to do the job takes years and formal training. And the reward was worth the stress.
good,"most happyfriedly culture Job. Friendly Nature. it is a mix feeling to work in Verizon,Verizon Communications, otherwise known as Verizon, is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company is based at 1095."

good,"Benefits, Health Care, Overtime, Flexibility, Tuition Reimbursement, 401K, Buyout Plan, Paid Lunch, Weekends & Holidays, On The Job Training, Uniform Budget"
good,"I worked for SVP & CFO.  This role was extremely high fast paced environment.   Working for any senior officers in Verizon requires learning to juggle multiple tasks. Our main priority is to make sure scheduling any appointments, meeting or travel is done in an proficient manner.  "
good,"Met incoming customers and provided immediate assistance."
good,"It was fun coming to work most days. I think starting in the summer time and being able to experience warm weather helped. When it got cold, the work place changed slightly and it wasn't all pleasant to come in"
good,Verizon would be the perfect job for young energetic person. Alot of hard work but you are trained very well and given the tools and information you will need to perform the job.
good,Overall a good place to work & great company to work for.  Every job has it's ups and down sides.  Unfortunately I am not a fan of shift work (which this position was and included weekends). Pay was not what I expected and I did not stay in there long.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,It was a great company to work a lot of good benefits of working with like minded people who set goals together and get things done within a timely manner which is great.
good,"A typical day I don't do many sales. If I get any customers, its for bill pays and questions. I did learn a lot about how to go about making sales, and how to talk to people better. The management changed a couple times, but all are very nice people. The hardesr part of the job was getting sales for helping my comission, but the most enjoyable part was the people that I met along my journey of selling."
good,Verizon is a good company to work for as any job you are expected to meet different requirements.  It can be stressful like any job but the environment is good and for the most part people have a good work ethic.

good,"A typical day included landing new businesses and managing accounts of those business already acquired. This included but was not limited to, bill payments, adding new accounts, and purchasing products and services."
good,Enjoyed working here. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and being engaged in there personal  process with putting together there packages for their homes.
good,"Verizon is demanding, but it pays well. You don’t get a 6 figure job without knowing your stuff and doing your job well. A lot of room for advancement, as long as you are willing to relocate, or you live in an urban area. You receive base and commissions, and both are fair. Unfortunately the targets constantly change drastically, so it makes it hard to know what the next quarters will look like time after time."
good,"With a large organization such as Verizon you are bound to have plenty of growth opportunities. Internal opportunities are plenty and management supports inter team transfers. "
good,"Great company with great benefits.  Competitive environment, but yet challenging and opportunity for growth are available.  I enjoyed my tenure at Verizon."

good,"Had a great experience working with verizon.Good growth and commission based platform . "
good,Workload sometimes overwhelming due to downsizing and not enough employees to complete the tasks.  Stressful sometimes due to continuous RIFs(Reduction in Force)...
good,depending on your location the position is super easy an relaxed most of the customer you'll spend the majority of your time with will be the elder since its modern technology they are trying to get equip with
good,"I worked in the call center and took around 60 calls per day.  Answering questions regarding Verizon Wireless service and using their products.  Unfortunately, you feel like you are being bullied by customers in a call center environment."
good,verizon is a great work place and many many opportunity for advancement and plenty of challenges everyday always something new to learn many different culture there the hardest part of the job is getting there but the best part was something different everyday

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,"I had a great experience at Verizon."
good,"My time at Verizon was satisfying for the most part. I worked with a good group of people who all worked as a team. The unfortunate part of the job is having to endure yearly RIFs. That was stressful and sad having to see so many good people laid off, which, after 15 years included me."
good,"I liked working with the people, but we were frequently concerned with lay-offs.  I was able to be productive with the job, and the company was supportive of training.  I liked working with my management, and found them to be very supportive.  It was a good work environment which included flexible work hours."
good,Organization has processes in place to allow the daily work flow assist in creating an effective environment. There are many opportunities for an individual to advance their skill level.
good,I enjoyed my time there working with some incredible team members. A very large campus and the environment allows you to walk around and see the amazing landscape.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon, working in ""Global National Markets"", supporting Verizon's Enterprise market customers. It gave me the opportunity to gain additional experience in Telecommunications."
good,"What I learned at Verizon was that you must stay 2 steps ahead of the competition, in order to have great success. You can't just live for today, plan for tomorrow. Other than the occasional manager who wasnt really prepared to handle 20-25 people, you got a company that provided a lot of tools for its people. The benefits are less now than when I worked but they are good. A lot of companies are trying to follow the path of success that Verizon has shown."
good,Comprehensive product portfolio and sales support structure employed to achieve success.  Large organization within which navigation skills were necessary to leverage.
good,if you have the right sales team its a great job. If management promotes good leadership its a nice starting sales position. Must know tech and programs if you expect to perform normal duties
good,"At Verizon, you are free to think and explore opportunities.Conventional ways do not matter when it comes to achieving positive business results. Clear thinking is motivated while vague ideas live and die on their merits."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. It is a very fast paced sales environment. The pay and people are great. I would return in a heart beat. It IS a union environment so newly hired associates would be assigned work schedules and vacations based on seniority.
good,"It was a challenging job,  With great pay and benefits. It was high paced and at times stressful. I enjoyed the exchange  with the customers, and the satisfaction of taking care of the support issues."
good,"Verizon acquired my company but shorty after decided to close my office. They offered to relocate us if our position was available in a different state. Though being let go was inconvenient, Verizon went about it in a very good way, paying us till the end of the year (which was 2 months), plus severance, plus assistance with finding a new job."
good,Great place to work! Would recommend to friends and family.  Cafeteria needs work.  High altitude can create some sleep issues as well as take time to acclimatize to.
good,Best place to update your skill and understand the business requirements  . Management understand the skills the resource posses  though it takes time . They boast you with responsibilities and confidence once you get along  . Challenging  and it  is always in the  push now or never atmosphere .
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It was great. Lots of stress and fast pace business. Lots of follow ups and selling. Tons of responsibility!"
good,"A typical day at work included helping people find the right solution to their technical needs, helping them understand how to use their devices, and/or helping someone with technical issues (troubleshooting)."
good,"They promote peer to peer learning which is great for getting experience from the veteran workers. They are very goal oriented, motivating for excellence."
good,Work as a technician so work does sometimes becomes just about the same everyday.Overall a very relaxed environment as long as you do your job and stay off the negative reports you will be fine

good,The culture and management are phenomenal. Every day is a challenge and it is exciting. There is definitely room for advancement. Verizon is overall one of the best jobs I've had.
good,Good And Ambience corporate culture to work and also competitive place to work. The Manager and the team are very kind and helpful to me and that helped me to learn a lot from them.
good,"Verizon is not for the faint at heart, but if you can deal with stressful situations, then you can excel. Customers complain a lot, but Verizon tries to balance that with the pay and perks they offer."
good,I enjoyed all of my co workers and the job duties required at Verizon wireless. They have great benefits and my location had wonderful people.........
good,"For a place that can be extremely challenging, it it nice to know that co-workers have each others backs. Those who have been there for a while are willing to assist those who are new, managers and supervisors are easy to get in-touch with"
good,"Learned a lot from seniors, management was good , friendly work environment, achieving goals, support from management and seniors. overall its a good experience."
good,"This job is great for young professionals who want to start their career, but once you want a family, the work life balance ratio is not that great. Great benefits, love the union but workplace culture/staff morale needs improvement and the company is only as great as their weakest link (we provided a service that is not available in our own city). This job can be very stressful. You have to know yourself and your limits."
good,"good place to work, can be unorganized at times. learned a lot about the phone service industry and dealing with unsatisfied customers. also learned a lot about fiber optics"
good,"As far as a company to work for Verizon was good. Salary and benefits are very good. We were on 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Usually one of us were assigned night duty for a week. There were times that nothing bad happened and times we were up for 24 hours. We could avail ourselves of each others expertise as well Vendor support. Time off was not a problem."
good,Working at Verizon always provided a new insight on products or helping a customer with their cellular needs. Made for a short work day buy growing customer business was a challenge due to market ups and downs with the economy.
good,Working a Verizon retail store was as good as retail could be. There is always a part of working in retail that makes you want to be out. Verizon was good to their employees.
good,"Verizon is great place to work."
good,"If you work here a long time (several years) you can potentially earn lots of money."
good,"Verizon is a great company with great benefits.  Verizon recognizes hard work and will reciprocate with education and career growth.  With dedication and the right mindset, you can learn to navigate the corporate world and become a great leader."
good,"Benefits and compensation were good. Commission and advancement rely mostly on sales skills. A very fast work place, not for the timid.  Customer service skills and patience is required."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon Wireless. I worked for the company two different times, once in customer service and once in financial services. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat, and I would go back."
good,great place to work. good benefits and good pay. good cafeteria and pool tables to relax. calls were good and people were nice. training was good. overall good experience
good,I was overly performing with no higher job title. Everyone around me was good friends. I learned all about cell phone assistance and how to fix and troubleshoot phones. The hardest part of the job was how competitive it was with AT&T and the changes in sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of community.
good,"Met interesting people every day, allowed people access to technology they weren't aware was available to them. Gave a good sense that you are making people's lives better, be it by selling them exciting devices or fixing problems they are having."
good,It was really exciting to know that there was a possibility of winning prizes.  The employees there were very helpful and really encouraged others to do their best.
good,"A typical day starts with motivating the employees and help them to plan their day so that they can be successful.  I learned that with team work, anything can be achieved.  A very fun and fast paced environment to be a part of."
good,"Great company to work for. Management ensures that the staff is properly supported and taken care. Able to advance quickly, but there are a limited amount of roles to advance to once you reach a certain level. Salary & Benefits packages are competitive."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, but can get stressful as a Solutions Specialist (sales rep). Sales has changed a lot over the years. The quota gets higher and higher just to exceed a minimum of 1,350.00. They laid-off two departments nation wide in the last two years to cut cost and pushing those departments into sales."
good,"Customer Service is a stressful job, but they allow options for you. You don't get ""sick leave,"" but you do get 52 hours personal time and 40 hours UIA (unscheduled leave) along with your vacation time. Advancement is encouraged, they pay for college and have a fun environment. Like any job you have the negative, but the positives outweigh them."
good,It's been a while since I've been with them. Great company to excel. Great for high school grads going to school and college grads not yet established in the field the went to school for.
good,"I have enjoyed my 18 years at Verizon.As with any job there were stressed moments for the most part my office was a well balanced work environment. Verizon offered good health benefits, vacation and salary."
good,Fast paced during Financial Close. Slows down during the prep phase. Culture changing to keep up with smaller companies. Time required to create Close packages....Interaction with internal clients
good,"I would get into work, sign in, then get to helping customers on rate plans, phones, additional services that may save them money from home phone to tv. This job taught me patience as I was dealing with many customers during the boom of the smartphone. Management was good, everybody had their roles, and those roles could interchange. Hardest part of the job was trying to sell people coming in for phones on Dish Network. Most enjoyable part of the job was teaching customers how to use the technology at hand. Culture and teamwork was good."
good,"Corporate, metrics driven environment. Fast paced, goal oriented. Excellent training programs. Opportunity for growth based on skill set. Customer call center."
good,"The culture is to go ahead over the limit find the success and achieve the goal is what it matters,, The office was full of good friends and supportive partners all on the same boat.."
good,every mornig you have a team meeting going over the goals for the day. sexting up phones and other sale items before store opens. once opened taking customers through your shift finding what devices and plans fit their needs the best

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This was a good job while it lasted. The location was very nice to live at. The company had good insruance and the pay was great, but the managenemt was bad."
good,Worked at Verizon for 7 years. I started as a Customer Service Representative and quickly got promoted to Retail Sales Representative. Afterwards got promoted as a Solutions Manager and managed multiple retail locations across the Bay Area. Very fun yet stressful at the same time. Overall quite happy and learned a lot on how to run a business during my time with Verizon.
good,"A typical day consisted of making sure the store was ready to be opened, receiving in inventory and putting it away, sending back used product and any other task the manager needed to be done."
good,"Set up events go from taking trash out torlay event floor for basket ball ,set up for hockey games ,showsdirect custermers to sitting,picking up chairs and benches running up and down stairs to set up bleaches,forpeople to sat on"
good,No longer a growth company on wireless side.  Can be unnerving waiting to hear when the next reorganization or restructuring will happen.  Good people to work with.
good,"Was a good job, until they closed down the call center I worked at.  Verizon has a good credo and culture, and believes in the credo ""change energizes us."""
good,Sales mentality needed. Multiple shifts. Sales objectives that are changing monthly. Work atmospheres at the stores are different  based on the location and management. As with every retail good and bad customers. Some days are easy and fun and some days are hard.
good,"Easy to manage job with good training upon being hired. If you are able to work with customers who are trying, can manage your stress level and stay focused....you will do just fine."
good,I think the reason I am a great with phones is because I treat every phone like it is my own. Not every phone is frivolous and purchased by someone with tons of money.
good,"At Verizon, you can do your job at your own pace, if that is important to you. My position is very flexible in terms of hours of work as I work out-of-office. There were plenty of vacancies and promotional opportunities."
good,"N/A - My review of Verizon is irrelevant. It's a great place to work, they compensate well and the people are fantastic. After 12 years of employment, I'm looking to add value to different opportunities."

good,Alltel is a great company to work for.  Alltel is a small cell service company with a very forward mindset allowing it to compete with the best of the industry and lead while setting trends in the market.
good,Verizon is a fun workplace. I came from another company telecommunication company I have learned a lot about the two groups. I enjoy the company staff
good,The job was ok and I appreciated getting it after being unemployed. I lasted as long as I could but I was getting stressed out from the demands of the call center and the nature of the job which has a high customer service demand.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon was one of the best company companies I have ever worked for in regards to my peers, benefits, and wage. Also the most stressful environment I have ever been in. If you can set aside the escalations, managers not listening to you and being under a microscope then this is the best job for you. You get to play counselor, troubleshoot, collect payments, deescalate, credits are given, sell technology etc."
good,I've learned how to cope with customers in a very difficult situation. Learning a call center job was difficult but manageable. Some of the supervisor could of needed more improvement to help us learn the job. I enjoyed going to work for some of my co-workers.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company but it is super competitive which is great. It motivates you to do your best and you get rewarded for it!! I also enjoyed my co workers too.
good,The company makes sure that you go through all the training you need. For the most part  your co -workers are friendly but it is a very competetive environment.
good,The speed of technology sales is what keeps Verizon an great place to work.  They provide their staff with up to date training to ensure you have all the info needed to excel.
good,Retail is perfect for tech gurus to make minimum 50k including commission. Benefits and stock option are great. Extremely political and competitive to get promoted out of retail into corporate. Utilize tuition program.

good,"Busy atmosphere where you are busy as well as you learn a lot."
good,I enjoyed my employment at verizon wireless. It was filled with great people and personalities.Team work and team building was highly promoted throughout the building. It was fast paced.
good,this is a very good experience to build your skills as a sale rep and to get experience as a tame member of a large group to push to became the best you can be
good,"The work day was fine, high stress sales and customer service but manageable."
good,"Great company to work for. Benefits are top notch. The battle between the union and the company became insensitive and dragged out too long at times. Working here teaches you about your limits in life, and pulls out what you're capable of achieving. The company offers many ways to educate yourself to grow. Work schedule may not afford you the time to take advantage of it."
good,"Always on the top of technologies, very competative management,good worklifebalance, good work ethics,good communication in teams,work culture is good."

good,"As a Software Test Engineer, I held many positions and had many good managers.  The compensation package was excellent.  The environment was supportive."
good,Verizon delivers a strong catalog of professional and managed security capabilities globally across public and private organizations.  Highly skilled professionals dedicated to supporting customers.
good,"At the beginning of each day you are given your work load of the day.  Normally from the very beginning you are overloaded simply because there was more work than there was technicians to complete said work.  You are given hardly any time at all to grab all the gear you will need to complete your work load.  All the while crossing your fingers that what you actually need for the day is in the warehouse.  You must throughout the day account for every minute.  You are to call all your customers before you leave to let each customer know what time you will be arriving, totally not knowing what your going to encounter at each site.  Also taking into consideration that you must take a mandatory lunch break (hahaha).  Making sure you finish without going into overtime unless its approved."
good,was a pleasure working @ Verizon was laid off because of compamy cut back  invertory blance cash open closed store and take care of customer needs includeing work shops
good,"Verizon Labs in San Jose is definitely a fun place to work with. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon.  Sometimes, I wish I had stayed, but I was employed there at a time in which my spouse was finishing school and I needed to take a different job with hours more suited to being home for my young children.  Cant go wrong with this company.  I recommend them anyday."

good,Any day was a learning day for improvement or advancement. The staff were very collaborative and the leadership were very goal-oriented and supportive.
good,"able to interact socially with people in which I love to do but as a finance professional its a typical sales job. Someone with my experience could use a bigger challenge in my career. Its great for a recent college grad , or a young person, I'm in my mid 40s and this is not my idea of an ideal job for me."
good,Verizon offered in depth training on systems and new procedures.  They management that I worked with were very flexible allowing employees to balance work and personal / family life.
good,Verizon an excellent company to work for. If it wasn't because they were downsizing I would have continue my career there. Relocating was not an option for me but it is an excellent company to work for.
good,"The job is ever changing which keeps you on your toes. The time off, pay, and benefits are good for the role. Most reps make 50 to 80 a year with the biggest challenge being the wide variety in customer knowledge  and ability. Your capability to adjust your approach to meet their needs will determine your success."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy.  I must use my analytical, decision make, finance and MicroSoft Office skills daily.  Our management team communicates with the teams on a regular basis and keeps us abreast of the direction of the company objectives.  The hardest part of my auditing job is deciding to remove compensation from an Account Executive.  However it is removed only because the audit found the product was not compensable or not all audit points were met."
good,"Work day flew by surrounded by like minded people.The customers were usually easy to talk to with minimal issues with their device. Showing them the ins and outs of what they purchased at initial point of sale made their future ""how to"" stops fewer."
good,"Verizon is a great opportunity.  A very competitive company to work for. Working with customers always was my motivation to always do my best. There were good days & there were bad days, but overall I loved my job at Verizon."
good,"The hardest part of the job was arriving to work on time.  Some of the"
good,There was a huge layoff at the company and due to my seniority I was included in the layoff. I worked a lot of hours for extra money. Customer satisfaction was number one.
good,"Managing Government Accounts ensuring they received the best bang for their buck so to speak. I learned about Agencies budget's, compliance, contracts and individual state requirements. Working for Verizon you have to have the ability to work well under pressure. If you do not do well in a fast paced environment and not able to think quickly on your feet, it may not be the job for you. However, the company did their best to give you a good work/ personal life balance. The company rewarded you for your commitment."
good,"You will definitely be paid fairly, but there is always gonna be something wrong with the work you do. No  mater how many times you fix their complaint, they will find another. If you can ignore the criticism, youll be fine"
good,"Enjoyed working at VZW. Great company. Learned many customer service skills in the call center, in which I really enjoy working in the type of environment."
good,Only worked temporarily but was fun met a lot of people and was very interesting can stress you out a little bit but was a fun job over all would like to try it again one day in the future.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Worked for a number of months in one of the call centers. The culture was honestly excellent. I have never worked around so many friendly and happy people. They worked with you through different circumstances if you had them. Very team oriented. I left because I was sick - and also just not cut out for a call center environment working in that particular position. Days could be long but I broke it down from break time to break time which made it bearable.
good,"Werkte samen met collega's in binnen en buitenland (audiomeetings, videoconferencing, chats). Vragen beantwoorden, fouten oplossen. service verbeteren. Uitleggen aan de klant waar het fout is gegaan. En er valt altijd wat te leren. Dat is het mooie van het customer service vak.  Het uiteindelijke doel van een klanten service is ervoor te zorgen dat de klanten blij zijn en graag bij je blijven.  Mijn direct leidinggevenden hebben mij altijd de nodige support gegeven.  Bedrijfscultuur in Amsterdam is goed. Het moellijkste voor mij: conference calls te regelen waarop alle gewenste collega's (Azie, Europa, USA)  aanwezig konden zijn. Het leukste van de baan: erg blij als een klacht van de klant permanent was opgelost."

good,the business is changing faster than you can learn it. wireless customers are some of the most obnoxious customers to please. they give flexibility for the time off which is good.
good,I loved this place but the cell phone business is saturated. No real room for growth.  They will lay you off in a heartbeat. What I will say is that they have great benefits and training.  They were flexible with their shifts. Growth is available if you are willing to travel.
good,"Quick paced work , long hours, fun, full of energy, Great people that train you for success,  You can move up very quickly and choose where you want to go."

good,"it a great company to work.. a chance to get promoted and a friendly environment. "
good,This was a great experience and I am proud to have worked there. I gained great experience with work force management and quality management. Only issue is they have unethical upper management
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I loved working at verizon wireless. I was actually there as an intern with my aunt. She taught me excellent service when dealing with customers phones or product.

good,"I worked in a Verizon retail store in a very busy, customer facing environment, where I split my time between managing the inventory and helping with customer sales and service."
good,Good place to work & grow with this company. I started around $13.50/hr and got up to $23/hour in 8 years. As long as you have patience & thick skin this job is for you. Customer service calls average expectation is 40 calls handled or higher. Tech Support expectation is around 24 average calls handled.

good,"Its a great place to work learn a grow with flexible paid time off. Meet great people and can grow in the company very fast. The hardest part of job is when system go down, that not often.

good,"I enjoyed working with my employees,  and teaching them on making decisions and handling difficult customers.  The hardest part of the job was getting my work done because of all the interruptions. I was on salary so I would. Work on weekends or extra hours during the day."
good,"Good company, but you need to stay on top of things.  Lots of broken promises.  For example, they announced a massive internal education campaign that would allow employees to schedule time to go to classes.  They had it all mapped out.  Power point presentations, the whole nine yards.  Then one day everyone stopped talking about it and it disappeared like it never existed.  This happened a lot."
good,"Verizon has a diverse, inclusive, tolerant culture that really tries to make the best of the resources they hire.  The most fun part is working for a recognized international brand name building products and services that any member of your family might use, including kids.  They encourage ""lifers"", so it is not unusual to meet staff who have been there 10+ years.  "
good,"As an inter, over the course of ten weeks, I was able to not only learn about and practice the agile method of project completion, but I was also tasked with projects that will add value to the company in a multitude of ways."

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This was a great job!  I loved working with the telephone bills, I was responsible for mailing out and repairing the ones that got destroyed in mailing machines."
good,"This is a great place to work, great benefits!    I enjoyed being a floor manager to make sure customers got helped in a timely fashion.  That made customers very happy."
good,"Good work environment, when not in the home office."
good,"Easy job. business customer service. can be stressful if you are not meeting your stats. You get 2 weeks vacation, 1 week personal,emergency time, flextime and more emergency time. Great tuition reimbursement - they actually paid for school upfront- you just pay for books and them you are compensated for you books. Management is ok. Culture is nice."
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company, great resources, strong products and good people.  I would have continued to stay with Verizon had our geographical part of the business not been sold."
good,"Great company to work for great benefits, retired from verizon in 2010 gave me a great retirement package,and incentives, in the beginning I did't think this job was for me, but by my 15th year, I was moving right along, doing my best and getting promotions"
good,"Telespectrum, was a very laid back company. The managers were okay, some what professional. the pay was good and the weekly incentives. overall it was an easy going place to work"
good,"Interaction with customers around the world, teamwork, I loved the interaction with my colleagues and customers. Fast paced position, challenging. I learned a new career in my 21 years at the company"
good,Daily face to face appointments that lead to a lot of opportunities. mAke sure you are updating your salesforce as this is very important day to day and weekly activities.
good,Verizon has a very productive environment and is a good place for people to build a career.  The time and effort is very rewarding and the benefits are very goof for those looking to build a career.
good,"Frequent reorganization of department impedes productivity.  Management is superb.  Friendly culture.  Talented team.  Newly acquired by IBM, which will change culture moving forward."
good,"The pay and benefits were very competitive from day 1. The call center can become stressful over time. There is always a changes in processes, stats, schedules and teams. You have to stay on top of stats. My only issue was the workplace politics you would see people being promoted because of who they knew and who recommended or liked them."
good,"I worked for MCI for several years before it was acquired by WorldCom and then briefly after the Verizon acquisition.   It was a fun place to work, I always felt valued and appreciated."
good,Work life / family life balance skewed in Company's favor.  24/7 availability expectations.  Little room for promotion or advancement.  Upper management out of touch with lower levels of employees.
good,A typical day include placing and answering calls. make sure the customers are satisfied and their needs are met. the place is fun the supervisors are really supportive
good,I cannot give a review of this company as I left it over 12 years ago so I do not know what the culture or company is like now. I just need to put in enough characters.
good,Typical workday for me is remote and I work 8-15 hours per day and some weekends.  My management team is excellent and the culture is fast paced and stressful.  I enjoy the people that I work with.
good,"Great company to work for.  Like any company it has a few quirks.  Show up on time or early, check email or educate yourself on products and promotions, get on the sales floor and make money!  The culture at the store location was great.  Management was very relaxed as long as you are doing what you're supposed to be doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships.  If you're not a people person, any role within Verizon is NOT for you."
good,"great benefits and money to live comfortably, can really grow within Verizon wieless if you enjoy call center environment. Very very growth oriented !!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon cared for it's customer and believed in it's FiOS product. They did everything they could to do what was best for the customer. They also made a comfortable work environment. The people were wonderful.
good,"Worked with direct communication with Human Resources Department. Hiring new employees, copying employee files and setting up training and accomodations for future employees. Worked directly with the Director of that particular district."
good,"Things can get highly stressful within the job depending on management. Was a high performer within my company, but the more comfortable you become with management the harder things become."
good,I would service customers on a management level. I was able to get into the management development program. I coached and development representatives as well
good,I can't really say much besides it is a retail sales driven company. Put out a number of boxes and you will make money. They have GREAT benefits and treat their people well. Work life balance is a little difficult but again it is retail sales.
good,"Verizon is an admired large company, performance oriented and technology competitive.  The work environment is appropriately equipped and well managed."
good,"Good work life balance, Nice growth opportunities, great benefits, Challenging work Easy access to leaderhip, allows creative and out of the box thinking"
good,"- Great compensation package"
good,"Great advancement opportunities"
good,"Verizon is a great place to work if you are looking to advance your career.  On a daily basis, you are interacting with many teams and you wear several hats in your role."
good,Good place to work with great benefits and the opportunity for advancement if you are willing to apply yourself and work hard.  The company is going through a great deal of change and should emerge as leaner org  with more opportunity after the transition.
good,"Being Store Manager was the most enjoyable part of my job. "
good,"fun environment,great job experience. I had to learn how to be patient and very polite even tough the customers were not always friendly. I was always willing to help."
good,I became a supervisor in this job. I was a salesperson which I enjoyed and I was a top seller.  I had good supervisors and a great manager.  The job was better when I was an associate.  Once I got into management the job got extremely busy.
good,The same duties as previously stated apply for this job.  The same processes were conducted in this job.  This job was busy and I enjoyed working with the employees.
good,"This place is great for part time event-only work.  You have the chance to see hundreds of people while you help them purchase, claim, and trouble-shoot tickets for the night's event."
good,I wasn't there very long not because of the business but becaused I had moved to another stated.  I enjoyed my supervisor there he was a class act with great salesmenship.  He was warm and made you want to work for him and also enjoy making money at the same time.    The business with great culture was always a win for me
good,Worked 10 years there and found that team very helpful and cooperative. Since it was my first job I learned a lot with peers and also company provided trainings.
good,"Excellent company for which to work.  IT organization is large and globally-dispersed, with top-notch talent, technology, and opportunities.  Great benefits (health insurance, vacation, etc.)."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical day work would include juggling too many responsibilities and having an inconsistent work flow throughout the company. Constantly changing commission structures and new work policies making it extremely hard to work and move forward in one direction. Extremely high turnover rates, very negative environment but a great opportunity to make money and create happy customers."
good,"I worked here fresh out of college. I had no wife and kids at the time, and it was perfect for me. I learned tons about myself, business, and sales. Invaluable skills I learned at VZW."
good,"A typical workday consisted of arriving at 7:45 (open at 8 am) "
good,"It's a good place to work becuase they stress work/life balance.  People who abuse it are the ones that complain that is it not so, but while I was there, no one ever told me I could not take care of me.  As long as you work with your manager, you manager works with you."
good,"Enjoyed working there for over 20 years. Had clear work load and functions to work on every day. few Conference call a day to communicate for each projects and with rest of team (on shore and off shore) to make sure team is on same page, clear requirements and project is on a right track."
good,Productive workplace. This was a great place to work. This company offered cultural diversity. There was a fair work life balance. The incentive were great!
good,"A great company to work for that provided excellent benefits from wellness and health, retirement plans, employee discounts and the occasional rewards for doing an excellent job."
good,"I worked here many years so I've seen a lot of change happen over that time. Some good, some bad! I will say that what I always enjoyed most was the people that I worked with and they way we were all dedicated to the work. Even though it was very stressful to meet most of the deadlines, we were able to do so. Ahead of schedule in a lot of cases. I help build a really strong team of techs and I miss working with them!"
good,"typical day is to have your mind on selling all day "
good,Verizon is a proactive forward thinking technology company. Benefits are great and advancement opportunities are above average. Many mentoring programs and great people to work with.
good,Got to help and build relationships with customers who came in and needed support. When it would get slow it would trim hours but great for building a foundation in customer service.
good,Perfect job for the person that likes to meet new people and solve problems while providing telecommunications solutions.  Hours are set by you to maximize your work ethics.
good,"- Excellent Salary benefits"
good,This was an internship so not much to review. The company culture was warm and welcoming with a lot of opportunity for advancement. Their new facilities are beautiful.
good,Work at Verizon was tough at days just because the call be so high and majority of the customers are upset. So we would have to take the time to align and reassure with the customer that we will get their issue resolved
good,I learned many OS systems for cellular platforms as I also preformed trouble shooting and technical support.helping customers is what I liv for so anytime we had an interaction I strived to be successful in correcting issues .Hardest part of job was limiations on how far ou can go to help customers.management was pretty good on assisting reps and techs .
good,"Verizon life is unique and is a family amongst coworkers. Management  would meet with the team as a whole and individually. The communication was good amongst the team and we would take care of each as family. When I worked for Verizon you would find people that had been with the company from 6-12mths or as long as 15-20yrs showing the commitment of the company taking care of their employees. Each and everyday were never the same. One day you could have the best day with everything going great; but, then you could have a day that no matter how or what you did to take care of the customer base that it was our fault even though you would explain what and why it was being done. But, if a team member saw you were having a rough day they would make it a habit to bring your spirit up and tell you that don't worry and to move forward."
good,Good company to work with. Gives employee to have good learning curve and encourages to work with new trending technologies. Had good work life balance
good,"It was a learning position on how to deal with all types of people. You received calls about phone bill, extra services, payment arrangements, and some who just needed someone to listen."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,At this office we were consultants working for Infosys Technologies. I loved the place as the work used to be very technical in Mainframes and those days i loved tech work a lot.
good,"A typical day at work would include addressing any previous issues from prior workday, updating any projects that are active, conferring with co-workers and superiors to ensure continuity in work operations. Enjoying a learning atmosphere where each employee is strengthened by the interactions with other workers and management personnel. The most difficult part of the job would be caused by poor communication within the work environment and failure to seek to rectify that problem would be a major problem."
good,Slowly over the years it became more about money and less about the employees. But they generally were a great company to work for. Just wish they cred a little more about their employees.
good,"nice place to work , very good compensation,  very good employee friendly environment , nice place to work , very good compensation, nice cafe inside the building"
good,i loved the people in that i worked with and for things were easy to understand and made clear. sometimes it could be stressful however the people and the culture made it easy to understand
good,incredible pressure to sell and upsell customers no integrity whatsoever. padding customers bills and working it out later. competing within your own company
good,"Like the title says the benfits are amazing and the competition is very competitve. If you ha e a family or are maybe going to school, the set schedules are a little rigid, unless you have the seniority+performance. They do offer multiple time off options which are a plus. The management if you of course get a good one is amazing as verizon emphasises an open door policy, even the senior managers are available at a moments notice."
good,Great experience in sales environment. Not just selling phones. One of the best training I've received. great benefits from the start. Opportunity to make great money.
good,Best job I have ever had along with great benefits and pay.  Provided overtime when available and the company itself was a very strong one with great management.  Unfortunately outsourced or I would still be working there.
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for with awesome benefits. Working in retail requires you to be available more often and during various hours compared to an 8 to 5 but that can change if you decide to pursue a position in corporate. If you enjoy sales and focusing on individual goals you can make good money.
good,"Great company to work for, good pay and benefits. "
good,Great company to work for but also depends on the channel that you are in. Working in the retail channel can be very stressful but also very rewarding and good compensation.
good,"For the work done, Verizon was a great place to work with plenty of opportunity.  There were some metrics that needed to be met which could provide for a fair amount of stress, but nothing too stressful."
good,Been fun working there for  years. Unfortunately the company is downsizing and lots of us are getting layed off. OTher then that is a good place to grow
good,This company is great if you are looking to advance yourself and make a career. The people are great and will strive to teach you how to be the best possible salesman.
good,Great incentives with bonuses. provided fun activities for employees which were great. provided lunch for special occasions and had company outings and just fun at times...
good,"Before I was let go, incentives were everywhere and easily attainable if you put in the work.  If you had the right sales strategies, people will buy a package that fits their needs, even if they reject it at first."
good,"If you are a person who is team oriented (not trying to be cliche) and focused on the big picture while proving daily that you are willing to learn and apply what learn in a highly competitive environment, then Verizon is a good fit for you."
good,Loved the company. They helped me gain more management skills. Very interesting company to work for. They taught me a lot about the billing process and why our bills look the way they do.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It was a great experience , if love helping people and work well with technology this is a great place to work. Keeps you on your feet , there is always something new to learn everyday."
good,"Good opportunity if you're willing to put in the work. The people that are most successful put in extra hours and go the extra mile. It is retail so if you don't want to work retail hours, its not the job for you."
good,"Verizon values it employees, encourages learning and career advancement.  Very happy culture that shares one vision, one goal one mission.  Very good company."
good,Although the work hours can be demanding.  Verizon is a great company to be a part of and has a great culture.  The company also provides great benefits.
good,I am looking to retired and work long term with a good company. Verizon is a well known company and great benefits. But I am looking more opportunity besides retail.
good,Working this engagement for Verizon Business was amazing.  I learned so much as far as cutting edge technology and business processes.  Major large scale data center migration with application build outs and digital transformation.  Amazing team and amazing work life balance while working remotely.  Would do again in a heartbeat.
good,Deal with a variety of technical issues involving a multitude of mobile devices. Deal with customer issues in a timely manner and follow up on tickets submitted.
good,Verizon was a very fast paced sales driven work place.  They offered great incentives and made the work place fun by valuing their employees.  The benefits such as PTO and Tuition assistance was top in the industry.
good,Great management program. Several problems with the company was there were to many steps as far as getting things done as far as the final product. We always had to fax over there advertisement then they would ok it then fax it back over. When we could have emailed it then had electronic signature.
good,A workforce full of sales driven individuals.  Sales reps determine the need for customers and look for opportunities to grow accounts by adding additional lines of service.  Management is largely supportive with but some individuals more suited for direct sales than managing salespeople.  Operations/Customer service roles in store have been eliminated so all back of the house responsibilities now fall on managements' shoulders.
good,"Anyone can do it, literally. You're pretty doing the same thing through repetition with the exception of a few bad customers and/or representatives. Other than that it's not too shabby."
good,"I really enjoyed doing my job and helping customers. Verizon had great job benefits as well as a 401 k plan. It was a good office environment, and it was pleasure to work side by side with my co-workers."
good,"Verizon is my first company and it was a great opportunity to work in that organization.we can learn more and enhance our skill set, productive environment."
good,A good environment to work in. The day consisted of answering phone calls and directing them to the correct number for customer connection. The best part of this job was learning what happens when a person dials 411.
good,"Very fast paced and stressful. Have to learn very quickly. Management has an ""open door"" policy. Workplace culture is balanced. Hardest part of job is company is reactive. Most enjoyable are the employees."
good,If you have the drive to push sales then you will excel with Verizon. They have great benefits and discounts. Only downside is when being promoted to management. Most of the time you take a pay cut.
good,I had an opportunity to work for former MCI which merged with verizon. My manger was my mentor to guide me to the corporate world. Loved every opportunity to explore the telecom world.
good,"A typical work day would consist of helping to find customers solutions to their very day lives regarding mobile technology and more. An example would be a traveling customer; they would come in with mobile internet issues, I would assess the problem, find a solution and present other options/ products that we sell at the store which could make their lives easier. The same would go for small businesses. We retain great relationships with small business's to help them become more efficient, more mobile, and more profitable."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Great atmosphere and friendly support staff.  Excellen compensation with ability to earn great commissions.  This division closed in 2004. It was a great experinece.
good,"I liked working for Verizon. They diligently train their new employees and try to give them every tool to succeed. Sales was not my bag so I left the company, but overall it was a great experience."
good,Awesome place to work if you are in a decent store. Slow months are extremely slow. Pick a good location or you'll get stuck doing nothing but helping old folks reset their emails.
good,"Locations throughout New England only have sales representatives now. Good place for driven, motivated individuals who love making money. You get out what you put in."
good,"Verizon as a company is a great place to work. pay is great, benefits are great work life balance."
good,"I would not consider this a ""stellar"" place to work but it ticks all of the check marks of what you would consider a solid place to work for both a job and a career."
good,"A typical day is I start off troubleshooting external and internal enterprise systems. Train online. Review policy and procedures of current troubleshooting  techniques. Close out the day with more enterprise troubleshooting. I learned how to train and provide great customer service.Very supportive management. Change management was a daily occurrence. "
good,"Stable and pays well. Good work environment.  Career and transition planning is not a existant.  If you are in the NJ office you can advance, but little opportunity outside of that."
good,ALLTEL was a great company until the last year.  Once found out and being bought out it was stressful knowing I would be losing my career.  Verizon wasn't a bad place to work for the short time I was with them.  The only positions available were retail stores and I wasn't interested in going back to a commission based job.
good,I loved my job at Verizon.  I got along with everyone and did not get involved with personal issues with co workers.  I  basically just did my job and went home.  The people were very nice and my managers were all very nice to me.   I know I was productive and there was no reason for any conflict between myself and management.
good,The company was good. It was a call center and we were in teams. The only criticism that I would have for the company is that they put pressure on you to make a sale. It is a challenge to get someone to purchase something online when their main purpose is to see about their account.
good,"Great place to work, definitely learned a lot with sales and customer service. Environment was great to work I'm. Compensation/Commission was very good. Timing could've been worked on a little better as far as schedule goes but overall great place to work."
good,In order to move up or stay competitive in this company you need to be adaptable. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable because nothing last forever here.
good,In order to move up or stay competitive in this company you need to be adaptable. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable because nothing last forever here.
good,"Verizon offers great benefits, spiffs and compensation, but if you're looking for a good work life balance this isnt the job for you. If you have alot of time on your hands and no family y ou can def make a killer living there with overtime and the pay."
good,Fantastic sales work environment that will allow you to advance and grow. Bilingual opportunities have more pay and there is always work. The location is great and management was professional.
good,Vzw is an excellent place to work. Great pay and benefits. If you want to make a career there you will exceed.  I enjoyed the team environment and the constant evolution of business.
good,Decent place to work. Typical day at my location was dealing with a lot of service and upset customers. The company is straying away from dealing with service/billing/tech support in the retail locations which contributes a lot to it. Recently laid off our operations staff so job is becoming more difficult to keep up with all the incoming changes/promotions while still having great sales skills.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"The environment is great, good training provided, however a lot of uncertainty and significant amount of lay offs lately."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Fast paced call center environment.  Excellent benefit package.  competitive wages.  Excellent culture and work environment.  Many opportunities for overtime wages.
good,Working at Verizon is just like any other job that has stress and trying to understand the difference between work and career. it is a great place that one can have a career there.it is up to you to make your own culture there. I learnt a great deal of team collaboration and making contacts in different parts of the organization because you may never know who would be a great connect to have.
good,"Verizon is an awesome company that supplies their employees with avast amount of resources to better themselves. i have learned a lot from the company - how to balance work/life aspect, working with others, and being a great team with different personalities."
good,"Great environment and amazing support from corporate but, due to various waves of layoff it feels like retail is going away. Retail position my not exist. "
good,Good company to work for if you are very determined. A strong sales background is necessary for success. Great environment at store level. Potential to move up if you are confident.
good,"awesome dynamic really great place to work. pleasant work environment, i learn new things about people everyday. hardest part making a customer entirely happy."
good,A great organization to work for.  There is a career plan and opportunity to meet your goals.  Leadership is there to mentor and guide you thru your career path.

Some of the hardest things to deal with with in my position is saying no to customers when all resources have exhausted and not very much can be done about their inquiries. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing what the company can do for the customer and be able to recommend the latest products and services for a better experience."
good,"Enjoyed the team work."
good,"A typical day at work was to take inbound calls to assist internal customers with their accounts. I also monitor their accounts to make sure they comply to compliance guidelines.

As a team lead, I assist my supervisor with various daily & monthly reports and assigned duties to my team to process. In the year 1996, I received the team player of the year award.

good,Working with customer's on a daily to help resolve their issues. I learned how to manage billing and providing customer service.
good,"This is a good company to work for. The hours can be difficult depending on type of job (rotating schedules, open 24/7, work nights/weekends/and holidays). The job requires joining the union. There is a contract in place that is very employee oriented. Paid vacations, some of the best health benefits for a call center, 401k and regular raises. The co-workers are supportive, training is paid, and the union is there for you if you need them. The hardest part of this job is the customers, and when trained properly they are not that difficult to work with. The management leaves much to be desired. Often promoted from different departments and needing to be trained by the people they are meant to supervise, they can be little to no help. The attendance policy strict and uncompromising, making it hard for single parents or people with young children. But overall a great company to work for."
good,"Amazing!"
good,"Great work/life balance"
good,"Very high call volume, I have learned to focus outward on the customer.  Customers are the most valuable to any business."

Every call having its own unique issues, never redundant. Very challenging monthly quota's, great prize incentives, wonderful benefits. Very helpful management, always offering training on new products.The most enjoyable part of the job, was knowing I was gonna learn something new at any given moment."

It was a pleasure to work with my internal and external peers, I feel like our relationship was  respected due to our work integrity.  Unfortunately due to Finance Transformation my job has relocated therefore I will be separated from the company in Feb 2014."

good,"•	Assist customers with billing and phone questions  "
good,Working at Verizon Wireless taught me many valuable skills.  Their continual training efforts helped me do my job properly.  The job itself entailed speaking to customers over the phone and solving their problems.  I did enjoy the interaction with the customers and learned a lot during my time at Verizon.
good,"I was a cable splicing technician.  My job was to Place, repair, and splice copper and fiber optic cable.  We covered storm damage and otherwise damaged cable.

The compensation is slightly higher than compensation in companies within the industry with quarterly performance reviews and an annual bonus.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"I would start work at 8:00 at the garage, report in and pick up the days work. Get my truck loaded  for the days work then proceed to first customer's house and find out what their problem was and then proceed to repair. when all done I would report back with the customer and make sure all problems resolved then proceed  to the next job. Many days overtime was needed to complete my work. My management was always available when needed to help resolve problems with a job.  My co-workers were all well trained and willing to assist when needed. I feel the hardest part of my job was solving internet problems because there was so many different offices involved  where the problems could be. This was very time consuming and required much patience. The best part of my job was making people happy by resolving the trouble they were having."
good,"Verizon is definitely one of the better companies to work for when it comes to working in a call center.  The training one receives is fairly decent and frequent.  The job can be somewhat stressful, as all call-center jobs can be, but the work environment is generally professional without feeling stuffy.  The compensation (wages & benefits) are among the best in the industry.  Unfortunately, knowledge and experience aren't valued as much as a four-year degree, so don't expect to climb the corporate ladder, no matter how long you're there, without one.  On the plus side, the company may also help fund your educational goals if they're in line with what could benefit the company down the road.  Just be sure you're able to keep a high enough GPA or you'll lose that benefit as well and you'll be stuck with a big bill."
good,"Great place to work!!  The call center was a great place to work. Took sales calls from beginning of shift to end of shift. had ping pong tables, basketball hoops, and gym.  If you are an active person and need to move around then working in the call center is not for you."
good,"A Typical day at work : Starts slowly and ends with busy evening"
good,"Verizon has awesome benefits and awesome management. I work in Maplewood and my team is amazing. If you love sales, you will love the Verizon retail life. My job as an experience specialist is to lead phone workshops, trouble-shoot devices, and help Sales reps sell stuff."
good,"Industry leader in communications. Standard retail schedule: nights, weekends, holidays."
good,"In the Marquee Accounts position I was responsible for supporting the Top 3-4 accounts in the Houston/Gulf Coast.  A typical day was spent interacting with those companies, finding new projects and contacts and working with the National Account Manager to set local strategy."

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Excellent company to have worked for. There was ample room for advancement. Management was available and approachable for the teammates.
good,"a typical day is sign in on time and taking calls. Answering the most basic to complex. I learned you have to wear the customer service  and supervisor hat to solve matters of callers needing a supervisor to solve problems. Take ownership and try to do whatever you can  before getting a supervisor for the issues. I learned 1 call resolution. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training to help a customer  who I could have helped and save a transfer to another department. My co-workers made it easy to come to work, some became friends. -- the most enjoyable part of of the job is getting bonuses just for doing your job. For being there when required and professional of the customer needs and time."
good,"A typical day would consist of a morning huddle to stay abreast on any new promotions and review product information.  Prepare your station and proceed to provide the best service you can possibly deliver.  Everyday will be a new learning experience given the fact that is an ever-changing environment in one of the most fast paced environment in sales.  You will know how to handle everything from operations to technical issues, overall managing your own business and clientele.  At Verizon Wireless, the co-workers and I are and have to be extremely team oriented but also have the ability to work independently to make transactions and the buying process more personable.  The hardest part of the job would have to be the fact that you work retail hours which is not as conducive to family life, although I would consider that to be the hardest part of the job as being away from your family I would also say the pro to it is that does result in more productivity.  The best part about the job is meeting and learning new people, technology, and achieving business and personal goals."
good,"Good. Enjoyed working with the public. Great offer."
good,"Verizon is a very diverse work environment.  Individual contributions are valued and business lines work as teams to accomplish short and long term goals.  Corporate benefits and compensation are very good, compared to many large companies."

good,"This company promotes from within. They have an extensive training system that prepares you for the calls that are being received. The atmosphere is friendly and the management is very supportive. They gave good compensation and good benefits and it was easy to progress in the company if you desired to do so. The only reason that I left this company was because I transferred to their Irvine, CA call center and they refused to put me into their National Accounts Department that I should've been going into. They didn't provide the wage incentive that I was supposed to get due to cost of living there. And, I had to wait for more than 1.5 months to get into the company there even though everything was prearranged before I got there. They also put me into their Financial Services Department which I found that I disliked."
good,"Work life balance was not always easy to achieve. Although I had a lot of vacation days available, I  could not call in and take a day if needed because of the needs of the business."
good,"Verizon Wireles was a beautiful and advantourous place to work. If you are will to relocate and put worth effort and resolve on a continued basis you would be rewarded,"

Learned so many things pertaining to all the little nuances of how people actually use there devices out in the field and at home.Dealing with angry customers could be a little trying at times, but it was extremely satisfying to have them leave with a smile on their faces when their issues were all resolved."
good,"Great benefits, pay and overall the corporation truly is a great company."
good,"Productive place where we can work for learn alot."
good,"In my position as a customer service rep, it is a high-energy job on the phones that is dynamic and changing every day. We bridge the gap between the customers and the company, and so we play a big part in helping customers understand their products and services, and alleviating any situations that arise throughout their time with us. Management is very dynamic and supporting of us, I've enjoyed the different managers I've had. Coworkers are always there to support each other whenever questions came up. The hardest part of the job for me is the occasional time where what I want to do for the customer is in direct conflict with how the company wants me to handle the situation, which can lead to the occasional frustrations, but overall most of the time we are able to negotiate win-win solutions. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping the customer out and sometimes knowing that our conversation is quite possibly the best conversation that they'll have with someone all week. I've learned a ton of people skills through my time with the company, and learned a lot about how business works as well."
good,"Handled most  aspects of job independently. Worked from home."

good,This is a great company to work for with the exception of the retails stores. The retail stores are so focused on sales and metrics that it cause a lot of stress for the sales reps while they are having to worry about meeting their metrics in order to save their job. Outside of this Verizon Wireless is a great place to work for with great pay and great benifits

good,"This is a great company to work for with full benefits including tuition reimbursement and 401k matching. You must be able to sell whatever the company wants you to sell, know a lot about wireless technology and products, and be able to stand on your feet 10 hours a day.

good,"I loved working for this company. I obtained a degree through Verizon, whom offered the best tution assistance program."

Hated that i would try to sell with honesty but was pushed to sell with lies."

good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon California. It was a fun and productive enviroment. Unfortunately I was a product of a reduction in workforce. My favorite part of the job was helping customers with everything from their billing and orders, and recommending products needed to better suit their needs. The most important part of the job was just to listen and pick up on clues as to what the customer needs. It was a job where constant learning and programs were implemented. Contest were fun and gave associates the added incentive to do more and be more. It became more about the customers needs then the prizes. It also kept moral high and the associates happy. It was a fun work enviroment."
good,"As a care rep or even a sales rep a typical day consists of interacting with customers, selling, and answering inquiries.

good,It was nice to have different shifts available so that it worked around my school schedule.
good,I loved working for Verizon Wireless.
good,Overall a very good company to work for. Excellent benefits and values.
good,"Hardest part of job is maintaining high quality customer service day after day, call after call . Most days interaction with customers can be fun and interesting, however ,if your customer does not feel ""completely/absolutely"" satisfied and even if you give them what they wanted they may give you a less then satisfactory survey response latter. Expectations are very high at Verizon Wireless which is understandable as they continue to be very successful despite higher rates for services. Customer ratings provided by customers via telephone interview is your measure of quality and if customer rates you less then 8 out of ten you have not met expectations (you may as well get a zero even if you get a 7). My experience last few months at Verizon were frustrating as I continued to focus on making the customer feel ""special"" and went to great lengths to ensure they were happy(many times I lost focus on why they called in the first place because I was so intent on being super nice & freindly). As scores came in all was well first 2-3 weeks then a couple of bad calls and the whole month is shot! I can't telI you how many times I got that notorious ""7"" from a customer but there were many."
good,"verizon is a great company to work for. hard to move up, you have to become buddies with management. great money great pay. easy place to sell, the customer come to you and you just discover their needs."
good,"Fast pace day, Continous training and updating guidlines. Learning what custmer satisfaction means. Management having even faster pace. Co-workers sharing same information and demands of service. Hardest part of day not completing follow-ups and updating customers. The most enjoyable part is when customer appreciates your effort and is satisfied."
good,"A typical day as a Quality Analysis consisted of reviewing your email to stay up to date with current daily functions of the call center and tasks which were to be completed by the end of the shift. I enjoyed working with as a team, which included my supervisor, assessing agent’s performance/behavior in the call center, and contributing to the improvement of overall call center performance. I coached and counsel agents to modify their performance/behavior to facilitate a high level of customer service to reduce business risk, improve quality of the call center agent calls, and reduce agent attrition. Also, I was responsible for maintaining a log in excel of each agent who were coached and monitored, the recommendations for improvement and any follow-up. Attended call calibrations to ensure that all sites were adhering to client's policy and procedures. Sent reports to corporate indicating the KPIs of agents who were monitored at the end of the shift. The hardest part working as a Quality Analysis was not being able to influence 100% of the agents who were coached, the importance of doing exceptional well while on the calls from start to finish."
good,"I grew a lot at this job, I started as a front line customer service representative answering phone calls related to individual customer concerns. By the time I left, I had learned how to schedule and staff a call center of 1200 employees, operating 24 hours a day. There is a lot of ground and subjects learned between those two points of knowledge, but i think the gist if made."
good,"good work place and great co-workers. Interesting customers as well. Great benefits, commision, bonus and teaching classes were great learning about all products. The hardest part sometimes was hitting your quota.Most enjoyable part was meeting need people everday and learning there needs and wants."
good,"I have worked at Verizon for 5 years; I have been a top performer, constantly obtaining my number. I have great relationships with hundreds of customers in the Tri-state area. Very good relationship with the management team, I owned my position and rarely needed to involve management unless it was something completely out of my control. I really enjoyed the people I have become friends with at Verizon and the professional relationships I have developed with my clients. The hardest part about the job was getting paid post sale. There were many system issues that caused errors in correctly tracking sales and sometimes the installation times would be so far out that the customer would cancel the order due to time restrictions. But, overall I was able to sell through it and enjoy a successful career."
good,This was the last assignment that I had in my Verizon career. It was challenging and rewarding and a great conclusion to a satisfying and rewarding career at Verizon.
good,"most enjoyable part- tuition reimbursement, flexible hours, free work phone"
good,I work in customer care where we finish the customers sales experience. I make the customer aware of what they can expect at delivery or pick up.

I typical day at verizon was always something different we learned alot about the services and products. management was great to communicate with and to work with.

good,"Verizon has excellent service, Their workers are very informative, Most of their management is very helpful."
good,"Verizon Wireless is overall a good place to work. They train very well, there are plenty of hours, pay is fair. Quality assurance could use some work as they don't follow ""set rules and guidelines"".The benefits are very good, They allow plenty of time for your breaks/lunch, and they do handle unruly customers very well they don't allow you to be verbally abused/attacked by customers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"Management is nice to work with, typical day at work consist of reporting functions that track device inventory for the business side of the company for top vps and executives, coworkers are great, hardest part of the job making sure there are minimal to no errors when completing the reports."
good,A typical day at Verizon Wireless is very busy. Things that you may learn at this job is being able to stay in control of your customer and conversation. Our supervisor job is to make sure that we are getting the correct feedback and also make sure that no one customer leave the call without there issue being resolved. Of course your co-workers are very different from one another but you come together to create a exceptional experience for our customers. The hardest part of the job is when you have an escalated customer and being able to control the call even if they are using profanity and being rude with youu. The enjoyable part of the job is when your hardwork doesn't go un noticed.

good,"Starting at customer service, and cycling through different titles over the years, my priority was furthering my education which they helped with.  After getting my bachelor degree and four certifications, it was difficult obtaining a desired job title, and my current duties at the time just did not interest my hunger after all that education.  Moving on to a position at a different company that fulfills the skills I have obtained through educational program."
good,"A typical workday would start by clocking in and checking email.  I found that we would have a recap of the day before sales numbers and monthly progress.  We discussed best practices and new promotions, before we opened the store to assist customers.  Once we opened, I handle customer request, sales, and trouble shooting.  The position is lucrative for the amount of work you do, but the sales expectations are in many categories, but you expect to be paid accordingly because of the long reputation and deep pockets."
good,"My daily tasks at the Verizon store were to make sure all trainings were completed and make sure we were caught up with updates upon arrival. I'd assist customers with phone sales, trouble shooting and with questions regarding their accounts. I learned new methods of positioning certain sales and sale pitches. Management was very helpful and knowledgeable, although not always organized. I did not work with my store manager as much as I would have liked. Metrics were attainable, we had access to the helpful resources, but the only challenge was keeping up with the sudden schedule changes due to the high turnover rate. I did enjoy meeting new people and learning from them."
good,"I was excited to be a part of Verizon’s FTTP fiber to the premise project from 2005 - 2010.  I even got to do my own neighborhood.  When they sold it to Frontier in 2010, that’s when things went downhill very quickly.  Every thing was fine while it was owned and run by Verizon"
good,"I was there for a shade over 10 years. Every year they'll tweak the compensation structure to ensure you make less and while adding additional responsibilities. I'm only slightly exaggerating when I say that by the end of my tenure, I was doing twice as much work for half the pay that I got when I first started."
good,As a single mom Verizon was amazing but as I advanced in my career it became harder to have a work life balance and childcare because of location was hard
good,I enjoyed my time with Verizon and was sad when they sold us...  They were well structured with a good direction and good job aids for employees.  They also recognized employees values by observing milestone anniversaries which was very nice.
good,"Verizon provides the best benefits to its employees. Plenty of growth opportunities, they try to create a positive work place. There are some cons with working in a call center and there are always room for impro7."
good,I have really liked Verizon Wireless.  They provide great benefits and have a good work/life balance.  Interviews to advance are tricky. Hard work and knowledge seem to pay off less than smooth talking sellsmen.
good,"A generally positive environment, filled with encouraging people who are willing to help you learn. The company provides decent training before you're on the sales floor but, it could have been more in depth technologically speaking. It's a great place to learn the holistic version of customer service as many customers aren't coming in to buy anything, but instead need your help to save money, understand the technology, etc. In that regard you are also dealing with, ultimately, people with a membership for your company so complete honesty is necessary when dealing with customers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon was a fun place to work.  Great training program with lots of hands on training.  Lots of support from management.  Job can be VERY stressful at times to hit quotes and find leads so IF YOU ARE HUNGRY and born with a hustle to excel than you can soar in this company.
good,"Verizon is an okay place to work also opportunities to earn extra income (overtime). The benefits are great. My typical day was to put out fires with angry customers.  Our customer service department would dump calls blindly to our area. If you got the call then that survey is on you, good or bad!"
good,installed fios and telephone for 10 years union backed up its members and management was willing to work with the people under them solid place to work
good,Never trust anything promised but the pay is great and they also offer retirement packages. I would recommend this job b to anyone that can be stressed 7-4 and understand your job isn't definit.
good,"I enjoyed my almost 30 years working at Verizon. It was very rewarding and difficult at the same time, but the overall payoff was well worth it. There were required methods of handling different customer situations, and adhering proved to be stressful many times. However, standard business decorum was absolutely necessary in order to achieve positive outcomes. I noticed that as I moved into different lines of businesses over the years, I was given more autonomy with work and customer handling. In one position, it was stressed that we manage our work as if being self-employed or contractors of our own businesses. Working in that capacity was wonderful. Not only was I given permission to handle the work as I deemed fit, but it gave me a sense of real ownership and freedom. As a result, I was able to out-perform the required metrics. There was not a constant ""looking over the shoulder""! But the one ever present aspect of working for Verizon was the help that was always at hand. If I needed help to complete my tasks or problems with certain job functions, it was always available. That one but very important aspect was what made my overall experience at Verizon completely unique,"
good,"Verizon Wireless is all about numbers, calls, sales.  The money has always been phenominal and the benefits exceptional.  My management team overall has been excellent.   The workplace is my family away from home.  The employees I have worked with are people I spend most of my week with and its always a relaxed and fun atmoshpere"
good,"Compared to other retail jobs you can make good money, but it is a stressful job and there are constant commission structure changes which always seem to cut down your pay over time. The benefits package is awesome and I took full advantage of the tuition reimbursement/"
good,"I would say that Verizon provides you with a steep learning curve in the beginning. As a data scientist, I had plenty of opportunities to experiment on various projects. The work culture was amazing, as my first company, it provided various avenues for relief from work stress such as the ERGs activities."
good,"Great job, great benefits, excellent salary as a technician.  Training isn’t emphasized as it once was, so you must be diligent.  Any false move will result in suspension.  But if you work hard and give them an honest days work and you’re blessed with decent supervision it can be a very rewarding.    The union’s good too!"
good,Monitoring and evaluating sales calls. Taking supervisor calls when representative is  unable to handle. Workplace can be very intense due to meeting monthly sales quota. Disciplinary action such as termination was difficult.
good,"We had great leadership at one time, but that changed. It became very stressful and then we had another change in leadership. It became quite the roller coaster ride."
good,"I loved working for Verizon. If it wasn't for a major restructure within the company and my inability to move out of state I would still be there.  Great benefits, flexible schedule, great people!"
good,"If you want to work in cell phones and you want to get paid your worth and don’t want to deal with cut rate management or some union, this is the place to work"
good,"had ability to work from home and minimal travel only 2-3times a yr"
good,Always a difference experience every day. Management was descent and my co workers always tried to help each other out whenever possible. Good work environment.
good,Verizon started out as a great company to work for but over the last five years it has taken a massive downturn. It used to feel like they cared but metrics have risen while traffic is a quarter of what it was 5 years ago and they're laying off people in mass.
good,"After considerable effort building a foundation for IoT to become the next evolution in wireless technologies, with a focus on enabling business partners to take the lead in offerings development, Verizon failed miserably in it's execution and investment focus."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you're looking to maximize dollars a Sales Rep. It is difficult to move into management, as they are consistently cutting management headcount. The company offers great benefits and the ability to make close to six figures as a sales representative."
good,"My store was one of the stores that were always in question of being around in the next few months. It eventually shut down. That being said, if I were in a better location, the goals would be much easier to achieve. The money is really good. At the lowest level, it is possible to achieve close to 6 figures. You don't have to be in management in order to afford a house...Or drive a brand new Mercedes. Verizon cares about their employees. Sales is all about the numbers. Find a way is all I have to say."
good,It taught me a lot about the work force. I was able to multi task and talk with people about their issues with their cell phones and I learned how to troubleshoot several different devices.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Working for Verizon was a great learning experience, I learned different parts of the business, and it also gave me the ability to work cross-functionally with other people across different footprints."
good,"Your supervisor can really make or break your success within the company. You should never be afraid to go up your chain of command when necessary, they are there for you."
good,"This company was all about competition and success based on ethics and performance. If you were a top performer and you worked hard, this was a great place to work. Much has changed in the industry but I know them to be a good company."
good,Verizon is a good place to work. There is no work life balance but the benefits are great. Most managers will help you succeed and get further in the company. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting great people.
good,Verizon is a constantly evolving company and always tries to be the first one in business to try new things. Changes are always welcomed and management supports your input. Benefits are great and work place have ping pong tables to get your self relaxed during break.
good,"Overall great company to work for, they understand you have to balance home and work. Met some wonderful people and learned a great deal about business."
good,I enjoyed my years at Verizon. The projects I was involved in supporting were very challenging and they spanned supporting both internal workforce customers like sales reps as well as projects that supported products that our end customers used on our digital sites
good,I was working for Alltel for 23+ years and Verizon bought the company.  My position was removed with the purchase.  I was given severance and left the company on good terms.
good,"Other than meetings you were allowed to set your own appointment times and schedule as long as you were making work numbers. I learned the ability to cold call, negotiate and close deals.  Management was knowledgable.  It was a sales job and a sales culture with numbers you were required to obtain.  You had to be prepared for quotas to increase regularly.  I loved the interaction with other teammates."
good,"Phone work is like any work you do elsewhere.  They do, however put a lot of time and energy in how you do it. Being a jack-of-all-trades will definitely help. The secret is volunteer for off the clock activities; go help the booths, go tot eh meet-the-boss brown bag functions, and then put them on your resume.  It isn't the specifics that matter, it's demonstrating that you will go the extra mile for the company that matters."
good,Management offered some autonomy if you were meeting your timelines and goals.  I created my own work schedule with the client list I was given.  The hardest part was not having one office to share with my peers since they were in different states.
good,I found Verizon to be a good employer and corporate citizen. The benefits are excellent and there is an emphasis on integrity and matching our goals to the company's mission and credo.
good,"Sales driven company that has high sales goals, but even better benefits. There are  lots of training for employees to participate in and advance their career."
good,"it used to be best place place to work at. But, recently, with so many layoffs, it's not as exciting as before. Also, developers don't have lot have independence to make decisions"
good,"I progressed through many job classifications over my 18 years and ended at the highest paid hourly position. I was frustrating when VZ decided to sell of 14 states to Frontier. I thought i had found a job for life, guess things change"
good,"Good company to work with."
good,"Having been a part of the Verizon Family, I have retained valuable skills that still remain in my business work ethic including sales techniques, importance of the customer/business relationship, importance of employee education, corporate structures, and further developing management skills while in a self-driven environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A Typical day at work involves multiple online consultation regarding the One Talk Portal."
good,"Many, Many opportunities. Like working for 30 companies under 1 roof and being able to move around. Upward mobility is available for those will to put in the time and effort."
good,"Training and development provided excellent opportunity to advance with company. Verizon Wireless was one of the best company in US that provided excellent benefits, good working culture and excellent pay in the industry."
good,Goid employees and job culyure resources are provided to help you succeed. They do allow room for advancement when the opportunity is available. The do a good job of keeping you posted
good,Every department that I worked in over my 28 years I had a different experience in. Some better than most. I did like my job there and was paid well for my efforts.
good,Verizon changed when everything became about money and people or its employees.  Business model was save and cut and save.  I was an employee for 19 years and then they layed us off and really did what was on paper to cover themselves as far looking good to help.   But people who spent the prime lives there.  It hard at my age to find another career.
good,"This job is very intense.  Extremely busy, Quotas and very customer service based.  ALL calls are being monitored in order to keep employees on check to ensure quality.  Learned to remain professional on all calls, no matter what occurs the customer is always right.  Culture is professional, structured and casual. The most difficult part of the job is to remain pleasant and professional even if the customer is vulgar. An employee must remain composure at all times.  The atmosphere is pleasant and friendly and supervisors are trained to use positive constructive criticism to ensure morale in this stressful environment."
good,"My current role I am able to work from home which is the most enjoyable part. My recent manager was great to work for. The only hardest part of my job which is part of the business, the requirement to work off hours and 24 X 7 oncall."
good,"Start with briefing of new products and any changes"
good,"Company was great to work for in the beginning. Commission compensation was very good, quota was mainly attainable. Company changed it's direction and focus. Customers no longer had a need to visit retail stores, instead they buy most products online. quotas became unattainable. Soon company will begin to downsize corporate stores."
good,"daily work included a friendly atmosphere 8am-5pm"
good,"Working for Verizon over the years I learned from a lot of different people.  "
good,"it was a good place to work, had great customers, pay was really good and i enjoyed working there. Bonuses were great as long as you put in the work.."
good,Company did a lot to ensure employees can get educated and have the ability to advance from within the company. Had lots of incentives and workplace fun activities to keep staff spirits up and motivated.
good,"A typical work day at Verizon was caring for customers concerns regarding their home telephone, internet, and video service. The hardest part of the job was the travel. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and my co-workers."
good,"There was not a need to write most things down, do to the fact that it could change the next day. Most Customers thought they were entitled to whatever they wanted, even if they didn't deserve it."
good,Great Benefits and compensation packages.  Plenty of room for career advancement especially if you are willing to relocate.  I unfortunately had to leave the company due to a disability.
good,Decent job but very not comfortable at times . Great retail job but very difficult to make a career with family or other responsibilities and are very disici
good,"I worked in the landline for small and medium business side. Excellent pay and benefits. Depending on the department your in, it can be very stressful.  The main reason main reason I left was because their main ordering system was the worst I've ever used.  Trying to fit a ""round peg and a square whole"", all day long.  Orders that used to take 15 minutes to process, could take 3 times that long.  And when you hit that ""submit"" button, you'd keep your fingers cross and hope the order went thru! For a long time employee, it was beyond frustrating."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Things change each day so be ready to adapt."
good,"Intense high sales position. Was driven to succeed by the management. Stressful based on traffic and new products, but an overall positive experience. Learned so many skills in sales."
good,for a beginning sales position this is ideal. This job will teach you the basics in salesmanship which will help you in the rest of your career. It is also very fun.
good,"Neve a dull moment, here is always a customer to assist, whether in tech support, billing, customer satisfaction, or customer education. Excellent ongoing training in the latest wireless technologies."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. They are flexible with work life balance and the environment is very friendly. Learned great skills while I was there
good,"The company truly allows you to take control of your own income. They have a competitive base salary and attainable commission goals. The only issue I ever had was trying to get a medical transfer to bring my family closer to other family members who could help us with our kids, otherwise, I would still be there."
good,"I was very determined and an amazing sales representative as well as manager, it was a lot of responsibility, stress, hours, and inconsistent pay due to the fact it was sales. I did not have a life or time for family working here because my paycheck depended upon it.  for my health and well being i left."
good,"Loved the staff I worked with, made it feel like a family.  However, some days it was difficult when customers wanted to lower their bills due to affordability and balancing still showing options to the same customers about expanding and adding on to their plan."
good,"Was an awesome experience working for them. I did really good friends, improved my English but above all, I did my best providing an incredible customer service because I’m a customer too and I would like to be treated the same way I was treating them."
good,"I was at Verizon for 7 years and moved up within the company, it was a great place to work. They like to promote within the company and I will always refer friends and family to Verizon."
good,Great place to work. New CEO is moving several positions to India as a result I have accepted a voluntary separation package.  If you can handle the roller coaster this place is for you
good,Excellent place to work but stressful. Great co- workers. Great pay and benefits.Fast paced. Union membership. If you do the job required and are there on time everything will be fine.
good,"Great place to work, Company is restructuring.  I am receiving a severance package on 12/28/18 after working here for 26 years.   44K employees being offered Early Buyout options."
good,I really enjoyed my job at verizon. Got to learn alot about phones and tech that i didnt know. My manager at GOWireless was pretty awesome!! They sent me to training so i could learn things that i didnt know and how to use their computer system.
good,"Pay was good, but benefits were exceptionally good! I was working for another company who was purchased by Verizon. I was concerned about what working for Verizon would be like, but Verizon's been good to me."
good,Verizon was a great place to work.  The personal are all professionals that know their jobs.  Was an easy place to work with many opportunities for advancement.
good,"A very ""get job done"" culture.   A lot of good people to work with.  Very little red tape and you must be a self starter.  Every group is different, but I have been lucky to good bosses."
good,"great benefits, fun atmosphere, good work life balance, Had great training so you were ready to work the floor. had a gym and cafeteria, generous time off and sick time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Although Verizon is a great company to work for, the expectation for Client Service Associates to sell product puts too much stress on producing high inventory numbers and less emphasis on providing quality customer care."
good,"Experienced Senior Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. Skilled in System Deployment, Software Installation, Network Design, Networking, and Technical Writing. Strong information technology professional with a B.M.E. focused in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Great place to work, in my experience"
good,"Verizon was a great place to work. They paid well and treated their employees as a asset, They respected your opinion and offered many chances to advance."
good,"Good place to enhance customer service skills. Customer focus is king at this company. Change is also constant. For career advancement, networking will provide the best opportunities."
good,"The company buts a premium on training in technical, sales  and customer service areas. The company compensation was salary plus commission . Pay structure focused on complete sales approach."
good,"The position was enjoyable, and management was exceptional. There was always an upbeat atmosphere in the office as well out in the field. the marketplace in South Florida is uber energetic. Management made it that much better."
good,Verizon is by far a excellent company to work for. Great work ethic group and wonderful job benefits to help support employee and family. Ability to promote at a rapid pace.
good,Every day was different because people are never in the exact same mood. I learned very quickly to focus on my best work. That kept me away from many distractions and raised my performance level. My manager was the best. He trusted his employees to figure things out and he gave us room to grow. The toughest part watching someone who had been sitting in the back all day get a 5-New Line customer. The most enjoyable part was consistently being on the sales leaderboard.
good,"It was love hate with CSOKI.. I was immature at the time but they're a Good Employer to have, and the culture is hard to beat.. It's pretty close to the same likes of Apple, and Alphabet inc... Not quite there yet but pretty close, and at the pace they're going they're going be there real soon.. "
good,Easy to do but not interesting and few opportunities to move up as all 'senior' positions get back filled with regular analysts. So there is little to no upward mobility.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for and its compensation package is very attractive.  It is a face-paced environment that is constantly finding ways to evolve and reinvent themselves. Dependent on your skills there is several opportunities for advancement.
good,"I would recommend working for Verizon Wireless. There is a lot of turnover and being a Customer Service Rep in the call center is not for everyone. Everything that is completed on calls can be seen and heard for management. Management works closely with all reps to insure they understand their role and how they can improve. It can be very stressful but also a very rewarding place to work. In my opinion, the best thing about working at Verizon are the other employees!"
good,"every store was a little different, but the key to success was down time management. It's a sales  position so you have to be able to turn it on when the customers come in."
good,"It is a good company to work for, however, it may not grow at the pace with which other companies are growing.  Sometimes it may feel like you're a small entity within a large organization, but that's normal."
good,Verizon will kill you with their benefits. They are even generous when they let you go through redundancies. But they may not be the best place to work or the best salary around.
good,"Worked closely with management and technicians.  Team orientated."
good,"VZW was, in my opinion, a great place to work. But, it's not for everybody. You will get customers that are upset and occasionally derogatory. The call center was closed in Mankato after I left but I guess people had to qualify to work at home."
good,Verizon is an fast paced organization that has allow develop professional and personally over the last 14.5 years. Wonder working environment where peers are more like family. Best part of my job was creating and fostering relationships.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Very good culture with work / life balance. Learned a great deal about telecommunications and technology. Management team is focused and goal oriented.
good,"Be more understanding in terms of sick leave, and also have more meetings as a company not just as a team. Make workers feel appreciated. That  is all."
good,Verizon is a great place to work. They have awesome training and second to none benefits however you work for what you get and they are constantly cutting positions as retail is overpowered by digital. Dealing with the general public and the constant demands and metrics you have to hit from managent can be extremely stressful but once you learn the culture you either learn how to deal with it or it breaks you.
good,Very competitive between sales associates. Everything is based on numbers they want you to meet for products and services sold. They provide many tools to help you learn as much as possible about everything your doing and selling.
good,"The hardest part of this job was the customer. The most demanding job I have ever worked. On the flip side, the money and benefits were outstanding. Sitting in front of a computer monitor taking upwards of 1000 calls in a shift."
good,"Very nice environment to work with. They respected my experience. "
good,This a heavy driven sales environment. It isn’t too pushy but you have to hit numbers to be in good graces. A lot of your money is based off your commissions anyways. The benefits are great. They start the day you start.
good,"Verizon works hard to make sure the right people are in the right job. Management works hard to make sure you have the skills to succeed in the business. The company will change focus quickly when it is needed, keeping it's success moving forward.  It's a fast paced work environment and learned a lot about how to keep successful.  Does a good job of promoting within and offers tuition assistance so you can further your education. Highly recommend this company."
good,"to solve customers’ issues by being creative to provide a resolution and display analytical skills, help them how to order phones, technical support issues."
good,I technically worked for Victra which is an authorized retailer for Verizon at one of their corporate offices and besides the fact that it can be stressful at times I stayed mostly for the nice work environment and the great people as well.
good,The company overall standards are really great. The Managers are very supportive. The job in India is a little less competitive than in US but the employee find a way to engage them in activities.
good,I spent the majority of my work experience with Verizon and enjoyed my time with the company. I spent the majority of my time there in support of Data Center operations and would go back into that function if opportunity arises.
good,"great culture and staff has positive attitude. Fun environment to work. The company provide you with great training, benefits, Job culture is very nice, and job security is fair because there is always a threat of layoffs coming."
good,"A typical day at work is based on start time. If you open the store you have morning huddles, check previous day numbers and set the tone for the day to be successful. If the closing manager, feed off of or improve store energy. Have a quick huddle with the opening manager to get caught up on how the morning sales and goals. The hardest part of the job is the last and first day of the month. You work hard to hit your number for it to start all over the next day. It is also the most exciting part of the job as well. The team you build make the day enjoyable."
good,Verizon is a wonderful company who compensates their employees very well. Must know how to multitask as well as be able to handle mental abuse from upset customers.
good,"Good company to start career. Manager was very helpful and mentored junior developers. "
good,Overall good place to work. Atmosphere was ok. But the main thing was being allowed to help customers get the products they needed while at the same time earning a great salary
good,I worked directly with engineers and they were always pleasant and helpful. There was good social interaction on occasion. I enjoyed helping the engineers accomplish their tasks regarding equipment old and new that was sent out to Commercial offices and Huts.
good,Working at Verizon Wireless provided me with the opportunity to obtain my MBA without having to take out student loans. The call center experience was not for me but the company overall was amazing.
good,"The job is good because you get payed based on how much you put into it, there is a lot of standing around and sometimes you don't make as much as you would hope, but overall it is a great work experience."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I would love to be workiing for verizon. Great coworkers and management, very knoledgeable and resourceful. if I had the opportunity i would definitely return."
good,"Great place to work , keeping you updated with the latest technology. Great benefits, perks and commission. I was a single mother and it just wasn’t convenient and easy for me to work retail hours with a 6 month old baby . Driving 45 minutes one way to work."
good,"productive and fun work place, your on the phone with customers and providing excellent customer service, Verizon would provide fun days for employees, with free meals, prizes, games, and awards. The environment was very work friendly."
good,"great benefits, leadership development and sale incentives."
good,"Verizon's employee culture is first class, management prepares you to be successful everyday highlighting areas of focus and guiding you to elite execution. Most enjoyable part of the day is working with new and interesting customers everyday, the hardest part of the job is independently keeping up with multitude of tasks that ensure Verizons brand remain at the top. Typical day at work involves a shift starting huddle, followed by customer follow up time and working one on one with customers to create a total solution that works for all parties involved."
good,I often found myself working overtime each week helping guests and attaining quotas. Compensation was great and I had a supportive management team. Days off were scattered throughout the week but overall it was a great place to work and meet new people.
good,I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot about sales. It was a very easy job and great pay for little work. There is a ton of room fro growth and within a few months I was promoted to Assistant Manager
good,"I enjoyed assisting customers both internal and external, building relationships, and networking within the company. I assisted customers on a daily basis via email correspondence and telephone communications, as well as found root causes to issues and concerns brought to the leadership of Verizon Wireless."
good,Great benefit and overall job. Great place to learn management. Very time consuming company. Culture is good if management is good.  Great starter job
good,Verizon was full of great people to work with who made the job worth while. We had a ping pong table in the break room that really became useful as a stress reliever during breaks and lunches. Hardest part of the job was to deal with upset/angry customers call after call but the most enjoyable part of the job was when you were able to solve a customers problem and turn their attitude around.
good,In the business dept calls can be slow or back to back just depends on the day. Great management for the most part. Great perks for just being an employee and also for performing well.
good,"Since technology is always changing, you must be constantly on your toes at this job. New products and new plans will launch a few times a month. On top of that, the current/older products/services are constantly being updated. To be successful, you must be very adaptable to sudden change and learn new things quickly."
good,"Verizon takes care of its employees not the biggest pay master but the opportunities to grow within the company is endless and depends on your potential and network within the company."
good,Its a good company to work for the culture is typically good unless there is pressure from the higher ups to shift results which can be a headache so it has its ups and downs like any company.
good,"I learned the value of building a rapport with your customers. I was able to solve wireless solutions to allow me to build sales for the store. The fast pace of the store was my biggest challenge at the store at first. The new information was a lot to take in, but once I got in tune with the flow of things I was able to efficiently control the flow of the store. I helped me improve my multi tasking skills."
good,"I learned a lot starting out in my career, I would recommend them as a great place to start, but staying too long can be a problem.  For me at the end outsourcing and layoffs were constant."
good,"Its the best company for female employees . WFh and vacations are inexplicably good."
good,"THIS IS A SALES JOB!!!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a leader in the industry and works to support their customers.  Most leaders have an open door policy and will make time to mentor and educate you on the business.  Verizon is very diverse and offers may webcast supporting various cultures/lifestyles.  Great benefits.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for with a lot of room to grow and develop. The company DOES have a hard time aligning the individual districts and the district managers can be a little controlling with their GM's and don't give room for creative control. At the end of the day it is a sales and performance based career, so you get paid accordingly. I have easily seen reps making over 75k a year and it is a strong possibility. The benefits are hard to match anywhere else, but because it's retail it's not the greatest fit for parents looking to establish a work/home balance. There are many corporate positions that you can be promoted into, but the pay will be a significant cut from a rep role."
good,"Verizon offers great compensation for your position and your time. The benefits are great. It is a very high stress working environment, but they do offer fun activities for you and your family."
good,"Good place to work, although I only spent 20 years there.   Pay was good, management fair.  Hard to see the companies direction, and it seems they are always making changes with departments, moving parts over seas.   Its good to know when to leave."
good,"Verizon Wireless was a good place to work as far as compansation and benefits.  The wireless industry is very competative.  If the managment team is supportive and proactive, then it is a great place to work."
good,Hard work pays off.  Great company with many opportunities for advancment.  Company is focused on employee development and leadership growth.  Very retail orieinted and beginning to improve in the enterprise space globally.
good,"VZW invests in its employees by providing a healthy financial allotment for education, as well as competitive benefits and great work/life balance. VZW is a fast paced and ever changing workplace, that has a strong company culture, that is based on integrity and proudly provides a superior product."
good,"verizon is a union job so job security is high but it is still a sales based job. You dont get commision but your team lead gets paid based on how well you sale. Which in turns makes them ride you alot. Hours are based on how has been there the longest, starting off youll mostlikley work 1-9 so get use to it."
good,"My daily tasks include managing a retail store, developing, coaching and creating a culture that is positive and performance driven. I measure customer experience daily, manage inventory levels, ship and receive and handle discrepancies. Creating a positive atmosphere, for customers and employees is the main priority. As a leader in the business, staying involved by listening and anticipating customer needs, resolving concerns and driving profitability."
good,Enjoyed my many jobs i did had with Verizon.  They have a really good training department and train employees to have the knowledge to do their jobs and they continue to train.
good,"Got a nice landing spot to work in USA.  Good work ethics , work atmosphere was very nice.  Learned new technologies , got very good support and encouragement from fellow team members and other teams."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, very seldom did we have downtime.  Normally people are buzzing like bees on the phones."
good,"Great company to work for, the pace was extremely fast, and change was constant. Some days were light, others required 10-12 hours just to keep up. The only down side was having to deal with the unions."
good,You are surrounded by peers alike that help you achieve daily goals. Management listens to you and takes time to teach sales reps. You get what you work for.
good,Help 2 positions with the company at 2 locations. One was sales rep the other was as manager. Enjoyed both jobs as well as the people that I worked with.
good,Verizon is a great place to work if you can handle working under deadlines and handle the stress of high call volume call center. The company offers matching 401k.
good,"The culture at Verizon is very relax and fast paced. We can take anywhere from 25-40 calls. The call vary from equipment orders to customer billing questions. The reps help each other out with difficult questions, also while using our internal resources."
good,"I worked at Verizon for a few years.  The pay was OUTSTANDING, as were the benefits!  This was a fun place to work.  Don’t get me wrong!  There are clear goals to meet and no excuses’ for not reaching them.  It can be stressful climate with a company culture of always sell them more; however, management is always there to help and sometimes scold."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great place, my manager is amazing! You can definitely grow in this company. You definitely have to give in your full effort. How much you make us truly up to you!"
good,"Complete any work task from day before. Learning new job skills and working with our technician(s) in dispatching them to customers home or business. Assisting the customer(s) restoring their services.The culture was of all ages, male/female, etc. Interacting with my co-worker as a team player and on break was good."
good,"Great environment and culture "
good,Being in a call center was not my position of choice.  Work schedule could vary depending on seniority and hours of work varied as well based on seniority.
good,"Great job to gain technical on job training. Excellent training. Great job advancement. Great salary. Great benefits. Great tuition assistance program. "
good,"I only left because of a buyout of land lines in my state. I liked working there and have applied for a position there again, just haven't heard back from them yet"
good,"Verizon Wireless is a good company to work. It maintains a work life balance which is a plus. Management is good. Alongside, its not very stressful workplace."
good,"Lots of opportunity to test one's virtues.  Competition for sales, micromanaged monitoring, expected to sell $200 /month telephone/internet/video packages to people who can't afford to purchase a steak once a month was horrible.  Some people were great, bosses said ""don't assume they don't have money, don't not spend their money"". I got deathly sick, my conscious got the best of me, others kicked butt.  The incentives were good, the management was supportive, but don't ever not offer to put people in debt."
good,"Not enough benefits for Employees. Other companies offer phones or solid discounts on service fees, but here at Verizon, it isn't very good. Work life is pretty hard, but overall fairly manageable. Verizon is really expensive, but you do get the best service."
good,"i only left because of family health issues. My boss was awesome and very supportive, fun environment great benefits. customers can be tough to deal with but the pay is great."
good,Repair and collect money from payphones on a route each day.  Having the ability to move around through town and plan sales on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was planning a area of work in a 75 mile radius.  Best part of it was having weekends off and winding down on Friday afternoons.
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. "
good,"The corporate enviroment changed and caused alot issues with people and the work loads , the managment made the job very hard , and a person like me that had 10 years invested it was a hard pill to take"
good,"Verizon is a large and successful company because of the employees and unions. I worked in a call center taking inbound calls from customers who had questions on  their bills, wanted new service or make changes to their existing service.  The position gradually become sales focused rather than focusing on customer need."
good,"I liked working there it’s a good job great benefits , work life balance is pretty good . They pay for schooling i enjoyed this place of business honestly ."
good,"Typical day will be coming to work, talk about daily goals and start taking calls. Some calls were longer, some calls were shorter. But your managers are always there to help you on a hard call."
good,Great company with amazing benefits. Excellent sales model and training. Would highly recommend this company to anyone that was strong in sales or just starting out.
good,Hard work but good pay.  Not a bad place to work at and good pay as well!!!  Lots of locations to work at. You can do lateral or vertical moves as well.
good,"verizon was the whole package. cost of living increase every couple years, stock options, when making sales could accumulate points to which can be cashed in for merchandise.  if you were really good in sales could cash in points for cruises, name brand apparel and bags, exercise equipment.  i cashed in my points for a D&B purse and an elliptical trainer among many other things"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The work environment is very demanding and fast-paced, you have to deal with a lot of upset people. But overall the benefits of working there far exceed the negative aspects."
good,"Working at Verizon is a lifelong experience. When you start"
good,Verizon is a world class company with top notch services.  This comes from a deep rooted culture of excellence.  In my opinion they are good paying company with good benefits and a good employee culture.They are able to retain top quality employees because of these factor.
good,You may get laid off. You have to be able to sell. And if you are a manager your employees own you because HR will not let you discipline them nor will they allow you to coach employees to be properly coach due to fear of the union.
good,"Verizon is a very stable and rewarding place to work.  The product mix on the wireline side is excellent, allowing the account team to talk with customers about anything related to technology needs.  Compensation is very good and opportunities to move around within the company are excellent."
good,It's a great place to work if don't have to commute and are forced to take the company package if you department is not making the quota in your district (what one does/ does not effects all)  Supervisors are helpful once you get to know them for yourself  Managers come and go some confrontational District managers come through  seldom only if office is not making their quotas  Weekends are fun if you like working nights  I enjoyed it until it became where transportation went out and had to commute by train early hours and late hours
good,"The job is really hard but the benefits are fantastic and the management team is very driven to help you succeed. The culture is really great, but they do require a lot of you in order to be deemed 'performing well"""
good,"The sales environment used to feel like a team but with pay structure changed it has become less like that. The management is great, very open door policy. The benefits are really good, including tuition benefits that they will pay upfront."
good,"If you worked hard there were many contests for trips, prizes, game tickets,etc. Kept the job exciting, and kept employees on their toes. Pay was good but one had the chance to earn even more w/ commission. Enjoyed it very much."
good,Work Place Culture is amazing and the way they make sure your work life balance is in order is amazing as well they give you paid time off when you have a newborn as well.
good,"The money is great, but after a few years, the stress weighs heavy. I loved my job but the ongoing requirements were a bit much to juggle. It was a great place to work ""overall"" I stayed mostly because of the pay, but it gets the bills paid."
good,"I enjoyed working at Verizon for the most part. You have to be patient with customers and always look for an opportunity to sell. "
good,"Fantastic company to work for, great investment in your future and job training, great abilities for advancement within the company for strong motivated individuals.  Lots of customer service and mid pressure sales wanted"
good,"Normal hours would be 40 hr wk"
good,"8-10 hours based on vendor deadlines/demands"
good,Verizon is great place to work. Quick-paced and very challenging. The salary are competitive and one of the best in the market. There are lots of room for career growth. Highly recommended.
good,"Working at Verizon you would have to understand the best network requires the best of everything. Starting with the People, the customer service, and the customers. Once your on board they offer a month of realistic hands on training. The management team  always sets the employees up for success while creating a team culture. Its an experience of a life time and enjoyed my time working for the company."
good,"Our team culture and management was very collaborative and supportive. We had regular team challenges to collaborate / sharpen our analytical skills and have fun! "
good,I loved working at Verizon Wireless corporate. Though the hours can be a bit overwhelming (exp in holiday season)  it was an overall excellent experience. I am currently needing a better result for us relocating to the Tampa Bay area and it is very difficult to transfer when there are limited positions open. I am hoping to keep this option as an open door in the future.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The experience I had was only cut short due to the hour and a half commute to and from Verizon Wireless in Dublin, Ohio. I would still be working here if it had not been for the cutting into my family life."
good,"Working for Verizon was busy and stressful at times.  However, worked with a great bunch of people who made the day a little bit better.  Verizon does change policies quite frequently, but their training is top notch when it comes to learning about new policies and /or procedures."
good,The listing to your phone calls with the customer and being corrected was very stressful.  Benefits were great.  Training was great.  Was given a lot of tools to make you successful.
good,Importance given to work life balance and also diversity. Learnt to coordinate work with onshore & offshore. Establishing internet access related Lab was a challenge as there were too many security related concerns.
good,"I love this place, I just wish that there were a way to make this job less stressful. They offer amazing benefits, but let me tell you, you do pay for it in the long-run with constant abuse from customers over the phone to management at times brushing off you or your concerns."
good,I loved working Verizon. Unfortunately the company down sized and I was unable to relocate. If I had the opportunity to work for the company again in my future. I definitely would.
good,"At Verizon I learned that working with customers and working on the phone was something that I excelled at. I started that job with a serious lack of confidence because I had not found anything that I felt like I was good at or that I lived up to my potential with. But after really applying myself and longing to better myself, 4 years later, I had received awards, been promoted and given multiple raises. "
good,Great company to work for the benefits even cover family members and having a very much reduced cell phone bill is great. depends on the location but most of management is in direct contact with you weekly.
good,This is a great company. There is nothing negative to say about Verizon. I learned a great deal concerning the telecommunication industry. I was a contractor for almost 2 years.
good,"I learned a lot from many different levels of management on how to better my sales, Verizon teaches you to become a better person not only inside of work but also outside by giving u skills that work and many different levels of life"
good,"Typical day at work, benefits are great. Culture continues to to increase with positive member. If the company has a party, there are many activities to enjoy"
good,"A great place to work! Great team members, management and the ability to display your skills are all reasons that make VZW a solid employer. The teamwork, training and opportunity for advancement are all available for you if you have a good work ethic."
good,"The culture changed over the years. Started off with a focus on employees, then focuses on customer experience and by the time I left it seemed like the focus was on the bottom line."
good,Great company to work with acquiring new and emerging technologies while positioning the company as an industry leader with its network quality and innovation
good,"I can earn money while traveling and meet many people, I have great time ! Wonderful people. Very caring and promoted work vs life balance. Very generous at the holidays."
good,"excellent company to work for."
good,"- Fast paced environment open to out of the box thinking to resolve issues. "
good,In my experience every manager I had cared fro me and my advancement. With regular meetings weekly you always knew where you stood and how you where doing compared to your teammates and to other agents across the company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I have worked for Verizon for many years. They offer the best benefits in the business. Verizon has always been good to me. Career advancement does not always mean better pay. The opportunity to grow is available to those willing to move around. It's a big company. If you have to desire and drive to move and grow within a great company, Verizon has a place for you. Commission sales jobs have gotten more difficult to make a lot of money in as the years have passed."
good,"I have had a great time at Verizon especially because I had the opportunity to work in a variety of software, had a great team to work with and have had a lot of fun working here."
good,"uncover customer wants and needs"
good,"A typical workday at Verizon can be as challenging, or easy as you make it. Day-to-day work is easy, but if you want to grow in the company there are opportunities to take on projects that will challenge you. With a company this large, you can feel separated from the company as a whole, which makes the company culture a little less exciting. However there are more opportunities for growth within the company due to it's size. Further, they offer resources for professional development and tuition assistance if you want to take classes while you work. It's a good company to start your career with and if you find you enjoy telecommunications, it can be a good place to settle."
good,"I would still be there if I didn't have to re locate drive was to far."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for.  There are multiple opportunities to advance your career.  There is also option to further your education via the tuition reimbursement program
good,The company offers managerial advancement opportunities in different areas. Benefits are offered giving the employee to share in responsibility of securing their future  retirement and medical benefits
good,I had many opportunities to excel at Verizon.  By consistency exceed my job expectation I was able to rise from a Manager of Finance to Vice President of Marketing and Sales.
good,The benefits are really good and for the most part the people are great. Verizon allows for tuition reimbursement and training. Management is good they pay well
good,"Good company to work for, if you are good at sales you make good money. It is commission based, the more you sell the more you make. Hours can be long sometimes and are required to work many weekends."
good,Verizon was an excellent company to make a career with.  I was able to learn many different things about the telecommunications business.  The pay and benefits were excellent.  Management changed drastically and the focus of the company over the years became more about the numbers instead of customer care which was very disheartening.
good,you are a hunter. pay includes base salary plus commission. management is hit or miss like any other job. There are really good managers and really bad ones. The enjoyable part of the job is having freedom of what you do but having to balance what you do and keeping on track
good,"I worked for VZW for 12 years and was very happy with the company.  Face paced, compensation was good, felt valued by the company, great benefits. I had no plans of leaving but my position was moved out of state and I was not in a position to relocate."
good,"Great place to work as the employees are treated with respect and are provided with abundant Education Assistance for upskilling. I've learned so much about diversity in workplace, team building, cross functional supervision etc."
good,"VZW was a great company to work for.  I was on the Network side of the company (behind the scenes) and it was a very fast paced environment to work in.  Everyone that works there has to have the ability to multitask and prioritize their daily tasks with minimal supervision, but be able to produce results. Every manager I worked for during my duration with the company was very supportive and willing to listen.  My peers were fun to be around and my primary office felt like a home away from home.  The hardest part about the job was the work load.  Many times I felt like ""one step forward, two steps back"" with the amount of work that needed to be accomplished, but we always got it done.  The most enjoyable parts of the job were the free trainings that were accompanied by free lunches, the people I worked with, and the fact that I was not micromanaged."
good,"If you aren't stressed by customer service work, Verizon is a great place to work. I found the pay and benefits to be far beyond what is generally out there for customer service work."
good,A job a Verizon wireless is a great launch pad if you are willing to sacrifice some of your work life balance. The pay is great but at the end of the day the work is still retail
good,"Career oriented work environment with great opportunities for skills and educational development. "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Challenging work environment with current and new technology to learn about. Everyone is willing to help to complete a project. Teams were always great to get along with. Everyone had common goals. Never a dull day.
good,"Verizon was a solid company with lots of benefits contiunous training, advancement in the company. and a open door policy to management and human resources. Hours were not flexible. no team participation. and there were strict guidelines in company advancement."
good,"VZW is a great company to work for. You are valued as an employee and your ideas count. The quotas are very aggressive but as long as you keep up with your clients, the quota is manageable."
good,not a bad thing to say about this company. they give everyone a far chance to succeed in this company and marketplace. my family was able to accomplish so much because of the opportunity provided by this company. if this new location had verizon i would quickly sign up for employment
good,Verizon is a GREAT company to work for. Excellent benefits and the pay is impressive. Nice bonus EVERY year. Work Life Balance could be better. Managers could have more training.
good,"For many years the business was growing, however, in the past few years, workforce reductions had become commonplace.  I enjoyed my fast paced job mainly because it was ever changing"
good,"I liked the area very much, good weather, people are friendly."
good,Great for young adult in college. you have to be flexible with the schedule. great place to work if you work well under pressure and you have to be willing to adapt to change.
good,"Good work life balance, professional managers and excellent coworkers. Work is not stressful, a lot of online training and office is well equipped with updated technology."
good,"Loved the work."
good,Learned great customer service skills. Open door management. Face-to-face customer interaction to solve a variety of customer needs. Team environment.
good,"Great training and mentorship program, support by upper level management. Compensations for hard work is merited throughout the organization. Would recommend to anyone trying to get into sales"
good,"Managed inbound sales inquiries relating to products and promotions for telecommunication services for local business customers, quickly establishing relationships and rapport over the phone. Handling account queues ranging from 20 - 30 accounts daily. Hardest part of job was the vast amount of technical information I needed to learn to be  fully knowledgeable of all products and services. Best part of job was coworkers, and theteam effort to get the work done with so many different aspects of the jobs."
good,"Nice place to work and grow . Nice team environment, good location.  Lots of culture to learn from and meet new friends.  Hours are fixed and not too much over time"
good,"great pay, great benefits. must work hard company does not tolerate lazy employees you will not last long very demanding be willing to give 100% commitment and follow through you will succeed at vzw."
good,Always room for improvement. Great company to work for with the right management team. Family like culture within the stores. You will love the new gadgets and plans that vzw builds excitement around
good,"Verizon was a decent place to work, although changes to the work process were constant and hard to get use to.  The paid is excellent and the benefits made working there easy."
good,This is the perfect job for people who love to talk all day.  The hardest part is the difficult customers. I have learned so much about customer service. Overall a fantastic place to work.
good,"Verizon is a great company overall to work for, excellent compensation as well as benefits. The workplace culture had great improvement. Sometimes calls could get overwhelming however, the good definitely outweighed the bad."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Use to be a great company to work for.  Recent changes are not a direct reflection of the company's history.  Overall, great place to work and lean.  Thumbs up!!"
good,I really had a privilege to work in two projects as an intern one in data science and other in product management. Its really a learning experience for me.
good,"Verizon Wireless believes in full and complete training whether it's in the call center environment or retail store locations. Also whether it's customer facing or behind the scenes. "
good,This was the best job experience I ever had.  The job was stressful but you had to be a quick thinker and utilize your skills.  There was never a dull moment but the hours were long.
good,"Verizon was a corporation that incorporated workplace culture, communicated the state of the business to all their employees, allowed for growth, and advancement in addition to perks such as education and benefits, putting their employees and customers first, always."
good,"Always had a monthly calendar of events that was happening at the center. Everyone was a close family and even after the center closed, everyone stays close. Only down side was their downsizing. Work place in Bangor Maine closed"
good,Its really amazing working as an intern with Verizon Wireless. I loved every minute of it. Really a great place to work and gain knowledge. I love the team and environment. I wish i could get more time to work.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. The benefits as a union member was excellent. Occassionally, go for training at different locations, learning. You constantly learning (hands-on) training from experienced worked. Constantly learning of the latest technology and applying it away. You move learning at different facilities from old to new equipment. You meet diverse people from all over the country and find out about their cities experiences."
good,"job safety"
good,Good but not great place to work. pay and benefits are good but management is very clickish. if you are looking to advance you have to be buddy buddy with management
good,"Verizon provides a very employee friendly work environment. The company truly focused on the customer needs, employee moral, and reaching targeted team goals."
good,Great place  to work for but being on phones too long need a change in pace dress down attire 401k plan excellent bonus every year wonderful.  Benefits are ecellent.
good,A typical day would be receiving in bound calls.  I learned that customers are always right. Management was great. The work culture was great.  The hardest part of this job was still not working for them. The most enjoyable part of this job is all benefits &the bonuses that we received yearly
good,Absolutely enjoyed every moment working for Verizon. My leadership development was driven and supported by Verizon and I am forever grateful for the experience they provided. The positive atmosphere that is supported by the sales and management team made it easy to come in to work daily. I was very fortunate to be part of their wonderful management team. The hardest part of Verizon was being impacted by the purchase from Frontier and not having an option to stay with Verizon. The sales recognition and trips will always be missed but never forgotten.
good,"You will be micro-managed and you will hate life sometimes, but the money and great benefits almost make up for it. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement if you do well though."
good,There's no benefits or payed holidays. But a good place to work. Everyone is  enthusiastic and willing to help each other out. We all work together as a team for the most part to try to satisfy the  customers needs
good,This is a great company to work for. The compensation is unmatched and the people you will work with are a joy. It is a demanding company but if you put in the work you will see the rewards.
good,We work as Agile methodology which requires quick turn over everything. So everyone in the team has to work very hard everyday and sometime weekend in order to make commitments.
good,"Verizon is a great place to work which provides all the needed infrastructure for a career growth and productive work."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Learned alot and interacted with many great people. Overall Verizon was a great experience. If given the opportunity, I would work for them again. I experienced a great work enviornment as well as culture."
good,Verizon promotes Innovation and Learning. A wonderful team culture and helpful colleagues is the key strength of Verizon. Agility in thoughts and actions helps it to deliver some good products to the customer.
good,This was a pretty great place to work as they are pretty accommodating. The benefits are amazing and the wages were surprisingly good. However their decision to get rid of every retail support specialist to save money was not their greatest. It is a high stress environment and they do push their reps hard to sell.
good,Verizon has allowed me to develop a career path from from being a call center tech support agent to a SQL developer allowing me the time to learn new technologies.
good,It is a fast paced and very demanding job. Great benefits. The job changes with the competitive cell phone culture. Changes can be stressful. Training is not always provided for new products.
good,"Great place to work, management is awesome, you get to interact with customers daily helping them save money on their bill, upgrading them to the newest and latest devices."
good,Verizon has been one of the best company that I have ever worked for. Flexible scheduling. Amazing atmosphere with my coworkers. Micro managed at times but overall I've had an awesome journey.
good,"I worked for Verizon a little over 5 years.  It started out amazing.  The benefits are the best I have ever seen and they truly take care of their employees.  Due to a shift in upper management the company has turned from a fun environment to a lot of micro management and cold calls soliciting business.  In the last 12 months Verizon has seen a lot of long term employees leaving for a more friendly work environment.,"
good,"One of the hardest parts of the job, is that it is constantly changing. Technology is the way of the future and everyday there is something new and exciting coming out."
good,Love working for the company.  Great hours and also flexible work schedules.  Management was always willing to help out with training.  Great union with the company that provides great benefits.
good,"All great and smart people here, just everything is overly micro managed that made most employees miserable. Verizon made billions $$$ in profits yearly. So the top 12 big wig executive employees received anywhere between $4-$15 million in bonus money each and every year. Also, all the managers through out Verizon received bonuses. The union workers did not get bonuses. Verizon fought union workers to give us less benefits and no raises every contract. In stead of just sharing the wealth that they all had above us. In my eyes, not a very healthy way of business. To show no appreciation for the employees that do all the grunt work keeping the cash cow running (selfish or greedy)!"
good,Good company to work for. Company looks for the best employees and keeps them at the top of their game by offering many training and certifications to help their careers.
good,"My first job was to handle any inbound calls for sales needs. Clients would call to upgrade of set up new service, and based on lifestyle and needs we would suggest the best phone.Second obligation was to retain any customers looking to cancel using company save tools. There maybe many reasons why a client may cancel but most of the time its not the reason they give you. Through discovery questions we will determine what the client needs to prevent loosing a client."

good,"I've enjoyed working in a place where your leadership values you, but keeps pushing you to get better and improve. The culture has improved, dedicating more time to providing recognition rather than always making everything a competition. The industry is changing though, so the restructuring has flattened out the company structure and made it a little harder to move upwards."
good,"As a sales representative for Verizon Wireless, there's plenty of room to make good money if you've got a good hold on consumer sales.  The stress of meeting the goals set by the company can be daunting depending on how much traffic each location gets, but exceeding that goal pays out heavily, making it all worth it."

Enjoyable part of job was getting to talk to so many different people in a day business owners to regular families that would come in.

Hardest part of job was teaching those who were completely un-techsavy and dealing with phone service issues with angry customers."
good,"By far the best thing to ever happen to my life. id still be with this company if it wasn't for the brutal scheduling. from top to bottom, Verizon is a well rounded company where if you are working correctly, you will flourish and make a lot of money."
good,"Enjoyed working here, they were encouraging for your performance Verizon.  You take two chats at one time so you are helping two customers at once and can be hard to give them both equal amounts of attention."

Due to market trends and competition, change is inevitable and frequent.  Knowledge of the internal support systems is crucial, because processes, rules, and regulations change often."
good,"• Provided growth in both revenue and customer base while also making efforts in reducing churn."
good,"Since it is a retail store, you can expect to work typical retail hours (anywhere from 9:30 am - 9 pm depending on location).  Working at an authorized retailer of Verizon Wireless teaches you a lot about working in customer service, as making sure the customers you interact with leave your location satisfied.  The management team is well-versed in the wireless industry, and you can learn a lot from them if you're willing to.

Overall though a very good company to work for."
good,"Ever day was very fast paced and required me to be able to multitask. I learned everyday at Verizon since it was a technology company it was constant change, new products, services, systems procedures etc. I worked well with management and co-workers. The hardest part was sometimes was making sure I got my own work done for the day, but still making sure I always spent the quality time to coach and assist my team to keep them pumped up and always focused on our goals. Helping our customers get issues resolved, hearing a thank you and knowing that I made a difference . Seeing my reps face when they made their monthly quota."

This company is a large contributor to society through community efforts.  In my position I was able to work with people in various parts of the country and abroad managing the forecast and projections for Global accounts.  The best part of my role is being able to telecommute and provide financial visibility to my Managing Directors and Business Partners so that informed decisions could be made while adhering to strict deadlines.  Being able to forecast and project and maintain less than 1% variance.  The disadvantage is going through numerous reorganizations.

good,"Verizon was a pleasant work environment and I really enjoyed working with my peers and my manager was awesome! Workload kept up busy due to deadlines but always manageable. Working in a team environment and the flexibility was always a plus. However, as the company started to restructure and move our positions to another state the environment became a little stressful.

Work closely with other departments as needed to solve any issues that were beyond my  required description."

However, there is constant corporate change at a much higher level, generally on a two year cycle in terms of company restructuring, and this constant change tends to disrupt work efficiency in terms of repairs or other changes which affects our customers.  This is the tech industry and change is constant and cannot be avoided, but better planning & coordination in the implementation of those changes would lessen the disruption placed on staff and would result in continued good customer relations."

good,"Calls would come in, we ans, ask customer about problems with phone. Look up account and verify address, name. Make note in reference to how problem was solved. End call with the statement of Insurance. Learned that each customer is different, with different needs. Most of all listen to the custom and you understand their personal needs better.

They pay for performance which was very nice. The harder your work the more you make. Management has a very open door approach.  No Union.   Hardest part of the job was needing more complete training  when new systems launched.  Service levels often did not allow time off the phones in order to be trained and  learn about changes.   We used our online resources to get answers to information we needed  to know about.   The most enjoyable part of the job was helping so many people with many different issues.  I felt a sense of gratification every day I worked. Internally coworkers called it Verizon ""Change"" Wireless.  For almost 14 years I enjoyed taking advantage of  the opportunities  to build my  knowledge  and gained multiple transferrable skills in the process.  Customer Service representative were often served  food and drink at our desks to enjoy .  We had games like Bingo to win prizes.  401k plan match up to 6%.  Immediate health coverage.  Strayer College on campus to further education within the same location.  Adoption assistance.  We received recognition often on our performance these are all reasons among others that I wish the Irvine CA call center did not close.  I very much enjoyed working there."
good,"A typical day for me at Verizon Wireless is i wake up get ready, get to the store around 8:50, then i count the cash draw, check inventory, turn on the display phones and lights. The store is then openeed at 9:00 am. After that i wait for customers to come in and either buy phone make a payment or if they have any questions. My manager is my co-worker in this store. The hardest part of my job would have to be making sure i know all the promotions and price's. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure the customer is happy with the outcome of their reasoning for coming in, and to hear how great the service was."
good,"Sale! Sale! Sale! That's all that matters. If you can do that, then everything else comes easy. Full benefits including 401K, tuition assistance, and health benefits for little to nothing. Great work environment. Always changing so you have to keep up with the times if you want to be successful. Hard to balance life and work though because the schedule is so inconsistent."
good,"I enjoy my job with Verizon. The money is great and you have a supportive management team that can guide you and give you their best practices to making great money. Essentially you get out what you out in. The benefits are great and the overtime is even better. It feels good to work for the superior in the cellular industry and be treated just the same, superior."
good,Great place to develop a professional sales career.  You will work long hours.  Getting a promotion is not easy either.  But the good news is lots of folks love working here. There is low turnover.
good,"I've only been working there for a couple of months but I've met some of the most amazing people there, Verizon does a really great job at hiring quality people! However, commission can be tough to hit  depending on your location and the traffic it gets plus the checks aren't all that great once taxes & Verizon's 40% cut takes in effect. Other than that it's enjoyable & the benefits are nothing like anywhere else. Management needs to be more realistic of what people are willing to spend money on & hold off on some of the pressure placed on the reps. If you want a work-life balance then don't bother applying! I work part time & yet my schedule is so sporadic I barely have time to do anything else unless I take time off for it."
good,"I have only worked at Verizon for under two years and I can say that the work may not be challenging at times. Most of the day I deal with navigating through process and finding the right cross-functional teams in order to manage capacity for video systems. Our team is responsible for managing capacity for FIOS. "
good,"I enjoyed the fast paced, every growing technology company. I learned a lot about self growth and improvement. My co-workers could always come to me to close the sale and respected me. The hardest part of the job was the high demand on my personal time."
good,"Developing new and current employees"
good,Prepare you to work all level of business I would meet each morning to prepare for my day and prioritize all urgency need to be completed . Make sure productivity d met 100%
good,"Verizon is an amazing company to work for. It is very fast paced, and evening and weekends are a must. They def compensate you very well for your time and benefits are incredible. My wife is a teacher at a local public school and my insurance and benefits were better than the state's. They only promote from within and will do anything to help you grow in your career. I loved management."
good,While I was at Verizon Wireless I loved it until the sales quota went up and they were asking for insane amounts on new customers and you got penalized if you did not make them or got writeen up.  Hours are long and holiday season is draining .
good,"Excellent company to work for. Complex work content, light work load."
good,"We work shifts, so my tour was from 7am - 7pm and the days varied.  One week it would be M - Th, and then the next would be W - Su, or even Th - W.  All in all great hours and left me with plenty of time for family.  Learned a lot about the various services that Verizon provides.  Co-workers are the best, learned from them, and we helped each other out.  If there is a hardest part to the job, I would have to say going on Bridges to help resolve user issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the days off."
good,"Everyday i encountered a different challenge, which i had to adapt to find solutions.Coworkers were absolutely great and helpful and great team chemistry."
good,Great company to work for. Friendly atmosphere with room to grow.
good,"Verizon Wireless consisted of daily meetings with the management team and representatives as well running daily reports. I worked with different departments as well as six other call centers to make sure representatives were available to take calls from our customers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A typical day at Verizon usually entails a lot of self-motivation to reach daily targeted goals in order to reach monthly quota. Friendly environment for customers as well as co-workers in order to persuade a sale. Hardest part of the job was overcoming objections primarily because of the wait times the customer usually has to wait.
good,"Depending on your branch (sales, service, etc.) work can be all-consumng. However, the benefits and pay are absolutely top notch. Overall, great place."
good,"A typical day at work for me was making the guest happy and feeling welcome. I have learned a lot in the 8 years at this company. I have learned different areas of inventory, sales, technology, and customer service. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance that I had to maintain in the past years."
good,flexible and secure. gym on site and cafe lots of relaxation spots around campus.
good,I'd typically check in at the office and hit the streets or phone to start the cold calling process for that day.  Management was key in finding ways to develop better sales skills.
good,"Downloading work assignments for the day, loading up material at the warehouse in work vehicle, calling ahead to let customer's know I am arriving at a certain time, reviewing what customer is expecting, and performing the work necessary to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,"Being a directory assistance operator for Verizon for the past 10 years truly has its ups and downs. Working here really showed my flexibility and dedication to attendance and accountability for any job I become employed. Being scheduled a 6:00-2:30 shift one day and the next can be scheduled a 10:00-6:30 shift was challenging but well worth the test. I've had 8 yrs of perfect attendance of my 10 years employed here. Management pushes daily for me to meet the company standards but as a caring manager not one that pushes to make them look good, but me the operator. My family received great benefits from medical, dental, vision, life insurance, etc. Really a great company to work and be apart of."
good,Providing excellent service to all our customers while addressing customer complaints.
good,"ETL and BI Testing"
good,"I currently handle a large call volume efficiently.  I handle the customer's issue including cellular devices, bills or the right accessory to fit their needs.  I also work with our local Human resources deptartment to welcome new employees.  I create exciting informational fairs for our internal employees so they are able to benefit from what Verizon Wireless offers.  I am also working with HR to go outside of the center to promote Verizon Wireless and help with the hiring process."
good,Very hectic and stressful at times. Call center environment so many employees...Policies often change and call volume is extremely high always. Great incentives.
good,"Working at Verizon was a fantastic experience. I had an amazing set of co-workers and my managers gave me the freedom and opportunity to grow. Despite dealing with some typical corporate BS, working for Verizon (even as a contractor) was great."
good,"As a b2b rep, a lot depends on the territory.  If you have a lot of prospects, just make the calls, book the meetings, and close the deals."
good,"Established company, great working atmosphere. Fabulous benefits."
good,"They get students out of school cheap...lol"
good,The hardest part of the job is getting business owners to think the way I think and to change their business strategy to be more profitable.
good,"Good people, good money, long commutes.  Advancement was mostly left to if you were given good leads or not. Hardest part of my job was learning how to stop myself from selling to hard."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,Good place to work and enjoy the life. Every day it is good day at work. Enjoy troubleshooting and fixing the problems at customer site.
good,Very fast paced customer service based job. Loved keeping busy and helping others on the down time. Most of management were amazing and so helpful. The hardest part of this job I'd have to say was the communication barrier with those from foreign countries.
good,"Team meeting on some morning; follow-up with customers; take calls to change plans for customers, order equipment and accessories, and resolve billing and technical issues; management makes sure all teams are meeting their numbers and rewards the top teams; co-workers are very friendly and have a willingness to help others; the hardest part of the job is selling accessories; the most enjoyable part of the job is fixing someone's device over the phone."
good,"Definitely a company everybody looks for, all about group effort and helping each other out. You're never alone at this company!"
good,Great job with great benefits and wonderful atmosphere and people!
good,"**Change Energizes Us** Verizon overall is a great company to work for, especially if you are used to a call center environment. I like to refer to Verizon as the ""Lamborghini""  of call centers. Verizon Wireless promotes from within. VZW does not bring anyone from the outside to fill positions which is always great. VZW also is one of the very few employers that still offer yearly bonuses. This bonus is based on performance of course! Verizon starts new employees on day 1 with benefits and the start pay is decent esp. for individuals that does not have a college degree."
good,many duties computer data entries and reviewed customers info merchandising and sles
good,Great place to learn the latest technology in the telecommunications industry.
good,"Verizon Wireless changes from day to day, keeping up with the latest technology to provide their customers with cutting edge technology, efficiency, productivity, and the ability customize their service to cater to their lifestyle."
good,"Great work enviroment, offers top-notch Employee Benefits, The management is fair and consistent with policy and procedures."
good,I really enjoyed my time working here. Unfortunately I had to leave due to personal issues. The management was some of the most entertaining and fun people I have had the pleasure of working with.
good,"Arriving to work, you're greeted with warm smiles and high energy! Co-workers are available throughout the day to provide support, resolutions, and assistance. The technical resources are easily available to assist you with resolving customers issues. Management is just a step a way, if needed, to assist with difficult issues. This is a very exciting, fast paced job that can be a lifelong career for anyone!"
good,Structured and regimented work day-all time accounted for to the minute-limited interaction with co-workers throughout work day due to the nature of the job-supportive management.
good,"A typical day at work consist of sitting at the computer, and receiving work orders.  Interacting with the management and the sales reps. I've learned a lot about telecommunications. There isn't any real hard parts of the job. My co-workers are some of the best people around.  There is something special about each one of them.  I enjoy learning more and more about the different changes and aspects of telecommunications"
good,"Health is promoted, so we all try to take the stairs or walk laps around both buildings.  We spend a few minutes managing our desktops to stay efficient In some cases we'll, 'huddle'   This is one of the most enjoyable parts of the day since we're on the phones 7 hours.  We are managed by Supervisors, who are grouped into different Associate Directors within the center. Our teams change every 6 months. We have a lot of ice breakers in our meetings and you get to know a lot of cool people."
good,A fast paced work environment with a challenge to meet monthly sales objective. The objective is attainable by thoroughly fact finding and interviewing customers.
good,"Led and oversaw numerous mobility projects while overseeing the launch and implementation of the My Business/VEC hybrid online billing and ecommerce platform. "
good,"A typical day at Verizon would begin with getting to work and having a quick team building meeting with your entire team. I would then take calls for a few hours where I would have to opportunity to speak with a variety of customers. We were given an hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks. Verizon has been the best company that I have seen to really care about their employees. Verizon constantly had morale building exercises and events. We were even taken to the park for a half day during customer service week to show their appreciation. I learned so much while working at Verizon. I learned some very important phone skills and I also learned that the grass is not always greener on the other side by leaving. The management and supervisors at Verizon were awesome. The last supervisor I had with the company was the reason why I actually decided to leave. The experiences I had with her were awful. My co-workers were amazing. I had ample opportunity to meet and get to known co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that you have no solutions for. The most enjoyable was Verizon's options for taking vacation, using vacation days without notice, and also getting to work half days."
good,"daily goals are established at the start of the shift to help ensure that we meet commitments and occasionally exceed expectations. we are a part of a team of 10-13 people. the most difficult part is when issues and customer concerns are unable to be resolved at the first level of support, and must be escalated. the rewarding aspect is the satisfaction that is received once the customers resolution is reached accordingly. Management  recognizes us for prompt resolutions."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"My typical work day includes preparing reports, conducting background checks/drug screening, scheduling interviews, enabling system access, completing payroll/benedits documentation for new hires, and fielding/managing disciplinary questions and issues. I prepare all payroll documentation for 500 employees and insure correct tax/benefit deductions. I am also responsible for assisting other team members with supplies/inventory/accounts payable."
good,"I would talk to many different people to get to know them, so I can find what device or other services we offer, would be best for them."
good,"A typical day for a Technician starts with a workload from dispatch, that is subject to change as the day progresses. Installs, maintenance, and demolition tickets were sent to my blackberry with deadline commitments agreed upon with customers. Occasionally I received tickets from irate customers from whom I learned to earn their respect and satisfaction. Field work was usually accomplished alone but with support if needed. Management was flexible about plenty of things as long as our team productivity didn't suffer. Most local managers were very informative and insightful."
good,Enjoyed my 10 years with this company until our group was relocated.
good,"Verizon Wireless was a great company to work for. They provided great benefits, flexible schedules, and great discounts. There wasn't much to complain about except the rules on how you made commission on certain transactions. Not getting paid on certain transactions all while it hurt your numbers wasn't the most helpful in boosting moral. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be helping a customer get their new devices and setting them up. Nothing beats making someone happy with a new cell phone or tablet."
good,"Over all I loved what I did when I was working for Verizon. The only thing was that this was a 100% commission based job. And even though you would work very hard all day, you would not be paid unless you made a sale or signed up a new customer. The most enjoyable part of this job was the independence the job gave you. I was in charge of a lot of accounts as well as handling any problems within someone's account. Also I love meeting new people as well as educating them on some of the things I know about the company I represent."
good,"Working for Verizon has been a great experience.  I spend most of my time interacting with clients, and doing my best to promote new products and ideas.  My approach has always involved putting the customer first to show them I care about their business and that I want them to continue doing business with us.  That approach has allowed me to be very successful at Verizon, winning several awards for exceeding sales goals."

good,I enjoyed working here.  Excellent benefits. Company vehicle. Learned how to be an excellent customer service representative.
good,"As a sales rep I got to meet many families and individuals, connect, and recommend products based on my findings. I learned how to engage with people of all backgrounds.  Management is all about the bottom line. The hardest part of the job was coercing people into purchasing extra items to fill quota requirements set by Verizon."
good,"I personally enjoy working at verizon, it is a great company. Definitely would stay if they had more growth opportunities in my area."

good,selling cell phones in the mall as a high school couldn't have been any more fun.
good,"While working at Verizon I was empowered to grow the company, motivate my employees, complete ongoing training, and be part of a company that provides an outstanding service.  A typical day would be to ensure customers expectations were meet or exceeded, employees were given all resources and training needed to perform their job.  Manage workflow, budget, and time management.  I enjoyed being able to provide process improvements the best."
good,It is a good company to work for in regards to pay and benefits. But when it comes down to the company appreciating their workers they have a long way to go.

The management at iQor was excellent, they were always sure to announce any issues and resolve them very quickly. The supervisors in charge of each team were outstanding, the were always available for any question at hand and were always more than willing to coach you on ways to improve your call quality.

good,"Leak and Valley work load with short schedules once projects actually funded. Management did have hands off approach to let you decide the optimal design, code  and test approach. Some great people and co-workers.  Upper management distant and removed from reality."
good,"Good place to work.  a typical day is taking 35-40 inbound calls reviewing customer bills, providing technical support and recommending proper plans, and products."
good,the day goes by fast because you are always busy. if you are not receiving inbound calls you are making outbound calls. co- workers are very helpful. managers try to help you succeed and expand.
good,"As a lifetime career employee with Verizon, I have several job titles and been involved with several projects over my nearly 24 years with this company - starting as an operator with C&P Telephone as a teenager and ending as a central office technician with Verizon as an adult.  I have grown up with the values of this company and still embrace them today. The following reviews will break done my experiences with the company."

I mostly deal with a lot of irate customers, setting up accounts, issuing credits, explaining products and services, assisting new employees, reporting to my direct supervisor, mostly working alone, assisting with technical support and lots of meetings. I would say the entire day is challenging, not necessarily difficult. The most rewarding part is resolving each customer's issue so that your contact with them ends with them feeling satisfied."
good,A typical day would start with opening the store and getting everything put out and ready to go. on a good day there will be maybe 3 hours of down time where you put inventory up or make cold calls. The best part of the job is the management because they really push you to do your best and try to let you know what you did wrong.
good,"My primary role daily was taking inbound calls from cellular customers that needed to make payment arrangements to prevent service interruption and in some cases to restore service from suspend or disconnect. I learned many of my customer service skills from this company including patience, empathy, openness and professionalism. I loved my co-workers (many are now close friends). The hardest part was when I wasn't able to restore/reconnect service for someone in genuine need but no resources to justify. I enjoyed the atmosphere, team work and team building."
good,"Coach, Develp, Train"

good,"I have worked in both Operator Services (for 15 years) and Engineering Support (for 17 years).  The first 15 years in Operator Services was with a headset while communicating with customers every working day with various hours of work time.

good,"8 to 10 hours a day, they are great in learning and pushes employees to keep up with technology. It was easier to get into management in the 70's now it is harder. Co-workers can be helpful.

Most enjoyable part working for Verizon was when it was fGTE."
good,I did several things here over the years but mainly supporting the IT area. I learned a lot about their business whether it was SuperPages or Online. The hardest part was gaining exposure to move up. The enjoyable part was networking and meeting new people.

good,"Verizon has a wonderful staff with incredible benefits, work isn't challenging and the people you meet are amazing."
good,"There are many different areas to work in with this company. I'm strictly reviewing a day working in the customer service call center realm. A typical day at work involves logging in and taking calls troubleshooting devices, resolving billing issues, escalating trouble tickets to the appropriate support channel, all while maintaining an average number of calls per hour and fixing issues to customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and staff. Customer Service is, in general, a pretty stressful job having to deal with a variety of issues and personalities. The staff does a good job of keeping a positive work environment to handle some of the stressful customer situations. The hardest part of the job is managing all of the different performance metrics (average calls taken, hold time, customers that want to disconnect, customer surveys, sales percentage). It can be overwhelming at times, but overall, it's ok because of the amazing benefits the company offers. The amount of work one puts in seems well compensated compared to other call center jobs out there."

good,"Typical day of work would involve, checking the monthly quotas, as well as acknowledging our store numbers and reaching a daily quota for each sales rep so my location can over attain monthly quotas. During the day also interact with all customers to ensure they have had all needs met and have full knowledge of our existing services, also provide excellent customer service such as account maintenence that can lead to savings on additional services, also follow up calls with service purchases so this can create a reacurring customer base for that location. Some of my most enjoyible wireless sales managment moments would be, assisting my team on asking the right discovery questions so they can create benifits and new needs for wireless services."

We always had a good time and made sure we had fun while working but still staying on task."

I have learned about business sales and operations both front and back house of Verizon. Managers and co-workers at my location worked as a team and it was a great work environment.

In the world of telecommunications there's never a plateau, you keep advancing with the growth of technology which keeps you on your toes and learning on a daily basis. My work co-workers developed an extremely competitive but respectful atmosphere which made it unpredictable but enjoyable. There would be days that were challenging, such as customers not coming in to your location, an over flow of sales reps. on the days that were slow.

good,"I worked for Alltel Wireless for over 10 years before Alltel was bought out by Verizon Wireless. I woked with a great team of about 25 DBA. With Alltel, my typical day was creating databases from small test databasese to large multi-tier RAC databases, multiple meetings, working help desk, troubleshooting issues with the database, creating software to monitor the databases and cloning multiple databases and schemas, upgrading and patching the databases. We supported over 1800 databases with this team. Alltel had a great set of standards that everyone followed which allowed us to lay out each database in the same manner so no matter which database you had to work on, you always knew where everything was located. It was important to document each database as it was built. If you wanted to know anything about a database the information was always at your fingertips. Each database was set up with a whole suite of monitoring scripts that were developed by a few of the highly talented programmers that also worked as Sr. level DBA's. Once Alltel was purchased by Verizon, the team was broken up into pieces and many left the company and otheres were laid off."

It could sometimes become stressful when deadlines for new cellsite turn-ups were given and problems arose, such as: interference, frequency co-ordination, hardware issues, etc. Preparing a cellsite for activation by loading parameters, neighbors, etc., could be done from my home. I would then drive test the site on the day of activation and verify no issues.

Working with"
good,A typical work day is fast past environment with ability to be promoted quickly to high achieving individuals. Verizon cares about the employee and their family.

good,"Verizon was a great employer during my time worked there. I left seeking a career that enabled more time with my family. Based on performance, you are paid an hourly rate as well as commission for hitting your target goal. If you exceed the goal, there are multipliers that you hit until you obtain what is referred to as windfall. I hit windfall a few times working there, but it was dependent on how busy we were and how many referrals and leads I was able to close. The benefits were excellent including 401k, tuition reimbursement, fitness reimbursement, PTO, Illness pay, and medical, dental, and vision plans. The only reason I can't give 5 stars on all is there were a couple times it took breaking the chain of command to resolve issues. Aside from that, I would apply again in the future."

good,"This is a great company with great benefits to help you forward your career in most industries.  Great benefit for continuing education.  My time here has been great, but it's time to move forward.  Sometimes it seems finding reward career movement involves moving to a very limited amount of locations, none of which interest me personally."

good,"Verizon used to be an Excellent work place, it is going thru organizational changes since 2015 that has dampened the employee morale in general.I hope that things get settled there as per reorgs etc and people can actually work instead of worrying.

Excellent benefits, compensation, yearly incentive, flexible work hours allows for greater work life balance and motivates employees to work more for their company."
good,"Verizon is very forward thinking. They make strides to deliver what customers and employees want and need. As in any industry, it is the immediate leadership and their understanding of the priorities and intentions that make it real. "
good,Job is very straight-forward with the chance of career advancement after 6 months of hire if doing great in job performance and minimal absences. Not many internal job postings for a Home Based Agent position (the call center is a long drive to/from my place). The pay is slightly above-average when comparing to similar job roles in the area. The culture is very customer and employee obsessed. Never expect a slow day at the office; there is never a short break in between calls and expect your shift to change every 6 months. Management is usually considerate and lets you know a month ahead of time so you can make arrangements in your personal life to accommodate. Occasional free lunches and snacks and company offers 50% off monthly access charge only (not applicable to device payment plans or taxes) and 25% off accessories!

good,I loved working at Verizon. My supervisor trusted my work's ethics and expected a job well done knowing that I would satisfy my external as well as my internal customers. We had tremendous respect for each other for the 15+ years that we worked together. The most enjoyable part of my job was the first five working days of each month because that was the deadline to complete a significant tax process to pay all the sales tax for the company and it was done consistently every month regardless of issues I may have encountered in the process. I lament that my position was relocated but I am positive and energetic and nothing holds me back. I will get another great position.
good,Management was very effective in keeping employers on sales target! The store location(s) I attended always had the latest gadgets and phones on display making it so easy to sell with looks at times and the work environment was always positive and productive! Amazing place and staff!
good,Verizon over all was a good place to work. As with all large businesses there are good and bad management. I worked for some I considered very good and some that very poor. In two cases I trained my supervisor. I was appointed temporary supervisor and when the permanent person was given the job Verizon had me to train them. I later trained another supervisor for the same position.

good,8 hour days or more primarily on launch days or holidays. working with many different accounts whether consumer or business. customers can be good or bad depending on direct service or customer enforced issues not caused by service reps. management and staff are good. have rallies and kickoffs quarterly and offer incentives and offsite events. hardest part of the job is consistently reaching quota which must be obtained in a multitude of ways for certain months can be slower than others.
good,I had a great career at Verizon I have nothing to complain about. Strike duty was difficult but we were well compensated for it. There is no overtime pay or pager pay but they give regular raises and people that are good at their jobs are well compensated.
good,"I was a greeter. I would have liked the job better if I was a sales person. But, the people were great! Also, I didn't work for Verizon I worked for a temp agency."
good,"We have the autonomy and support to transform the org into a continuously learning organization that delivers highest value at a sustainable pace.

good,"Verizon is a company formed by the merger of GTE with Bell Atlantic, a former ""baby Bell"" under AT&T (""Ma Bell""). GTE was very customer oriented and valued their employees. The merger followed more of the Bell Atlantic culture and was not as pleasant a working environment. In the end, after approximately 11 years, Verizon sold its acquired territory from GTE to Frontier Communications which concentrates its business on rural residential and small business customers only. For this reason, the majority of large businesses left when Frontier took over in order to satisfy their communications needs."
good,I got hired with a decent pay plan and after two months they switched plans and moved me to a smaller store and I started getting paid less. Everyone was really cool to work with.

good,"I had a great run with Verizon, definitely a company I would recommend to anyone that’s into sales, opportunities to make a good amount of money, job security, outstanding benefits, and an adaptable environment."
good,I've learned to value customers just as much as you value your lively hood. Customers aren't always happy. Be a positive light on their situation. Verizon always provides exceptional training tools and customer service.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Good company.  Typical corporate structure."
good,"Always something going on to celebrate the employees. Great incentives, food, games,time off, etc. The employees are very nice ad willing to help and this job comes with many career advancement opportunities."
good,"Verizon is probably the greatest place I ever worked. I was able to earn my Bachelor's degree while employed there through the tuition assistance program. I held several positions providing insight and experience into more than what I originally applied for in the beginning. I grew as an employee and a leader. I was able to learn from others, many were open to that. Most positions are results driven. Leadership training program was amazing. I had the privilege of mentoring other employees during my tenure there. Its a big company but within certain work groups, family relationships are formed and a culture of teamwork is present. I left to pursue a different career but look back on it fondly."
good,"job culture intense as a a result of employees bonding quickly, employees are quick to come to co-workers aid in times of unforeseen circumstances. On the other  management needs to take more accountability"
good,"Work on UX design in collaboration with cross-functional teams in the development of projects. Engaging in information architecture, user research, testing and design thinking. Accountable for all elements of asset delivery to development teams. Creating low/high fidelity assets like flows, wire-frames and prototypes for customer-facing and workforce related applications."
good,It was a great experience working here but the job/life balance is tough.  I would consider working for Verizon again but am happy with my current choices.
good,"Smile and greet customers. Offer new and updated products. Give them the best customer service."
good,"Good employer, good  benefits, good pay, some stress for management, not so bad for union employees. Customer service used to be job one as was safety. Do not know what it is now."
good,Pay is very good as long as you're willing to work retail hours and weekends.  Quota was starting to go up as well and Winfall is the biggest scam ever.
good,"The work structure at Verizon was very structured, in a very good way.  My supervisor was very supportive, hands off, but involved by being informed by number of meetings every week."
good,"It would have to be one of the best jobs i had. Your team basically became your family at work. It was stressful when new products would come out and just learning everything new, but we had extensive training to help with that."
good,Good company to work for good culture good balance between work and life. The flexibility to work from home is the best part and being apart of the inner workings of the company makes you feel you are a part of the team.

good,"Verizon had great pay and benefits. The energy in the call center was positive. They were a lot of fun events planned such as employee appreciation day, winter festival, harvest festival just to name a few."
good,"I have been here for several years and worked with several different teams. Had the opportunity to grow, lead and help several team members in this process. They have very smart individuals in IT that are always finding ways to improve and innovate."
good,I was well trained and able to continue learning as I advanced to management within the first two months of working there. They strive to reach goals but do not encourage being too pushy which creates a more positive environment.
good,The job itself was very .. complicated at first . ive learned how to speak with people with more passion . ive learned how to deal with certain situations better than i have in the past .
good,"Working in retail you have a pretty flexible schedule and most managers are willing to work with keeping work life balance. You are constantly learning and adapting since it is a field that is ever changing and you work with all kinds of customers. If you're looking to further your education or career, Verizon does make it pretty easy to do that."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for, like most of the companies it's going through many changes to increase shareholder values while balancing and positioning itself for future forecast."
good,"You have to focus on meeting your stats which is stressful in itself.  Must be willing to research at a very fast pace and try to retain information for future use.  Management is usually not engage with you on a day to day basis.  Hardest part is, difficult  customers who may and will fail you on a survey even though you may have done everything to help and or solve their problems.  The best part is just seeing the folks that show up to help."
good,great team work. the best place for working mom. Managers work with you for a better schedule. Everyone cares about you asa an employee. Always fun working at VZW.
good,Great company to work for if you enjoy competitive sales and commission based pay. Great for preparing oneself for future careers or advancement opportunities
good,Verizon was a wonderful company to work for. I found myself leaving the tristate area and wish i could have stayed to further my career with them. Relocated to Florida for family and could not continue.
good,This company offers many benefits and always wants to move people up within the work place. Verizon also communicates any new changes to keep the representatives informed. Very fun and happy workplace.
good,"Business sales associates. Working directly with sales reps to generate new business and reduce churns , also help prospects different sales territories to meet with new customers."
good,I had a great run at Verizon but like many companies in the space they are made up of many companies and that brings challenges in terms of getting products provisioned. Overall I had a very good experience and would consider going back.
good,Overall the 20 years I was employed at Verizon it was a very pleasant place to work and very flexible to cater to family needs and very diverse in culture.
good,"At Verizon, I am health and wellness coordinator at a corporate gym. I serve as a personal trainer and overall health coach. In addition to working one-on-one with clients, I also hold seminars and give presentations on nutrition and other health related topics. Working mostly in a gym means that the workplace culture is relatively relaxed. But the pace can be fast at times when having to work with multiple clients at once."
good,"This company is a great place to start out from college. It's also a great place for women. It's not so good for older reps over 40 because it does not maintain a great level of culture for mature reps. The pace can be fast, yet sometimes it is extremely quiet. If you are good at demonstrations AND sales you will prosper."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, excellent benefits and compensation, great job security and advancement, the company  compensate you for going to school. A typical day at work is taking calls back to back a lot of time you may have angry customers in which you have to deal with appropriately.  I learned how to be a tech while working for Verizon, the workplace culture is good as long as you do your job no problem."
good,"Verizon is really a great company to work for. Wonderful benefits, great culture, and fosters a work/life balance as much as possible. It's a fast paced, goal oriented environment."
good,I was always active working on my projects that I was leading. I had all the support that I needed to lead and work from my bosses and i had. I had 3 different bosses in the past 4 years and they all had their own style of managing.
good,"In general, if you're a hard worker and good at your job, you'll have opportunities to advance.  However, not all management is suited to their jobs and can cause issues. Lately, layoffs have increased."
good,"It is really a great place to work, good pay and great benefits. You do need to be prepared for a high pace and competitive job when working at Verizon."
good,I never felt dragged down working there like I did from other companies. They really try to make the atmosphere welcoming and try to accommodate to your needs within reason.
good,It was a unique experience to help transition the Finance Team from NJ to FL. The benefits were great. The company cared about creating a great culture.
good,If you’re into gadgets and the neeest technology this VZW is a great place to work. General product knowledge is a must but there is also extensive ongoing training to keep abreast of the newest devices and technology
good,Verizon is a great place to work. I would still be there if I did not have to relocate. I worked in the call center. You typically sit at your desk waiting for calls.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a fast pace and competitive environment.  Management is excellent with assisting career opportunities and advice. Verizon's Benefit packages are very good.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon. I worked with some great people to meet the everyday challenges of meeting the needs of our business and commercial clients. "
good,It was a good opportunity for me.  There is room for advancement.  The pay and benefits were wonderful at the time I worked there.  All of my co-workers were like family.
good,"Loved working for the call center. Job security, competitive pay and great benefits. The job was repetitive but there were other opportunities to grow in new departments after some time with the company."
good,"I learned how to work in a team, and how to be effective as an individual.  There was plenty of room to move up.  I also learned basic skills and how to upsale, how to get a feel for our clientele.  I enjoyed the competitive nature of the position, because I was encouraged to be a good representative and learn rather quickly how to do so.  Really laid back, business casual dress code, and I would definitely recommend this company to a friend."
good,I had a team of great programmer / analyst that supported the media system.  The media system provided the residential and business bills for all customers across the nation.  I then led a team that automated the collections call center; using MS SQL DB and MS BizTalk was able to suspend or cut off a residential phone line. The app saved the company time and money
good,Great compay with great benefits and opportunities for career advancement. Has excellent resources for their employees and awesome company moral which makes for a great work environment.
good,"Loved working for VZB. I worked for the company for 15 years. I enjoyed every bit of it. If they would have let me, I would have retired from there. I grew up there, VZB was family."
good,"Had company vehicle and worked from home.  Hardest part of job, industry is always growing and changing and have to stay on top of all the new technology as well as the old."
good,"If you are wanting to work at Verizon you have to e prepared to deal with various of customers, from the happiest to the most frustrated of them all. You learn plenty of ways on how to read a customer and determine what their needs are. Management is always supportive and goal oriented. Have fun  while being at work is whats most important, happy employees always leads to happy customers. The hardest part of the job would definitely be when technology is not working in your favor. the most enjoyable part of working for Verizon would be the joy of helping your customers."
good,"The only down side was that our pay was based on customer surveys. If the customer did not feel their issue was resolved whether it was within our capacity to resolve the issue or not, they could still give a low score ."
good,"I worked in various departments for GTE/Verizon:"
good,Working for this company was very stress. They have a high turn over. I worked for this company for 14yrs and was never able to advance. The supervisors is very cute throat.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients on the phone to resolve issues involving monies due on past due accounts."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. There is reasonable representation of all the countries in the world and the working culture is simply fantastic."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Room for growth, benefits, great pay and team building. After starting with little to no sales experiences, this job madmade me into a great sales solutions specialist."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I am not leaving Verizon.  I am looking for a part time job.  I was told that I can work from 6pm to 11pm.  My daughter currently work for your company.
good,"If you can handle the retail hours, Verizon is a good fit for any outgoing individual. The only thing negative is that they do not have the best commission structure based on what they want you to sell. Certain sales keep your job, other sales get you paid. Learn to mesh them and it would be perfect. But compensation is more than fair. Lots of PTO and most managers work with your needs."
good,"My time at Verizon was a blast, I've met great people along the way, and learn so much about multi tasking."
good,Although this was a very stressful job it was also very rewarding. You were provided with the training needed to perform your duties.  There was always a chance for advancement  & internal transfers between different departments were always available.
good,"Fast-paced, customer service. Overall company, great. Advancement opportunities, great pay, great benefits. Training provided consistently. Scheduling needs to be more consistent with days off together rather than split, not have to work more than 5 days without day off."
good,Verizon is an excellent company to work for and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a fantastic career.  After retiring and moving to Delaware I am disappointed I am unable to get back into the same kind of position I was in previously with that company.
good,"Great career, "
good,"I really liked it better when it was just Alltel. Once it merged with Verizon a lot of things changed. If it was still here in Shreveport, I think I would still be an employee there."
good,Verizon is a very great company to work for. Hours are just not very accommodating when you have a family. great benefits and atmosphere.  not all managers are good ones
good,Verizon Wireless demonstrated value for their employees and compensated accordingly. There was a strong focus on work life balance and recognition for a job well done.
good,Training was provided to everyone for each task department within the call center. Everyone work well together and helped each department when workload was heavy. Overtime was always available.
good,"As stated above, the workload would keep you very busy.  I always had good managers to work with that would listen to my opinion.  My coworkers were wonderful people."
good,"Working at Verizon is overall pretty great with regards to work-life balance and benefits, so if you're looking at a Full Time gig with Verizon and want a nice office job at a reasonable pace, I say take it.  However if you're a contractor you get none of the perks, no PTO or sick leave or phone discounts, etc."
good,it was fun just wished more customers came I had no issue adjusting its a sales job after all so its a little stressful but if you have the energy it can be great
good,"A typical day at Verizon was exciting and stressful at the same time.  You have to have patience in this type of work environment due to dealing with many employees, management and customers.  Verizon has a great work ethic and always makes sure its employees are up to date on the latest and greatest products in the business.  Anyone who works in retail knows that the customer facing is the hardest job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the operational part but also helping customers with learn their devices.  Making sure I took care of all their needs."
good,Working for Verizon was overall a good experience.  We were a very high sales volume store for the amount of traffic we had.  Management varies but overall it is a very corporate America experience.
good,"Just like any sales job, if you work hard and make the sales, the job is VERY lucrative. If you have never worked in a high volume call center before, it can be overwhelming. The entire work culture is geared towards making money...even more so than people...it's just the industry."
good,"Great company. You will get out of this job whatever you put into it. If you work hard and keep you goals met, you will prosper. If you slack off and just get enough done to get by, you will not be happy here."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Verizon Wireless. Managers were always consistent and fair in a fast paced environment. I loved the people, the team work and the benefits Verizon gave to employees."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,A wonderful place to work. was able to grow as a professional. Management was always helpful and understanding. Provided us with monthly goals and assessments.
good,"Good job, great benefits. Relocation for family reasons wasn't an option. As such, I had to leave. The job was quite demanding but i was rewarded for my good work."
good,Started as a contractor at GTE. After 6 months was brought on as a full time employee. During the corporate name change to Verizon was asked to be on committee to incorporate the new name behind the scenes. Management was great the environment was very professional and at the same time enjoyable. A very demanding work environment at the same time with some tight deadlines.
good,I love being able to close that large sale and maintaining the relationship I made with that customer.  My workplace provides our new customers tools to become more efficient and save money.
good,Working at Verizon was very fun- you are surrounded by extroverted people who are motivated and believe in the products.  They all go through sales training and know what they are doing.
good,Worked for them for 20 years in Tech Support. Job can be a bit challenging esp working with some customers but can easily can be worked out. Great benefits. Can be very hard to advance since it is a call center.
good,A typical day at work is a very stressful day. Constantly answering customers questions about their devices while trying to send them out with a strategic device (sell them something) customers don't just come in wanting products so we have to capitalize on the customers who come in with troubleshooting issues. That would be the most difficult part of the job.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the independence that management allows if you are a self motivated, responsible employee. The off shift work, although necessary in the Telecommunications world, can be stressful but you get used to it."
good,"Great management, supportive culture for advancement within the company. Fast past and competitive environment. Hardest part of the job depends on who you work with and what location you are at."
good,"Every company has a problem or maybe it's that someone can find a problem with every company. Or maybe we don't realize a good thing until it is gone. The moral at VZW was amazing in nearly every retail store I worked in. Customers are customers, both good and bad. However, VZW's employees and policies created great leverage for deescalating the consumer. Only drawback for me was the hours. I need more consistency for my growing family."
good,Great place to get your career started. A great support system by executive management. Wish there was better career pathing opportunities. More positions should have more work life balance in terms of scheduling time off.
good,Verizon offers great pay and benefits with a good work life balance. be sure to have a game plan going in like the education reimbursement assistance to gain value and experience to move forward. taking calls gets old fast.
good,"This is a good company to work for good pay and benefits. VZW does take care of their people with various awards, incentives and support. It is retail, so you do have to get used to working different shifts."
good,"Verizon is a great company with great benefits. They promote from within and reward those that do well at their position. As of late, the retail industry has taken a hit, forcing Verizon to do layoffs to cut back on expenses. This has put a lot of employees on edge and created job insecurities."
good,"The job culture, training and benefits package are excellent. The management can be inconsistent and unreliable. The call center has a LOT of turnover"
good,Learned a lot from working here on technology. Long hours sometimes that's good if you like overtime bad if you don't. Management is good if you follow company procedures. Get to meet someone new everyday. Coworkers are great always have your back.
good,"Verizon focuses a lot on the customer, I believe the team you work with makes a difference and you have to care about your paycheck and the company to make money. They reward hard workers a land their benefits are Great. If you can handle retail hours you will be happy with this company."
good,"For me this job was extremely stressful because it was so against my personality type.  I'm an artsy, no-fluff kind of person.  I forced myself to try to change because you know everybody says fake it until you make it, but it will ruin you.  If you are somebody that's truly empathic and are good at  baby people, this job will be ideal.  If you're not it will create a stress that will crush you mentally to be something you're not.  The pay and benefits are great.  "
good,"Good place to work with a reasonable job security. Flexible working hours. Depending on the team and manger, you will have the option to work from home sometimes"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I worked at Telvista on a contract for Verizon FiOS. My experience here was pretty decent. Overall, the management is fair and easy-going. Some policies change quite a bit, but it's not unbearable I would say."
good,"Good management , good policies and practices. Employees enjoy working here. Top bosses make sure to resolve issues when they show up. Nobody judges or bothers you as long as you do your job well."
good,"Cold calling, door knocking, customer appointments, appointment prep, annd customer service skills. I learned all about wireless. I also had some excellent trainings such as Axiom which is understanding all of your customers needs. Psycological selling, non-stop product training and last of all, manager in training or Major "
good,"Typical day at work was meeting and collaborating on new products and initiatives.  Quality was always top of mind.  I learned how to be a great Leader!  Culture was focused, collaborative, and transparent.  Hardest part of the job, leaving.  Most enjoyable part of the job was my team and my leader!"
good,I enjoyed working at Verizon Wireless. I started working toward a Medical Profession. I would recommend this company to anyone of my friends and family.
good,"Verizon, is a good company, i start work at 6;30am. I am a Lineman for the company, i work until 4;30pm. I have been doing this for 20 years, i have done splicing as well."
good,"Cost and Revenue Assurance is a great team to work with!  Compared to some of my other jobs, this is a very pleasant environment.  Time in and out is flexible."
good,Provide direct support for sales associates.  Provide direct training to new staff.  Develop and implement new sales initiatives.  Meet with customers to discuss products and services
good,"Stressful calls, not all. Happy and motivative culture. Good management. Employees are pampered as much as they can. Once you have everything down, its pretty easy. Usually takes 6 months to learn almost everything"
good,"A very fast-paced job that puts you to the test. I would start out the day updating all of the numbers from the previous day as well as verifying that all of the inventory was up to date. If there were any inventory issues, I would have to research and figure out why there was a problem as well as make sure it gets fixed. I would also help out management and sales reps on the sales floor as needed. I also would manage inventory flow throughout the day as well. Overall a very fun job that allowed me to learn the best ways for problem solving."
good,"A typical day of work is, NA"
good,"Offers amazing benefits; great health care options, 401k matching, and tuition assistance. Prioritizes hiring from within, so lots of options for moving up. Expects a lot and comes with a lot of stress."
good,"Firm but fair professional work environment. Very diverse work force provides opportunities for personal growth and exchange of ideas. Varied and complex work duties allow for learning new concepts, new tasks, and new software systems for the professional growth of the staff. Very good in-house training opportunities."
good,This was a nice place to work before GTE and Bell Atlantic merged. GTE was a great company to work for. The management teams were always making the place fun to work. Contests and awards. When the merge came through and Verizon was born things got out of hand. The management did not care anymore and the contests were gone and so was the morale. It became so micro-managed.
good,Learned how to strive for more since there is commission involved. Gained confidence when selling and meeting peoples needs. Very friendly staff and management is very helpful
good,Handle a multitude of functions by handling customer concerns. Would not end a call until everything was resolved. From start up to completion everything must be reviewed on the account.
good,I worked with people that were very well trained and were willing to help you learn and grasp an understanding of telecommunications and all the functions that play a vital roll with the company.
good,"Fast pace, high energy job environment.  Great benefits, great pay, great incentives.  Enjoyed the daily challenges. Great culture and trainings.  Wonderful place to work"
good,"Great benefits, excellent organization and transparency.  Encouragement and availability for expanding knowledge, skills, and advancement.  Mine was a management position that required extensive local travel and occasional national travel."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Compensation, benefits, and bonuses are great. The customer service specialist position is great for someone who enjoys talking on the phone for long hours and sitting."
good,"Great Incentives, Performance Driven Workplace, Game room, Fitness Center, Nice Campus, Encourages leadership and promotion"
good,Even though I only worked here for just one summer the knowledge acquired in my sales training was invaluable. I feel that I am more comfortable in dispositioning products because of the extensive training I received.
good,I always find good in my jobs and the people I work with. I am a hard work with of energy. I am a fast learner.  I want to work with a company with is also full of energy and growth.
good,Great company to work for but they're failing to adapt to the changes taking place in the marketplace which is leading to their downfall. My Boss is amazing but he doesnt have enough of an influence to push change.
good,"Verizon is well run and has good benefits. Management employees tend to work excessive hours, but due to the backbone of hourly employees on the landline side being a union environment, has good benefits."
good,"Verizon is a company that pays well, gives great benefits, and promotes the best.  With so many different departments there's always another career path if you want it."
good,It is definitely a call center job. The environment outside of the actual job itself is great. The benefits themselves are great and this is considerably more of an entry level job.
good,"A typical day involved showing up at scheduled time."
good,"A typical work day at Verizon Wireless consisted of: inbound calls, providing stellar customer service, taking new phone upgrade orders, explaining customers bills, handle disputes and escalated calls, and cross selling products.Verizon puts high premium on stellar customer service, building customer trust, acknowledging and listening to customers' needs to make sure the right products and plans suites and meets the customers' needs."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. Its unfortunate that I am not able to relocate as the people, benefits and overall connections I have made throughout my time has been so rewarding. The job itself is for sure stressful at times but what job isn't. I appreciate the skill set it has provided me with for my next chapter. I will truly miss my co-workers."
good,"Excellent company to work for. Few downfalls to the career and a great atmosphere. Beyond the recent news of the call center closing, the job would come highly recommended."
good,"Nearly 20 years, until the transition to Frontier. Very thankful for the lifestyle that I was able to keep. Good culture, solid management."
good,I loved my time at Verizon Wireless. They invest a lot of time and money into their employees and have a great benefit package.
good,"My typical day involved database file downloads, deep dives of metrics, support of department meetings. Opportunities for learning are excellent with tuition assistance. Co-workers were great team players and friendly. I loved when an unhappy customer was cared for and became a raving fan of the company ."
good,"I've been working for this company for 20yrs. And I'm thankful for the opportunity that I've been giving by them. The management are  supportive in finding solutions to provide to the customers, and my  co-workers are helpful at working together as a team."
good,High quotas in a saturated market is the only complaint. verizon is a flexible employer. working with the public can always has its ups and downs but so does every other retail job.
good,The job was nice. It was really comfortable. I am the exception though. I worked with Verizon during the time they implemented the group commission. Being that group commission does not exist any more all I can say it was good. Verizon is very competitive and sales and you get in trouble if you don't produce.
good,having good team and management. having lots of fun. very well established company i never seen in past. ist very hardest at month ending projects
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I love working for Verizon, but the hours were to long, and their no work, and family balance.  I typical day would be selling phones and dealing with customers."
good,Customer Service is key.  The customer must be the number one focus.  Fun sales atmosphere.  Everyone must enjoy what they are doing to make the atmosphere enjoyable and increases the likelihood of employees coming to work.
good,"Company has a highly driven opportunity for employees to obtain a College Degree. While employed have been able to complete a Bachelor of Science, Business Management and Master’s Degree, Management"
good,"Field tech is less stress than customer service reps. I have done both sides. Customer service and sales demands lots of attention and commitment from you. Technician is more here is the job and the goal, you do have numbers to meet but is not as bad."
good,"In my 3 years at Verizon I learned more than I could ever list, as well as developed my skills far beyond anything I could have learned in a teaching environment. We were always encouraged and expected to push our own limits to provide increasingly better output. While this may have been daunting at times it was a very beneficial aspect of my career there. I left Verizon a far better Instructional Designer than I was when I entered."
good,"It was a different job. A chat center which was different than I was use to. But it was because of that I was able to, for the first time, get to know my co-workers better because we could interact with each other."
good,"its a really fun job if you are good in sales. you get training and they teach you how to be a good salesman. you become part of a ""family"". you also have to do Fios box returns which is really annoying, but that is a great way to make some sales and hit you goals."

good,"I work as a lineman for Verizon Communications. During the course of a day we are required to place telecommunications physical plant, such as telephone poles, copper telephone cable,fiber optic cable and related equipment. My local manager is excellent. He possesses a comprehensive knowledge of my job duties, and he gives frequent feedback and sets clear goals for our team. My co-workers are hard working, safety minded and provide an enjoyable working environment. "
good,"Typical day at work depended on the day of the week, some days more challenging than others depending on the goals. Staff is helpful and coaching is provided to attain certain goals. The hardest part would be certain quota marks that you have to make. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the family orientated atmosphere."
good,"they pay ok, but scheduling is off and you get what you get, management was good, co workers were great, learned that if you do your job you have nothing to worry about as far as being secure. I did not like that customers had a lot of control of your job via survey."
good,"During my employment with Verizon I learned so many different things. There weren't many typical days at Verizon because there was always some kind of training, learning new systems and opportunities for advancement or cross training to learn other aspects of the business. The leadership was very good and were willing to teach and learn from their employees."
good,"Absolutely loved it, great pay and there is always more to learn.Very competitive, great co-workers and great opportunity to move up."

good,"Good company to work for. Long days and several long nights. Thriving in fast paced, cross functional environments, promote culture of growth, partnership, and seizing."
good,"Awesome experience working with Verizon Business Sales Team.  They give you the tools to get started and get the ball rolling in a B2B sales environment.  Office environment is lacking but that is because everyone is focused on making sales.Top reps have opportunity to make over 6 figures, normal reps make 60k with commission incentives"
good,"Verizon was a decent environment. I felt this job was not for me. The training and the actual job were very different."
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"And change is what you will become familiar with. They are a fantastic, high-paced company to work for with fantastic benefits. Verizon offers much ceiling space for promoting and runs job incentives on a constant basis. Overall, a very competitive and invigorating workplace."
good,"VerizonBusiness bought MCI and it changed slightly. My manager was an extremely hard worker and that made it even easier to go the extra mile. It was a joy to work there and the original location (Prudential Center-Boston, MA) was perfect."
good,"I found working at Verizon Wireless in the Call Center to be a good job which was sometimes frustrating but what job isn't?"
good,"Same comments previously shared about my work experience at Verizon apply to this position as well."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Got to understand how things are working in an IT company. How deployment and other things are happening. Got a chance to work in Java, Oracle along with BPMNs (workflows)"
good,Verizon has wonderful benefits and compensation.  It is mostly retail so it is hard to maintain work/life balance.  I dealt with a lot of customers and acquired great customer service skills.  I learned a lot on how to manage a store and operations.  I worked with inventory and merchandising along with paperwork.  I learned some great skills that I will take with me.
good,Verizon is a great place to work. Great pay and benefits. Because of its rep Verizon is always busy which demands lots and lots of your dedication and time.
good,"Commission based environment that can be challenging at times but allows you to exceed base level compensation, benefits are great and leadership provides a lot of support and development"

good,"In-bound call center assisting customers with their inquiries regarding products and services. "
good,"This was my first ""real job"", although I started at the bottom. Taking offers to learn other jobs placed me in position for advancement. This company always encouraged you to move further in the business and backing up education."
good,"A typical day at work is motivational huddles before we start our day, kudos and awards when we accomplish things. We are able to have down time outside of the phones to decompress. There is room to advance and grow within the company and management supports and encourages you to do so, and they help you map out a career path to help you get there."
good,"Typical days at Verizon Wireless do not exist. Each day is a dynamic set of new challenges that allowed me to gain the sales expertise that I need to move on professionally in my sales career. Myself and my co-workers work cohesively as a team to benefit the needs of the customer. Our management team is largely involved, to our benefit, in the development and education of our team to achieve company goals. The most challenging part of many sales positions is properly discovering the needs of the customer to get them in the right product that fits their lifestyle and personal needs. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is the opportunity to witness customer satisfaction at the end of each transaction."
good,Great place to work.  Answer calls. Smile and friendly.   Great people to work with. Hardest part of my job is being nice when someone is cursing you out.
good,Job was monotonous for me as it was over 10 years ago since I left. Not a big fan of unions as they make it difficult to get rid of the bad apples.
good,"Excellent work team that is always open to help and support co-workers."
good,"Great experience, provided with tools to succeed.  Best sales training on the market with plenty of ride alongs and coaching.  Management truly cared about the success of employees."
good,"Great company to work for in my opinion. Always giving the tools needed to succeed. My co-workers had great personalities, management was attentive to your needs and also helpful in each team member maximized their potential."
good,"Enjoyed working for Verizon for the most part, could get competitive."
good,"In a typical day you'll take anywhere from 20-50 calls. These calls can be as simple as people wanting to know when they can upgrade their phones, to as difficult as figuring out why their bill is 100$ more than they usually pay. The management is different depending on who's team your on. Overall the management is supportive and very helpful with any questions you may have concerning customers. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated; One day you'll have all great calls where you helped lower people's bill and they're very grateful, and another day you'll be getting yelled at for the data overage ""they didn't use"". The most enjoyable part is definitely being apart of the team meetings its very casual and they really care about how you're doing."
good,Great working environment. Very goal orientated. Cutting edge technology.  Co-workers: work together as a team to achieve great results.
good,"Work was from 11:00am-8:00pm. Took calls throughout the day, had 2 breaks and sometimes had team meetings to review our performance for the week."
good,"A place to learn the ropes of running your own profitable business- from operations to front of house customer facing issues, you will gain great management experience."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers and work activities"
good,"I had a really great experience at my location! Loved my managers and coworkers. Regularly had food brought in for us when we were busy. Lots of perks! We were short staffed so some weeks I'd work 50 hours or so, but overtime was great."
good,"Verizon is good place to work, I never had any issue in balancing Job and Personal life. This place helped to improvise and sharpen my QTP automation skill set. Enjoyable part of work- we will never feel stress, there is lot of fun activity like game area, library, gym, cafeteria with free drinks and evening snacks, lot of paid vacation etc."
good,A typical work day is very fast paced. The hardest part of this job is no downtime between calls and management is very helpful.
good,"Oversee all aspects of management in a retail environment. Hiring of employees, scheduling, money management, day to day business. Daily training for employees, upheld company policies, worked closely with the customer entering the store. Worked closely with upper management on daily store goals, along with individual sale representative goals, daily, monthly. Execute company promotions, daily, weekly, and monthly initiatives. Kept up with all current cellular trends and competitive promotions pertaining to new and current customers. Worked closely on developing all of my employees, and mentored many of them to management. Hardest part of the job was the long and relentless retail schedule one must keep up with. Did not enjoy the micro managing style that Verizon promoted as a normal day to day operation in the retail segment."
good,"so far, since i have worked at Verizon it has been enjoyable. Co-workers are amazing people. The environment is great. The supervisors are always willing to help. It is a fast past job and thinhs are always changing."
good,"Spending two years in the call center, I believe their pay was very generous as well as options for further bonuses, incentives and the benefits were amazing. It was seniority based so in the beginning you have few options for your desired shift as well as receiving certain days such as holidays off, however, they do have several options compared to other companies when it comes to needing time off of work and/or making time up. There were times when unlimited overtime was being offered as well. My co-workers and management team is what helped me get through my shifts every day, some of the customers as well, but not all customers call in to say they are pleased with the service. Some customers are very irate and misguided or uneducated about the service and will voice their anger towards you. A good job if you can not take words to heart and enjoy constantly communicating with customers."
good,"Verizon is a stable company focuses on the customer rather the bottom line.  Although I have dedicated 16 years of my life, sadly I was let go due to budget cuts"
good,Being punchuality.Learing from situation by being positive. Actively participating in every event by being friendly with co-workers.
good,"Worked In Commercial network services for over 15 years.  Exposed to several different types and platforms of Network devices.  Was exposed to extremely talented and deep pool of colleagues and skill sets.  Was in challenging environment because of need for group to be horizontally talented across different functionality's; but this unique structure also allowed me to become well rounded and versatile in any Network community.  Working weekends on change records and during third level on-call was difficult at times, but management recognized this and provided ample flexibility in allowing for time off and need to get rejuvenated"
good,"This company is always changing and rapidly developing in the technology industry.  There are many great benefits this company has to offer.  However, the demands are extremely high.  If you can't take criticism and constantly having higher levels of management watching your back, then don't work there.  Everyday there is something new, but there are many frustrated customers you must deal with.  Also, the work schedule is all over the place...no consistency.  Pretty much the only thing you can rely on is a plethora of confused customers with billing or device troubleshooting issues.  Maybe it was just the store I worked in, but it is a highly stressful environment, primarily mentally.  But, if you can handle pressure and thrive off making another sale and don't mind having to call customer service/tech support all the time and being transferred all over the country, then you'll do great."
good,"Verizon offered excellent opportunities, training with certifications and work environment.  One of the most difficult responsibilities I had was converting call processors from the old to the new systems."
good,fun workplace with vending machines and a break area.  great coworkers with great ethic.  hardest part of the job was leaving.  easiest part of the job was coming in everyday.
good,"Verizon is a Fortune 500 company that provides local, national and global communications services to enterprise, government and carrier customers. My normal work day included ensuring overall progress of assigned project from inception to implementation. It also included reviewing with and providing consultative advice to management on all project aspects to secure buy-in. As a project manager I would monitor daily tasks and project assignments in progress ensuring project schedule is being met."
good,Verizon Wireless is an excellent corporation. It is fast paced and everyone truely lives by the corporate credo.
good,"1.	Team Building Skill"
good,"Training was excellent.  My first job in tech support and I really knew what I was doing when I hit the floor.  When I didn't understand something, a manager was totally willing to help and very friendly, no matter who it was I asked.  The pay was great, and being able to take paid sick days or vacation days off on a whim was a great perk.  I felt like the company cared about my well-being and I equally cared about the company.  Co-workers were friendly.  Hardest part of the job was doing sales and understanding the systems, but I hear that they've stopped pushing sales so hard in the tech support department.  It's hard to sell things to angry people.  TWC compensates its employees with holiday pay, loads of cable-related merch and even commission on sales across any department."
good,"Typical day at work was very fast paced, had deadlines to meet."
good,"Supporting end users of a 400 sites and 5 regional data centers."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A typical day for me at Verizon Wireless would be walking in smiling and telling everyone goodmorning because I had to be in a good mood because I would be the first face that the customers would see as they walked into the store and I aslso wanted to Make sure that everyone else was in a good mood. I was responsibel for checking all customers in with a tablet that displayed the order of which each waiting customer was in to see a sales representative. I also handed out flyers and discussed the stores special promotions with each customer. Sometimes I helped with minor phone issues to keep the customers form waiting in line. I really loved this job and hated that it was only temporary. Everyone was nice, the managment was friendly and I loved the work envornment."
good,"Review customer accounts, set up new accounts, upsold products such as television, internet, and data products"
good,"As regular work depends on team work and frienship. We work as a team and take care of the promotion in a good and entratain labor. People enjoy it ! Our manager is always busy but always with a smile. "

good,A lot of great people flexible overall good place. Learned alot from there made friends.
good,"Verizon Wireless is an Excellent Company with Great Benefits, Culture and opportunities for Career Advancement"
good,"My typical day required me to be independent checking my monthly progress and my sales goals of the day. My main focus was to assist current customers with bill pays,saving them money on their bills and establishing new additions to their accounts. I also promoted our company to gain new accounts and happy customers giving them knowledge about our devices and products that we offer. The challenging part about the job sometimes is talking to senior citizens about technology. Its like talking to your own grandparents. The most enjoyable thing about working for any company is helping customers learn something new. "
good,"good people and fun, enjoyable , fast leaning culture "
good,"	Responsible for resolving data equipment and service issues via 800 line for both internal and external customers"

good,".Take inbound calls  service  customer accounts  and trouble shoot"
good,"great job to work.Great benefits, co workers. The commission could be better"
good,Verizon had implemented a highly automated call center experience for their customers in my Small and Medium Business department. I would contact the customer to verify the order for communications services and then check for technical correctness using several custom-built programs. If I felt they might benefit from one of our featured offers and bundles I would present them with that option. Writing the order for our field forces was sometimes problematic and required impromptu workarounds shared with first my team leader and then other reps if he approved. This was often the most difficult part of the job. My favorite part was calling the customer for feedback on their installation and operation of their new service. I was proud to receive several letters of commendation written by satisfied customers.
good,"401k-the best match up to 6%"
good,Great job love it. I hate I lost this job its really easy and they pay you boat loads of money but you have to be focused
good,Verizon offers an incomparable benefits and pay package.  The atmosphere in the last few years was declining when it came to day to day rules and regulations.
good,"A typical day at Verizon..log in, handle about 4-6 calls a min., deal with all types of customers, successfully turn an irate customer to a happy customer. I learned that people depended on me to help them and that made the job easier, I'm always willing to help, and provide fast and friendly service. Management was great always helpful and thoroughly trained me when needed. My co-workers were amazing, we all dealt with the same thing on a daily basis, we were all there to uplift and help each other. Hardest part of the job was having that one customer that took everything out on you, but having a customer be very appreciative of the service you give made up for that. I enjoyed my job listening to different stories of each caller and trying to help them as much as possible."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a great company, however as a customer specialist you must know the job of multiple departments.  In my position I answer billing questions; give credits when warranted; use account analysis tool to recommend plan changes; add global features and discuss global price plans; conduct tier 1 troubleshooting; sell accessories, features, and price plans; prevent churn or disconnects; pass surveys with a score of 8 or higher; process returns, upgrades, etc.  Ultimately my job as a CS Rep is to resolve all of the customers issues in 1 call which means I have to be knowledgeable of all departments."

good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits, and the overall advancement of employee opportunities, with tuition reimbursement."
good,Very busy and hard work. Barely had time to mingle with coworkers as the job demanded a lot of your time right away. Hardest part was knocking on doors even when the weather was bad. Most enjoyable part is being able to meet new people and make new friends
good,Verizon pays amazingly well. They have financed both my undergraduate degree and now my masters degree. Every year I receive an annual bonus and a raise. That being said you have to work for what you get. This is not the easiest job and in order to move up you have to be willing to pay your dues. If you work hard and get your name out there you will be rewarded well.
good,Enjoyed the benefits and rewards. Was recognized for good work and the company has total integrity in all things. Cutting edge technology and excellent systems...very good at rolling out new things.
good,Work Consists of 3 to 4 12 hour shifts on alternating weeks.  Absolutely a great learning environment if the person takes advantage

good,"I was very happy with working for Verizon Wireless from 1996-2006.  I moved up in the company with various departments as a call center representative to Resource Management positions while I was employed with them.  I never would have left, if my husband and I had not decided to start our own business."
good,During the time I worked for Verizon Wireless. I originally worked for Alltel. This was bought by Verizon Wireless. They are a great company and always trying to improve.
good,"While in the core of the technology driven world, Verizon Wireless is number one when it comes to all things wireless. While working for Verizon, I encounter solving problems, learning about new technology, how to prioritize and manage my life, working in a competitive sales driven environment keeps our teams motivated to earn more and create a positive environment. The hardest part of the day is assisting the customers whom do not want to be assisted and have had encountered situations in which they feel they cannot be helped in. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day putting smiles on customer's faces after you have accomplished assisting them in whatever their technological needs are and exceeding their expectations."
good,"Working at Verizon was a wonderful experience. It really prepared me for my job now. I walked away a book of knowledge when it comes to management. Before management I was a union member which now works to my benefit since I now manage union members. "

good,"Responsible of assisting customer with there wireless needs be it a upgrade to a new or activate new service or assist with getting there questions answer billing technical or general question ,make sure customers need are satisfied"
good,"work consisted of answering 40-60 calls a day.  Customers would call in about their bill, how to use their phone, technical issues, promotions, starting service with the company, etc.  As a customer service representative, we are the front line.  We try to solve the customers problems and resolve their reason for calling in but if we are unable to we get them to another department that specifically caters to their issue.   Management was wonderful.  Very uplifting and positive attitudes were promoted daily.  The hardest part of the job was getting a question you weren't sure of the answer,  It required research while building report with the customer at the same time and remembering to value their time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment in general.  Very nice people to work with and always an energetic and positive atmosphere."
good,I enjoyed the challenge of working in a competive environment.
good,"Fast paced environment driven by the latest technology and mobile devices. Learning is forever a constant working for Verizon Wireless and the way in which the material is delivered is usually effective. For the most part, the management staff gives clear direction and supports the sales staff by walking the walk or leading by example. The team was made up of a variety of different personalities that would sometimes cycle between other locations. For the most part, everyone was able to work together to acheive our overall common goals while working toward individual quotas. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with escalated customer issues due to simple mistakes made by sales reps. Being everywhere all the time was the hardest part. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I was an effective leader and that my team and the customers we served appreciated my/our efforts."
good,"I worked at a retail location that is open seven days a week. We try to offer a more personal setting working with the customer to resolve issues and find the proper device. We do not just sell cellular devices and accessories, but offer a wide range of technological equipment and assistance with said devices. We worked in a team of five, including our manager, with two to three employees working at a single time. My team was highly efficient, helpful, and overall enjoyable to work with. Learning and having to explain the latest technology was the hardest and most enjoyable aspect of my job."
good,Verizon Land Line Business has given me a good life.
good,It gave me a great opportunity to sharpen my customer service skills. My co-workers and I made a great team and were allowed to bounce information off of one another which made it easier to flow thru difficult calls.
good,A typical day of work at the verizon wireless ampitheatre is full of fun. Although it does get tough when the guests consume way to much alcohol. My coworkers are all friendly and outgoing. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to listen to various genres of music weekly.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"Great company to work for but the hours are awful in the call center environment, overtime all the time at your leisure"
good,My day begins with setting daily goals for my team and reviewing the prevoius day. I then contact other locations to ensure they are up and running. While waiting for customers I make folow up calls to existing customers as well as to customers that my team has had cotact with. My team and I are on location to sell our service and that is the major focus of the day. I lead by example. I cannot expect more of my team then I expect of myself. The most difficult aspect of the job is dealing with irate customers which leads to the most enjoyable part of the job which is to ensure that customer concerns have been addressed and the customer leaves knowing that we are there to assist them. I get great pleasure knowing that I have been able to reconcile customer concerns.
good,"A typical day was about 60+ calls, dealt with various calls, troubleshooting, billing issues, explaining devices offered."
good,"Verizon was my favorite job. From them I learned a great deal about how a large company works and how each department within the company coordinates with one another. I was a marketing intern at the Orange County corporate office. I worked on graphic design, data entry, conference calls with other offices, and travelling around America. When traveling I would work with my team to market new products coming off the line to vendors like LG and Motorola. My co-workers were there to train me how to design and market their products. I enjoyed travelling a lot."
good,"Verizon Wireless is an excellent company to work for. They offer very competitive benefits. I've never worked for a company that actually promoted Career progression as much as Verizon Wireless. From day one, a manager will sit down with you and discuss your goals and help you develop a career path. I worked here for a little over 3 years but unfortunately our center closed and we were given the option to relocate or take a severance."

good,"Reviewing sales goals, many upgrades, deadlines to meet. Many ""fire-drills"" weekly."
good,Management was good they keep it interesting and funny to work there. The co-worker upbeat and helpful attitude helped the day go smoothly.
good,"good place to work for, strong company, i was part of a franchise that Verizon sponsors so i had some issues."
good,"A typical day at work includes many friendly people trying to do well for customer, company and self. Working often with multiple types of analysis including electronic troubleshooting, financial and personal/business operations management."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I really enjoyed working with all the staff and management.
good,Worked during 15 years in all technical aspects of the company in Venezuela
good,"I managed, coached and developed 30 plus technical support representatives. Monitored statistical performance, and adherence to company standards by indentifying areas of excellence and areas of improvement."
good,"At Verizon Wireless, I handled several inbound calls from customers regarding their cellular phone bills, pricing plans, as well as all complaints and concerns regarding their phones. This would include but not limited to trouble shooting, activations, etc."
good,"This was a inbound call positon which provided someone a rich variety of experience with customers. The day may involve billing and service questions and solutions, selling solutions or extended problem solving solution yet each brought a different approach as a direct awareness of the customer whom a person worked to resolve issues. Management tended to promote from within, especially those with years ahead for career advancement. The negativity of thought by many workers is/was balanced by benefits offered and employee appreciation events. The best part of the job was working with customers, whether irate or happy. The worst part of the position was the performance evaluations that were geared toward company feedback versus employee feedback, thus leaving out in most instances ""what YOU did right"" or the actions taken prior by other representatives that the feedback representative resolved correctly."
good,"A typical day at work is preparation, being prepared to resolve any issue at any given time. You must be willing to listen attentively and exude patience and understanding."
good,Provide sales/technical support information for business and customer support.
good,"I still maintain my wireless service with VZW even though I am no longer employed there. The tuition assistance program was very comprehensive. However, a career in retail was no longer enticing to me."
good,Very good company to work for and pay is good. I wish I could go back.
good,"I regret ever leaving Verizon Wireless. Their pay and benefits package rivals that anyone. In fact, I would wager that their ""total rewards"" beats out 9 out of every 10 companies you measure it against. My only concerns is that promotional opportunities are dififcult to come by and there is a greater sense of cronyism where a select few are given promotions without a true competitive applications process. I guess that happens if you have a company where people are generally satisfied with their careers so turnover at the mid-level and higher positions is very low, so opportunities to move up are often few and far between. However, they take care of their employees and the culture is one that is very appreciative and grateful to the average employee."
good,"This is the best company I ever work. Good Compensation and Benefits, good job environment, friendly coworkers and good training program."
good,I have worked for almost a year now at Verizon and the company has great benefits and pay. I have enjoyed working at Verizon and learned a lot of networking.
good,Its a great place to work with excellent benefits. work life balance is a plus. great team work. great trainings and opportunity to grow.
good,"Excellent call center environment. High paced, not for whiners."
good,Worked for Verizon (formerly GTE) for 22 yrs. Worked in various departments from 611 to E911 and M.A.R.K. working with various supervisors and peers. I would probably still be there if the office that I worked and the office closed down or if I hadn't had a stroke in 2001.
good,Verizon is a great place to work. Great benefits and plenty of opportunities to progress. They care about their people and take pride in providing a workplace with diversity.
good,"Stability and ability to learn and move up within the company.  Lifework balance sometimes difficult with meeting required deadlines.  Enjoyed working with my colleagues, Consultants and customers.  Great incentive plan for employees and management.  Outstanding company benefits.  System issues and implementation problems causes negative NPS scores."
good,Must be somewhat social this can determine the success. Fun culture very performance based work structure. Patience will achieve more than force in this setting.
good,"No Comments - I took the buy out as advancement was very difficult to attain after a certain level. I was with the company for five years , the benefits were great."
good,helping people out around work and home along with what they do at home is a make you feel good type thing and it's not for everybody. I enjoyed it a lot and would work again.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,You have to stay on your game with technology. You must have a customer first attitude along with presenting and selling with honesty to be successful.
good,"I learned a lot while I was working with Verizon, very good company to work for, well paid, plenty top notch incentives, enjoy my job everyday , always prioritize my customer ."
good,Training for me was great. I was sent to training every time a new product came out. My customers that I serviced always requested me back.and spoke highly of me. Verizon was the best company I ever worked for.
good,I enjoyed my time at Verizon my manager was a great person and very easy to work for.  The schedule was very flexible.  the hardest part of the job was the ever change targets. Projects were created and dropped very frequently.
good,"Love the people, the work, and the mamangement, however as I had never done this tyoe of work before I was a much slower learner, and their standards were one of the greatest challenges I had ever faced. Over all the job taught me so much about Verizon as a corporation, as well as how the Union works, but above all, I learned so much about myself I couldn't be happier for the experience!"
good,I have learned that you have to have patience. Help the customer in the best way possible. Always stay positive in any situation. Meeting all needs as well.
good,"Lot's of changes happening with Verizon however they really have it going on for career advancement, benefits, and opportunity. The culture is amazing. I wish i could get a job with their HR department. Probably no one leaves. Too good a job."
good,"Verizon is a nice company to  work for after they updated to 2.0 in work culture it became more flexible I heard, Management should be appreciated for this"
good,"Team oriented work place. Open floor, easy access, sometimes problem with close parking, but shuttle is provided. Overall, positive place to work at. ."
good,"I worked as a contract from March to August, it depends on the manager you work for. When I was an employee in 2002-2010 it was a great place to work."
good,"On a scale of 1-10, I would give them a 8. I would rather chat online than answer phone calls. But both was easy and helped with communication skills."
good,I loved working for Verizon. Due to unforeseen circumstances I had to leave (personal reasons). The company expects a lot but pays well and takes care of their employees.
good,"A good place to work. Work life balance is not that bad. If I can suggest one area of improvement have the management develop their team slightly better. Maybe have more training because some people feel discouraged when they are trying to meet some goals, while they are not impossible They are a bit challenging"
good,"Solid company with many opportunities to advance, learn and develop.  Leadership seems to be on the same page from top to bottom when it came to initiatives around products marketing, profitability, and strategic planning"
good,"Greeting the customer picking three life facts about them for cross selling purposes. Meeting metrics from plans, add on, and devices. To asking,if they have a business account they would like to open. Running credit setting up there account and devices."
good,A typical day at work involves assisting customers with their needs. I have learned to use company provided resources to find solutions that fit the needs of the customer. Management always provides the support needed to assist agents helping our customers. The most challenging part of my job is when I don’t have a ready-made solution for my customer so I have to be creative and think outside of the box.
good,"A typical day at work would involve speaking to about 80 customers a day. I learned a lot about call center operations and CRM systems. You will be micro-managed down to how many calls per day you take, first call resolution, and quality assurance. The hardest part of the job was dealing with different issues all day."
good,I love working there I was there for quit long it gave me lot as of sales experience learn so many things my team member was great they all help each other
good,I had the opportunity to be able to grow within the company and learn many ways on how to improve my skills. The company encourages you to try different locations for the fact that you are getting out of your comfort zone and being able to expand your knowledge.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I work as a tech support rep. I take calls related to fixing the service, or device related issues. Help with global support as well. Typical day at work, we have a quick meeting, then on the phones. 1 hour break or if you choose, you can have a 30 minute lunch. Great culture, holiday events, parades, etc. Best part of day is that we can play music on a portable speaker and it gives a nice calm to the back to back calls. Most challeging part of the job is the task of helping people who are frustrated, or confused and they may not be willing to cooperate or unable to. Management is cool, I've had good ones and bad ones. Learned lots of patience. Great culture though and they keep employees updated with lots of training."
good,"Great place to work, job security not as high in the rural or smaller population areas - as I found out when our local call center closed.  That was my only negative experience with the company.  They did offer relocation and assistance with moving costs."
good,the workplace always had lots of activities and games daily. great environment to work in. Very friendly colleagues. promoted success. Lots of opportunity for advancement.
good,"I loved my job, customers were the hard part to deal with. Verizon did everything they could to make our work environment stress free because they understood the stress of the job."
good,"I worked in the call center. Tight nit employee environment. Compensation and benefits were awesome. My base pay was 60K. One year I made a little over 100K through sales opportunities. The company engages its employees with cool meetings, potlucks, and games for prizes. Ongoing training's to keep you updated with new innovations in the company. Ample room for growth."
good,I worked as a Customer Service Representative with Verizon. My shift was from 12 midnight to 8 in the morning from Mondays to Fridays. They offered us one (1) month training before the actual job. The HR Department was the best and the Management was really fun and accommodating.
good,I was with VZW for about 20 yrs and have no complaints about the management nor the company. I would recommend this company to anyone that wants a good career and is able to travel.
good,"A typical day at Verizon.  Early team pull up's to review previous day stats and set the pace for the current day.  I'll pull the team adherence from the previous day results to address immediately and set goal for the day.  Perform 1st call of the day by executing side by side monitoring to acknowledge the best call to start the day off.  Continue to Coach, Train and Motivate."
good,"Verizon bought the company I had worked for the past 17 years and while at first it we all thought Verizon would lay us off, they didn't. Not right away. "
good,"Accenture is the best place to work for business professionals."
good,It was a awesome place to work if I was not relocating I would have stayed. Competitive pay above average and lots of days of and flex time. Co workers were awesome.
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Verizon. They have great training and supply you with all the tools you need.The pay are benefits are second to none
good,"Verizon Wireless was a great company to work for. It provided everything i needed to be successful. If i could, I would love to work with another company like Verizon"
good,"Fantastic people to work with, I had the pleasure to work with a lot of small business owners and different people in different areas of the government,"
good,From the sales associates to the management team everyone was helpful. Even in a very competitive sales environment team work was evident. Opportunities for growth and advancement were only limited by an individuals desire. Expectations and sales goals are high but realistic.
good,A typical day for me was spent working with my direct reports and sales professionals to solve problems. This was a sales support role and took many years to gather the knowledge of who to go to for what.  It's a fast paced environment and change is inevitable.  The culture was great.  Many people took an interest in my success. Very refreshing.
good,"Verizon really takes care of it's employees and it is a great environment to work in. I left the position as it was not the location I wanted to be in nor the role I wanted to advance in. A different opportunity came up, but I have seen many former peers grow in this company."
good,"A typical day at work 8 to 10 hours"
good,Great opportunities if you drive yourself to meet the demanding goals. This is not a job for those who lack motivation and the drive to make money. Work life balance is a little off. You have to be committed to making the money. sometimes you will stay late or arrive early just to make your sales.
good,"Typical work day is busy from start of your tour until the end of your tour. Working at Verizon  taught us how to self-led and how to interact with others. Workplace culture is collaboration. Hardest part of job was making sure everyone turn in the work schedule on time in order to be paid for the week, etc.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with such a diverse team."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is an AMAZING place to work but the call center life is not for everyone. Be  sure you understand what the job consists of. That it is a lot of sitting, and you are generally dealing with unhappy people as people don't call customer service for fun."
good,I actually liked my job at Verizon.  Yes I put in long hours but that was the job and I knew this when I applied for it.  There are a lot of job duties as a Supervisor so I had to make sure that I was organized.  Verizon's culture was outstanding and the company always went out of their way to constantly improve their culture.  I have to say I really liked working in a corporate atmosphere - Why? - because I like policies and procedures and Verizon made sure that all were treated fairly.   Probably the hardest part of my job was when one of my associates did not get a good survey from a customer.  I had to make sure that I based my feedback on the personality of the rep. For example what type of feedback worked best for that individual and how best to motivate that rep to improve. At the same time this was the most enjoyable part of my job especially when the rep left the meeting motivated.   I really liked listening to reps recorded calls and scoring them because I learned a lot just listening to how the rep interacted with the customer including choice of words and their tone. I was very sad and caught by surprise when I was part of the group of supervisors that were laid off.  It was a very sad day for me.
good,"My typical day starts and ends with helping customers make the right decisions on products and services, the job taught me a whole lot about human beings with different personalities, adaptability and understanding."
good,"It was a very monotonous job and every day had to do the same routine. I had to learn all about the devices since I was more in the technical support side. Having a month of capacitation for it."
good,Verizon had a great tuition aid program that paid for my bachelor's degree and all my master's degrees. My supervisor was very supportive and awarded me outstanding annual performance reviews and bonuses. Verizon is a great place to work and move up the management ranks as I did.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, I just don't like the fact that you have to bid for your shifts and that your shift only last for 6 months each time. It's not the best for someone that has minor children at home. You're not there to help them with homework and spend much time with them depending on the shift you have. The benefits are excellent. When it comes to management, sometimes it's not the best."
good,"As a intern, you get to experience all of the areas on how to run a event. The culture of the place is very good. Easy to learn the material and they are willingly to help. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is talking to the promoter and getting everything they need for the show. Then going out there with the ops crew and helping them put the stage together. That was my favorite part of doing the internship."
good,"Verizon provides training on different product line, so that the customer can have there needs met.  Verizon is very good at creating  custom solution that addresses the clients business goal while working with the customers team to fine tune the needs of the business. Verizon has done this for more than 35 years, and have seen every type of training request, and they have done it all. That is why they are number ! in the Telecom industry."
good,Atmosphere was amazing.  Everyone came to work excited to start crushing it for their team.  We had team compositions within each department. Management was very approachable and listened to concerns.  They cared how each employee was doing.  They gave a lot of opportunity to move up within the company.  I unfortunately didn't last long due to becoming pregnant.  I had to relocate to Texas from Arizona.  The company is fantastic and my only complaint is there needed to be more floor managers available for when a Call Rep needed an escalation or refund added to an account.  Seemed like that hindered call times quite a bit waiting for the customers needs to be met.
good,I would recommend this Company and posistion to anyone looking to settle into a long term career..  The education salary and benefits are in support of a good work / life balance.
good,great company to work for.  Working in retail sales is always a challenge to keep a good work/life balance considering the job duties and hours.  Verizon has many advancement options.
good,Verizon is great company to work for. They invest in the knowledge of their employees. Learned alot while working there. They have incorporate business with innovative employee training.
good,Verizon is a very diverse company. There is room for advancement and the benefits are amazing. Coverage starts the day you begin working. Reviews and raises are given yearly.
good,Everything about working for verizon was great except the actual work. I got burnt out on customer service aspect. Great training and team environment.
good,"The work was stressful do the customers. The hours were a little long. We had to work different shifts, which wasn't my favorite. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a lot of upset clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was my team members."
good,"The best part of the job is feeling the true essence of what teamwork is suppose to be. We all helped one another as well as the customer when the customer needed us. Due to Micro Managing it has sculpt me to be more disciplined and assisted me in perfecting time management in my every day tasks. I worked in the spanish and english department of sales within the company and have relocated a couple of times due to my previous job. Loyal, Dependable, Great communication skills and currently I am fluent in English and Spanish."
good,This was the Call Center of Verizon Wireless. They provide a cafeteria with a variety of food choices. There is a walk path around the perimeter. They provide exciting team member pow wows to encourage and excite the employees on new products and services.
good,Customer service at Verizon was at times can be exhausting but in the best way. It was fun competitive and the working environment was peaceful. If unfortunately they didn't close the plant down I'd still be working there.
good,they have there stressful times but overall a good employment facility. the pay is great   get paid weekly.  the only bad thing is when it's time to negotiate a new contract   be prepared for a strike
good,"Great company for eager, personable people wanting to learn and refine their selling skills. For a company to be commission only, you can't make a living on lay down sales."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Great pay and benefits. And most of the people are great to work with. Job itself can be quite stressful, especially with escalated customers. Some inconsistentcy in leadership at times."
good,"good job, taught alot. Good place to make money and you develop your selling skills. Would recommend it to anyone trying to pursue a career in sales or sales management."

good,Working for Verizon has been a great experience for me. I learned a lot about Line Man work. I had met lots of great people. The environment is good and working as a team had showed me that I can definitely be a great help for other.
good,Overall I've learned a lot from having the opportunity to work for verzion. My duties as a financial coordinator were to assist customer with ways and save on there bill.
good,"The benefits and compensation packages are very competitive."
good,I was with Verizon Wireless for 4+ years and overall I loved the company. It was the work itself that was stressful. The repetitiveness of the job became a mental challenge for a lot of people for the company.
good,Verizon Wireless provided a good family life work balance.  The people were not only my co-workers but my family.   A typical day would include running several reports which included financial results and distribute those numbers to Senior Management.
good,A fast-paced and competitive environment that has a budding culture. If you love being a part of a team then this is a job for you. You have to be self-motivated as well.
good,"Great company with the ability to move up if you want, they offer a great commission structure and offer fantastic training for employees and amazing benefits."
good,"Considering that I am a long time veteran of customer support roles via call centers, I've never worked with a family that has even remotely compared to the Verizon family. Need time off? They give it to you. Want more money? They provide the options for advancement. Like to further your education? They provide assistance and have college councilors onsite. They even have a cafe that is fully staffed and a professional chef that regularly provides unique recipes. A full gym with lockers, showers, and fitness assistants always available. Pool tables and lounge rooms, monthly games and activities to relieve the stress, as well as regularly sending management and morale teams through the aisles with prizes and snacks while dancing and playing music to keep the smiles on faces. It will be hard for me to NOT compare any other company to them for the rest of my working life."
good,Verizon Wireless work hard to make sure that the employee's voices are heard. Enjoyed the flex time and overtime during the holidays. It is a good place to work.
good,"Great place to work, people were amazing and very friendly. Always felt like part of the family, very laid back culture and management treated you like family."
good,"Great work environment, there is no micromanagement, as we are allowed to run our own business, and management provides support to close deals and navigate processes."
good,Pay is competitive with great matching 401k and 15 days of PTO for new hires. Laid back culture. A lack of leadership from management. Great work can be unnoticed.
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for."
good,Work included interaction with others of different cultures and areas in the US. Gave room for improvement and advancement on a regular occasion. The benefits of working here were great.

Definitely was one of my favorite places to work for.

good,Verizon was a good call center environment with consistent incoming calls into the technical support department.  Allowing customers to explain their concerns and taking the time to understand the root cause of any concerns and resolving all issues and ending the call on a very positive note was very rewarding.
good,"Miss the action always something new . Diverse group.   Traveling plus, training always available.  Tuition reimbursement.  Easy to advance.  Positive working environment"
good,"Working at Verizon Wireless was a great experience for me.  Great pay, benefits and career advancement possibilities, but it was difficult for someone (me) who is not well-versed in technology products.  I made some great friends and learned a great deal.  It's important to be good at customer service because many customers come in upset about their bill or broken phone and you need to know how to calm them down."
good,Good company to work for/ they are always looking for leaders and will promote people based on hard work/ and leadership skills. They were very transparent/ never confused on what had to be done.
good,"Laid back environment, very understanding manager, independent contributing type of work so there is no micro managing, come to work, finish your tasks, rinse and repeat.

good,"really great place to work, friendly and family environment. everybody there is always ready to help and wanting to see you succeed. Benefits are great as well."
good,"Verizon was a competitive place to work. There was a sales quota to meet every month. The pay was great if you met or exceeded those goals. If you did not hit your target , you received a part of the commission and of course a salary."
good,"Coming from my previous department here at Verizon, working here in RCMAC has been a Godsend. Great work culture, relief of being pressured as well as flexibility to work around your life events. Working here has definitely extending my years with the company."
good,"The salary and benefits for a customer service representative are fantastic $35,000 and full benefits. If you can get off of the phone get off the phone. Its fast paced and stressful."
good,"I was employed with Verizon for 10+ years. Benefits were superb, great life/work balance for the position, salary was above average. I would work there again if the opportunity was a good match."
good,"A great company to work for. Can be stressful if you do not manage your time, time off and interactions with customers. Most of the management is very helpful and promotes job progression. Pay is great and they offer several ways to earn more through overtime and incentives. The culture is great they care about their employees and looking to make sure they are enjoying their job."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,great place to work with pay.. Schedules are based off a shift bid so your performance is important if you want a great shift. Must be okay with talking and sitting down for this job
good,"Loved working for Verizon, they had a clear vision and product offering.  Perhaps a but slow to react to new products and leading indicators for its core products."
good,I'm constantly learning and getting better at my trade. Its the same equipment that we are required to maintain and check but we also do various other things like plumbing and electrical.
good,"This is a place i learn what real customer service should look like and, Training was of up most importance to keep a good team going. The culture was of something i=new on the horizon at all times. To be the most innovated in the market place. I also learn that to be a great representative is to always have the answer or know where and how to go and find it."
good,"Enjoyed working for Verizon, definitely an employee conscious company. Hardest part would be managing manpower and balancing work load to meet customer expectations"
good,"Taking in bound calls, trouble shooting phones, computers, broad band devices. Thinking outside the box to assist customers with their needs.  I love the people that I work with its the best part of the job.  The pay and benefits are great."

good,"Great place to learn and get experience in the FTTx space, especially in the field. Every day presents new challenges to exercise customer service, team work and technical expertise.Great company to work for but also depends on the channel that you are in. Working in the retail channel can be very stressful but also very rewarding and good compensation"

good,"Great place for someone to get a career started with customer service, very friendly and management is always there to help.  What i learned here is how to handle different types of situations with different types of people."
good,"Fast paced, organized, fun environment, with lots of opportunity to learn and grow the business. Management team is stellar and ready to roll up their sleeves and collaborate. Culture is good and lots of perks, great benefits and smart people to work with. Hardest part of the job is not being able to get things done as quickly as in a smaller organization. Most enjoyable part was great sense of accomplishment as one would own a part of the business end to end and opportunity to bring to market cutting edge technology."
good,"Excellence,  hard work and Volunteerism are all part of the culture of Verizon. The Verizon Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Verizon Communications, donating about $70 million per year to nonprofit organizations, with a focus on education, domestic violence prevention, and energy management."

good,"Although there may be times when we are under pressure by the customers, Verizon makes it a top priority to keep employees engaged by having activities available during down time or even by scheduling time off for a couple of hours to participate. The benefits are exceptional and probably couldn't get any better. There are occasions when customers are irate and it is hard to get them to calm down where they can be assisted, most supervisors are able to step in to make the situation easier for employees."

good,"Verizon had the best working environment ,they provided a career building presentation for first 10 days to built our confidence and to stay positive during the project. I remember an incident where  few employees was facing trouble during an on going project but the leader guided them so correctly that they did not felt like they were in touch with the boss but they treated them as a friend."
good,Verizon is a great place to work with great people and great benefits. Also they treat their employees very well. great room for advancement with the company
good,"I worked from 7am to 3:30 Pm, Monday through Friday. I worked in New Jersey and had to deal with elements as this was an outside plant position.

good,"I worked there for 3.5 years. They provide amazing pay and benefits. The job is slightly stressful as I was a Technical Support Coordinator. The way that calls are routed is sort of broken. Customer service is supposed to take over billing and account related calls, but many times you were faced with a transfer to Tech Support about billing calls because reps were incompetent with completing their own job duties. That was the worst part. Other than that, the job is great. People are great. Pay is fantastic."

good,This job was a great experience. You have to have alot of patience and a happy attitude all the time.
good,Verizon is an excellent company to work for and had great benefits along with options to help balance life/job. We had a lot of training on a regular basis not only for the products we offered but also ways to assist customers to provide them the best experience. The hardest part of the job was when customers were given several options according to their situation and they wanted a resolution that was not possible.
good,An 8 hr shift of outside sales great team of co-workers. Hardest part of the job at times weather conditions. Best part of the job interacting with different customers everyday

Management and our group of splicers were a close group. the hardest part of the job was working out in the weather conditions.  I enjoyed the job because there was no supervisor standing over your shoulder. You were given an assignment and you had to be responsible enough to complete the assignment on time and correctly
good,Available Upon Request. Most of it is In My Resume or Cover Letter
good,The managers/supervisors were great and very encouraging.  Sometimes the customers were hard to work with as they were adjusting to a switch in companies.  I like the fast paced work and the fact that I was never not busy.
good,"I worked for this company when it was GTE...I've did many different jobs during my 32 year stint starting as an operator (the lowest paying job) and ended my career at top level pay as an hourly employee.  I worked as a tester on special circuits and I loved the job.  I was also active in the union and while there's a lot of smack talk about unions these days all I can say is that working in a non-union shop is scary.  I didn't realize how great it was working at Verizon until I went to work somewhere else.  The hardest part of this job was meeting attendance guidelines...they're tough it and I was always on the bubble.  I enjoyed my job as tester, my co-workers for the most part were an intelligent, fun group of people to be around even though we did complain a lot.  Near the end when Verizon shut down our jobs we were all pretty unhappy."
good,"Again, I love the people I worked with. Management started out okay in the begining.  Afterwards, they didnt care about the people only productivity."

Assist with billing, tech support, and orders. In the almost eight years that I was employed, I learned how to multitask with various positions. How to make connections with my customers on every call. My co-workers were always helpful and we were a team. The hardest part of the job was being limited to the amount of time spent on a call. Every call is different to to limit the time spent was sometimes challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction knowing that I was able to educate a customer on something they weren't aware of previously."

Able to multi-task by listening to customers , sharing information, trouble shooting issues,  integrating information from multiple online resources , and provide innovative, individualized solutions a timely manner"

good,"I enjoy working for Verizon Wireless Business.  I get to interact with many different businesses and learn about many different industries.  Being a Business Account Executive, my success is completely dependent on my drive and desire to succeed. In many ways it is like running my own business.  I don't punch a clock.  Rather, I have to be self motivated and schedule my own appointments.  I love the autonomy and am successful in this environment."
good,"I took inbound calls ranging from tech support to billing and sometimes upgrading customers phones. The day went by pretty quick depending on how fast the calls were coming in. Policy and procedure was the hardest part of the job if the customer didn't like what they heard they would immediately ask for a supervisor, which was frustrating at times."
good,"The place I worked at, was newer, so not many people knew about it. So it was a slow place. Slow foot traffic. But it was a fun place to work! Very friendly co-workers, management was awesome! The hardest part of the job was getting to know every product that is being sold and providing the right customer service to the customers.

good,"A typical day is visiting locations and training employees on Verizon Wireless products and services. It is important to build relationships amongst different departments to help bridge the gap and leading teams to one unified goal. I work close with the management teams to provided group training and one on one training. I learned how to motivate people and create a culture amongst many different teams. I have built great relationships with my team of six co-workers. We help each other with any matter they arises in the field.

good,I am very happy at Verizon wireless. they have awesome benefits for families and many opportunities for advancement. really my only complain is the schedules they give at the call center. they work for most people but i have young children and the hours are hard and you have to bid and change schedules every 6 months
good,I loved working there. They appreciated my skill set. I worked very hard and was rewarded for my efforts. I only got out because they closed my call center.
good,"This is just what I assumed phone work would be like. Leadership was definitely there for your well being, but the daily grind of costumers complaining about everything under the sun became monotonous."

good,"Answering calls about mobile devices such as wireless phone plans, international calling plans, troubleshooting devices upgrades, making payments or payment arrangements. There are a lot of different types of reasons a person can call. Calls can be short or long as an hour or more. The management is great and listens to employees, Training starts within a Verizon building but you take first call from the comfort of your own home, so work culture is what you make it there. I love my work culture..lol. The best part of my job is working from MY HOME!!"
good,I am really proud of my time working for Verizon as a contractor in Dominican Republic. I don't know if this is going to help as I was not a Verizon employee but I can say that even as a contractor you can feel that this is a company with great ideas.

good,management is very professional and encourages everyone to excel within the company. The company provides all the needed resources to help you become successful and stands by an open door policy.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at verizon and my co-workers were very friendly."
good,"The management was always looking out for the employees that worked under them. Corporate seemed to make the usual amount of bigger decisions that directly impacted the employees, so we all had to adjust or leave. The last decision to convert the call center to an at home agent call center was the same. We adjusted or we severance packaged it out of there. I would have rather gone home and been a at home agent. My internet was not fast enough to meet the requirements."
good,"Fantastic Call Center Job. Competitive Pay, world class benefits.Hours at first are hard to balance, but better shifts are made available with tenure."

Plenty of work/life balance options for all kinds of schedules. That being said the pressure for certain objectives can drive some people a bit hard. If applying keep in mind that they will work with you but you have to put forth the effort"
good,"Everyday there would be something new to do, from working in a manhole to working in a high-rise building under construction. You would work with amazing team members to get your tasks finished in a timely manner and have time to yourself."
good,The best thing i liked about verizon was its flat culture. We dont have any kind of working pressure in this company. I would suggest everyone to work with verizon.
good,Everyone was great and this place had a lot to offer as far as expanding the knowledge goes. The QA manager land developers listened to each and every single needs and answered accordingly.

good,It was a good job to have except the pay could have been better. If you didn't reach a certain  point on commission you wouldn't get paid out on it. So then you would just make hourly which wasn't much
good,Call center that was rep driven. Lots of room for advancement and overtime. Training program given to all new hires to successful complete your daily duties.
good,Verizon treats their employees very well with all of the benefits and opportunities for advancement. It has gotten more challenging as this industry has now become a commodity. That coupled with tough to achieve quotas and ever changing commission structures can leave you frustrated.

good,"Verizon Wireless had room for growth, great benefits and listened to their employees. They provided tuition assistance, and also lots of on the job training. I was able to get my A+ certification and learn about computer networking. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers, as with any customer service job not every one is happy.

good,"Working for this company was a good experience.  You have a great chance of  growing within the company and good benefit package."
good,"good company to work, flexible work schedule, good workplace culture. The salary could definitely be higher, and the benefits could be better, but I feel that the management team is very strong at the moment, and the office culture is extremely inviting."

good,As a sales person for Verizon you would think my favorite part of the job would be the sales part...but it wasn't. My favorite part of the job was actually helping customers who weren't so tech savvy to learn their new product. The appreciation the people had for someone to take a few minutes out of their day to help them and offer patience to them is what actually made me enjoy being a Verizon employee.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"It was a new experince in which i enjoyed , it taught me better communication with each customer , how to be more patient and understand since alot of the customers were older and needed much assistance with their new phones. My manager was actually blind but he knew everything by someones voice. so all he needed help with was things he couldn't do like write or store customer information into the computer data base system. my co-workers were easy and very friendly to get along with it was family owned so it was nice to feel like part of the family. The hardest part of the job was getting down new information about each device i would have to go online to the verizon store and just do my research and take test, inorder to really expand my knowledge. The most enjoyable part of my job was actually seeing the older of the customers really enjoy their new iphones and galaxys it was like a whole other world for them."
good,"A typical day for me when I opened the store was, preparing for opening. organization was a huge part of ensuring a successful day. Organization was key for me because it allowed me to have a smooth  day, being in sales is not an east task. It takes a dedicated person to achieve quotas, new ideas, and overcoming hard potential customers  to be a sales representative, and I excelled at my job. Through out the day I would approach customers with a sincere greeting, and inquire if they have service with the company, and inform them about service we offered."

good,Great training program and advancement opportunity.  Verizon is a very results driven organization so if you have the results you will continue to grow with the company.

good,This was an awesome company to work for. So much time off for vacation and PTO. I learned so much about from this job
good,It was excellent place to work. I have learned lot of new things and my colleagues are very helpful
good,"Providing customers with assitance reguarding any account questions. Assiting co-workers with any clerical tasks.My co-workers were great, all fun interesting people. I enjoyed going to work each day. The hardest part was , becausse it being a retail postion the hours weren't always the best."
good,I enjoyed my experience at VZW. I learned the importance of servicing the customer and the impact they make on the business.
good,Nice place to work. Good working environment. Learned many different systems.
good,"My typical day at work would entail sitting in an open style cubicle and taking 44+ calls a day assisting customers all across the the country with their bills, and technical issues of the cell phones. I learned how to be more organized, how to use my resources to assist the most difficult of situations or problems to come up with a reasonable solution to the problems. I also learned to type much quicker and how to build rapport of the phones with each customer. The hardest part of my job is the intense stress of assisting many angry customers each day about their phones and problems with their devices. The most enjoyable part of my day I would say is when I know I helped a customer understand a bill, fix their phone, or know that I helped them find a phone they will truly enjoy."
good,Management and company treat everyone on equal terms. The co-workers help each other and they have a great system to promote within.
good,Verizon Wireless is a great place to work. THe company allows you to have a great work/life balance. The company offers great benefits and more than competitive pay.
good,"Really enjoyed my Job Top performer for 12 years, my department is relocating out of state"
good,"Verizon offers three tiers of unlimited data plans. 4G LTE is the standard but there is also 5G coverage but only in certain areas."
good,It was so long ago I can't remember the experience. All I did was break fix in giant call center environment. Happy New Year and have a Blessed day in Year 2020
good,"Working for Verizon taught me various things and skills that I am able to use in different jobs. Great environment and culture working there, great job advancement opportunities."
good,"I worked in the call center, and it was a challenging job but the environment and people made the job a great place to work. The benefits and pay were great as well."
good,Work of sales and customer service. Making sure every customer left happy. Learning about new products each day and testing them out. Handling of cash.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I hope u guys will hire me full-time I love working for the company love keeping the bill to clean great people great guys over our guys the work week
good,Great benefits and overall great company! I wish I never left.  I would do anything to go back!  The commute was the bad part of the job.  The people and relationships you build there are amazing! I would do anything to go back to Verizon!
good,"When my previous position was being phased out, my manager went to work to transition me into Systems Performance. Once approved and accepted by HR I began OJT training. After three weeks of training, I then assigned to a new manager to begin work a Systems Performance Engineer."
good,"Divertido, y te dan todas las herramientas para trabajar."
good,Management was fair with work problems.  Was great learning. The office was bright & clean.I enjoyable part of my job was the people that worked with.
good,VZW is overall a great company to work for.  A lot has changed but the benefits are great and every day brings a new challenge. They promote from within and everyone has a fair chance to determine their future.
good,"Wonderful work place, customers would always come in typically happy. About 1/8th the time we'd get someone who couldn't fix their phone or just wanted accessories. Rarely did I come into contact with someone upset. Just a great place"
good,"A typical day at work would always include a morning huddle to discuss the objective of the day. Any pertinent information we needed to know before we took to the phones for the day. Management was for the most part very supportive. They were usually there inn case you had any pressing questions,but we usually relied on other members of our teams. The hardest part of the job was the occasional overbearing customer who demanded the almost impossible because of their tenure, but one of the most enjoyable parts were when you were able to save a customer money in the long run because they could move into another plan to better fit their needs."
good,I worked for Verizon for 35 years. I held various positions within the company. Installation and Maintenance was my favorite. I enjoyed working with the managers and the technicians
good,"Creative."
good,Great company to work for. Excellent pay and benefits.  Great for balancing life and work. Have great team builders and show lots of gratitude for workers.
good,great place to work and has lots of room for job growth. I would recommend this company to everyone. I started my professional career here
good,"A typical work day would be comin in to work checking previous sales making sure everything is working and clean logging into your tablet "
good,Great benefits to make up for the anxiety driven customer service job. Culture very fun and friendly. Time off to handle work life balance was excellent!! I miss it! The pay was just not high enough for me any longer.
good,We can enjoy the work environment over here. Lots of new challenges when building future solutions. Every thing is enjoyable here. Mostly very good people around with very good environment.
good,"When there is no much work,Then I get bored and feel like typical day.Co workers are very good.I love my work and enjoy a lot.I love the management over there."
good,Verizon is a great company to grow and work with. They offer advancement and tons of bonuses. Also the benefits are incredible. The staff was some of the friendliest I've ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,"Fun work place to work in, working in sales was stressful but they always had incentives to make the work place fun. Management was always supportive. Quota was always stressful but I always achieved all of my goals."
good,"Great company to work for. Pay was great, benefits were good."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"The company provides an enormous amount of benefits for their employees. The tuition assistance is phenomenal. The medical, dental and vision plans are well worth the premiums. Verizon provides 401k, Health Care and Dependent care spending accounts. This is one of the top things I love about this company."
good,"Working with government agencies to develop accurate phone bills, and resolving disputes. Management was flexible and helpful when additional help was needed. Very diverse department learned a lot."
good,Assisting  customers with bill explanation. Help conduct meetings for the team.  Retaining customers
good,took many phone calls with upset customers helped with phone services
good,"Very productive workplace , training etc, great place to work"
good,Great company; allows telecommute. Very flexible with family schedule
good,"This can be a fun company, a relaxed atmosphere and some great people to work with."
good,"A day at work is a 8 hr ahift answering the phone for Verizon customers and as well as new customer I handle billing, sales and retention"
good,"Nice location within a shopping mall, not bothered by surrounding stores, starbucks corner. Nice staff, managers nice. Computer ok, able to do contracts, phone displays."
good,Apparently they don't hire older women to work in their call centers. If you are minority female then dig in! If you are over age thirty then don't even bother
good,I worked for a third party that did not represent Verizon well. The management did not treat employees fairly and consistently changed the schedule to meet his needs.
good,I learned Verizon will terminate wrongfully. this company doesn't care about their employees. they just care about numbers and production. they pay enough to keep you. I loved Verizon I worked for almost three years and I was wrongfully terminated and promised a higher position. I worked so hard and made Verizon my priority. until they wrongfully terminated.  its sad because it was under 4g wireless and A wireless. they place managers that are rookies and have no management skills.
good,"I have been with TCC for 11 years and have received 5 pay restructures."
good,As a company they have amazing products. But you work retail hours. No work life balance. You work long days and get paid low. You worked on weekends and every holiday. If you want a balance do not work for verizon
good,"This company provides a lot of great benefits, work environment, and opportunities. I would definitely return if possible. good competition and great people."
good,"Great Co. to work for, on the other hand...being hammered with customers cursing and complaining 8/10 hrs daily is another story. Management there wasn't very helpful either, you feel as though you work there nerves."
good,It all started out great when I worked as a union employee. I advanced my way up to middle management and supervisor. I was always feeling that I was pulled between serving my employees and meeting corporate demands.
good,"Only if you don’t have a family , if you don’t have a family or small children Verizon is an ok place to work. There is little to no work life balance.  Focus is the customer is always right. As an employee it’s all about the numbers."
good,"If you go in there and do your job to best of your ability, you will succeed. The customers can be stressed when calling but if you are a good CSR, you can call them down and actually help them"
good,This job are for those who have the inner shark ability to push wireless products. As the industry is constantly changing you must be able to change with ti to achieve results. This job is not for everyone as hitting key performance indicators can be challenging for most.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,has great benefits and greatmeal plan. meet new people and great place to grow
good,"Be ready to miss out on events, be ready for trainings, and always do better."
good,Verizon as a whole is a great company. Working for a retailer however was a very poor experience. Did not care about the customers and forced employees to push products.
good,"the manager didnt even know how to manage himself in times of stress so how did he expect us to handle each other, not only that everyone got laid off from our location without any warning"
good,"This job is made difficult by the lack of Work/life balance. Forced overtimes, constant weekend work. Fortunately, some employees know how to mane it fun"
good,Verizon is a fast paced job. You have to make sure that yo are up to date on the newest products. It is never a dull moment! The management was okay but the security to say the least is not acceptable! There were two robberies in 2 months! I enjoyed being able to learn new technology and help customers leave the store satisfied!
good,"its not for everybody, you have to like people, and have patience"
good,All responses are based on my 27 year career with Verizon. Released from company 2017 with RIF. Sad day. The most responsible employees were RIF’d and less competent were kept based on a personal relationship rather than the ability to perform a job.
good,"HS diploma is all you need to get a job here. The pay is pretty good for that. Benefits are amazing. BUT, you are just a number. This company is big and you are replaceable."
good,I worked for smaller company that was bought out by Verizon. Everything seemed ok until I come to work one day and I was told by the New DM that the store would be closing. He stated they just wanted the towers and not the customers. I was offered another position at a different location but the DMs words were enough to burn me of the company. Great pay and benefits.
good,"Its is a stressful job good benifits ,fast pace I will recommend it to a gradute students"
good,It is a good job if you are okay with sitting and answering calls all day.  That just was not for me I need to be up and moving around.  It was a good job and great people.
good,Experience is productive in terms of learning professional customer dealing
good,low pay but flexible hours. no management that knows what they’re doing and cant lead for kaka but they also have no idea what you do so you can milk it for what its worth....
good,"came to work, signed in and checked email and got ready for the day. Took calls until break then took more calls until lunch, took more calls until second break then more calls until time to go home."
good,"Out door manager, very face paced directed a team. Lots of hours and overtime"
good,You have to be willing to devote all your time i worked many 12 hour days
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,enjoy being a part of verizon i had lots of fun making the csutomers happy abling me to make the right life time decisions a very high stepping stone i reall love the way i make the csutomers happy
good,"waiting for management to make changes, in work flow processes"
good,Okay place to work. Pay could be better. Learning new parts of the job is very beneficial. Management at times could be stressful. Better management will make the job better.
good,"It was a good job. Enjoyed working there. The benefits are okay. The commission is not the best. The management was good as well. You learn a lot, so pay attention. "
good,"I worked at Verizon for 17 years. Awesome place to work for. I learned"
good,"It was a very rewarding career at Verizon.  I learned what it meant to work for a Tier 1 company.  The day to day was very busy, and hectic at times, but the teamwork was abound.  My peers at Verizon, were some of the best professionals I've ever worked with. I made it a point to get to know as many people from all sides of the company and at all levels, building lasting relationships. I would go back and work there again, if given the opportunity."
good,"learned news skills about computer network and good management "
good,"I have nothing to say about Verizon, as I worked for a third party of Verizon Wireless. We sold cell phones and I was not there very long to learn much about the company."
good,"if your money hungry- work at verizon! commission is awesome if you can meet the targets and if your driven. Hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. other than that, its a fun and fast environment to work in"
good,great pay and benifits however verizon customers are always angry and for good reason. they have practices that prevent the employees from being the best at helping to solve issues. hopefully things have changed since i've left.
good,"Working for Verizon Wireless was a great experience , but the lack of management need to improve and the hour of pay. You will learn a lot with working for Verizon  about customer service."
good,The place I worked was over staffed and underpaid. They just tossed more bodies at the problems. Once I was able to get into management I stopped all that and proved that less people were more successful and better paid. No one cared and after I left it went back to junk. Great learning experiences but I would never work for a small retailer again.
good,"the company is good to work for, it is relaxed and professional, it has flexible timings, it has a very diverse in culture, managers are very relaxed and expereinced"
good,"Work cultural is ok ,management is poor ,no gain for hard working resources not getting recognized for working people ,poor management and only managers and senior managers are getting benefits"
good,Before BAM took over it was a GREAT company. Then they went south and no  longer enjoyable to work at. Seems like they moved all there call centers over seas. Most people I talk to that work there hate their life.
good,you learn there are a lot of thing that we must not do however you see other Verizon members doing. I am working in training at the moment. it is something you can do until you find something better
good,Typical day starts with cash management and setting up work stations.  Answering and attending to customer inquiries.  I learned the importance of building positive relationships with potential customers before selling products. Management was like a revolving door where my team had new management every year. Co-workers are amazing and honest and very supportive. The hardest part of the job is the absence of home/work life balance. The most enjoyable was the paychecks as well as the rapport built with co-workers.
good,"Great campaign to work for , great trainers awesome benefits  ! They pay is decent for the work being done . You have to have a good amount of patience and problems solving skills to take on this job"
good,"Verizon is a  great job to work at, their always punching you to work your  best and  always  giving you great opportunities to move up in the company"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Was a great way to hone into skills and learn traits and psychology of myself and others around me.  Unfortunately was unable to continue my life outside of work. Having to work 12 hrs wasn't a problem of course with advancement opportunities. They just never presented themselves for me or anyone else while I was there. Showed me my time and energy would be benefited somewhere else.
good,"Loved the people i worked with, just jot management. We were underpaid and they would switch are shifts and schedules with barely any advances. Again love the company just not the third party i worked for."
good,Working at Verizon was fun for a while till you start coming short on rent due to the fact that business is slow and you are not able to sign up as many customer's.
good,Great salary and benefits and the training provided for the job was top notch. I loved the job unfortunately my medical situation at the tim e would not allow me to get DOT certified
good,"Learned lot of new technologies"
good,"When I was at Verizon/DecisionOne it was a great place to work. However my VP of HR left the company and things changed. His replacement wanted her people, from a previous employer to work with her. she has since left, and HR has been outsourced."
good,My work with Verizon at the time was excellent even though I was an agency worker. It was interesting supporting employees from across the US.  It was challenging working in the changing world of IT and advertising.
good,"prime location in downtown dc. no parking. very busy area. get to see lots of sports stars, and celebrities. great food. nice shopping area. metro 1 block away."
good,Verizon is a great place to build a career. Full benefits and an excellent compensation package comes with the job. Employees are expected to dedicate themselves fully to the job in return. The company culture emphasizes placing work before everything else. That said one is greatly rewarded for this commitment.
good,"It's a good company, however the management lacks professionalism. There are extreme instances of micro management. The industry is good overall, but advancement opportunities are slim in certain departments."
good,"I loved working for VZW. They provide also training, great compensation and amazing benefits. The work life balance is super off though. Especially during holidays because they are pushing for more sales."
good,"I worked here for a long time with the same management. Once management changed, too many things changed in a negative way. One benefit from this job was the fact that I got used to working with large crowds."
good,"Helping customers buy and repair new phones and calling plans. If you don't have a problem dealing with customer complaints its an ok place to work. Always celebrating something with pop corn, candy, ice cream, and sometimes catering in food."
good,"Cellular Sales is an authorized Retailer for Verizon Wireless."
good,I wasn't with company for  very long so I can;t provide a fair review  of the company. I still have Verizon as my carrier. Seems like most people are pretty happy.
good,"The typical day at work was busy creating DS3, STS1,OC03, OC12, OC48 and design circuits on Verizon's network."
good,"Verizon is a great company with the traditional challenges of any large company that has grown in size by acquisitions. Lot's of legacy systems etc. "
good,"•	Responsibilities:  Proper operation and repair of a large group of network elements including installation, optimization, and integration of network hardware and interconnect facilities; the network elements include emergency power systems, DC power plants, various edge routers, MUX’s, microwave radios, and many different types of cellular base stations and transmitters. ● Was a team leader in installation and integration of ALU EnodeB. This included small cell with MRO’s, CPRI links to RRH’s, multiple sector TRDU configurations, in DASS environments, and multiple BBU’s with vastly different configurations. ● I was able to run discovery’s in the 5620 SAM. Strong knowledge with IPV6 for the S1 links. ● Turned up EnodeB’s loading .XML and YANG files; also familiar with manually provisioning the cell to establish OAM connectivity to the MTSO by running the commissioning wizard. ● Analyzing network coverage and system alarms to ensure communication and network integrity. ● Composing clear and concise reports for system documentation and better ways to complete projects. ● Making recommendations to engineering for improving network coverage and implementation as well as best practice for installation and integration processes. ● Completing inventories of test equipment, base station, and transmitters. ● Conducting VLAN and OTDR tests to verify fiber optic throughput challenges, and to develop an excellent response time for troubleshooting issues. ● Being available to pick up the phone 24/7 as to help assist other team members with any technical issues that may arise. ● Maintain"
good,"Great place to work but no Work-Life Balance.  Call Center Job is very demanding, however working in the field is great!"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"great place, stay professional at all times. They could give more benefits to the employees. but that's my opinion. customers are not that irate but can be."
good,I spent my entire shift on the phone as a customer service agent.  I learned  about cell phones. Management was very young and not focused at work.  It was hard to associate with co-workers since we were on the phones all day. The hardest part of job was at any cost making the customer happy.  The most enjoyable was I got to talk to many nice people.
good,"Great place for intern or grad student"
good,"•	Sale of FIOS phone , television, and internet"
good,My tim there didn't last long. Not because I didn't like the work. The work was easy and fast paced so time went by pretty fast. It's just a simple day. Not much to do so you're easily bored. Great working environment for teens or elderly (minus the lifting).
good,"Verizon Wireless is an excellent company to work for and a company you can be proud of, and changing all the time. I'ved worked with hundreds of people while at Verizon, and being honest I'm very well liked. I'm definitely a people person. I work very well with employees, management and customers"
good,I love to work and the job is fun but don’t have enough time because of split days to enjoy your loved ones! The work environment was relaxing and the pay is decent
good,"My over all review is I was very satisfied with my company if it would've have been for the distance I had to drive daily."
good,"Great place to work! make alot of money!•	Met and exceeded quota/revenue target for net activations, customer renewals, accessories, handsets and enhanced services; demonstrated equipment functions and network capability; performed rate package evaluations and proposed solutions that best benefited the company and the customer; engaged customers; effectively executed the sales function; maintained and grew existing customer base and managed churn."
good,"great company."
good,"phones"
good,It was a great experience working for them very fast paced work friendly. Great customer service was provided and customer’s felt like they were at home when the entered the store.
good,Verizon is a great company with a lot of opportunity and options.  Provided me a great life thus far. The people are the best part and I have met lifelong friends.
good,"I learned a lot about sales working here. Expect some days to be slow, It's not a very fast paced job unless it's the holiday season. Really good stepping stone if you want a career in sales."
good,I was a contractor and the pay was great but zero benefits for contractors. Did not get paid for holidays so had to work 4 days of 10 hrs each and work during christmas break. But work was fun and that is the most money I ever made in my life. Too bad they had to let me go. They cannot keep contractors more than 30 mths and they could not hire perm as they were continously laying off people
good,Get the numbers or get fired..Simple as that...If you can't produce its no point working there. Folks standing around sharking  one antoehr for customers. The hardest part of the job was being powerless if youre store didn't get traffic. Its a cool job for folks just getting out of highschool but not a grown a** man trying to support a family.
good,In an ever changing environment and challenging work days you can always rely on experienced technicians for help. Learning the culture of each garage is a talent in itself.
good,Overall good company to work for just no work lift balance. Management sometimes lacks understanding of needs for the representative. Benefits are amazing.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Interact with guest/customers that come in on a daily basis."
good,Verizon Wireless was a great place to work! However they moved out of the state of Texas and everyone had to look for new employment or move to Georgia.
good,Here it was a temporary job with nothing to write about.  Very competitive all is based on the number of sales.The hardest part of it is going door to door.  The most enjoyable part of the job is you meet different time of people.
good,Its really a good company and some managers are amazing but the politics and favoritism is the only thing I do not like. We have a few events that happen on works days but you are given time off he phones to enjoy them you have to use your own time.  Which means that you are still working.
good,"depending on your customers needs determines the time you will be spending with them. taking care of escalations, making adjustments to customers accounts, and making sure they are on the right plan for their life style."
good,This company is not a good company for mothers with children.  They want you to do whatever it take to sell their products even if it is not in the best interest of the customer
good,"Worked 10 hr work day, learned how to test co-ax cabling, got along with everyone, nothing really hard about it."
good,"Verizon it self is a outstanding company and very good place to work in. But call center work is very hard within verizon. However, i think this is a good place to work if you would like to extend your eduction and move forward. Verizon pays for your education .. all of it.."
good,"As a sales representative, I am driven by advancing my quota and in turn advancing my paycheck. I usually was able to double my base commission check due to my persistent ability to discover about my guests. I learned a lot about product management, networking, discovery of guests needs, and management skills. The co workers at both of the locations I worked at were very fun to work with and provided an all around good environment to work in. The hardest part of this job was dealing with some of the management that I had along the way. Some of the management staff was unable to adjust their leadership skills to deal with someone who was self motivated and driven."
good,"It is a great place to work, the benefits are great and the job progression is ok. However the work life balance is not so great. It is hard to get the shift you like."
good,"It is a good company to work for, but there are some limitations for growth."
good,"Fast paced, superb benefits and incentives.  They are decreasing every year but still used to love working here.  Unfortunately they do not rehire."
good,I would like to move back to outside sales position.  I am a very self motivated.  I do promote more sales and business this way.
good,"Fast-paced call center enviroment."
good,"There care for their salespeople's future is uncertain, possibly restoring techs in each corporate store would allow salespeople to prosper."
good,"I left during a transition time when Verizon and the Directory Store were going through a change in administration and downsizing some parts of its services. As with any sales position, one needs to be very focused on the product and capable of closing the deal. Sometimes, it is difficult to reach sales quotas. If you are a good salesperson, then this job is for you."
good,"I would start my day by coming in and signing in my phone, start taking calls immediately from customers, determine their needs to recommend the best service for their needs, figure out any billing errors and making sure order goes to completion status so no delays in the customers order. Follow up with customer's to make sure we gave them the best customer service. Hardest part of my job was the ongoing changes from week to week on what the FSC determined what we had to say and it changed almost monthly. You would have to memorize it and if you got it wrong you were written up. You could not take longer than 3 minutes for bathroom breaks. Most enjoyable was helping the customers, especially the elderly as most people would take advantage of them and sell them whatever they don't need, and I felt really appreciated knowing the were happy at the end of our conversation."
good,it is very fast-paced and demanding. the pay is above average if you can handle the pressure.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Hard Core sales strategies even when customers said no, rep must continue to offer products/services."
good,like a manager who can relate well wilt workers. Typical day at prev job was all phone interaction making up trouble tickets answering custome questions also ran a infinite bridge line that can handle an infinate job number of callers. Hardest part of the job is when you have tried your hardest to please a client but doesnt quite end up the way he wanted it.
good,"It's a company that everyone should have experience with because of the retail time spent and the individuals you will meet. The company itself has a great idea and outlook overall, but not for individuals."
good,Most enjoyable part was taking care of the customers. I would handle up to 250 calls a day which made the day go fast
good,"I loved working for Verizon. I learned a great deal about programming, networking and team management."
good,Overall great if store is not understaffed. Robberies made working there very uncomfortable; safety & security needs to be updated & prioritized. The environment is very lax and welcoming to all new hires to learn and develop that sales mentality! Unfortunately if you have a family the job is not for you due to the unpredictability of hours and staff members that call off like at every job but the days are very long
good,Great place to work! I enjoyed the environment and the opportunities for growth. The benefits and educational opportunities are amazing. I loved working here!
good,productive and fun place to work. 8 hours a day and team is of 20 people and working is comfortable with them. The requirements are clear and easy to understand.
good,good experience overall. unfortunately i can't work remotely  and that was a major drawback. I like the management and team. good professional environment
good,With customers who had special needs but I was able to handle the calls and needs as best and promptly as possible all in all it was a great experience working for verizon
good,"Fun place to work, competitive pay, with benefits workplace is good. friendly work environment, they will take care if you and your family. well rounded"
good,"Working at Verizon was amazing!  Great benefits, career growth for advancement opportunities and the culture was incredible!  I enjoyed working for Verizon."
good,I was fortunate to have an awesome work experience and an excellent management team.  I observed the overall work experienced varied by group/management team.

good,"I would have been a lifer at VerizonWireless however, there was a mass layoff and it was so devastating after being there for almost 10 years. Great place to have worked."
good,Verizon is a good company overall to work for. The location I was at had questionable management so it could have been better but the company was ok..
good,I got the job and loved it it was a great company to work for the pay was great and had NY phone service paid for every month was on time everydqy and never missed a day
good,I really enjoyed the people and the work tasks throughout my time with Verizon. I left with mixed feelings when management offered a 60 week voluntary separation package.

good,Every day is a different day for me because I learn something new each and every day as life goes on. I expect and achieve new goals and keep records of my successes.
good,Verizon was a good place to work for. They only hired experienced Sales Engineers. The compensation was fair and the educational opportunities were unlimited. Verizon on the widest breath of products of any telecommunications company. Verizon provided excellent support to their Sales Engineers.
good,"Supportive learning environment and ample opportunities to learn."
good,Excellent place and fun place to work. Management team are always available to provide  support for team members. Everyone always so helpful. Great support!

good,"Worked as a contract employee nice team, cafeteria and got an opportunity to work on latest tools"
good,lots of work and very productive lots of phones sold and lots of accessories. my experience there was very welcoming and the ambient was really nice as well
good,"was like an abusive relationship in that, there were times when things were good! Really good! And then, there were those bad times... Even though my career was progressing, I was met at every level with some of the most hateful, spiteful, narcissistic leadership you could ever imagine."
good,"Great job good people! Although it was a short lived experience, it was a very good experience and I am happy to have had the opportunity. I quit after finding another job, and when I wanted to re apply I didn't ever hear back. They mentioned my tardiness was a concern for re-hiring at that location, but I reassured them it would be my personal challenge to make sure it never became an actual problem."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"Typical work day includes handling sales as well as operations Processed daily reports to track inventory shrink and month to date contracts"

good,"Verizon is a great place to work with many opportunities to expand. Teamwork was fantastic and organization is very dynamic. "
good,"it was ok.    Commission structure is horrible.   Not sure how much you were supposed to get paid per cellphone sale.   There needs to be a higher minimum wage at this company.   Waiting for customers to show up  to sell them phones and/or accessories is should not be the job.  Also, you should not be obligated to telemarket for phone sales."
good,"We will learn a lot on our day to day work, amazing learning modules available. Flexible and good work life balance. "
good,"Great benefits, room for career growth, tuition assistance. overall good company to work for. Supervisors were helpful and there are additional duties that are available to work."

good,"If you're looking to work for a company that is truly the industry leader, I believe Verizon is the place to be. Product, service, reliability, among other factors are all number one. There will be corporate politics, office environments that are difficult, matrix organizations, groups that don't allow working from home, and maybe other less attractive parts of the company that stand out or are red flags. But it's still number one, and they have the best talent out there. With that comes robust compensation. Again industry leading by far from pay, benefits, and investing."
good,I have nothing bad to say about Verizon. They have helped me develop my leadership skills. I have received 4 promotions in 4 years. Under new management since Verizon 2.0 I see no future promotions or accountability. I have struggled with HR to holding my team accountable to the direction the store is going and Verizon. We are short staffed and as managers asked to do more with less. I am a hard worker and am not worried about that. I just don’t see future career opportunities in my area and am not mobile. I believe Verizon has helped me all they can as far as my career and it is time for me to make an impact somewhere else.
good,A stable and environment to grow in. A long term career petri dish. many paths to choose from. Verizon fosters long term employment but supporting education coupled with good benefits.

good,"Work life balance is good"

good,Awesome job I really think the sight offers a lot of great features if you’re searching for a job. I really not a fan of the survey. Plus it’s making me fill it out.

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,Exciting high paced work environment.  Takes care of employees.  Lots of overtime opportunities.  Good relationships with fellow employees.  Contests ran internally as prizes
good,"I do like the pay and benefits at verizon, but being on the phones is not fun. Do not look forward to going in, but i do like the money i have coming in and the benefits are good."

I obtained my CCNA and worked on many projects over the years.  the ability to train and share my work experience with peers was satisfying. establishing rapport is a key with peers and customers.  working in an NOC environment supporting multiple customers for the 1st 13 years at Verizon helped me professionally in my growth. the last 6 years I was part of a dedicated team for a single customer. this was a 1st for Verizon as we took on more roles not normally done.  We demonstrated our ability time and again to understand the needs of the customer and fulfill their expectations.  Through out my time with Verizon I established trust with the customers I worked with to fully understand their needs and worked to satisfy their requirements. "
good,Verizon was one of the best companies that I have ever worked for! It is one company that actually values its employees. Definitely a lot of benefits for working for them!

It would also be challenging when you cant givea customer what they thin they are entitled to but yet in the end these customers are surveyd"
good,Good environment for growth and first job out of school. They have a lot of resources but are trying to make too many changes at once for it to be done effectively.

good,"Indeed is forcing this review so i can create my profile. I worked for Verizon over 10 years ago.

I was recruited by one of my long time business customers to work for him on a M-F 8:30 - 5:30 schedule with no weekends. Needless to say, that was not the hours required.

Management provided me with an excellent opportunity to train new associated to the center how to perform their job duties. Along with my fellow management we communicated on all issues concerning the DRC. The hardest part of the job was writing appraisals. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching newly trained employees work along with experienced employees.
good,"I was contracted back in Aug 07 to assist with the combining of three Dispatch Centers. Training and supporting the local management in running a Dispatch and Resource Ctr. I would review the workload and offer suggestions on loading the work. What I learned is that not everyone accepts change in the same way. By supporting the team, both management and associates, to get the job done through this stressful time. The hardest part of the job was leaving it. The most enjoyable time was working with all the individuals in the new center."
good,"A typical day at work begins with the daily meeting in the 'gang room' at each Verizon yard. This is where management will assign work and field questions, as well as advise craft employees of relevant news about current and future work orders. With my Verizon training, I always felt confident in my ability to handle any OSP fiber construction assignment. Also, I was constantly aware that I had all the necessary equipment (provided by Verizon) required to do the job. I knew that my co-workers were always willing to pull their share of the workload, and to be as concerned as me in completing our assignments the right way the first time. They were a great group of guys and gals. I suppose the hardest part of the job was digging the occasional splice pit in the Florida summer heat, but hey, that comes with the territory. My time with Verizon was easily the most satisfactory work experience of my entire working career. It was a great opportunity to learn new skills and interact with some very talented people."
good,"Large company with lots of career growth available, would go back in a heart beat."
good,Great flexibility and employee engagement. Open door policy and great career progression opportunities.
good,Great people
good,"I would say that the typical work day at the Verizon Wireless Center has many parts to it depending on what your area is. In my case, I would check in with all the bartenders to see if they are in need of any assistance. If any of the bartenders need any item I would go and find the item they are missing, whether it would be alcohol, lemons, limes, etc. I have to find any of them. My managers work along side of me and my co-workers, I really enjoy that since they understand the situations in which we find ourselves sometimes. They are very understanding and help out anyone in need of assistance. During certain events, hockey games or concerts especially, keeping the stock up can be tricky sometimes. When all of your tasks have been completed there can be some free time to watch some of the events."
good,managed 32 techs and handled all personnel issues
good,"busy, always chatting w/customers--learned that, you never know it all about the wireless products--management was very caring about you & the customers--co-workers were always respectful of one another--the hardest part of the job was informing a customer at times that their wait would be a bit longer than informed--most enjoyable part of the job was meeting & greeting people from all parts of the world"
good,Everyday was different. Never knew what to expect. I learned quite a bit at the arena. I learned how to put all types of stages and set-ups together for different events. I met people from all walks of life. Working at the Verizon Arena was very exciting. And I had the pleasure of making some real good friends.
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure the customer is happy once they leave the line
good,"The key to succeeding at any call center is to maintain calmness. Know and understand that the customer at the other end of the line is not aiming their complaints personally at you but, as a representative of the company you work for. Some adults do not have the quality of peaceful negotiation. They enjoy yelling and screaming when they feel they have been unjustly billed or disconnected .....lol. This is your typical day. I felt a sense of accomplishment assisting these customer and having a calm rational adult at the end of the line when my call was completed."
good,I loved my job and looked forward to building career within the company but due to new management it is not going to be a possibility. I love being a part of new technology and being able to help customers be excited about it.
good,Excellent company. Professional. Enjoyable workplace. Excellent Managers.
good,"This company thrives in a true team environment. They value their employees and train them appropriately for the job at hand. And as changes happen to the business, more training is scheduled."
good,"I loved working for Verizon for 30+ years. Unfortunately, I was forced to retire at age 47, and life hasn't been the same. Thank God for the insurance benefits I was given upon retirement, but just pray they aren't taken away the way Idearc has done to my fellow co-workers who retired in the recent years. I wish I could have retired at a later age, but there is a reason for everything, I guess.."
good,Came in to work clocked in and started to fill paper work into folders of each property owner.Management was great she was a good understanding boss and co-workers were like family.the most enjoyable part of this job was when they had private party's.
good,A typical day of work would consist of me taking as many calls as possible in a timely manner. Making sure that I am assistingthe customers to the best of my abilities. Using my provided resources top give the customers accurate information. Sharing any new information I might have gathered with my supervisor and team mates. Making sure that the customer's issue is resolved as well as providing them with great customer service.
good,Temporary position for maternity leave.
good,"Promote education but don't promote within, need to offer employees jobs within when they are trying to omprove themselves."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I enjoy working here. In all my years at the Verizon Center I was able to meet many famous people, from actors, singers and politicians. I have gained a lot of knowledge and important skills as well. We deal with fans from all different cultures and have to meet and be up to their expectations. It is not always easy but I always give it my best and give the patrons that attends event here a great experience, so they can come again."

good,"- Worked with a team of 8 developers on project lifecycle, including requirements gathering and analysis, testing and implementation"
good,Great place to work. Fun corporate relaxed place to work. Very progressive and pro employee. The court order group has experienced well informed management. The workplace is well suited for coropration with coworkers. The hardest part of the job was making customers understand that confidential information needed legal process befor it could be released. Helping law enforcement to sometimes save a life was the most rewarding part of this job.
good,I made sales to potential clients over the phone. Customers called in with questions about service and i talked them into purchasing Verizons service
good,"Busy, for every changing, nice co workers. Good opportunity for advancement."
good,This is a great place to work and has provided my family with a lot.
good,"Steady work,ideal for those who can work independently. Pros are it is a large company. Cons are,it is a large company."

good,I love the work i do and the company that i work for. Verizon offers great benefits and has great career progression opportunities.
good,I really enjoyed working for Verizon. The best part of my job in the 29 plus years there was connecting the people internal & external.
good,"A typical work day included tons of fun ! Having fun with the customers , I enjoyed learning about new technology and, since technology is my thing I was defintly in the right place! I would go back to this company at any time!"
good,"My co-workers and i were a TEAM and that's what makes work that much easier. The only hard part i would say is when there was absolutley nothing that could be done (not being able to upgrade because of there upgrade date, etc.)"
good,i really enjoy working here at Verizon! everyone is so nice and the environment is wonderful.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Assist customers with concerns about their accounts, technical support, sales, data entry."
good,"Great place to work, The attendace policy is strick, so always be on time. Do the job you are paid to do and you will be successful."
good,I got alot of customer service experience working for them and enjoyed working for them for 6 years until the company closed down.

good,This would have to be one of the best companies I have worked for.
good,"Great benefits, Awesome co-workers, Some customers that call in are a pleasure and the hardest part of my job is the irrate customers but it's still all great!"
good,We fielded thousands of calls a day from the deaf and hard of hearing. It was really rewarding to help them make their phone calls. The most difficult part was having to relay phone calls for people that just wanted to abuse the service. It was non-stop incoming calls so I liked that because I enjoy working at a fast pace and staying busy.
good,"Jindal is one of the world’s multinational leading steel manufacturing companies. They are having ERP package as Oracle Applications and RAMCO MARSHELL. Due to various integrated systems, user demanded for additional functionality and additional Reports."
good,"Verizon Wireless has been a great experience! Overall, employees are treated very well ranging from contest and giveaways to tuition reimbursement and benefits. A day at work consists of being a wireless expert, taking over 200 calls per month, while being very knowledgeable about Verizon Wireless products and services. I learned how to interact with different customers and personalities, also lending a helping hand to new employees in training. Being able to help new employees is always enjoyable and always keeps me looking forward to another day at work."
good,"Job was very enjoyable, work times were great, attire was casual, management was friendly, compensation was great."
good,"Great company to work for, all the colleagues are very cooperative."
good,"What can I say, not enough. I liked how I was able to navigate through the different product lines in the course of a average day in sales."
good,Verizon provides a postive working atmosphere. Daily team meetings keep the employee up to date with information and new initatives. Verizon provided an environment of growth within the company as well. Supervisors were professional and supportive.
good,Overall the company was horrible my pay check were late and incorrect and they laid me off after almost 2 years of working for them
good,Verizon Wireless is an excellent organization to work for.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Experience in handling large (15+TB) databases, Performance Tuning, RAC, RMAN backups/Recovery."
good,Great place to work but unfortunately the call center is closing in June 2012.
good,Got to interact with people . Learned a lot from my team members. Were very helpful.
good,"Great training program, room to grow and learn with the company."
good,I had the opportunity to learn about the new and exciting ventures of the telecommunication industry. From local land lines to replacing copper with fiber. I was trained in wireless as well as digital TV. And working with medium businesses was such a positive experience.
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon, but had health issues that prevented me from continuing my employment with them.  The only real negative is the way they devise the performance agreements."
good,"Verizon corporate is a great company to work for. Benefits, great pay and a future to look forward to if you are looking for career development as they will have many opportunities for one to develop and stay with a company."
good,"I worked in the Telecom industry for almost 25 years.  I learned a lot, and really had many good experiences.  The job was always stressful, but the dynamics of it changed so much.  As a manager I had an opportunity to to share my knowledge with many.  The focus of the business has changed so much that I felt it no longer took time to fully understand the needs it the workers."
good,A ton of opportunity to advance if you work hard. The benefits are amazing. I would have staying with this company for the rest of my life had they not relocated the office.
good,"Verizon has the best benefits of any company I have worked for.  They have paid for college degrees, and the medical and dental insurance are very inclusive.  I have enjoyed working for this company for the last 20 years and look forward to retirement in a couple of years."
good,"The environment is nice, for the most part your peers will be the reason you actually stay employed. The people I’ve met while working here makes me want to come to work daily. But I’m ready to work from home."
good,Verizon’s culture was great but the comp plan changes were very hard to deal with in terms of our quarterly bonuses.  Also it’s good to pay an outside rep about $55K a year as opposed to $45K.
good,"I would prefer to not give a review about Verizon. I was layed off from the Company after 30 years of service. "
good,Its a grind but overall a great job. You are in competition with the stores in your territory as well as the retail small business reps and that is annoying
good,"Worked in fast paced department where there was no shortage of projects and work to get involved in. Enjoyed that but the culture when I was there was abrasive and management was clearly stressed and under pressure and they passed that down to the whole team. There were lots of layoffs all the time, so that in itself is demoralizing but that's the industry. I relocated or I would probably have stayed."
good,"I loved working for Verizon, and would love to work there again. I really did not want to be sold off before, but that was out of my control. The Union is very problematic for junior employees who desire to excell."
good,Verizon's commission structure changed frequently and made it tough to advance commission paycheck. Entering management was tough because they would bring in hirees from other states versus hiring in store. I left with almost all of my two years vacation time unused because workers who were there longer had their vacations approved before a new employee.
good,"Verizon wireless was a great company to work for, my district manager was who made it fun and worth working for. The training team that TCC had were the best in the business"
good,Verizon was a great starting place to help with my sales skills. Any sales company will be glad to take you after Verizon wireless. It was a big starting step to get me into Quicken loans.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon Wireless provided me with the benefits and tools I needed to become certified and learn effective technical skills. Limited movement from within.
good,"Verizon is a very demanding workplace, but it's well worth it. I've learned about hard work & how to deal with & meet the needs of people. I enjoyed the culture, the compensation & the opportunities for advancement. It was very demanding & work/life balance was hard to achieve, but well worth it."
good,It's a great job with great pay. Not as many benefits as it once was. Top pay for call center and customer service reps is $38/hr for landline fios workers.
good,Overall a very great and stable company to work for. It can be a challenge to move up within the organization for various reasons but if you are mobile it definitely helps.
good,i left in a good mental space about our departure. wish i was able to relocate.i was happy withhow they treated their employees. and the company events.
good,"Great company to work for all in all. Management varies from job to job, some good some bad.  Great salary but you work hard for it. No regrets my entire 30 years working for them."
good,"Verizon Wireless is a fun place to work and I would recommend it to anyone. The retail hours are not as family friendly as they advertise specially during the holidays because of customer's needs. The hardest part of the job is upselling to regular customers while maintaining integrity and making sure you give every customer the best solution based on their needs without being affected by their willingness and capability to pay. I believe that it is easy to build customer report and to gain their trust when recommending a product, but sometimes it can be difficult to sell something that you know the customer will return or will not be able to pay at a later date causing a charge back that will have to be explained."
good,"I would greet customers and make them feel comfortable while they waited for their turn. I also processed payments. Offered water, coffee.  Lot of fun"
good,"High stress, and management was less than positive.  It would have been a great experience if the work/life balance and the store manager had been more employee centric."
good,"Wonderful benefits and pay, no time for family or personal life because of the hours worked. This company trains the employees very well. A bunch of drama from my experience at my store"
good,Nice Place to work. There a lot of complex projects and a lot of room to learn with the help of very helpful full time employees. Workplace culture is very good.
good,"Every day is different and requires one to quickly adapt.  Always learning, which was encouraged.  Felt empowered to get the job done with respect to quality. Past few years job security in question."
good,"There is always work to do, and if you are surrounded by a great team, then you can achieve all your goals and have a great work life balance. "
good,"I had to work 12-9 my first year and didn't like that, there was production and adherence to stick by. they were a great company with excellent training and skills"
good,"Shutting down the call center in Huntsville, AL 2018. Beginning to phase out in April. The entire call center will be out of service by July 2018******"
good,"The on going training and support I received.  I became an upbeat, fast paced multi-taker real quick!  Great company discounts on Merchandise.  And looks good on a Resume!!! :)"
good,Calls unfairly routed to meet sales quota.  
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"the company overall is awesome, but like every place they have their pros and cons. the culture is awesome, most of the directors and senior managers are great."
good,"New Manager was hired.  She had not managerial experience and appeared to be entirely overwhelmed.  Otherwise, loved my job at Verizon.  There was always work to be done, but I did learn some things about the wireless industry."
good,Overall Verizon is a great place to work where you are well compensated for your efforts. At times it can be difficult but overall it is not stressful if you meet your sales commitments.
good,"While I had things I didn't like at Verizon, overall, it is still the best company I have worked for in that they constantly challenge you and shape you for new job responsibilities.  The camaraderie was also first class as I loved working with my peers."
good,This career is a great place to work if you like working on a commission based job.  This is a very sales oriented position and customer service the the name of the game.
good,"Everything being based on metrics and statistics is disheartening. You could be out deathly ill, they'll use your PTO it will still affect your absenteeism and you could literally slip from top 10 in the client to the high 900 percentile. Being ranked against peers is one thing but people always have a way to beat the system."
good,"Steady flow of traffic at work, some slow days here and there. Current management could use some work in their training/development skills, morale tended to be negative. Great people though."
good,A typical day at Verizon consists of building relationships with customers and delivering outstanding customer service. We drive up sales by contacting our warm leads. It's all about maximizing revenue.
good,Hard work but it does have a chance to make money.travel is a distance you have to be able to get to the location in the northern suburbs. They have a great training team that will walk you thru the process to becoming a great team member!
good,Commission plus base pay makes everything else great. Things could be better. Managers need to have better people skills when it comes to those they are over.
good,"Start the day with a team huddle."
good,"Verizon has a great culture. It is one of the most stressful jobs I have ever held but when the rewards came, it made it worth it. Too bad that the campus had to relocate."
good,"Very easy to get stuck in the same position- but great benefits."
good,"Each day I would come in and count inventory of all the phones in the safe. Once that was completed I would count the drawer and open the store. After ensuring the store was properly organized I would go straight to the computer to check my emails. The emails we were provided gave us in tell about what is expected from us that month, day, or even week. The next thing I would need to review would by my promotions I would look up the sales and update myself on which promotions were over and which new ones had came out.l My main tasks were to stay informed on all Verizon sale changes and gross profit on phones. It was difficult at times to balance helping customers and finish all my work due to the volume of customers we would receive at times. The beneficial part of this job is that it taught me to multi task and how to learn quickly in order to give my customers the best sales experience."
good,I had a great job and learned a ton of skills that enabled me to assist customers and help them with a multitude of issues.  I was very happy with many of my managers and I enjoyed the work.
good,"Customer Service Taking care of Customers Accounts tech support, customer service, bill payments eventory shippment"
good,"In addition to discussing Digital Transformation with clients, Verizon is going through an inside out review and makeover of core systems, operations, its business model and how it does marketing."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,It's ok at first but gets old after the first two years or so.  A lot to learn so there is a challenge but have a plan going in.  Dont take time off unless you need to as you can get burned out taking 35+ calls a day from the general public.
good,"Fantastic company!  Many learning experiences.  My favorite thing was the people, love my coworkers!  My position didnt have much recognition, was more of a ""grunt"" type of position supporting sales.  No advancement opportunities outside of sales."
good,overall good company to work for. Great benefits and great compensation. The driving around is what makes this job a bit hard but other than that is a good paying job.
good,"report to work on time, receive work and give a full day's work. I learned to work hard and provide great customer service. over the years the manager. My co-workers were good for the most part's job get worse and worse. The hardest part of the job over the years were working in a union environment.the most enjoyable part of the job was training new employees."
good,the middle management team is very weak and tends to only follow direction from sr. management. in a word they tend to be syncopathic.
good,"Great company, amazing compensation and growth opportunity, but incompetent store management can easily ruin your career. lack of concern from District managers as well."
good,Great interpersonal skills Enjoy working with a diverse group of customers  Enjoy handling customers needs and wants and being able to resolve the issues they have with the company
good,"Very high pressure sales environment results in both workers and bosses constantly stressed out and forced to come down on those under them.  If you are into high pressure sales, it's a great job, but I decided I no longer wanted to work in a sales environment, despite the pay."
good,"* Pros: "
good,Team was one of the best teams I've ever worked with. So knowledgeable and helpful. Fun time during lunch time. Some office politics.
good,"very high energy fast paced work environment, structured and very fun. Worked on business accounts often which were very well payable. co workers were a team, very close knit. Hardest part was keeping up with changing technology."
good,Verizon Wireless affords its employee endless possibilities. The culture is clear from the top down from the coporate level and the desire to be there for it's customers is amazing!
good,"Dynamic work environment with ever changing priorities and projects."
good,Demanding work culture energized by change. May make it difficult for work/life balance. Many organizational changes requires ability to withstand working in an ambiguous environment.
good,The company promotes a very agile environment for the projects. People are expected to be proactive and be capable of managing their responsibilities along with their subordinates responsibilities. The company keeps employees informed of the future plans very well.
good,"The company itself is wonderful to work and provide excellent benefits.  As far as location, I did not like where I worked. Upper management sucks and the job had become very stressful."
good,"when we come in in the morning we have to get all the morning payments out by 11 so the bills can get to the bank by the deadline,and what comes in after 11 we try to get done by the end of the day. If we finish all our work we usually do over and help out out with the data entry."
good,"Very smart worker , on point and on focus to all  assignments and very straight forward on issues ,very direct and on point to where the technology is going ,"
good,"I sold several different accessories and electronics. Took payments ,handled customer questions and complaints . Maintained quotas and sales goals daily. Majority of my day was working new accounts ,upgrades, and insurance claims."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for with excellent benefits and wages. There are numerous opportunities to advance your careers and work in different departments.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"During my 1 year at Verizon telecom I would say that I have learned many things, I learned to be precise in everything I do to minimize the mistakes and prioritize what is necessary. I learned how to multi-task and exercise my logical and analytic thinking everyday as required with the job. The people there are very friendly and accommodating and they are ready to help you or provide guidance if your having a hard time with the companies projects. On typical days, we usually process network request from different companies and we aim to target our daily target quotas. The hardest part of the job is handling multiple request. We normally handle 20 request from different companies daily, On top of that I was with User-acceptance testers which tests logical systems and create new processes to speed up network request and improve the quality of work."
good,I first took the position at Verizon with every promise told to me up-front that was not delivered. The Managing staff would follow your every single move and no matter the profit you brought in would always be negative.
good,This company allows some chances for advancement but not many. I am looking for a more pleasant atmosphere using my skills and education.
good,Mostly dealing with customer support and having the satisfaction that you have help out to make a difference in the work force.
good,Verizon wireless was a fun place to work with good mgmt. and co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work involved daily testing activities, coordination with the offshore resources, reporting bugs, resolving issues, meeting the deliverables, status calls etc."
good,"As a whole, VZW is a good company to work for with good benefits."
good,I would typically handle inbound calls speaking with a customers on the phone that wanted to purchase a hunting or fishing licenses for the state of New York and or any problems they are having purchasing one on-line. I have learned that job is as hard as it might seem once you are trained and well looked after. I enjoyed working with the workers and management at NY Verizon they where very helpful and understanding. Hardest part of the job was getting to know all the rules and regulations for the hunting and fishing licenses. Working in a place where you feel welcome and was treated respectfully.
good,I typical work day is fast paced and unpredictable. In this position I have learn who to handle pressure and adapt on the fly.All while dealing with multiple personalities. The job can become challenging when multiple customer demands need to be met simultaneously. However the most enjoyable part is customer gratification.
good,"Received Customer Service Top Quality Awards for outstanding track record of positive customer feedback five years in a row.    Instrumental in improving customer satisfaction ratings through suggestion, development, and implementation of new procedures."
good,Typical work day begins with a sales huddle to bring the staff together and roll out information about changes from the previous day as well as discussing daily goals. Then those goals are distributed to each of us and managed through out the day. What I learned from this more recent development is that micro-managing is effective to drive sales but not good for moral. Management has a hard time managing the frequent changes and does not receive any coaching on how to solve their problems. Co-workers have become similar to family in that we help each other work and train each other with best practices. hardest part of the job is being away from my family for 12 plus hours a day. Most enjoyable part of the job is reaping the commission checks from my hard work.
good,"Reference previous review, this role was project with in my previous responsiblities as a Assistant Manager."
good,"Arrived to work on time, logged into my computer, and handled every call as expected of me, friendly yet professionally, in a timely and efficient manner. I acquired a faster typing speed, and continued to work well under pressure. My coworkers were very respectful and professional, the hardest part of the job was when we began to handle hawaii calls the pronunciation was difficult, but wasnt too difficult to handle. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining more experience and actually having a coach who spent a sufficient amount of one on one time with each operator to let them know in which areas they needed improvement, and with each improvement were  rewards."
good,"In by 0730 on teleconfrence by 0735 stocked the truck and out of the yard by 0800 on the 1st job by 0830.My manager I just tolerated and the co-workers I could care less for. the hardest part of the job was waking up to get there.the most enjoyable part of the job was the weekends,vacations, and the times I was activated for the Military"
good,"Verizon wireless, was great place to work in with friendly staff members. It was very busy with more than 10 telephone lines and over 100 employees. I learnt to multi-task and be accurate at the same time. The hardest part of the job as receptionist was to memorize names for over 100 people. I enjoyed the multicultural and non- judgemental environment."
good,"Day starts a 7am in the yard and form there can be a walk in the park and be just maintenance and up keep Now A days everyone and every thing is tied up to the internet and people as you know expect to have all there services and this is the day changer ! These are the days when you wonder will we ever get done! With Florida's weather and all the great road projects any given day can turn into 2 or 3 days at work! Between finding the problem talking to the customers who have outages and often finding problems in worst possible spots than having to destroy customers side walks drive ways yards to make the repairs Well balancing My crew equipment on lookers, customers that outages and really ticked off customers who""s Yard we are working on and tearing up and assuring them it will look like new or better when we leave! to the best part of the day almost home and lol called back out to another emc outage !"
good,"Wireless call centers may be the worse to work for. You have to be mentally stable to work here. Customers can be so cruel and this company just pays you to get cursed at daily. If you just go to work and home it can become draining, its also a who you know job, you have to know the right people to get put where you want to go."
good," Applied effective instructional methods in conducting training and development, as well as feedback and coaching on product knowledge, selling skills, visual, and delivery of quality customer service"
good,managers were biased based on staff with personal involment
good,"Great company, wish I were still there! Location was great, I always met my goals and sales were commissioned."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,On a typical day at work. I would come into work and log onto the computer and begin to answer incoming calls. This is throughout the entire shift with the exception of breaks. I have learned a lot about customer service and the wireless industry. I also have learned more about information technology. Management is great but they have very high standards such as meeting demands of the stats. Co-workers are wonderful and treat everyone as if they are a coach to motivate you to work harder
good,"Great co-workers, good money, fun place to work. Loved going to work everyday. Made friends at my job."
good,You must be very organized and punctual to work for Verizon. There is a lot of work but the pay is substantial. Computer proficiency is a must also. As well as a positive attitude. Unfortunately Verizon is now hiring over seas and jobs are limited in the US.
good,"Come in and assist customers with any and all device issues.Teach them or guide them regarding,how to do things such as, add songs to phone memory card.Help upgrade and change any and all account issues as well as anything else the customer would like to have changed,for example...Placing a call block on their account"
good,Typical day started at 4:00am. Run reports and review issues with senior management. Make sure staffing resourses are available and online. Monitor outage events and report to management as necessary. Review prior incidents with recovery and problem managers. Review incidents for impact to availability goals. Review staffing schedules and modify or revise. Monitor status of action plans and solution anlysis. Facilitate mid-day status review with staff.
good,My first call center job. It wasn't too bad. The hours tend to be the worst part of this job. Late nights take away from days with family or just life in general.
good,The company has passed its golden years but is always paranoid of falling behind to it continues to lead and innovate.
good,"After being employed over 9 years, I gained valuable experience that I will be able to take to any job in the future."
good,"Great company spend over a decade of my life working for them good pay, but a lot of pressure with performance sales #’s stress. Left them but not by choice I got discharged after 13yrs+ based on my numbers."
good,"Great company "
good,Came to work with a willing to learn and i was provided great service and support. It was a great field experience and i would recommend working for verizon to other tech seekers
good,I loved working at Verizon. It is a great company to work for. Pay is competitive and the benefits are excellent. I would recommend to anyone out there looking for a job.
good,Verizon gave me a chance to further my knowledge in sales while also teaching me life skills. My only recommendation is to consider work life balance when given the option of your schedule.
good,"Good inviorment and good place to"
good,I have great interpersonalI skills so it made my work day so much easier. I had great coworker we were a family. I work at a kiosk it was like running my own store. I really enjoyed working for Verizon wireless.
good,"Great company full of opportunities for those willing to work hard. Benefits are top notch, from health care to tuition assistance.   My time with Verizon was well spent."
good,I enjoyed working at this company. Benefits and management were amazing. The company takes care of their employees and I learned a lot working with several different management groups as well as different locations.
good,Loved what the company offers. My only negative ate the unreasonable required stats for job security and advancement were the cause of my job related stress.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"To sum up my normal work day, I followed a routine religiously."
good,"Very stressful working environment by meeting daily goals and QA. However, there is plenty of things to help remove stress like incentives and bonuses"
good,"although i did not have a good manager .I really did enjoy working for this particular company. Competitive pay, Great training classes/ seminars and commission"
good,Great Company to work for . Would recommend anyone who is fresh out of college wanting to grow in a rewarding career. Doesn't take long to get in to management.
good,"A culture of the highest ethical and moral standards.  Fast paced and meaningful, challenging work. The benefits are second to none with vacation, personal days, maternity and paternity leave, matching 401k, and profit sharing."
good,Company has great benefits and pay.  High volume of escalated customers made job very stressful. Must be able to work on your own. Very little supervisor help once you complete training.
good,"Great for short term work depending on who your manager is. Great Work environment, great place to learn new stuff. Sometimes we are able to move from 1 department to other."
good,As a contractor it was either fame or fortune. During the busy times there was much work to be completed but also sometimes you are on an on-call basis which sometimes is not the best for a home life. Would have to have a good partner to balance a home life such as kids and errands that needed to be handled.
good,This job is a non stop always busy job . Great for the tech savy people that love fast paced careers. You will be answering phones and placing customers in conferences via a headset and computer.  You may be setting up net conferences to go along with the audio calls . You will talk to famous and not so famous people as well. It can be a fun job if you let it . You may be trained to take the incoming reservations and switch your routine to placing the calls .
good,"A typical day at Verizon consisted escalating orders, collecting, analyzing, coordinating and reporting data on spreadsheets and presentations for various projects.  The work culture was very diverse!  The most enjoyable part of Verizon was being part of a team who cared about the customer.  The ultimate goal was to give the customer a great experience."
good,"The company has changed over the years, not always for the better,  but I can't thank Verizon enough for the life they have enabled for me and my family."
good,I loved working with everyone there and very much enjoyed the opportunities they gave me. I was allowed to do much more than what I was contracted for and worked with several different teams because of my background and knowledge.
good,The company compensates their employees very well if you are willing to work hard and listen to coaching from managers. The manager can make a great difference if you have the right one in your location. Work life balance leaves something to desire and the culture that Verizon is pushing is making it harder the employees to succeed. They want them to be able to sale and increase profit for the company but require them to trouble shoot and become Tech support with no training or education on the devices.
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon. I learned much and helped a lot of people with their computer issues. The training was extensive and prepared me for all work that I needed to do. I recommend Verizon as a good place to work.
good,"Learned great customer service skills, mastered multitasking and working as a team. Their training is top of the line and their work environment is super friendly."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. Need to be able to work any days/hours as scheduling is based off how long you have been with the company. Some supervisors are better than others- but you get that at any company."
good,"The VP micromanaged, very difficult to work with. Best part of the job were the co-workers, they were friendly and professional. Made lifetime friends,"
good,"Great company but something I'm not looking to do for too long, while it was great working with Verizon and learning useful skills to Target the consumers while learning to create an amazing team for a store."
good,I started this job right out of college. The company had a culture that was great to be apart of and made the employees want to be committed to the overall success of the company.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Tons of opportunity for money and advancement. Avg work week of 40+hrs. Benefits are great (PTO, employee discounts). Management tried to work with you to better yourself."
good,"You work retail hours which was not fun after a while. when a new phone launched example Iphone  it was all hands on deck."
good,"Working at Verizon is a great place to work with great benefits but as a single mom when I got my schedule there really were no accomadations for your schedule , cause you could choose a schedule but it wasn't always what you were going to get which makes it hard if your s single part trying to manage your schedule around daycare with a little one. But the pay was great and some of the managers were awesome and then there're are some who just didn't seem to care to help you."
good,Work was plentiful on the phones which led to the goal of not being on the phones and go into some type of support role.  Many of the support roles were taken by people unqualified or unenthusiatic about their jobs anymore.
good,"You have to have patience and empathy with the customer.  Also have an eye for detail and problem solving.  Be willing to be a team player.  "
good,I enjoyed my job. Meeting new people every day was awesome. Being able to help them see what they didnt know was fulfilling. My area was going through a ton of management and personnel so it was a little different. Structure was  changing. But if you did your job then everything fell in place.
good,we had 14 seconds to answer a call and get to the next call. Very fast pace. Sometimes we would get a call that someone was trying to call 911 but we handled the calls anyhow.
good,"I worked as a contractor for Verizon for 2 years. The work environment is very straightforward. I worked in desks next to other contractors for other departments. The atmosphere is quiet, but friendly."
good,"Money is great, but there is no work/life balance. The schedule change every three months. Everyone work three weekends per month. The hours get later and later."
good,"Great place to Work! Definitely a company that values and invests in its employees, offers great benefits-tuition reimbursement, full medical and dental, annual bonus based on performance"
good,Solid co-workers and management. Enjoyed employment. The co-workers were helpful and competitive. The people placed in leadership positions had great incentives to help create a friendly competitive vibe in the atmosphere.
good,"Verizon provided and opportunity for growth and experience. There was always a training available to help better yourself. When a position became available , the company hired from within first ."
good,"Great company, great pay and great work environment.  This is a great place to try and star a career. they are very team orientate and great schedules."
good,"Worked for the company going on 13 years. The pay is great. The benefits are fantastic. The people I work for are amazing, however I am finding difficulty finding career advancement. Looking for something new with a better work/life balance."
good,"I loved working for the company but some difficulties with the local management, though I have heard there has been some changes made. I would recommend them to anybody because Verizon is such a great company and forward thinking."
good,Long hours but good compensation. There is little opportunity for advancement and the company is constantly turning over staff through forced reductions.
good,"A great company to work for, I have been with the company for about four years. There is room for growth and advancement within the company. This is an awesome company to work for."
good,"Supported an enterprise client base in NYC , New Jersey , Mass and Utah. Had 22 staff technicians reporting to me in 4 states. I learned to trust others to do their jobs. I learned to treat people with respect and it will always come back to you. You have to make a decision , right or wrong but do something. You can always correct mistakes , you can do nothing about doing nothing. I truely enjoyed my time at Verizon. I cannot think of one bad experience. The people are very positive , and truely love to work. They had a desire to grow the business. It was hard to accept the change in the business that forced me to let so many good people go. A lot of folks thought of Verizon and their customers as family and it was difficult to see that end."
good,A really nice place to work. The hours can be hard when your days off are during the week and you don't get any days off. the pay is good and you get bonuses
good,"Best in class customer service training. You are consistently put on the forefront of the wireless industry. Employees are given top notch support, and access to a wealth of knowledge regarding industry trends, business needs and upcoming advances."
good,"Overall Verizon is a great place to work for and the culture is truly amazing. Depending on where you are in the company it can really be hard to tell if you will have much success in terms of growth within the company. Flexibility is pretty awesome but that depends on your director/boss. the headquarters location in NJ is the best as they have pretty much everything a employee would need to succeed on their job:Free coffee, state of art cafeteria, no cubicles, gym perks, lunch jams (party every thursday at lunch time) ,etc."
good,Verizon is a Great Place to work they provide great pay as well as flexible work schedules they offer 401k health and dental insurance as well as paid vacation and time off
good,"Great place to work, they pay they’re employees well and if you work hard and do the right things you controlled your overall pay. Retail hours so those leave your shifts to vary but overall great place."
good,It is a fast paced environment with so much scope to learn new things and face new challenges. Unexpected production issues always challenged me to learn a lot and communicate with cross teams and get the work done in tight schedule.
good,"The time I spent at Verizon I loved so much when it comes to a sales process and corporate environment. However I also learned that Verizon at ""Silver Spring"" location really doesn't have any idea what they want from their employees and would rather place blame on employees then to admit failure on a new process. My title as a sales/customer service rep was false my title was actually only a sales rep. being that there was very little importance in resolving customer issues, the most important thing was to NOT transfer to the correct department that the customer needed to be in touch with as we were directed to attempt all possible sales opportunities and provide phone number to department then direct customers to disconnect just to call back in again to resolve issues. I disagreed with this process so much that it began to take a toll on my impression of Verizon as I was a strong believer in ""better matters"" and #1 customer satisfaction awards. As a employee we were penalized for transfers as it was viewed and taught to be ""customer mistreat,"" please be advised that we received any and all calls ranging from billing, collections, repair, new connects, renewals, direct manager request. There were more issues that I encountered while working at Verizon ""Silver Spring MD"" but this being one of my biggest. Overall Verizon was a great experience but I do not agree with a lot of their new policies,"
good,Company was overall enjoyable to work for. Mangement often seemed more interested in pay than advancement of teams or learning at times. Training programs and training aspects of the company are a nightmare.
good,Quick-paced position assisting with customer requests for Verizon services.  Work flow was constant and a bit stressful at times working with many internal groups to assign service.
good,"leader in a dying retail industry. quotas skyrocketed over the last year even though the market is slowing. closed my store due to low quota achievement, but the quotas did not accurately reflect the slow traffic. unfair quotas."
good,Verizon is a very competitive and  stressful organization.  constant relocation constant selling and work culture change great pay and benefits good company to work for.
good,"The job was temp - should be made permanent for contractors.  The work was not to stressful, but it was challenging. Again the only complain is the 22 months of employment before being let go by Verizon."
good,Verizon was a very interesting place to work. New faces to see everyday. Always new puzzles to solve and working with technology is a passion of mine.
good,A typical day was balanced. Learned a lot about computer on the back end help people resolve compute problems. The hardest part was when computers for a whole company failed and it took more than an hour to get them back up and running. Great work environment.
good,"Responsible for opening or closing of location.   Opening completing check points opening secured inventory, updating merchandising and relaying any company updates  to staff.  Reviewed with staff daily target goal and created visuals to increase moral and encourage growth.   Management staff worked closely so to communicate status of goals for the month.  Hardest part of job, creating a sale when no steady flow of customers.  Necessary to get employees on phones to reach out to new and existing customers.  Most enjoyable part of job, working with customers and employees to find fit solutions for communication needs."
good,"Being a sales representative at Verizon was very difficult because due to very demanding KPIs, there was always a lack in customer service which has made it difficult to perform at my best"
good,Its feels more as if you are pushing people to buy instead of actually helping customers and showing them that they need certain devices. Maybe the way i was trained just was not proper.
good,I didn't work for Verizon I work for an agency. It was a great opportunity. I got a chance to work with amazing team in the Legal Department. Workplace was quite and calm.
good,Very personable.  Enjoyed the care free spirit while effectively performing job responsibilities in a timely manner.  Enjoyed free style dress code.  Learned a great deal while performing steller.
good,Great place to work! Awesome benefits and 401k. Decent salary for college grad that wants to gain sales experience. There is no room for advancement within the company.
good,Great benefits and training very fun environment great managers its just a good company to work for !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Worked for 6 years.  Commended for efficiency. Received about 1000 calls per day.  Management are accommodating."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"It is a great company with great benefits, but the work life balance in retail is hard. The store leadership focus more on development of the store rather than developing employees."
good,"I had the pleasure of working with an awesome director and team who supported my school endeavors as well as my need to take care of personal matters during working hours. This is a perfect place to work and is one of the few employers that provide an atmosphere that is second to none."
good,had a blast working for the company but the are very quick to let people go i randomply came in and was let go no warning. they pay alot but theres no job security at all
good,"Nice place to work. "
good,"Took orders from our customer regarding circuits and when they were to be installed at site.  Held daily conference calls with customers to make sure all orders were being taken care of.  We were on call pretty much 24 hours a day and when a circuit went down would get called all hours of the night and would field techs, supervisors, etc to get resolved on a conference call."
good,seul livre a soit mémé tout la journée quelque soit le travail
good,"Pay was very good, although the commission structure changed to lower success of making money. Career advancement? Made more money than managers did.."
good,Excellence company to work for and with. Company is 24 hours 7 days a week.  All levels of career paths in varies states.  Good benefits working there was really good.  100% education training..
good,Mobile Generation needs to learn to advertise to attract the right customers and recruit the right sales representatives. They fired me without any warning.
good,"shifts change weekly, very, very busy environment, Saturday work, great pay, shift differentials also, union shop, friendly and helpful co-workers and managers,"
good,"Verizon is best company to work . Verizon invest lot of money for employees certifications, education and this is really superb place to work with good work life balance. Only neegative cocnern is with some middle management people where they play politics and disturbs our career growth by not giving promotions and helping in growth. Overall, Verizon is best place to work"
good,"Answer and take calls. I enjoyed my coworkers. I handled the rebate forms, certify the correct paperwork and speak with customers to find solutions to their problems."
good,"One of the best places, to work at, opportunities all around. Great benefits. 401k available at the beginning of employment. Great culture with a diverse crowd and managment is well."
good,"I was hired as a contractor to manage a project to get all the baby bells on the same page in terms of the server configuration and workstations. I spent a year testing, writing installation documentation, and finally deploying a push to 11,000 server and 150,000 workstations over a weekend using Microsoft SMS"
good,Miss working with Verizon. I was one of the people in Florida that was transitioned to Frontier then laid off after 6 months. The management I worked for under Verizon were great to work for. Good work / home balance and flexible. My position and the manager I worked for were challenging and I loved it.
good,you will be pused to the limits and they will train you well but theres no work life balance and if you have a family forget it.
good,I was fortunate to spend my career at the Bell Companies.  Verizon was my least favorite company to work for.  Bell of PA was the best company I worked for.  Decent pay and benefits.  Stressful conditions and work was difficult and challenging.
good,Love the commission made and always being aware of new technology. I also loved discounts I received...great for gifting. I hated the customers they weren't the brightest
good,"Verizon is a great workplace . Really good opportunities to advance and move through the company ,really good training setup and very nice support through"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Typically 8 hours in a call center environment. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the erratic schedule. We spend most of our time moving between different NOCs.
good,Customer service call center for cellular service. Provides the top service in the United States and believes in their product 100%. Entegrity values all in place of business . Being friendly and showing your concerns for every customer needs help the customer trust that his/her issues and concerns are going to be resolve .
good,Working at Verizon Wireless was a real great time.  The company speaks about work/life balance but as a sales rep there really is no work life balance.  Days off vary and shift schedules change.  The money is great! I made alot of money and had a great time doing it.
good,"Verizon was a nice place to work. Just like any job, some days you may be overwhelmed, flooded with calls, other days it calms it self out."
good,Verizon Telecommunications Inc. is an extreme and diverse workplace that is always developing and maintaining telephony technology. Management and higher officers are not a good representation of the Verizon Telecommunications brand. It is the technicians from outside to inside that really makes Verizon Telecommunication viable to the mainstream public.
good,"This is a good company that trains you in various disciplines that are crucial to a companies productivity! "
good,i just support it customers with cell phone issues as well as sold other verizon products. i enjoyed working with this  company and would go back if i was to relocated back to califonria
good,Great company if base salary is good and you are compensated well. Decent benefits and good work life balanced. Best in class.
good,Management provides many activities outside of work to build team continuity. Management provides great training and structure for job at hand.  Company hires great employees to make job easier and fun.
good,"It has been a great place to work. The culture is the best that I have seen from any company. The staff specifically at my current store location is great. The one downfall I have seen is the ability to move up is only attainable from Sales Positions, and often times those who become managers don't have the skills to develop and lead."
good,"Great for career experience.  Great for a start up or ending career., great benefits and 401k and competitive market salary."
good,"Productive company with co-workers who quickly became my ""work family"".  A typical day at work started at 9:00 a.m. and ended at 7:00 p.m. There was little time for breaks. I learned the value of patience and truly caring about the customer's needs. The hardest part of the job was that I had no time for my small daughter, who had to be in daycare, or either in the care of friends and/or family. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,Verizon has taught me a lot in nine years. Its a fast paced environment where you are always learning something new. Upper level management seems quite nice but interaction with them is very limited. There are  various departments in Verizon and the Sales and Service aspect is the most difficult area. The Sales and Service Department doesn't allow for great opportunities for advancement.
good,Everyday got to work with excitement enthusiasm and ready to learn and work. checking emails throughout the day greeting customers at the door helping customers above and beyond. Co workers were amazing management was great best part of the job was it felt like a big family had a great district  manager
good,Large company with great opportunities to learn new services and move up within the department.  An individual can gain a plethora of experience in a very short amount of time.
good,"I was employed there for a total of 7 years and absolutely loved everyone i worked with.  The work is extremely up paced & detail oriented.  Only issue is upper management.  The communication between managers & directors etc is extremely unfair, belittling, and disrespectful.  Aside from uppermanagement all the customers enjoyed my account management/service management as i was always extremely attentive & provided sense of urgency even while on vacation. The culture comes from Terremark and very much enjoyed working for Terremark.  Verizon provided constant learning which i appreciated and enjoyed."
good,Testing network. Rolling out new technology. Troubleshooting new issues. Verizon is a good company to work in. That's all I can say.
good,"I looked forward to everyday of work, because I was the one in charge of helping people and getting my own sales quota.  I had great co-workers that enjoyed doing the same.  Management helped on most occasions, but preferred we worked our own problems out for the customers. I would love to be in this type of work atmosphere again."
good,"A typical day at work consist of me providing the best constomer service I can give, and to to make the customer happy with the products."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"I typical day at work includes inventory, emails, check lists, conference calls, problem solving  and sales."
good,Work life balance. Diversified with contractors. Good pay. Generous Paid Time off. Great benefits. Advancement opportunities. Tuition reimbursement. Laid back.
good,I learned my professional customer service skills.. the hardest part of the job is to make sure on every call you have done all that you can for the customer
good,"Verizon is, like all large providers, constantly looking for ways to expand their margin.  With competition as fierce as it is these days, there are only a few ways to do so.  One is to limit your product offering and phase out old, difficult to deliver and maintain services like wire line and ATM.  Another way is to parcel off pieces of your network and lease them back at a much lower cost than owning and maintaining it would be.  The third, and most effective way, is to reduce labor costs.  Verizon has been off shoring a very large amount of it's process related functionality for quite some time.  Most of this activity is not customer facing, but that is changing very rapidly as the labor costs continue to go up in the US.  Highly skilled, highly qualified customer facing Project Managers, Customer Service Managers, and Technical Managers are being laid off in droves.  Consequently, customers are now dealing with an organizational culture that is focused on reporting metrics and not quality of experience.  It is becoming more and more difficult to implement complex networks as Verizon's senior leadership continues to look for ways to increase the bottom line."
good,"it was cool pretty stress free relaxed on my end"
good,Verizon was a good place to work.  I was able to complete 26 years and learn new skills.  I have had several different jobs within the company.
good,"On a typical day in this position we take incoming calls on average about 40-55 calls per day with people who may have issues with their bill or technical support issues and try to come up with a solution for them that resolves the customers issue as well as increase the bottom line for the company. Our goal is to make our customers aware of possible accessories, devices or services we have available that may suit there needs. In this position I have learned to except change and constantly be able to adapt and change."
good,Wake up at 4.30 for physical training to start off the day. Then come back after personal hygiene to start the work day. I managed over 56 personal on the work day job duties every day. That was a real joyful moment for me.
good,"Overall, I love this place, its been good to me. People are great, pay is really good, benefits are the best of anyone I know. It has been the best career move I've ever made."
good,"great place to work , excellent benefits.  work Environments are always excellent  with plenty of professional work resources and training."
good,"Flextronics (contracted through Verizon)"
good,"Verizon was a excellent company to work for. My local management was supportive and professional. I was based at the Cleveland Federal Building as well as the Cleveland FBI and Cleveland Clinic Foundation were I gained much knowledge and experience in high profile, high stress environments."
good,Partner with B2B sales groups to drive M2M sales effort and data activations wide and deep within assigned accounts while developing new data opportunities.
good,Wonderful company to work for and benefits are above average.
good,"Currently undergoing an transition from telecom company to technology company - lots of leadership changes, and organizational changes that are impact focus"
good,"I joined in VDSI in 2008, a company that keep recognizing the talent and give the promotions, pay hikes etc on time."
good,"very stressful .... rewarding but stressful .. sups are alway pushing you to get more sales always down your back even if your doing well and exceling in the companies eyes  and some people need that others don't  ..... in bound calls for 8 hours and there are times in the year you HAVE TO do Overtime ... every rewarding when you do well company paid trips .... sales driven ,,,,"
good,"Great time working here. great people, great management. learned a lot"
good,"free phone annual bonus, lots of people on FMLA for stress, anxiety, the stress and made to feel less than,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Serving people is very rewarding when accomplished correctly.
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for. Everything is being centralized into New Jersey and the work style and culture in Jersey is cut throat. A lot of politics, but this is true in any large corporation."
good,"Fast paced but pays well with great benefits,nice facility located in Elgin"
good,"A very  cool place to be employed. Had the opportunity to meet a variety of people, and see great shows."
good,I loved working at Verizon! Unfortunately the contract was for only two years.
good,Over all Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. Has great benefits and room to grow if you’re willing to put the work in to show that you are serious about your carrier
good,"I did not like the politics involved between management and the operators. It was a union job so whenever the management could cause you grief, they would."

good,"My duties at Verizon Wireless Retail Store is to assist sales representative close transactions by setting up phones, putting accessories together, as well as gathering items they need. My duties also consist of greeting at the door and checking customers into the queue to be assisted by the next representative."
good,"Throughout the day the expectations were pretty consistent. Provided the best customer service experience. The best way to do this is to treat each customer with the respect that you would want. The management were better classified as leaders. "

good,Average 38 calls per day assisting with technical support and billing issues as well as device questions
good,Daily plugging into the head-set right at the right minute when the day began. Getting onto line to obtain what the customer wanted. I learned a lot about parts of America we serviced when they would ask for a specific business and they'd explain what they were looking for. I learned to be helpful to those who called and to co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of when to take breaks and start and finish times as they were different every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and staff who were very likable for the job itself. Loved it.
good,"THis job was great at first pay was great but after your training you would see how it really was long hours on the phone, no change from day to day micromanagement not much support from leadership."
good,"A typical day at Verizon Wireless was very insightful.  This job has taught me a great deal with how to deal with different cultures, ideas and personalities.  I also did learn so much about how to multi-task, as this job was very fast-paced daily.   My co-workers made it exciting to come to work and played a great part of my success.  The hardest part of this job was the work-life balance at times.  It was usually easy to balance, but at times could be challenging.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the success of my center and employees."

good,Verizon has a great benefit package and pays well after the first year.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,They set goals and expected them to be met which I enjoyed. It was at times a stressful job like any call center. I loved all my co-workers and learned that when you helped a co-worker the favor was usually returned.
good,"Greet customers in a in a professional timely manner. Assist with billing questions, run soft credit checks, open"
good,My co-workers were very friendly and i am still in contact with them. You learn a lot from this company and it shows how why Verizon is one of the greatest companies to work for.

good,I received a great deal of statisfaction assisting customers with their problems with their cell phones. This is what I am searching for in a new position: the ability to help people resolve their problems.
good,on a scale from 1 to 10 the score would be 5/ the company has a double standard

good,this was a temp job that i knew was temp overall a good job would have been better if perm
good,"A typical day at work involves receiving calls from anywhere in the United States from people interested in buying or shopping cell phones, finding plans or helping a customer with an issue. I learned that every customer is unique and we must treat them in a special way to satisfy their needs. Managers help you at every step of the way. Your co-workers are there to help you with a technical difficulty or just cheering you up when you have a bad day. The hardest part of the job is the demand of overtime, it's sometime overwhelming because you can work 12 to 15 hours some days and the next day the company expects you to do the same. There is no work-life balance. Work is always in your mind. The most enjoyable part of the job is achieving a great sale, where you help the customer purchase a great phone as well as accesories that well make the customer glad they spoke to you and will refer friends and family to you."
good,Directory assistance operator
good,They are very flexible. Training is slow. Trainers are personable.
good,I enjoyed working there especially under my HR Manager. My manager provided me with valuable experience in sourcing and recruiting. The office was very organized and I was unsupervised most of the time so that left me responsible for getting my daily work load done.
good,I worked on websites within this area. It was a lot of learning how their structure worked. The hardest part was not being able to move up within their organization. The enjoyable part was working with the people.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Job duties may vary depending upon your position but, all of them require you to have excellent customer service skills. There is day to day customer interaction which requires multipule task such as billing support, technical support, trouble shooting, escalations, research. Verizon Wireless also requires all employees to train on new devices and policies when new ones are introduced to the company. The jobs requires a lot of mutitasking and it is a fast paste position. Each position within the company requires you to meet your monthly goals both personally and as a team. The best part of working for this company is the benefits. This is not a job for people who do not like sitting behind a desk all day."
good,"customer service, enjoyed working for this company. Worked there for several years."

good,Good pay. Must meet monthly quotas. Full benefits after training period.
good,"I have really enjoyed working with this company for the past 10 years. I have become an expert in the wireless world. It has also given me experience in customer service, sales, marketing & advertising, billing, call center (in & outbound calls). My career has prepared me for the next level of service in my career."
good,Unfortunately due to low seniority I was laid off. But would gladly return if called.
good,I like the job because you get to meet new people also travel. The pay was unlimited you were your own boss you set your own schedual the job was never physical just mental
good,"The environment is constantly changing and very busy, always goals to meet and people to meet with, training and reviews are always happening"
good,Good job Good benefits Good Union
good,Verizon is a great company to work for . However the retail sector doesn't allow for much work life balance and they only focus on the needs of the business.
good,"awesome company to work for great pay and friendly environment updated working equipment great  benefits and incentives supervisor give great motivation,  encouragement to do better and enroll in class of employee as needed"
good,"Verizon was a great place to work, pleasant coworkers and management. Dealing with irate customers can be difficult day in and day out, but with the support and coaching and training Verizon provides, it makes those situations less difficult."
good,"Job security is a big concern, No room for creativity. You need to perform the existing process only. Work pressure differs from Team to team and person to person."
good,"Working in Verizon is good.  Time is flexible also people are nice.    The main problem is it is new operation company, not a software development company.  All related job are related with software maintenance."
good,"Navigating the social system is a key skill."
good,Excellent company and work environment by Colorado Springs's Garden of the Gods center. Work was tedious and meticulous but rewarding. Benefits were lacking due being a contractor and verizon only give contractors exactly 30 months on the job before being rotated out!
good,"Verizon was an excellent place to work as an Emerging Technology Consultant III of Unified Communications and Collaboration(UCC).  My role was a subject matter expert in UCC.  "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a challenging but very rewarding job that requires tons of energy and focus on customer obsession. It bares with it a difficult work/life balance due to scheduling.
good,"I left for personal family reasons, not reasons for not liking the company. I would go back if my person situation had changed. I would recommend this job for anyone not trying to raise a family. This is the type of work for someone young and just starting in the workforce."
good,Very demanding environment.  Many employee resources.  Opportunities for advancement.  Engaged management that is not afraid to get their hands dirty when needed.
good,"Being one of the leaders within the organization allowed me to make decisions in order to ensure we operate daily in a way that will meet the desired regulatory targets and KPI's.  Personal pressure to me and the team to be ""Best in Class"" added additional stress to the daily operations."
good,Verizon is a really fun place to work. If you can sell you can make money. Work life balance is really hard. Working in customer service is always hard however Verizon is an excellent company to work for.
good,Not ready for the launch of thre product. Management did not provide any training which id what I needed.It was good position but the environment wasn't good for a learning experience. I was often wondering why we had to complete douvble entry work bit did so anyway. I thought everyone was very nice.
good,"I thought I will retire to this company. I love how they pay employees and stay im current market. Generous bonus and very competitive salary. However, due to company status they could layoff alot of people."
good,Good company to work for but over time the commission goal continues to get harder to  achieve or over exceed on a monthly  basis.  If you have a family  it's very little work life balance  but that's with most retail jobs.
good,I love Verizon but the hours are not really allowing me to balance life and work. I’m a mother of 4 and Verizon is not really a place to work with small children and a small support system. Other than that it’s a great place to work if your single no kids or have an awesome support system to help you out. Love love love Verizon.
good,I recommend Verizon as a top place to work. They have a great work environment and care about their employees. The training I received was exemplary and they offer continued support.
good,"I enjoyed my experience.  Left due to work hours. But overall, a good experience.  I liked doing inventory of phones and accessories.  I enjoyed my coworkers as well."
good,Fast pace and good hourly pay but commission target it somewhat unreachable. The company has tuition reimbursement and discounts on accessories and cellular plans
good,Great place to work great benefits and salary. You will work a lot of hours and you will have the opportunity to work from home. This is a job with a large project scope which you will have
good,"First thing before each shift change they hold a meeting going over all projections, goals, and ideas on how to achieve them.  This is also the time when we are educated on new products and/or technology.  You address any questions you may have or concerns, then on the floor the remaining of the day working with customers and implementing those strategies throughout the day and track your progress for the next meeting."
good,"•	Responsibilities include; providing phone support for Verizon wireless voice and data customers"
good,"This job is never dull. The schedule changes on an hourly basis."
good,This was great place to work.  Great benefits and great working environment. There are several opportunities to progress within this organization.  I would recommend this organization to anyone.
good,"Always have new challenges to resolve.  Constantly looking for process improvement and efficiency.  Team focus, so there is always knowledge sharing and learning from each other."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. Leading the telco industry with a great work and innovative ideas the opportunity are there if you choose to work hard.
good,I work from home so that is nice but the hours change every 6 months and the job can be stressful. Have to be ready for lots of changes to work duties with very little training
good,"Verizon was a great company to work for, they offer competitive pay rates and fast ways to move up. Only decided to leave because they didn’t offer part time position while I was in college."
good,"Minimum 8hr days with two 15min breaks and 1hr lunch. "
good,"Verizon has good benefits.  However, the job there as Tech Support expert should have had a higher salary.  Also, for the most part, they don't allow you to speak naturally.  They, way to say specific things that for the most part sounds forced and un-natural.  An almost mindless robot that starts sounding like an IVR recording.  People are not dumb, and know what you are saying is not sincere.  The reason for that would be that it's what everyone else has to say.  A mindless robot that that is forced to say what they want you to say, and then get scolded that you did not say, even when the customer survey was perfect."
good,"For this job one must really love technology. the money can be very good. work days are very busy. I enjoyed being a CSR but not a sales rep. Being forced to move to sales was not the best option for me.There was really not the right move for me.They wanted you to up sell the customer. I was told to have every customer leave with a smart phone. Selling a product to a customer that told you exactly what they wanted I had trouble with cause I knew it would be returned. Sales reps would do some not so appropriate things causing the customer more money and management would over look it because their numbers were being produced. If this job is what you want then do it with integrity.Best position is CSR, there you can make all the difference to a customer and their experience."
good,"-  Best place to work"
good,"Sales.represenatives win more trlp most definitely make a whole lot more money  "
good,A really fun place to work. You can actually see and experience what is meant by culture diversity. I'd encourage anyone seeking employment to apply at Verizon
good,"As a senior account executive, I was responsible for (3) fortune 500 companies worldwide networks.  This included LAN/WAN, security, appdev, wireline and wireless"
good,I have been employed here for almost 22 years. Good pay and benefits.  Solid company.   8 hour shifts with opportunity for overtime.  I have been lucky and have worked with great people.
good,"I learned a amazing amount in industry information and most importantly sales techniques. We would regularly have sales practices using different methods. Our training was also fantastic, we had two months of training for for indusrty, tech knowledge as well as sales skills. After initial training was completed we continuously, throughout employment, had VZ learning portal to learn about new products, tech, and techniques to sell certain products how to sale certain products. points of sales, differentiation etc."
good,"Great Company to work for, good benefits. Not much room for career advancement. Fast paced and positive work environment. Amazing people to work with and great benefits"
good,The company was great on promoting within and the medical benefits were amazing.  I was there 17 years and the only complaint that I could reference to is the strict attendance policy
good,"I enjoyed my time there, and I would recommend it to somebody else. It was a very good experience because everybody is treated like family. They always are willing to go over and beyond."
good,Learned and experienced many valuable lessons at Verizon.  Verizon is a great place to start your carrier which will guide you through to be a very successful individual.
good,"As with large companies, politics can play a big part, silos exist, and it may take a long time to make decisions. Unfortunately there is a lot of change and re-structuring which can cause uncertainties and become a distraction."
good,I loved our company team and who we worked for. Our ceo paid for us to travel to headquarters to learn different techniques and skills in the industry.
good,"The job had great benefits and if you sold enough you could make a great check. The hours was one of the worst parts of the job, their was to different shifts and it could be different for you each day."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Nice people, strong Company purpose and direction, great benefits. Lots of personal and professional development opportunities. Online learnings for continued growth."
good,Great Growth and Learning Experience. I learned alot during my time at Verizon and they had excellent benefits.  The coworkers and culture were very productive at managing and growth fo reach employee
good,"It was a great overall experience but I was unfortunate with timing of a nationwide layoff in the thousands."
good,"I loved my job at VZW.  The schedule could have been a little better, but overall it is a great place to work.  The employee discounts are good and I would say that they treated their employees fairly.  Very strict attendance/tardiness policy, but if you can comply then you won't have any problems."
good,"It is a typical call center positions but much more advanced and complex being that it is Verizon Wireless. Although I was in Tech Support primarily we were still required to assist with any situation a customer may call in for even if it is not a technical issue. They did a great job of rewarding and recognizing hard working reps and having events that family could attend and be apart of. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the individual customers and their different personalities over the phone. Some individuals during a call could be extremely difficult, disrespectful, and down right rude."
good,I liked working in the sales department for Verizon because it made me want to make more sales when a good commission plan is in place. It was great to see that hard work will pay off.
good,Verizon is a good company all around the managers at this particular site we’re not the best but other made up for that . Hours are flexible and Overtime is often unlimited and offered to anyone meeting qualifying performance goals
good,"Verizon was a good job. I would recommend I learned a lot from this job, I had to relocate to get a new job. I will say that it was a cut throat job and you have to make sure to meet your sales goals every month."
good,"Good pay and benefits, lousy management."
good,"Verizon pays well and has been stable over the years.  They are probably top heavy and have higher costs/older workers.  Verizon exited the cloud business, showing that they were too bureaucratic and slow moving to compete effectively.  The wireless line of business is strong.  Enterprise business is slowing,"
good,"Micromanaged environment, everything is time sensitive. In order to be productive you have to be 110% ready everyday. Management number driven, have to stay focused. Workplace environment can be"
good,The work was very challenging however it was always full filling. The benefits were amazing and made sure that you had the knowledge to do the job that you were assigned to do.
good,It’s a great company to work for. I work there for 14 years. I was just laid off after 14 years of working for the company. If I had the opportunity I would work for Verizon again . They invest a lot of time and training in their employees.
good,"Verizon Online was a typical sales environment...competitive and stressful. Because everything is sales and commission driven, there is a lack of comradery throughout the department. In sales, that is probably not out of the ordinary, but nevertheless...uncomfortable. Yes!!! this extends to management too!!!"
good,"Loved working there, but the thing about wireless sales it is not always going to be there. Sales go up and down, people lose jobs easily. You have to come in determined to sell or you will not last."
good,Verizon has a very good company that you can grow in abd with in different states.  Georgia was not a center or a career with verizon I would have stayed a part of due to mismanagement.
good,"Verizon is a well balanced location.  You are the main source of their revenue, so they treat you well.  Everything is focused on you and it is enjoyable."
good,"I loved going to work everyday."
good,"Pay is great, benefits are excellent as well. Work/life balance is not the best but compensation makes up for some of that. Good culture and respectable environment."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,This was  good place to work but the existing sales people were treated much different than the new hires.  Somehow Verizon that the new hires would be better.  Not so much
good,Never regretted  any time spent at Verizon. Great place to work and values employees time. Great benefits including tuition reimbursement which is key for anyone looking to further their education or improve their skills.
good,it was a nice company to work for . i liked working there. it was a pleasant experience since the co workers and other collegues were super nice to everyone who worked there.
good,"Great company to work for, however once you reach management the opportunity for you to climb higher goes away. Also management should be held at a higher salary"
good,This was a great job out of college with lots of options to move around company and grow.  The benefits were great and helped make the compensation seem better-although the bonus structure was great.
good,"While with Verizon I had several assignments such as processing service request for residential, small business and government customers.  Acted as a training Instructor and wrote Methods & Procedures. Received excellent training and support services."
good,Verizon pays really well but the money depends on your level of sanity. Verizon paid well but my peace of mind is way more important  than money. They do have a pretty good cafeteria but it’s expensive.
good,"the pay was great as were the benefits. HR did their best to create and maintain a great work culture. they had many events catering to employees and great career advancement opportunities as well as performance bonuses. the only drawback was that upper management didn't consider employees when they decided to reorganize the company according to ""real estate"" policies."
good,The company culture respects the diversity of ideas as a way to strengthen the overall team.  Performance standards are fair and objective.  Heavey investments are made in employee development and training.
good,"Working VZW retail provides for a great opportunity to meet interesting people as well as make great friends. Management at verizon can be hit or miss because they don't hire people that would make great managers, instead they only promote people with good sales numbers and hope that they can bring up everyone else's sales numbers, which can lead to many awful managers. Mandatory overtime on black friday and iphone launch days however generally the retail schedule can be very flexible, verizon offers a good amount of paid time off as well. Commission based sales allows for you to make as much money as you can potentially earn however this comes with tons of pressure and a high degree of micromanagement on almost every transaction. Be prepared to be grilled by your manager during almost every sale to talk strategy."
good,"I liked work in Verizon, and I learn important things about quality assurance. What I liked the most was the working environment that was very organized, clean and in a good mood. Verizon each month granted several recognitions to employees."
good,"great company until knew leaders took over"
good,I enjoyed working at Verizon and the benefits that came with the job. I would definitely recommend Verizon Wireless as a place to work and get a great experience.
good,"This place offers awesome benefits but the work environment can get stressful.  If you are willing to move, there are a lot more opportunities.  If not, the only option you will have is a supervisor which is a terrible job here.  Many supervisors decide to go back to an entry level position rather than stay a supervisor."
good,Verizon was a great place to work for me. I felt in control of my paycheck and all of my years in sales made over 65k. Most years in the high 70s. I left because I wanted evenings and weekends off.
good,Good place to work if you can handle telemarketing. The one thing I would recommend is to make sure that you can handle sitting at a computer all day long while talking to customers.
good,If you are technical and like to explain new technology to people from all walks of life than this is a great place to work.  Fast paced work environment with ever changing technology.
good,"Excellent company to work at.  Great job and excellent company benefits including vested 401K, annual bonus, annual raise, good group dynamics. good people"
good,"The Telematics Industry or IOT Industry is a fast growing market with tremendous growth.  Worldwide Leader with many new and exciting opportunities to develop, enhance, and grow your career."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,When I started with the company in 1987 it was very amply oriented.as the company merged with Bell Atlantic it became less family friendly.Im happy overall to have worked for the company.
good,"Great Company to work for i loved this company, great job great pay great culture i would recommend this company to any one looking for a great company to work for"
good,"While working for Verizon Wireless, I was able to see the first store open in this market. I was given amazing training and compensation for the work that I did. The hours were long but it was worth it. It was a great position if you are sales minded, competitive, and like working with the public. This was a wonderful place to work."
good,Great company to be apart of. Great benefits. Positive motivation and product training. Competitive environment and high paced. Must be able to earn the right to sales to anybody.
good,Stressful changed a lot  on phone with no reprieve the bosses micro manage the pay and benefits are good but the rest kinda like a sweat shop. Was offered good package to leave.
good,"Verizon is a very nice to company to work, i have learnt so many things after joining here.workplace culture is very friendly.They encourage us in learning new things and support people in taking courses and certifications that are required for the changing technology."
good,"Verizon is the best because of their talented People. However, Field Technicians have little or no chance of advancement as the skills they acquire are found not to be applicable to any other Roles within the company- seemingly so"
good,Very fast paced and a fun place to work! Can be stressful if quota isn't met. Need a love of working with people.  Also needs to be a good problem solver.
good,i didnt work at verizon i worked at rose international. but i would love to work for verizon. at rose they had great service and managment. i had no problems there at all
good,The company is large and you will be a number. Training and education is wonderful. The psychology necessary to perform at high company standards along with technical skills are demanding. Excellent diversity and leadership on the corporate level.
good,I would definitely be still working at Verizon if I had not been part of those laid off in November 2016. I was employed with the company for 10 1/2 years and enjoyed my time there.
good,"Great work ethic, awesome people."
good,"Love, love, loved this place! The management was willing to help your to perform better and they were very nice. It was a very fun environment and the people are fun!"
good,"During my time at Verizon, I learned how to deal with the many types of customers, happy/upset. I grew as an individual and I learned so much about being independent, making executive decisions, how to manage time and the many tasks given to me. I did love working for the company but sometimes the culture at an individual store can change the morale of the employees."
good,"Position at Customer Billing Operations/Customer Billing Systems in Monroeville PA.  First LAN administrator on site.  Took operation from terminals to laptop/desktop computers.  Started as DOS and windows for workgroups using Novell to Windows XP and Server 2008 when I left.  After six years as CBO/CBS administrator moved to Lan Desktop Support Group out of Pittsburgh.  Learned how to do mass deployments and support a diverse group of employees, systems, and software.  Part of a large team (2 states) found it easy to resolve problems via teamwork.  This position allowed a lot of personal flexibility to schedule day to day workload. Although a contractor and not an employee i was treated as one."
good,"Monthly release and one mini release per month."
good,Verizon is a well run company. The management here is always willing to help those that put forth the effort to get better. They also want everyone to succeed and put you in a position for that. Benefits are some of the best in the business. Work/Life balance is a problem with being in a retail store. Late hours make it difficult on family life. Goals are obtainable and compensation is worth the hard work. The job is very fast paced and customer service oriented. Getting to solve peoples problems and provide solutions was a great aspect of the job.
good,I received my job through a temporary agency and my job was seasonal. I was employed as a greeter which inturn turned into me helping with other things but not being compensated for those jobs.
good,"I worked for Verizon for 7 years then they did company lay offs and got rid of my position it was a great company to work for but it does take away a lot of your home time but that's the case with any retail job. I don't suggest ever joining the union or thinking about joining if its ever presented to you, that is probably the worst thing you can do as a wireless retail worker, they will do ABSOLUTELY nothing to help you. I was unionized at At&t Wireless and then the union came to my job at Verizon and the unioln made everything 150 times worst just they were only concerned about landline workers and not wireless. But besides that its a great place to work good people and great memories."
good,"Excellent company to work for. Great benefits and bonuses"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company that will grow and develop your professional skill sets needed for the lifetime career that you will transition into.
good,"I worked here for over 2 years. Loved the job for a long time but about half way through my location brought in two managers from Radio Shack a business that closed down. These guys effectively reduced our numbers as well by demoralizing their entire team with old sales tactics that do not apply in a Verizon environment. LOVE Verizon, but be careful applying in Evansville."
good,I very much enjoyed working for Verizon. The benefits were great and the overall work environment was very positive. Lots of opportunity and the college tuition benefit they offer is hard to beat.
good,Nice clean workplace with great people to work with. A lot of interaction between people in and out of the office along with vendors. Most people have a positive attitude and want to work.
good,"The typical  day  at work included  developing the  ETL jobs  to  load the  data  into the  target tables."
good,Good company to work for. Benefits were good. Pay was good. Work shifts weren't always the best for people with kids. Some weekends required. High call volume.
good,Verizon was a fun place to work with the ever changing technology and challenges at work. The workplace culture was very positive and motivating. I would go back to work their as a single person with no family.
good,"Verizon is a good place to work with different culture and verity of organisations. A company offers to learn many diversified subjects and work in different teams, that include on-site and off-shore ."
good,"it was a great job. the pay was great, and the work was steady. not too hard and by no means easy, but you felt good t the end of the day. i looked forward to going to work everyday"
good,Greet incoming guests and sell them new technology. Great team atmosphere catered around competition. Dealing with Verizon's systems wasn't always the best.
good,"Enjoyed my 16+ years with Verizon.  Unfortunately, my work location ceased operations on 1/27/2017 due to an organization realignment.  Was able to secure two degrees through Verizon's outstanding tuition assistance program ($8,000 per year--prepaid).  Good career advancement opportunities."
good,"Overall great place to work, however you do work in a retail environment so nights and weekends are a requirement to work. You will make some of the best friends you have had there. with the industry declining however career advancement opportunities are few and far between."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work,  you get good pay but you'll battle work life balance. Verizon are innovator and training provided for employees is top of the line"
good,I like the Work Culture and Work Place in Verizon. There is a lot of scope to learn the latest Technologies and Upgrade the skills needed for the IT Industry.
good,Great company they provide excellent benefits to their employers.  Always make training available to learn and a good work/life balance. Because it's a cell phone company it's always changing everyday and you have to be ready for that change.
good,The district manager at the time was terrible. The only reason i quit. She would make you feel like Everything was your fault and you needed to just give up and would do it every time she came to the store. Other than that evil person it was a very nice place to work.
good,Productive work environment while learning the basis of a management training program. The management is very hands on to help you learn new material in your field.
good,"A day at work with Verizon, TCC is very fun and uplifting, there really isnt anything very hard at work what we do is fairly easy. Plus having done it for six years Ive seen pretty much every change and curve ball one self could see in this industry. I want to move up with in a company and grow with it."
good,"Adapt to everyday changes, constant world of change:"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is one of the best companies that I ever worked for.  There are a few good reasons for that, the benefits are almost unmatched by any other company that I have interviewed for or worked for, the pay is very competitive, and that extra perks are nice.  The worst part of the job is the work life balance.  Verizon will try and build this up by saying that you get vacation time and can request time off but I feel that you should not have to request time off to be with your family.  I am the father of two and the hours made it very challenging for me to work from 10am to 7:30pm then pick them up from the babysitter, drive home, cook dinner, do homework, bathe them, and still put them to bed by a descent time.  It is almost impossible to do."
good,Good job where I could leave the work behind as soon as I left the building. Lots to learn. The work is hard and the pay is fairly good. Advancement opportunities differ by location.
good,An amazing company to work for; it was a good learning experience. Working at Verizon fosters great work ethics which contributed to my overall holistic development
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working with Verizon in the call center environment. The only reason I didn't stay is because they closed the local call center and I wasn't able to relocate. Unfortunately that isn't uncommon for this company. They have closed several centers due to company needs. I enjoyed the environment and how the center was set up. Managers, Supervisors, Coordinators were ALWAYS available which was great. Since this is an inbound call center, you will be at your desk your entire shift other then your 30 min lunch and 2 breaks"
good,"Customer Service isn't always the easiest job, it can come with many challenges, we are all people, Verizon did their very best as an employer to create a balance, the benefits are great, I feel management is just hand picked favorites and aren't hired because of their qualifications for the position. Overall I felt Verizon was a good employer for the time I was there."
good,"Verizon Wireless was a fast pace company with many benefits."
good,"I've been working with the company for about 2 years and they definitely keep you on your toes. Technology is a continually growing field and so, the information and new innovations were introduced to are limitless"
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Decent work life balance and security advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon but felt the need to expand myself professionally. I enjoyed the freedom associated with working independently and providing excellent customer service. I took great pride in my work and often went above and beyond the call. I was often called upon to assist less experienced technicians and restore a customer relationship when said customer wasn't satisfied after repeated attempts to correct a problem. Verizon's compensation and benefits package was very generous and was one of the best for a blue collar worker. I found the local managers to be more than fair and helpful to me and appreciated the trust and confidence which they vested in me to get the job done correctly."
good,"This was more of a challenge but I was able to complete my monthly goals. Sales were hard at times, but with the right team and support I was able to achieve."
good,"I was an account manager, responsible for business accounts in urban and suburban areas of the bronx, westchester and white plains.The work was commission based, and the opportunity to be a team leader was absolutely essential for personal and financial growth."

good,"I appreciated Verizon for its structure and well entrenched guidelines, process and procedures.  It felt very similar to the military I was so used to as a young 1st Lieutenant; unfortunately as I learned as I  progressed through my career; change must be embraced and actively sought to survive in business."
good,My typical day at work consist of me being assigned my work load for the day. Preparing my workstation with all materials required to complete all of my daily tasks. Answering the phone within 30 seconds and assisting the customers with any questions or orders that need assistance.
good,"What my takeaway of this company and experience is; I learned skills to make me excel in the world both in the workforce, or in my own business I would create someday. I had an excellent time of learning more challenging and quicker ways to, help my customers and give my personal brand out to the world."
good,"Director of Sales/Monroe, Michigan/Toledo, and surrounding areas, Ohio "
good,Great compensation and benefits. Advancement was easy. With the rapidly changing environment in technology it was always educational to have the training classes.

good,Always ahead of the curve in service delivery and innovation; Great compensation to employees and contractors; Lots of room for development and training
good,best job in the company !!!  lots of long  stressful days ..immediate supervisor knowledgeable.  the more and more new people they hired the less and less they knew.  tired to reinvent the wheel...
good,"Management shows true appreciation for employees. Always doing things to keep the moral on high. A fun and productive work place, doesn't give you the ""I hate my job"" syndrome. "
good,"Great benefits, paid training, paid vacation and sick time, friendly work environment, fun place to work with regards to both coworkers and customers."
good,Great place to work with your own ways of building customer rapports. Able to make your own decision and be your own boss.

good,"You have the opportunity to move up with the company. You have to be energized and ready. Hit all of your numbers such at Quota and you have the best chance to move up. I wouldn't suggest this job to a single parent or parents who enjoying being around their children. its always Verizon first, family second. Especially near holidays and launch days. The people that you work with are FANTASTIC people. Easy to get along with."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance was great"
good,The company stressing training thru online courses and in-class learning which I find to be very helping in Information Technology.
good,Good job and benefits best job i had management was not exactly what you would expect the pay was well.  The company is not what it used to be Im waiting for the company to be on under cover boss but I seriously doubt it Overall as long as you on time you will be ok and try not to mess up to much I recommend this job to a single person looking to make a lot of money.
good,"Verizon is an excellent company.  The compensation and benefit packages are among the top in the nation. During my tenure at Verizon, I had various positions with increasing responsibilities.  In my final position, I served in the Telecom section of the company, supporting FiOS and FiOS TV."
good,I started as just a sales rep but quickly move up to one of the floor managers within a year or so. Everyday I walked in to work was always a great day.
good,Very rewarding but stressfull at times. Felt satisfaction from dealing with customers internally and externally. Room for advancement could be better.

good,"Handle all of customers needs, whether that be sales or tech related. I learned how to relate to all kinds of people and every walk of life."
good,"Greet customers, answer phones, set up new phones, teach workshops. I enjoy working with the newest technology. I have learned working in a team environment can drive positive results. The hardest part of the job is worrying about performance versus taking care of the customers needs."

Constantly inspecting existing model apartments and walking every new corporate apartment to inspect prior to resident move in.  Attended Apartment Association Meetings and functions as well as Chamber of Commerce events and meetings.  Working diligently to maintain and grow company revenue and customer base.

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Working within retail is never a dull day. IF you enjoy talking to people and engaging with all walks of life this is the career for you. Sales bring in more money if you're a talkative person.
good,"It's a job, and potentially career, where you get out what you put in. A career with Verizon can be very rewarding. If you work hard, you'll have the opportunity to develop yourself personally and professionally. There are plenty of opportunities both in leadership, and outside of sales."
good,I learned a lot about building relationships and finding potential customers.  Was the best job I ever had and I miss it.  My customers were very important to me and I felt a sense of closeness to them.  I worked at this company for almost 15 years and still today some of my close friends still work their.
good,Verizon is an amazing company to work for. I grew a lot with this company and had great support. Majority of the managers were fair. Just don't work with one that doesn't see things the same way as you.
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement unless you want to be a manager of about 15 reps under you who determine your schedule, pay etc. Not a great system."
good,"Verizon Global Enterprise Advisor position is challenging but also rewarding.  Verizon offer good benefits and excellent training.  The position requires you to work with internal and external customers and to have strong interpersonal and communication skills.  Management interacts daily with employees to provide necessary tools to accomplish goals and objectives."

good,I love working at Verizon. Good energy and very easy to advance with your career

good,This job put me in a position to suceed i have enjoyed my time with the company.

good,"A busy workplace within an ever-evolving business with many deadline challenges. I learned to be pro-active in my approach to my work and prioritise my workload. Use of SAP has been excellent experience for me. Management is variable depending on which department someone is working in. My manager was always very helpful, considerate and approachable. The team I worked in (General Accounting - Verizon European Holding Ltd) was a great team to work with - always ready to help, roll up their sleeves and get stuck in and also fun to work with, not only in the UK but all across EMEA, APAC, LatAm and the US. Everyone brought their own experience to the team and were always willing to share their experiences. It was a challenge to meet deadlines sometimes (although I always met my deadlines), especially at quarter end when the Global Transfer Pricing had to be posted before Intercompany closed. "
good,Great place to Network and get up to date technology training.
good,TCC was the company I worked for. They did really well with paying you for the hard work you did. There was just no place to move up aside from store management.

I enjoy helping customers and training new representatives."
good,Great team and it was my first corporate job. I was given a lot of responsibility with so little schooling. Learned about accounting and month end closing.
good,"I was account executive for a year. My job was to sign people up for Verizon's strategic program, we were to get people set up with tv,phone,and internet and then sign them up again when fios came into the area.I traveled alot back and forth from Albany to long island because of my experience and ability to train and motivate people.I was young but firm minded enough to handle all tasks at hand.

good,Working at Verizon consist of day to day objectives and sales goals. It is important to stay focused as well as goal oriented. As a retail sales representative you are required to stay knowledgeable about products and services. The communications industry is constantly changing! I learned a great deal about sales and techniques as well as customer service practices. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers and the management (within the store location) was fabulous. I did not care for upper management as they did not take your opinion and experiences into consideration. The hardest part of my job was the schedule. You never worked the same shift each week and very rarely had weekends/holidays off.
good,I loved working in such a large team.. It was fun to get to know all the employees and learn their different styles of retail. I loved my management staff.  My favorite part of the job was working with the public.  The most difficult part of my job was trying to upsell customers on different products and services (being pushy).

good,It was a great job with good benefits and the environment was pleasant. I was able to develop a relationship with the team members and created a family.
good,"Verizon Wireless is a mass employer in my town and the only place that pays a competitive wage above minimum. The benefits are great and the people that work there are amazing. The main issue I took with this job was that like any other call center, you are no more than your calls handled per day. When your employer tells you to make every customer interaction memorable and perfect and then tells you to cut things out to make the calls faster, there is something wrong there."
good,Our team was like a family. Fun place to work. Excellent company benefits and opportunity to grow.
good,The support system was the best within the different teams.
good,My work days were busy and enjoyable absolutely loved working for this company.
good,great customer servicehelped customers get there bills paid

The center I worked in closed at the end of 2005. As you might imagine there were a lot of changes and in the end I left Verizon when I could not find another Verizon job with 75 miles from my home. If I could have I would still be with Verizon."

good,"Verizon is a great company to work for, they provide room for advancement, and offer a unique work setting."
good,"A typical day at work began with scheduling meeting, with dispatch to a work location. I gained experience and training in all aspects of telecom outside plant construction and maintenance. Management at Verizon maintained an adversarial atmosphere throughout my career as a union employee. My co-workers functioned in a team environment to complete all tasks as directed. The hardest part of this job was operating and working in harsh weather elements, both in daily function, and storm-related repairs. The most enjoyable was the satisfaction gained with the completion of all time-sensitive jobs and projects."

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"My typical work day consisted of managing accounts, troubleshooting,calming angry customers and creating win win situations. My co-workers were a joy to work with as we always assited one another, if there were questions or concerns about products and services we worked together just to ensure that accurate information was delivered properly to the customer. I did find the learning experience to be very pleasurable as it allowed me to increase my knowledge and actually have fun learning about the different products and services. After becoming familiar with the products and services through extensive ongoing trainings I was able to position the products/services to the customer with confidence."

good,fast work days
good,I enjoyed working there and made fantastic money. The hours were reasonable and many paid holidays
good,"I work in a fast-paced environment which requires Coordinators like me to be attentive and organized since you are the point person for the entire department you support. Daily tasks include providing executive administrative support to a Director for Southern California Business Sales, planning events for the department, closely work with other departments to coordinate projects, and organize travel arrangements for anyone in the department that travels for work. The most challenging part of the job is staying organized with all the tasks assigned and ensuring that everything will be completed. I've learned many power management techniques to effectively complete all tasks assigned to me. The most enjoyable part of my job is completing projects successfully while juggling other tasks."
good,good company to work for and good environment. Good place togain experience in workforce development.
good,"Excellent company,pay and benefits will and can transfer u anywhere whithin 1hr 30 mins of ur original work location bosses change every 2 to 3 yrs. mandatory o.t. at any given time."

good,"Verizon is a good place to work and I worked there for 32 years. However, with the ever changing telecom world, and the automation of jobs, etc., the management has continued to decline, and will continue to decline. This does not mean Verizon is a bad company, they too have there growing pains as they continue to evolve to where they want to be."
good,Can be an exciting industry(with all the new technology) and the pay was competitive. The work at times did become repetitive so changing roles is a must.

I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I started as a college intern and had a fabulous 20 year career at Verizon. I worked on multiple teams with some great people. My work was cross functional and gave me an opportunity to work with different business entities. I valued my time on the VTeam and was a true ambassador of the company. I will forever be grateful for the relationships both professionally and personally I was able to attain during my 20 years.
good,Over all Verizon is a great company. My degree is not in sales so I'm just looking to make a transition. The over all experience with the company is an awesome one!
good,VZW is a great company that offered great pay and excellent benefits. The down side is the home/work balance.  They weren't understanding of compassionate when it came to my family medical issues. Other than that it was great!
good,Fun place to work with great team and good energy.
good,"Great company to work for, but you must LOVE sales and being pushed on a daily basis. The team and ""family"" sense that's created is wonderful.  I really enjoyed my years spent there, only wished to be out of sales."
good,This was a great place to work as it was family owned and the boss was a great guy. We also had some loyal customers who I enjoyed working with. Positive experience!

good,made me answer this question to continue. this is not a real review. I should be able to skip this section and it will not let me. made me keep typing.
good,The culture is fast-paced placed.  A typical day will include several meetings and conference call requiring updates or resulting in actions. There are many internal courses you can take as part of your development plan.  The hardest part of the job at times was responding to urgent request.  The most of enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers and seeing results of completed projects or process improvements that were implemented.
good,"Verizon is an excellent place to explore with latest technologies and with the challenge to handle multiple applications."
good,I enjoyed working at Verizon but left due to the demands of graduate school and home/work life balance. I would have stayed if a position that I could balance my responsibilities was available at the time.
good,Verizon is a cool place to work for. Everyone is very friendly and supportive. The technology that they are working is of cutting edge and world class. It is a good place to grow as a professional.

good,"Interesting work, good benefits and excellent salary, lots of autonomy in your work and ability to work remotely for some jobs.  Company offers profit sharing and great 401k match"
good,"Verizon has a good company culture, when the managers encourage the culture. They like to promote from within. One major downfall is there the stores are usually so busy that you don't really get a ""real"" break. You also live in the store for the first few months."
good,"good to gain knowledge in how to upsale a customer."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,"I started my career at Verizon as a Technician in a retail store. Installing phones in vehicles as well as dismantling them to solder the charging port that a customer broke. Fast forward 20 years and I'm pleased to announce that 3/22/19 was my last day with the company. I accepted the Voluntary Separation Package (VSP) like over 10,000 of my former co-workers."
good,"Its a good experience, learned many things, the best one is I worked under 6 managers, one different from others, learned many from them. Best Leadership."
good,"Good benefits, lots of development, and very competitive pay. Leading into the digital age with wireless and 5G wireless opportunities. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"•	Took inbound calls, about bills, outages, technical issues, and new equipment"
good,Good summer job. Got the opportunity to work with talented people. I also learned a lot. I would recommend the job for anyone that wants to get a view of life inside Verizon.
good,"My experience was very positive.  My career was what I made of it.  I had the freedom to take risks and put my thumbprint on the business.  I believe those that had a positive, can-do attitude did very well in the company.  I only left because my type of work was moving away from my location and Verizon offered a very generous voluntary separation package."
good,"Hello,"
good,a amazing place to work where they really take care of you. I enjoyed all the ups and downs from my career there and have nothing bad to say about the company.
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. I have had the opportunity to be mentored by some of the best leaders of the business and have been rewarded for working hard.
good,Best customer service training provided.  It's training that sticks to you forever and helps you in many jobs.  Hardest part of the job was the working hours the constant stress over what your hours were gonna be during shift bids and having to worry about life around what you got was horrible.  On top of that worrying about the constant changes on expectation and what each individual supervisor expected was worse than dealing with the customers.
good,The only issue I had was the work life balance because of the shift changes and mandatory OT. I was able to learn alot if new trades and they did an amazing job with paying for you to continue your education.
good,"Most high stressed environment for worker as they have more expectations for everyone."
good,Verizon is an excellent company that innovates. When they go through changes they take care of employees. the workforce wants to make a difference and generally that is encouraged.
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. There's always opportunity for advancement, training and development. Management will work with non management to meet the goals of the department."
good,Benefits were great advancement opportunities were greater in some departments.  I like the company overall.  If I were going to work again and they were hiring I would reapply.
good,"Daily activities involved working with the business partners resolving and/or discussing the application's function and results. Team work was necessary to successfully resolve issues, which included investigations with other application teams. The team work was a great experience."
good,"its a good place to work, had a-lot of benefits and good working environments. There where plenty of of over time and bonus opportunities. As long as you did your job well you made money"
good,We took about 40 calls a day. I learned many sales tips. I had the opportunity to lead installation of fiber optics. Hardest part was no growth since we were out of footprint.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Was a member of the electrical brothers local union. The union ensured that everyone received the same as the next employee. Enjoyed working with the staff there. The management team was exceptional.
good,"Productive and competitive environment, Managers are very knowledgeable. Fair hours and great benefits.  Also, a very quick-paced environment. Must have the ability to multi-task."
good,Benefits were great the only thing that sucked was the customers could talk to you however when you just had to take it there is no rule that you could disconnect the call if they were calling you names. One time I remember a customer being belligerent and started using racial slurs. I told him that he needed authorization and I got talked talk from my supervisor for my tone. The hardest time i had was when I was  pregnant because every time I was feeling nauseous or sick I would get docked for my time.
good,Fun but Challenging Environment.  I was riffed unfortunately.  I love working for the company and nothing really negative to say.  Work was challenging but I enjoyed what I did everyday.
good,Great Place to work. Verizon has given me every opportunity to grow and learn the telecommunications and networking business. I have certainly enjoyed my time at VZW.
good,"Verizon offers great benefits, training, and culture.  Over the 17 years with Verizon, I was promoted 6 times, and each opportunity challenged me to be the best that I could be and I had an amazing support team behind me every step of the way!"
good,"I really enjoyed working Verizon. I was the go to tier 2 Lead specialist and was called on often by my peers and management team to assist with outages. It was fun, I excelled and thrived in that environment. I even had the opportunity to represent my tier 2 team on multiple cross functional teams as well as intra organizational team meetings. I was told on multiple occasions that I was up for a promotion to Principal specialist however, only to be told that HR didn't have funding for it.  "
good,"Great Pay with great advancement, but the retail hours are really hard to have a family and continue to do and have a social life. The management was always there to help and assist with anything you needed."
good,Best day ever!!! Learn and advance quickly.  The awesome culture of family. Advanced technology of 5G.  Growth from within. Awesome company to work for.
good,"A typical day at Verizon is like any other call center, is making the customer satisfied our customers they are our priority overall at work. Treat customers has you would like to be treated."
good,"The company itself like any other has its positives and negatives.."
good,"loved working for VZW.  Great company, lots of work but you know that coming in.  No complaints at all.  Was treated with dignity and respect.  Again...loved working for VZW"
good,"Le travail dans un environnement international y est très enrichissant."
good,"Day at Verizon as a manager I had to review the work and prioritize the incoming troubles and projects. Then I have to plan and organize the jobs for the technicians. I then retrieved all corresponding information and prints needed for technicians to properly execute there assigned tasks. I also make my rounds daily to all job sites and inspect for safety and quality assurance compliance as well as customer satisfaction. I track employees progression on projects, training , and budget expenditures. The hardest part of the job for some is being able to quickly and efficiently solve technical issues and roadblocks technicians encounter. I enjoy my interactions with my team and my organization and working and growing together."
good,I worked for Verizon for 15 years. They provide great great benefits and healthy salaries. They match 401k contributions up to 6%. The have a yearly bonus based on company and personal performance. They have a mentoring program if one is interested in advancing. I loved working for them.
good,Good place to work.  Good benefits.  Toughest part are customers.  Great hr team.  People really cared about you there.  Tough metrics but great pay.  Would recommend
good,"Always learning new technology, meet new people daily. Many work days are actually fun and enjoyable. Great potential for money and growth. Awesome benefits which start upon hiring."
good,"Great company to work for. Tough to manage work life balance with retail hours. I have worked with the company for 5 years. I have held 3 different positions, which proves career growth Within the company is admired."
good,This company allows you to make as much money as you want if you put in the time and effort. Great place to work with friendly staff and management. Would definitely work here again.
good,"great company and benefits,"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Loved working with all different kinds of people and learning to overcome different obstacles on a daily basis. Had much training at verizon wireless which helps me in my day to day life.
good,After working 21 years I was laid off 2 years before my full retirement benefits were due; You are not kept in the loop about future company changes that will impact your life.
good,"I would go in handle sales, customer service, also do inventory, handle calls as well as technical issues with their devices. I learned how to be quick and handle sales. My management was amazing when dealing with anything. The hardest part of the job was the hours. the enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,Awesome place to work - I would love to be able to get another opportunity to work for them again.  I got cut quickly because I was a new employee and was having a lot of medical issues.
good,"Enjoyed working at Verizon. Company had nationwide layoffs. I got let go."

good,I enjoyed every aspect of selling Verizon services.  Everyone was great to work with.  I anticipated a quicker process to advance to a management position.
good,People the are amazing. I've made some life long friends in the 2.5 years there. Pay was good. You can get burnt out really quick if you don't manage your time.
good,"-Enjoy going to work and co workers"
good,Company was great to work for.  12 years is a long time to give a company and I only left to pursue personal happiness due to unforeseen family matters.
good,Verizon provided lots of opportunity for me at the mid management level.  However is seemed like I could not get the support to keep building on my experience at skills.  The tools were first class and the education at the job was above any other experience I have had or heard from others in the area.  I enjoyed being a part of a team which created a family like atmosphere at the work place.  I have nothing but respect for those who worked with me.  Just wish the communication in the end was better.
good,The team got along great and the manager really showed us how to talk to customers and gain customer services experience. We learned how to handle all types of situations that could come through the door.
good,busy fast paced call center with strict adherence to your schedules.  leadership is out of touch with frontline employees and needs to work on moral in the call center.
good,Great place to work and be compensated for doing your job. Performance based with a myriad of perks and benefits. Training is autonomous and upward mobility is prevalent.
good,"As a full time employee, I was very satisfied with the work challenges & the way that the company treated it's employee's. The benefit package was great compared to Verizon's competitors."
good,Great Experience.I would recommend this to anyone. Wish I were  a perm employee but even as a contractor it was satisfying. Very enjoyable place to work.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon expects for you to do your job with excellent customer service, other companies should follow this structure.  I have learned to treat people with respect as I want to be treated.  Excellent culture and the most diversified.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to help a customer based on financial restraints, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the tuition assistance."
good,"I loved working for this company. It was stressful, and at times there would be rounds of mass firing which did keep everyone on the edge of their seats."
good,"I worked for Verizon for 10 years and was laid off, my overall experience was good and the benefits were the best.  The office politics are a bit much and the culture was ok.  It is one of those companies that networking is a must to move up."
good,i was recruited for the Verizon job and told it would be a year long and then I could be hired.This was not true. With a change un management came a layoff of 3 contract recruiters.
good,Fast pace environment. Many areas are undergoing growth and rapid change. An exciting time to be a part of growth and product development. A number of training programs to take advantage of.
good,High paced inbound call center with great benefits and so long as you put in the work you can advance within the company or even transfer to another department.
good,"Overall love verizon. The job is not for everyone, especially if human contact is not desired. People will complain, people will want to speak to your manager. Be efficient and you'll be fine!"

good,"it was a great experience overall, stressful and very demanding but not impossible to accomplish, unfortunately, their work hours are just not accessible to everyone's life style."
good,I love working at Verizon. The managers throughout all levels of the organization do an excellent job of supporting and encouraging their employees to drive and be the best they can.
good,"I love to work and work hard. The last few years at Verizon I was working 7 days a week at 24 hours a day on- call. technology changes faster than employees can be trained, you must be a self learner."
good,"I made many friends and have had long lasting relationships from the projects I worked at Verizon in Bloomington, MN."
good,Had a lot of incentives and was fast paced with much room to grow and learn. they had a lot f activities through out the weeks and months. Management was always there to assist and help.

good,It was a joy to work at Verizon because of the great team that I worked with. There was no petty bickering. Everyone was simply focused on getting the job done. I would have stayed until retirement if there was bot a sale to Frontier.
good,"Fast pace, good money if you work hard. Benefits are really good.  As long as you don’t mind working a lot of hours and working under stress to hit quotas. Which is fine, I’m a motivated person but if you’re not this is not the job for you."
good,"Over the period of 10 years learned a lot at Verizon. Good place to grow into a role. Also very lucky to have good mentors along the road. "
good,very good atmosphere to work. management is supportive.Being provided the opportunity to work with a broad range of experienced co-workers and diverse client group. Appreciated the opportunity and enjoyed the experience and supporting and making a positive difference to people in need.
good,Great company. Enjoyed the culture and pay was good. Retail hours were difficult for a family and not many non retail positions available without relocation
good,"Taking care of customers and offering them with the best solutions, managing inventory, daily and weekly reporting to the top management is a key role of my job."
good,"Currently promote and sell a variety of wireless products for the betterment of business and consumer needs. Examine and fix cellular devices with defects and software issues. Work with management team to promote customer service and sales. Maintain phone locks, alarm systems and account databases to prevent theft and fraud"
good,"My employment with Verizon was 10 year ago.  I'm sure a lot has changed since my employment there.  The job culture at the time was tense due to on-going layoffs, but other than that I enjoyed the work, co-workers and mgmt."
good,"If it interests you to always have new tech in your hands, this is the place you want to work. With that being said, do not expect systems or processes to stay the same. If you are a creature of habit, you may want to consider a different company."
good,No review at this time. Check back with me at a later date. I’m not sure why I’m even answering this but you are forcing it so blah. Can I move on now?
good,Verizon was a good place to be on the cutting edge of Tech and network changes that were backed up by the company credo. The Management was mostly productive and there was always someone there to help you.

good,"fast pace good work environment relocation possible."
good,Over the past several years Verizon was relocating our jobs off shore to other countries and reducing our staffing. Having to train people in other countries to do our jobs was difficult but we did what was asked of us until no longer needed.

good,Great to work for at the corporate level and in the Washington dc market. New England East to silo oriented lack of management rotation creates a poor work environment but over all a good corporation to work for.

good,"A typical day consisted of 10 hours on-site along with communication via phone/tablet after work hours.  The work day was 24x7 to meet the needs of the business.  Working at 3PL locations as the liason for Verizon was never dull.  Days were filled with conference calls, planning sessions, inventory fulfillments, independent decision making to ensure the needs of both internal and external customers were met timely and efficiently.  The day went by very quickly due to the nature of the business."

good,Great success in attainment of sales objectives for all 9 years employed.  Criticism is only that the organization is very political and is not conducive to advancement even when performing.  All about who you know and not what you do.
good,"Pay is amazing, benefits as well, but if you cannot handle stress, or the possibility of working from 9am-11pm... don't take the job. Benefits of working like that, means you can up your pay cap to 100k a year... draw backs... prepare to miss a lot of family time."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,working at Verizon has been a wonderful experience. it has kept me up to date with the latest and greatest technology and I also loved the people I worked with the time I was their.
good,great company some of the management is unfair but the majority is really good and nice great company to work for. tons of perks always free food and ways to make more money
good,"Liked my job at Verizon Ok, but there was a fair amount of favoritism from lower level management. Since it was a tech support position most of the time the guys were afforded the best shifts and the most benefits. (ie time off) . One really good thing was the training, there was always training, so you learned a lot. Management was hardly around, always in meetings or out of the office. The safest thing to do was just stay busy and avoid any gossip, of which there always seemed to be. The hardest part of the job was just keeping up with all the changes. The best part was if you took the initiative you could move up."
good,"Good company"
good,Working on commission seemed like it was going to be hard but once i learned the ropes it was a breeze. You make what you want to make in this job. If you put in the work for it you can achieve so much more and there is always room to advance.

good,Energetic environment. Opportunity for advancement. Development and career advancement opportunities. Great game room with a lot of activities and a nice gym with personal trainers.
good,Great management.  my leaders look out for me and for my future.  I'm able to have a great work/life balance. my team is awesome and my leadership recognizes our success.
good,I was bought out during the work depression in 2008-2009. If not for the buy out I would have happily stayed. It was a work environment that I enjoyed. Competitive and reasonably placed with good benefits. Unfortunately the world changed and the jobs dissappeared
good,A great company to work for with a lot of great benefit. A sales driven company so you have to work hard to get to wherever you would like to go. Made a lot of good money and would recommend this company to recent college grads.
good,"Great company to work for!---Can be busy, but very rewarding. Pay is very good for industry standards. Management can be very hard on workers, which adds to daily stress."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"I love work at this job, I was at several locations and had great experience with staff and customers. I was expected to be driven and energetic, which i did not mind"
good,If you are a people person who is driven by numbers you will thrive here. If not this just would not be a good fit for you. Verizon has great benefits and a solid culture. Plus you know where your numbers are at all times.
good,"I stayed with the company for 16 years. I went through many changes and transformations. I was happy at my job. Last week, my position was eliminated. I would still be working for Verizon if I had the option."
good,"Hard to advance because there are requirements to go through certain time periods, hard to get rid of low performers so there was a lot of low performers still employed"
good,"Great place to work and learn sales skills. Loved the dynamics of management and team ,  company culture was great and supportive. Made Great friends in a fast paced environment."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Verizon. They treated all employees fairly and equally and had fantastic benefits."
good,"fun work place very friendly people."
good,Verizon is the leader and will do what any business in that situation will do to remain competitive. you have to learn to adapt to change and be a mover and shaker with a positive outlook and your will be successful and meet great people along the way
good,"Has changed some since the NYNEX days but the pay and benefits are still good. As technology increases, we are able to meet the demands of the industry and the customer with both training and professionalism."
good,"I learned detailed sales processes, building customer clientele by qualifying and earning the right to talk to customers. Building trust because of detailed product knowledge. Worked long hours but very dedicated and loyal to my position. It was a fun atmosphere where we had to meet sales  quotas.  The most enjoyable part was the internal award of winning sales representative of the month four times throughout my time there against a member of presidents cabinet award yearly.  Winning winners circle incentives for being in the top 25 percent in the country amongst all sales representatives.  The reward of management trusting my training processes to the extent they had me training new members of the staff and teaching even older members of the staff new ways to embrace the sales atmosphere, and provide advice through my own sales process"
good,When I was working for Verizon I was working for a third party retailer.  The propieter was fair and it was a fun learning environment.  That was my first cell phone job so it was pretty fun to have the face to face customer interaction.
good,"-erg druk en met verschillende soorten taken tegelijk"
good,would of liked to stay with company but hourly pay was one of the highest at store and managerial and staff cuts were mad due to recession. they offered many resources to employees
good,It's a good company to work for it just has a difficult balance between work and family. Money wise I would recommend some locations. Good opportunity to move up as well.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Company climate was awesome and advancement was there and I took advantage of the offers. However, a person had to sale a certain amount before they could move up. I was one of these dedicated people."
good,I have been an employee for over 13 years and it has been a blessing. The company has many benefits to offer and a great place to advance in the technology world.
good,"Check call backs from previous day, send out customer service surveys, accept calls and give solutions, trouble shoot, assist stores with customer accounts over phone."
good,"We have a manager that is not socially apt for his position. Due to this one manager work can sometimes be hard to go to wanting and willing to work with this individual. "

good,"It was great while it lasted. I loved working for the company, and for the customers. I wouldn't change my time at Verizon. If things were different I would still work there."
good,The call center was a wonderful atmosphere. The job can become very stressful. Management and co-workers really help with the stress though.
good,"This place has had the best benefit packages ever. Great compensation. Job advancement is possible if you are willing to move around within the company. Considerd relocation as it may accelerate advancement opportunities. The culture is not as diverse as you would think, but it does exist. The culture is all about Verizon. Every interaction is all about Verizon that it can sometimes drain you."
good,Great company to work for. Offered me the opportunity to excel in Leadership and understand the Lean Six Sigma process. Overall Verizon is removing so many layers in the business I am not sure I will be able to get to the next level in my career with Verizon.
good,Good company to work for. Retail hours not desirable. Great benefits. Long hours and days. Expectations unrealistic.
good,"The Hardest Part was working just for comission."
good,"Verizon is a good company to work for, corporate as well as privately owned stores.  It's a fairly simple job that requires good communication skills as well as customer care. I would recommend working for Verizon."

good,"When Verizon first gave me the call to work for them it was honestly the best day of my life even going through training I was excited to get the chance to show my technological prowess and eager to learn new selling techniques. As time went by I learned the hard way that working at Verizon was not only about selling phones they rated you on selling all of the products they offered (home phone, internet, etc.) but the thing that became my Achilles heel really fast was the fact that I had to sell $100 worth of overpriced phone accessories with every phone that I sold. How they said that it can be done 100% of the time is if you simply discover the customers needs and build a rapport with them, easier said than done. I struggled mightily with doing that because for one the demographic consisted of people who lived in or near Sun City which were mostly the elderly crowd which a lot of them didn't understand the concept of Bluetooth headsets or smartphones, very rarely do you get the younger crowd unless its summer time and they are more tech savvy meaning they love to order cheaper accessories on amazon and not only that it didn't help that the management team loved to micromanage your every transaction and if you didn't do a certain thing they have a coaching portal which was a computer program which they recorded every interaction with every sales rep. If that wasn't enough they put together meetings in which they call skill building workshops from time to time which gives them an opportunity to micromanage a whole class of sales reps at the same time. After a year of being there,"

good,"Working the midnite shift alone from time to time, covering the whole of the county is quite a responsibility. During the day tour there are many more team members on board and avenues for help, but also there is much more going on to contend with. The day starts with logging onto the PC, opening you work log and then proceeding to your assigned centeral offices to do routines. The company provided van has all you need to do the job except spare parts, which must be acquired at the Power Team store room. The routines we do keep the emergency power equipment at the ready, and also allowing us to find weak spots that need attention. The fact that the entire centeral office will need this emergency power ASAP if trouble occurres is what my job is all about. You are on your own most of the time, supervision in this department is minimal, help is there if you need it, but the Power Room is your responsibility to maintain."

I loved running test on the lines and getting the ""ver"" codes which told us what was wrong with the customers equipment. At this job I learned more about telecommunications and technical equipment which started me on the road to certifications. Management was very hard and did not understand that you get more flies with honey than vinegar, but that's an old tale. Most of my coworkers were great and always willing to lend a helping hand if you were not aware of a certain procedure, my ""tub mates"" were the best. The hardest part of the job was traveling away from my daughter who was very young at the time still, and yet I survived this.

You have to really set your priorities or your day will last longer than 8hrs.  you  come in and you have to connect with your team because they are the ones that are getting you your numbers.  The most enjoyable part about being a supervisor is that when you watch your reps empliment all your coaching and development on their calls and producing results.

Also, the opportunities that I have on a daily basis to plan events and coordinate moral building exercises and programs is a plus as well."

Received PMP certification during tenure here. Was discouraged, over time, to learn that there were very few upward opportunities in local market, and with smaller children at home at the time, moving was not an option. Had a manager who was not much of a people developer. Experienced ""good old boy"" network behavior in earlier years here - had to prove that I was competent much more so than male counterparts. Learned how to survive in a male-dominated organization that favored internal hires (I was external) that were men (and I'm not) - a skill I still appreciate. A significant career step for me."

I learned work ethic and how to interact with people, especially initially being an introvert. Verizon helped me to open up and communicate not only with other co-workers, but with the general public. The hardest part of the job was catering over the phone to many different personalities. Sometimes it could be overbearing, but the end was rewarding knowing that I was able to assist someone to resolution with any issues with mobile data service.

good,"Very good company to work for. Not much diversity. A lot of the positions were held by hispanics or whites, not many africian americans held management positions."
good,You are given the opportunity to grow in this company as fast and as high as you want based on how hard you work and the time and effort you put into your job.
good,"Verizon was a great company to work at. It offered great salary, opportunity to grow and learn and move to different positions. It offered great continuing education benefits/reimbursement. I appreciate the opportunities for grow and development that Verizon afforded me."
good,The buildings are currently being renovated to open concept office spaces.  There is a gym and cafeteria onsite.  The office is flexible for working hours for most sections.
good,"Seems like there are a large number of opportunities at the company, thought they mainly seem to be contractor positions.  My manager is fantastic though - really looks out for his employees (and contractors, for that matter)."
good,"Every call is unique no 2 days are the same. Fast pace. Never a dull moment Days are productive.Diverse work place. Learned patience, leadership skills."
good,"Productive and good work-life balance and has a good scope in learning new technologies with exposure to the tools and open to all software."
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for great benefits, and you work as one team. Learn a lot over the years, different departments and training situations give you the skills you need to exceed."
good,"Overall, Verizon is the most profession place I've worked. They are very supportive of their employees and tend to employees needs. Although there isn't much of a work/life balance due to having work weekends. That, of course is expected with retail. A typical day at work is providing our customers with excellent customer service. Also it includes a lot of administrative work with working with different accounts."
good,Good environment and people.  I work for many years in Verizon and its subsidiaries.  I have worked with people of all ethnicities and cultures and all technical backgrounds.  Its a goof place to work.
good,Verizon is so large many of the groups overlap and call on the same accounts.  There is territory conflict so account managers need to develop a plan when more than one Verizon group is selling into accounts.  Verizon also never has separated the cell phone group from the Enterprise group.  This is an area Verizon could improve in their go to market strategy.  Everyone knows Verizon sells phone service on their network.  The market needs to know Verizon is much more than a cell phone network.
good,It was not very hard work went to training for a week or so it was fun meet a lot of people and the higher up people but the work hours were long and you were required to work 6 days a week
good,I would be happy to work there again on contract basis for full time permanent employee. The work environment is great and flexible working from home.
good,Very good company to work. Just wish I made more money. Great 401k and health and vision. Great team avg management at best. Opportunity to move up is there if you want it.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I was able to learn a lot about the sales business and first hand how difficult but rewarding commission based jobs can be. Once promoted it allowed me to acquire new skills and learn new things that a took with me through my career.
good,Verizon was a great work experience. They took care of their employees and always rolled out new things for us to learn. I loved the contest and the employee appreciate week minus micro management.
good,"Verizon was a great place to work, the company teaches you great sales techniques. We always had fun on the job, had a nice big game room to play fooseball. The hardest part of the job was battling with our own company's online promotions. Towards the end of my career there the company had better promotions online than in stores, which made our traffic slow down and numerous reps lose sales in the store. My overall career there was enjoyable and I was able to learn numerous sales platforms which will definitely help me in future jobs."
good,Good pay if u are a good individual contributor   I just moved to the business channel and i like it much more    If you are mobile then u will have a great opportunity to move up    I went to Nebraska for a promotion one year after starting with the company
good,"Helping existing as well as new customers in the purchase and selection of services and products Processed customer bill payments effectively and answered basic questions regarding customer service Communicated with customers effectively providing them information regarding products, services, equipment usage, billing procedures and feature functionality making outbound calls for prospecting opportunities and customer follow-up Maintained clean retail work area Performed back office duties effectively including accessory stock, inventory"
good,"I worked there for two years and enjoyed the entire experience. I left because I moved to another state and found a better job. I would gladly work there again, but I am on to bigger things."
good,Excellent place to work and extremely sales oriented. The hardest part of the job is selling what Verizon wanted to be sold versus what the customer may actually need. Definitely a great experience and a lot of fun to see new technology first hand and work with customers!
good,"You will find yourself amongst professionals whose work has big impact.  This is a company that has high visibility products (FiOS, Wireless, etc), and you will feel that your work matters."
good,"-great benefits"
good,"Honestly, It is one of the best companies to work with. The teammates will be supportive and you can work the way you want. The Verizon will give you a boost to your career."
good,"If you want a driven and innovative place to work, look into Verizon. Cutting edge and always improving. The offices in San Jose are working on some of the best areas like smart cities, 5G, and public safety."
good,"They take care of you.The training is very defined, the benefits are immedite and the support is great."
good,its pretty fast pace and some managers are very nice and some managers are ok. A lot of pressure of meeting targets. sometimes a lot of micromanagement
good,If you are looking for somewhere in IT with remote options this is a great place to work. Easy to stay self motivated and involved in the work you do.
good,this was a great company to work for The only downfall was that management wasn't communicative with their employees and then all of a sudden there was an issue as opposed to the management working with the employee
good,"great organization for someone looking to get into the technology field and work with clients in sales, engineering or customer support functions. great company"
good,"Not an easy place to work but rewarded for your performance"
good,"I loved working there, great experience for a 1st time job. Learned a lot from the older people who worked there, it was easy to adapt to the work space"
good,"great company"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"A day work at Verizon is 7-4, you are responsible for one to three building and all the HVAC equipment in these building. 90% of your job is in your field, the next 10 % have to do with electrical fixtures within the building."
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. The company prides itself on work life balance. Unfortunately that applies to the corporate offices, retail sales not much balance is available. Outside of that I love my job and the people I work with, both customer and employees alike."
good,"The pay was good the job was fun , bt the long hours and the every Sunday working made it hard for me to find a balance. However I do miss my job at Verizon. The customers and the pay."
good,"Large company, great job, many challenges. Great benefits, they do require long hours with mandatory overtime, they will compensate you, but take weekends from you. It is not a Monday thru Friday company, it’s is a utility company. You will work a lot of weekends."
good,Verizon retail is a great place to work. Verizon is hands down one of the best companies that I've work with. Verizon was able to help me provide many great experiences for my family. I did not find it hard to work with Verizon..
good,"Wonderful coworkers wonderful managers, depends on how good of a sales person you are, if you aren’t a good sales person maybe this isn’t the right job for you"
good,Would love to return and work for verizon as an Manager.  The benefits were great. So were the people and Management teams. Also VeriZon provided training and travel.  It was the best company that I ever worked.
good,"I was a top performer between 2 call centers:  Rancho Cordova, CA and Tampa, FL.  Enjoyed the environment a lot, the hype and recognition awards. Unfortunately, the center relocated out of CA."
good,I worked for Verizon Wireless for 6 years I relocated twice within my tenure with Verizon and I was paid very well with great benefits. I left because I thought I wanted a change in career but it mostly due to management was not of the pay and benefits.
good,The culture was very team oriented.  Teams worked together to overcome issues that are beyond the skills and resources of the individual.   Managers are quick to recognize good performance and going beyond the minimum requirements.
good,"I enjoy being a sales rep at Verizon, but I worked for a indirect location with poor management that drove me out. Other than that it is a highly recommended opportunity with a chance to learn sales and customer service first hand."
good,Working at verizon was a very informative and innovative experience.   The overall work environment was great for the culture and you are constantly learning new things.    I enjoyed also working in the stores meeting and greeting customers.
good,"every guest was different, constant change, must learn to adapt and grow constantly, a lot of over time and off site meetings. great pay, work life balance nice. high goals and many metrics to meet. competitive work environment but i get along well with everyone i meet."
good,"Typical work is more in the morning ,management is very good and we always improve our skills thg continuous learning."
good,"The call center I work at is pretty decent. The site director works really hard to make the environment a welcoming place. The team managers vary. Some are way better than others.  I say that in regards to all aspects. "
good,"Verizon is a great place to work. The team I worked with was great and were very organized and respectful. I did have couple of managers who wer not great, but overall a great place to work."
good,Overall a great company to work for. The company does have its flaws but overall I had a really great experenice there.The Management team there is avg at best and at most times repeat the same thing to sound smarter than they are to avoid saying they dont know or have the answers to your questions.
good,"Fast paced business culture that focuses on the customer, I enjoyed my time at this company. They are currently going through reorganization and working to save money. Lots of changes in the company."
good,Great Company to work for! Great benefits and flexible to relocate. Everyday is different and fun! I Love change and adapting makes me grow! hours and work life balance is there!
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Theostvenjoyable part was the on the job training. Great benefits..flexible schedule."
good,"Good for the go-getter, once again if your not sales motivated then this will not be the place for you. Weekends will be mandatory for meeting sales qouta"
good,"Management and other coworkers were fun and everyone got along, everyone one was willing to help each other out while also focusing on their on goals as well."
good,"I have worked for Verizon for almost 12 years so as you can tell, Verizon is a great company to work for! Excellent benefits! Fast paced learning and expect change, as it energizes its employees!"
good,"Started the day checking conditions of systems and equipment  followed by Emails on other offices that might of done work to affect your equipment."
good,"Provided training opportunities, excellent benefits, retirement plans, sand succession planning.  Employed a diverse work force and pay was excellent.  Also provided health care coverage, Retirement benefits and paid vacation time off."
good,"I started in technical support and moved from coordinator 1, coordinator 2 in a year, and to a technical analyst with the Wireless Network Response Team the next year.  My department was absorbed by the Technical Advisors Group several years later and I remained a technical advisor until I parted with the company."
good,"Looked forward to going to work and handled projects in professional manner with support of Verizon in Training an"
good,I enjoyed my position because I love helping people. The management was very nice and had an understanding for helping the employees do their job effectively. Their was a lot of training every month which helped the employees stay on top of policy and customer satisfaction.
good,This was a wonderful place to work. Always got to keep up with the up and coming devices. Had great management looking over me and couldn't have asked for better coworkers! We were constantly busy!
good,"Spent 14 years with verizon wireless , great opportunities and benefits ."
good,Loved working for Verizon. Good work-life flexibility and benefits. Awesome collaboration across multiple teams towards common goal. Job satisfaction at the end of the day despite long work hours.
good,I enjoy working for Verizon. We are very customer service driven making sure that we represent the brand and supporting the customers In the best way possible.
good,"Workday-Monitor Attendance, disability and Fmla usage"
good,"Worked for company for 22 years. Was a great company to work for,  however, they have been down sizing in CT. Lots of good people losing or lost their jobs, including me."
good,"Was great place to work til Nynex, AT&T, Bell Atlantic became Verizon. No job security, too many unnecessary changes in programs used to provide excellent customer service."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working on project improvements, and being able to implement them. Most be able to be a team player and individual contributor."
good,"While at times I wasn't thrilled with my managers and the competitive nature of the job can be stressful for some people....My overall experience was amazing and I had some amazing managers over the four years I was employed by them. At times the stores I worked in had cultural issue and some cliques. However, they have a generous maternity leave as well as additional parental bonding time. I made the most money in my entire adult life while working for this company (without using any of my 4 college degrees in other unrelated fields) and it was only because of their amazing infertility benefits that I was able to conceive my son. I am forever grateful for the opportunities and professional growth I achieved from working for Verizon. However, there was usually an annual change to the commission structure that typically resulted in a lower commission achievement each year I worked with them. Even with this annual change, I still made more money than I had with any other job. They also fully paid for my Bachelors degree."
good,"Verizon is a wonderful place to work. I enjoyed the years spent growing and learning. My management was very approachable and supportive. I worked in a very fast paced, but friendly environment, which kept me motivated."
good,It was a fun work place for a temporary job. Just not enough pay for my cost of living. I was hired through city connections. We sometimes had short breaks. I really enjoyed working with Verizon and I would love to become a part of their team again.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,I put Verizon 1st above all other things in my life and left because I was not one of the boys and feared for my job. I was a thinker and a doer and was not appreciated by my peers or leadership. My only goal in the company was putting the customer 1st.
good,"Verizon was a wonderful place to work and the benefits were amazing. Verizon, as a company, works hard to stay on top of its game. I think that it will be a game changer as the 5G services expand."
good,"My experience was very positive. My career was what I made of it. I had the freedom to take risks and put my thumbprint on the business. I believe those that had a positive, can-do attitude did very well in the company. I only left because my type of work was moving away from my location and Verizon offered a very generous voluntary separation package."
good,"Strong emphasis on employee education"
good,"There are intelligent people to bounce ideas off of and get training from. They promote learning new things and being educated by tuition reimbursement and training vendors coming to the office. As an hourly employee until level III, the culture changes when corporate basically takes away overtime but expected the same work level out of their employees. Contractors sometimes don't know what they're doing and screw things up, and then they layoff their knowledgeable employees to save a few bucks, bad decision! They do have great benefits and was a great place to work and learn new things."
good,Working at Verizon was definitely a learning experience. I was taught a variety of information on how to sell phones and services provided by the company.
good,"A great conpany to work with , always find a mentor to coach you in your career here. New technology and tools in use. Great benefits and work schedule."
good,"On the wireless side, Verizon provides the tools and structure for individuals that wish to advance, to advance.  The management has con a great job in promoting these tools to the employees.  There has been some streamlining over the past few years, due to the business model changing in the industry, but the product and vision remain consistent."
good,"Their are not to many issues with the job, if you like sales, the managers are helpful, and they provided assistance when it is needed but it is easy to get burned out"
good,"Verizon is an enjoyable workplace environment. A typical day opens modestly with the opening procedure and once consultants get their first customer the hustle ensues. By paying commission on top of hourly pay it motivates sales consultants to be good; to recognize, advance, initiate, and capitalize on opportunity. Management promotes team success and initiative. The culture is ground level as store employees understand they're the faces of the company. The most difficult aspect of the job is maintaining a profitable measure of commitment. The most enjoyable part of the job...it's easy to succeed."
good,Verizon was a great place to work at. It was laid-back as long as you got job done and went above and beyond as needed to keep the ball rolling you would do great. The benefits are very good comparable to other companies.
good,I spent 20 years working my way up. Loved it. In last few years it grew very stressful but was still a great place to be. Excellence abounds. I'd do it all over again!
good,Worked for Company for 8 years. Pay is decent. Enjoyed my time with the Company. Awesome Benefits but work life balance was a little off. You have to work several mandatory hours on launch days. No real holiday time off but it's to be expected when working in retail sales. Other that that...best company to work for in my book!
good,"Great company to work for. Very competitive salary and benefits package. Upward mobility is up to you and your work. Downside is with the acquisition of Yahoo and AOL and launch of 5G, there may be more call center closures and more jobs for vendors over seas."
good,"Verizon was extremely good to me. I have made over a million dollars in the company during my tenure. I was able to get 2 degrees, enabled me to not only pay my child support, but to also take my children on several bi-annual trips that included cruises, Disney World, Ocean City, MD, etc. I was able to acquire a few cars over the years and provide a house for my family. It also helped me to acquire real estate to start my own business. Verizon is not a selfish company. They want you to follow your dream and do their best to help you. Verizon paid for my degrees."
good,"It was fast paced but you can handle it easy money. I took about 50-100 call per work shift, I learned how to handle customers needs wile navigating multiple screens and troubleshooting."
good,"This has given me the oppurtunity to grow and move in different fields within VZW. Embrace change. People do what they need to and stay low. Everyday there is a challenge but, that with any job."
good,Verizon is a great company that takes care of employees. They provided training and reimburse college tuition. They encourage and provide internal online training to make life easier for the ones that are too busy. The best part of is the culture they have built.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Of all my years working at Verizon, one thing I can honestly say is that the company knows how to hire great people.  Every team that I have been on, I have been fortunate to work with great people, very few bad apples in all my years.   This made the work day more enjoyable at least for me.  The company does encourage one to have a great work/life balance as it does understand the importance of family.  Depending on the team you are on, there are certain points throughout the year where you would have to stay late and possibly work weekends, but it's a simple sacrifice when you see and understand the big picture."
good,The most enjoyable part is the easiest to talk about. There was nothing like helping someone who did not understand features or services gain knowledge of features and feel like there life was changed because of a cell phone. So easy to add value to someone more than once a day..
good,"The Company's Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and services. The Company is a good to work for. The Company offers a range of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices. The smartphones offered by the Company are enabled to utilize the Company's 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO high-speed data services and run on operating platforms, such as Apple iPhone Operating System (iOS) and Google Android. The Company offers tablets from a range of manufacturers."
good,Verizon  was a great company to work for. My department closed and I was unable to relocate. Otherwise I would still be an employee of VZW. They have great benefits and incentives.
good,"it was alright, management was not. the commission was okay but not the hourly. the hours was not worth the pay i was getting. Hence why i left the company"
good,"The balance was difficult but the benefits were undeniable. The store can become your life but with the collaborative team effort daily, makes it more bearable."
good,"Communication with so many different co-workers everyday. I have learn so many things from others and have developed my Role as a QA Tester. So many different religious people, so I have learn so many different things from them and knows each other very well. Also having fun with each other and everyone is so friendly."
good,Very good atmosphere to match individual skills with available job openings. Company transitioned from very structured organization to resilient and nimble work groups.
good,Work days were spent talking to customers about upgrading phones and phone service. Often forced to push older phones that were close to being taken out of inventory due to age limits.This was pushed hard by management even if not in clients best interest.
good,you were assessed by how many calls you could take  and to resolve them.  Clientele could be very hard on the operators no matter what you could do for them.
good,"The culture and atmosphere are great. As with any sales job there is going to be drive in hitting goals and quotas. Management always tried to keep everyone active and upbeat throughout the work day. My only concern is there was the lack of help for lateral job transition. If you start in sales your projected path is management. While they do have a cross training program if you want to shadow other departments, there is no clear path to transition to those jobs if you want."
good,Great place to work and wonderful work family! Wouldn’t trade it for anything. Only reason I want to leave is that working retail hours is getting old. I want to spend more time with my family.
good,Verizon is an awesome company to work for and team to be apart of! I promoted at a year with this company due to my hardworking and dedication to my job.
good,"Work is chill, you are a problem solver and you have to upsell everyone everything you can. Money is good if you can sell without caring what the client needs, just sell them whats on spiff and your good."
good,"verizon is not a stepping stone for your career, it's a career destination. it offers competitive salary packages including benefits. its a great workplace."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Verizon is a fortune 25 company which provides the ability for an employee to grow their capabilities, but it is up to the employee to engage.  Verizon is constantly in an efficiency mode and looking for improvements in process and ROI."
good,"Great money until they changed the comp plan. The money is good regardless i do recommend people to work for Corporate Verizon. I am currently ranked 64th in the company out of 17,273. Due to how high i am in the company that's why the commission change affected me so much. I started to loose about $2,800 every commission check because of it."
good,Was great. Great benefits.  I would have liked more work life balance but the compensation was great.  I was compensated based on performance and I liked that.
good,"Verizon is an awesome place to work!  Great Benefits , culture of integrity and acceptance of diversity. They encourage the professional development of their employees."
good,"excellent pay, excellent benefits, excellent vacation time.  Tuition assistance allowed me to earn my degree.  Verizon taught me skills I would have not learned elsewhere."
good,Verizon was a collaborative easy-paced environment that allowed you to talk with different people and meet different people both in the work environment and customers one assisted.
good,I wish there was a call center in my area as I would definitely had stayed with verizon. The communities within the company really makes you feel needed and important. They recognize an individual for the hard work that is contributed.
good,"When I was working for Verizon I took a lot of what they offered for granted. Now I wish I could go back .If you do get I job here, I recommend taking full advantage of all the benefits they offer."
good,"Loved the company. they have great values and i met a lot of great people within the company, seems pretty difficult to be promoted within might have to spend a great deal of time with the company before you see anything come of it."
good,"Overall I believe that Verizon Wireless has a lot to offer its employees and if you like a fast paced environment and love people, ten it would be a great fit"
good,It just wasn’t for me. The managers made it to stressful. Their salaries depend on performance and not everyone hit their goals. I was #2 in the office after just 10 months.
good,"day usually starts by doing inventory, then I would go over our promotions and sales leads before we open the store, once we open if we have down time we do our five star and try to set up appointments for the week."
good,It was cutthroat at Rome’s but Verizon will push out those who are selfish. They promote teamwork and cohesion. I loved the environment but had to leave due to death in immediate family.
good,I loved working at verizon. Although the hrs spent standing right at the door where just too much for me. It was super cut throat and competitive. Unless you stood at the door you would not see a customer. It was super high stress since the numbers were high and to get more than your 15hr you had to meet these numbers. The GM liked us fighting over customers so we could try and get the crazy numbers we had. I did well there and the benefits were great. I didn't like the way the GM ran the store. There was too much favoritism to his select pets. I would work there again part time only and at another location. I did make 50k and for my area and cost of living that was decent.
good,"Verizon is an excellent place to work. However there management style leaves something to be desired. They have a tendency to put too much pressure on sales and not on customer satisfaction (which is too be desired) there is an unspoken rule. Sales, Sales, Sales is the bottom line. REGARDLES as to what's going on in your life."
good,The pace was face paced at times and relaxed at others. Some managers were wonderful and positive others were not. Hardes part of the job was when someones family member had passed away. I loved helping people make their phone work and get upgrades.
good,"Verizon is the type of place that gives you more when you put more into it. Although Others May say that the work is difficult, is truly one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. be prepared to be challenged, and be prepared to meet sales goals as they're placed in front of you."
good,Great place to work. Lots of areas to learn and advance. Employees are easy to get along with and open to helping you learn and perfect the area you are working in.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"This was a good career.  I was allowed to work from home if needed.  My team was spread out over the country, so no one was actually in town.  We supported several teams with managing their code production.  Our system was designed to prevent code changes without being approved by preset individuals."
good,"Can learn lot in the area of telecom area. "
good,Fast paced and performance driven was how the culture was defined.  It was a great place to build a career with good communication.  I was proud to work there and things were always improving and advancing.  There was a strong focus on development and growth.
good,Consistenly partnering and working with various stakeholders to evolve and change the business with the customer at the forefront of all that we do.   Putting the customer first and always working to exceed their expectations is extremely enticing and fun.
good,I enjoyed working for Verizon.  It was a great place to work. They took over the Telecom department I was working in from another company and they treated us well.
good,It's a good job. The commission style pay is something you never really get used to. I don't have anything bad to say about it. I just am wanting to Venture into the IT world.
good,I was very happy with how welcoming Verizon makes you feel. Not once did I ever feel they ignored my needs. Great Company! They have great customer service.
good,Verizon Wireless was a great place to work. They work you hard but there is an opportunity for work/life balance. The environment is fun and Verizon hires very quality employees. There is a big focus on performance. There are a lot of extra perks for working at this company.
good,Great place with great benefits! Base salary is kind of low but compensation is great. Work attire is casual and very friendly. Great one stop shop for all technology needs
good,"Verizon is a great place to work, you get paid weekly, the benefits are awesome. There are many areas to move within the company.I left seeking a career change and regret it."
good,"I was engaged with a multitude of our customers on a daily basis, in a team atmosphere, servicing and selling Verizon products and services. The workplace culture was great and was conducive to providing outstanding service to all of our customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting and helping our customers get the best service and products in the communication industry."
good,It was wonderful 17years of experience working at Verizon. Learned a lot! The benefits were great. The yearly reviews were discussed on time with constructive future plans. Miss working at verizon.
good,"The hardest part of the job was the strict attendance policy, mostly meaning you were stepped for being late. "
good,"Productive and fun working place,cool working environment and good coordination among team members, good place to grow technically and adopt new technologies"
good,"Experience at Verizon varies from team to team. My first team was a disaster and my second one was great. There is a lot of politics - friends of the management are hired and promoted, people are not properly recognized and those who work the most get the least of attention. It often feels that hard work is not valued enough or even noticed. It's a large company, so, things there are slow, it could be very hard to complete a task because there are so many dependencies and nothing is easy."
good,they provide me with tools to perform the jobs. They have a really good trainers. Management very helpful. Schedules change every month. Good design jobs route
good,Sales is hourly plus commission. VZW is the #1 wireless company at the moment. You get full training on devices and services we offer. If you can manage the stress of high quotas and demanding customers you can make great money working for this company.
good,"great company to work for, I was given the necessary tools to grow in my career. I appreciated all of the experience and opportunities provided by the company."
good,Great Training and opportunity for entry level sales.  Prepared me for a more in depth career in medical devices.  Appreciated the growth in company from basic to smart phones.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,"A typical day at Verizon is providing customer service to customers by reviewing their bill, offering services they may or may not be aware of.  Walking them online for self-services.  Have to maintain how many calls you took and how long you were on the phone.  Call Quality, calls were surveyed.  The culture was friendly, open door policy.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining good quality customer service in the small amount of time we were given to be on the phone with a customer who was upset.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily prizes and competitions we were able to participate in."
good,"I was a manager for 20 years there.  It was always a good place to work.  Micromanaging towards the end of my career was a little too much, but I would assume that would be the case for many large companies."
good,"spent 10.5 good years here, miss the people, not the company. the culture was inconsistent, left feeling you were just a number. Customer service was a good place to start, wish I had gone into tech support"
good,I loved working there it was a blast. I love this line of work and it’s my cup of tea. They were very nice and had excellent training. I would defiantly reccomend anyone to go work for them.

good,I have enjoyed my time with Verizon a great company great benefits. I would recommend Verizon to anyone.  If the center wasn't closing I would not be looking!
good,The small amount of time I sent with the company I learned and enjoyed the process. The hours were long in the marketing office but the time spent actually promoting the services were only a few. Overall it was a great learning experience. I learned how to control my thoughts and how to work with others. My favorite part of the company was the ability to grow within the company.
good,Verizon was a good place to work at you get good training. work environment was grate. Not a hard place to work at. Management was good. The best part of this job is that they work with you if you need time off and its paid.

good,Opportunity was there to learn a lot about UX design and apply some of my design decisions. Wireline respected life work balance a little more than wireless.
good,"Ressovle customer complaints regarding sales and service"
good,Great company to work for if your young and just starting your career. Great benefits and good culture. Typical large corp very political. Get 10 year experience in and then leave if your managment level because they will lay you off once you start putting in some time.
good,A typical day at work began with reviewing the previous night's activities and possibly troubleshooting issues that did not arise until peak traffic on the network was reached.  I learned a lot about Unix and servers and the future virtualization of the same.  The hardest part over the last couple of years had been the looming layoffs that were inevitable as the industry matured and market saturation reached.
good,"Definitely enjoyed working for this company. Very competitive and fun atmosphere to work with, along with great store managers. Once you learn how to sale, it's a walk in the park."
good,"Cellular Sales Verizon was a by far one of the most challenging positions I've had. It was fun, hard, brutal and amazing!  The pay and culture is good, it's been many years since I worked there now and the issues that caused them to loose many good Reps have been worked out.  I would work there again in a heartbeat.  It was a commission only workplace when I was there, which made it pretty ruthless when the store had 3 computer terminals and 7 Reps on the floor."
good,"excellent place to work, if you enjoy working at a fast-paced customer service company Verizon wireless would be a great place for you. There are some pros and cons to working with a 100% only commission job."
good,Great owner and overall good place to work. Hardest part of job was inventory counts. Most enjoyable part was the people. Honest expectations of employees
good,"I loved working for Verizon and I made great money. However, the hours are very long and the work life balance is horrible. You will never get to spend time with family. There’s not much room for career advancement, unless you want to be a General Manager. I would of never left the company if the hours were better."
good,"Preview"
good,"Within my years at Verizon I learned many valuable skills and practices in which to increase my sales and management abilities. Although you have to provide and check certain boxes so that management can say they've tried to get you to do certain things, this is a great company to work for with fantastic benefits."
good,"i am having good experience and had good team and worked on devops project and used selenium web driver,automation testing and used Iphone and android testing"
good,The job was fun and fast passed. I found the management to be very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my job duties and the staff was very hard working. It was a fun environment.
good,"Verizon was a good company to work for. In my opinion, it is the best cell phone company in the industry. This evaluation applies to both the service it provides for its customers, as well as the environment and pay structure it creates for its employees."
good,All the employees are generally younger and enjoyed spending time together outside of work. We all worked together to satisfy customer needs. Team players.
good,"My position at Verizon was stressful but not in a way most people thought it was. The easy part of my job was interaction with customers and helping them resolve their issues.  The stressful part was making numbers/stats,  for example 3 day repeat callers. I would get a ding if a customer called back within 72 hrs.  This is tough to meet due to using my skills to control another persons behavior."
good,Diverse systems infrastructure.  Training on new systems is not keeping pace.  Company is downsizing workforce and those left are asked to more with less.  Compensation can't be beat though.
good,Management was outstanding but it was only a 6 month contract with no extension. I learned how to splice fiber and the engineers were very helpful and taught me different technologies.
good,Awesome work environment and competitive edge. When you come in with the right mindset anything is possible. Continuous training is definitely a plus and great Management team to help improve morale.
good,"Oversee the direct Demand Planning responsibilities, ensuring that financial goals, turn and ending inventory objectives for each product category are met and aligned with long term strategies.  "
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,High volume of calls throughout the day. Never a dull moment. Excellent quality is a most working here. Management was hardly available when they were needed. I found myself walking around looking for someone to take a escalation.
good,"Worked and Mobile App called VIC it's a wonderful experience Innovations and new technology. Enjoyable, learning curve and work culture is always inspiring."
good,"Great workplace to work with cross cultural colleagues from around the globe."
good,Great Company. like working here. No complaints. Great work life balance. Great management team. Great company. I like working here a lot. No complaints.
good,"Dale Drost the manager of Verizon is a great guy who is always lending a helping hand where ever he is needed! He always puts all employees needs and interests first, but is even giving and understanding with the customers. The pay is very good if you have the ability to make good sales. I enjoyed my everyday normal routine there and got along great with most of the other employees."
good,"I worked with Verizon in 2002 at the time wireless was the best place to work at. Money was good, the companies really cared for their employees, within time things got stressful after all it was a sales job. The company did really care about their employees."
good,"Being on the phone with angry customers is not fun, but Verizon has many incentives. Their management is very high energy and fun to work for. They have great pay and benefits. If you have a decent amount of patience, I'd definitely recommend working for this great company."

good,"Overall, my experience has been great with Verizon.  It's a competitive environment with opportunity to advance.  I enjoyed the culture.  There are advancement opportunities if you are willing to sacrifice the schedule."
good,"I think in my case I am compensated very well at Verizon. They provide good benefits as well. Flexible workplace, Can work from home if needed and pretty flexible around outside appointments you may have, as long as your work gets done. I have a great manager who is one of the best leaders and the team we have is amazing to work with. Most other teams and people that I work with are also good to work with."
good,"Freedom to assist customers on technical issues, Tools and Vehicle provided.  Good pay!  Ok Benefits...  Travel to customers gives time to compress..."
good,"Absolutely loved my position at Verizon.  Was laid off, would return in a minute if a position opened up that uses my experience and qualifications!!"
good,I enjoyed the leadership I worked under.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work closely with my peer group to help increase productivity  Verizon always provided a great deal of training every month.
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. They are on the cutting edge and provide a dynamic workplace. Pay and benefits are second to none and there is a yearly bonus that is always very generous.
good,Almost 3 years as a solutions specialist.. Tranfered from one state to another. Had a great experience.. I also did leadership training loved it. You should take this job if your young.. Great benefits.. Location is key it can make you or break you with this company.. From managers to reps to customers even the goals are different per location.. Locations and team matters research your store before you take the job.. That was my mistake.. Your life can be different depending on location.. Otherwise it’s the best all around job meaning benefits training and pay then most companies..
good,its a good company to work . I have been in this project for over 2 years and gained working knowledge on the  Topology services  of networking platform
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Benefits are great.  Good pay.  CEO's direction of the company is questionable.  Multiple yearly layoffs due to this lack of direction.  Work culture is good, but depends on the group you work in."
good,"Being an intern here is great, PT/FT depending on the semester, a learning experience, this job will get you out of your comfort zone. "
good,Very fast paced work environment. Wonderful upper management leadership. Change in supervisory management lost team camaraderie. Chandler location had few advancement opportunities other that supervisory positions.
good,I went on appointments with my reps daily. I usually did Salesforce updates after hours. As a leader I considered my role make their life easier by taking on non revenue producing activities for them so they could sell. My manager was a fair person and very hands off. Culture was great on my team. Hardest part was managing 9 reps with a total of 141 zip codes. Seeing my folks hit their numbers and being happy.
good,Very competitive and fun. Great training that prepares you for various jobs. Exposure to various channels and career options. Worked here 10+ years and have learned a lot.
good,started off with this company so i may be a little jaded. I feel during the time first started in 1995 to when i left it was the best training of any company. The customer service training is best of best. Mergers never good.
good,"Worked from home 100% of time. "
good,I really enjoyed working at Verizon. It taught me a lot and they gave me a chance to show what I am capable of doing. It was a productive and also fun atmosphere. I am greatly appreciative of having to work there.
good,"answering calls and giving the customer information on their bill thats all i was required to do for the company,besides making the customer feel like a part of the family"
good,I held multiple positions at Verizon from an entry level customer service representative to a Sr. Analyst.  Entry level positions don't offer as much flexibility in terms of time off and can be high paced and stressful.  Offline positions allow for a better work life balance in terms of working from home when needed (as long as it's not abused - also depends on manager) and more availability of time off.
good,This company was fantastic. I only left because I wanted to spend more time at my children's functions and could not do that working retail. Since that time I have been trying to get back in.
good,Easy part time job. Ideal for a student or other busy person. I liked the pay and the free downtime that i had in between stores. good way to explore the state
good,"Every day was different, which is pretty normal for my position."
good,"Verizon is an excellent place to work in a team environment. Every day is a learning experience about telephone landline switching equipment how to program it, how to fix it from a desktop workstation."
good,Verizon is a great company to work for. The job can be stressful at times but what job isn't. Classroom training is provided and they keep you aligned with their products and services which is excellent and overtime is always available. They work with their employees because they invest so much in them. If you are great at problem solving then this is the job for you.
good,"loved my job, management was great until new person came in and moved job out of state."
good,There cool no issues with anyone I've ever worked with. Be ready to sell and its not for everyone trust. Jut keep a good attitude and come to make money not to collect an hourly pay check.
good,Great fast paced work culture with lot of stuff to learn. Good field experience. Very nice team and management to work with. Working in National Sales help interact with customers directly.
good,"I enjoyed working for Verizon. I left Verizon due to a RIF (Business Needs) and was never treated poorly.When I left Verizon, Verizon was very generous to me and my family. I started as a Central Office technician working in a call center and  worked my way to being a team leader then Network Engineer (T2 Support). My last position was stressful but in a god way. I provided assistance to call center and field technicians when they could not resolve an issue. I would be in the office from 8 am until 5pm and take some occasional after hours calls. The hardest part of the job came once every 5 weeks where I was assigned the on-call position. This meant working all night from 5pm until 8am M-F and all 48 hours on the weekend."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Typical retail job where you work most weekends. The culture was great very laid back but still professional. Compensation was great but company made quotas difficult to exceed to limit pay. Management team was great to work for. I would probably still be working here if there was opportunities for advancement.
good,At Verizon  you are always working . Always connecting with the community. Always an opportunity to put forth your best self. I enjoyed being kept educated on the changing technology and how knowledgeable it made me for the customers.
good,"Verizon is top notch in training their employees.  They also expect a great deal, and give steep deadlines to accomplish goals.  They micro manage a great deal."
good,"Being part of a global organisation can be very challenging, having to take into account the different cultures we have to work with within the same team. "
good,"As a customer service representative the main focus is assisting customers with their inquiries and needs for their home phone, internet and cable TV services. The environment is fast paced and full of energy. The hardest part of the job is realizing that each customer has individual needs and one has to decipher what those needs are with fact finding questions n every call."
good,"Excellent company to work for as it has union positions that are extremely well paid.  Comprehensive benefit package which included mental, dental, 401K with 6% match and vision.  Union position so there was job security.  Hourly rate above average."
good,Great work place. Friendly and helpful management. Job could be challenging but at the end of the day things are done with successes. Verizon culture is good in many ways. Job security could be a bit of concern.
good,"I worked at a call center, it really is a great place to work.  Everyone is very supportive, I just need a job that I'm physically active at for health concerns."
good,VZW was one of my first corporate jobs and it taught me a lot about how to carry myself in a professional workplace and how to handle customer escalations.  My coworkers made the work environment fun and I always looked forward to seeing them.
good,Verizon is a large company with good benefits and takes care of its employees. They have well written job duties and task lists. I enjoyed working for them.
good,"Atypical day as work was fast pace and I worked in a call center, on a 24 hour a day 7 days a weeks phone Que. I learned excellent conflict resolution and customer problem solving, time management. Management was fair. Workplace culture was fun and fast past very goal targatred  and goal oriented. The hardest part of the job not being to take breaks when needed as the breaks were scheduled. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"Verizon is definitely a great place to work with EXCELLENT benefits. Change is consistent, fast paced. Working in telecommunications cane be challenging especially in the ever changing world of technology. Wouldn't change the experience I've had not one bit."
good,"Typical day is coming in and taking customer from start of your shift to the end of your shift. you stay busy. if you have down time, management can get you business leads to call who have Verizon already. you can help with stock and product placement as long as its compliant with floor plan. you can develop great people skills and learn about a large corporation that has good business sense and that looks out for their employees. great benefits"
good,"Verizon was a fun place to work. They offered their employees lots of room for growth and advancement. The bonuses were great, depending on the state you worked daycare was offered on site. They care about working moms. Verizon offered great discounts as well"
good,"I loved working at Verizon Wireless. "
good,"This is a great place to work if you are looking for work life balance. My role gave me the option to work from home. You receive nice vacation time."
good,"The job is highly stressful, but very rewarding. Great pay and benefits. Work life balance needs improvement. This is a result oriented company like any other. If you produced, you will be rewarded."
good,"The workplace culture for me is well balanced, for example a typical day for me is performing task supporting the engineering team. However, with my extensive background I could also support the real estate team as well."
good,I had a wonderful time working for Verizon.  I worked for 3 1/2 years then left and came back for 5 1/2 years.  WONDERFUL benefits. I liked the health benefits and the schooling and money benefits.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,If you get in the right location you can have great management and you can stay busy easily.  There is definitely money to be made.  Make sure you are self motivated.
good,It's your typical call center work. Fast Pace and competitive. Thats all I have to say about Verizon. They are a great company to work for with amazing benefits and pay
good,"Compensation, benefits, and advancement wise this company is great. I just didn't treat it with the respect that was required and I lost that opportunity. I do regret it but that's life."
good,"Well this was a few years ago...  This was ""Verizon Business"", not ""Verizon"".  Separate branch of the company.  We used to be MCI, an even better company to work for!!!"
good,"answered difficult smart phone related issues, Resolved customer's concerns and offer appropriate options if needed. Trained and developed coworkers . Worked at a call center and store level when needed,"
good,Typical day at work would be fast paced yet very relaxed. Customers come and go some wanting more help than others but it is all still fairly easy to do. And if you don't know something or need to learn how to sale or how to do something the managers and staff will all tip in and help you out. The environment is very positive and relaxed. Hardest part is being calm and collected if your the only sales rep on the floor some days and just remembering to take each customer one at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer get something they want from the store and having them smile after and feeling that since of helping someone.
good,Great for experience to gain in customer experience.  A lot of development roles but no real advancement . You can hit the ceiling real quick. Sets unrealistic expectations
good,You had to step out into the main part of the mall surrounding the kiosk to generate customer or new client interaction. I had to make people interested in buying what verizon had to offer because we were not located in our own store people would try to avoid you so instead of customers coming up to us for questions and buy we had to approach them so it was mostly cold leads considering the location
good,"Long hours, lots of traveling and working with different people and many different technical challenges. I've learned how to deal with emotions and defusing situations as well as being an efficient One Minute MANAGER and becoming a master closer. This is a people persons job, we weren't swinging a pick or sledge hammer all day. Its more psychological then physical labor. This is very simple job if you have proper professionalism and communication skills, but sales isn't for everyone or everyone would be doing it!"
good,Day to day it was non stop and always working.  I would take multiple calls an hour and help customers through out the U.S. I learned to be very fast and efficient in order to make the company and myself the most profitable.  The culture was fast past and easy to learn and hone your craft. The business was constantly changing and always provided a challenge. It was sad that Verizon FIOS removed themselves from the industry.
good,"great company to work for, benefits starting day 1 and very good benefits, 401k matching 6% and a competitive starting pay. lots of room for advancement and they really encourage you to advance"
good,Verizon is focused on Customer Service and Sales.  Sales are the driving force in a Verizon Call Center as well as providing Outstanding Customer Service
good,"The company is great however they do a lot of cuts to positions. I was moved around in 1 year 2x due to they removed my title. The benefits are great they give  vision ,dental 401K   Health care spending and even emergency child care ,everything that you're looking for in a job"
good,"As a customer representative it was non-stop busy. Phones never stopped entering the queue.  Hardest part was constant headaches due to the overwhelming amount of callers. But I loved what I did.  I prided in what I did, being able to help my Spanish community."
good,Opportunity to implement a new PMO team and put in place strong processes around Portfolio and Project Management.  Teams successful implementation of PMO processes.
good,"Escort Verizon Workers "
good,"My company works as a contractor for Verizon Wireless so I don't have anything good or bad to say about the company. From my dealing with them, they seem to be a solid company to work for."
good,"Verizon fired the contract agency globally. This left me without a job. "
good,"when its busy, its busy... we were always well trained on new products coming out and what motivated people to feel the need for new technology. The culture could easily make you feel like you're showing favoritism towards certain individuals but honestly, knowing your team, you would know how each individual would treat each customer and since the goal was for every customer to have the best experience every time, you may want to make sure the customer interacts with some one who has rave reviews from most of the customers they interact with.  The hardest thing about the job, was to balance work with personal time. The most enjoyable part about the job was the compensation, if you worked hard, your pay check showed it."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Verizon is a great place to work with lot of opportunity to learn. Good work atmosphere. Learned several new technologies and management skills working under my manager and her team.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Verizon all the way till the end.  When I was laid off is when the I started to dislike the co because Verizon does take care of you until you a gone.  Once you are laid off, they really do not want anything to do with you as an exemployee.  While you are an employee you get hugh discounts on their products and services, once you get laid off, that all stops and they treat you like a second class citizen."
good,"autonomy to get your job done, declining industry as landline service circles the drain."
good,"It's a great job with great pay and benefits, they try their best to make accommodations for balancing your family life, it didn't work for me however it's one of the best jobs I've ever had. Thanks."

good,Great culture. Amazing team and learning process. Competitive compensation. Work hard play hard. Be the first to try out new technologies and given the ability to share your first hand experience with high end electronics ranging from speakers to drones.
good,"Day would begin with inventory. Throughout the day you're helping customers with either phone issues, new plans, selling new equipment and insurance and accessories. There wasn't really management in our Fort Wayne stores. I loved my hours there but didn't like the drive to work"
good,My coworkers made coming to work every day a delight.  Everyone is generally pretty smart and cares to be good in their role.  One of the best office environments I've worked in
good,"With over 25 years, starting with GTE, I have been fortunate to work in a multitude of areas including Marketing, Sales, Training, Performance Assurance and Call Centers. The work can be very complex and very rewarding."
good,"local management was a little weak, overall a very rewarding place to work. benefits are grate. very flexible work hours and all work tools where provided."
good,excellent job as well as management but they switched the pay  structure making a third of what we were previously were earning great opportunity to meet new people as well as helping customers achieve a common goal
good,Verizon was a great place to work because of the changing culture and work. The company has great training program and is a leader in their industry. the people really buy into the message that is created by the company--we all pull together.
good,"I like the supportive working environment, a good work/life balance, and collaborative culture.  But compensation structure is not rewarding to the best performers."
good,this place is a very good place to work I worked in customer service and customer retention the job is stressful but verizon pays well to deal with the stress

good,had a great team. good team management.completed work within deadline.issues tracked easily. good office culture.good co-ordination with team lead and managers..
good,"Our team was responsible for anything seen, heard, spoken, or written about Verizon across 13 southeastern states. I learned a great deal about communicating to our employees on behalf of our area president and his leadership team. We always looked for new and creative ways to convey those messages and were always encouraged to try new, innovative ways to communicate"
good,"Verizon is a great company to work for. They value they're employee's. There is somewhat of a work/life balance but its retail you already know the expectations before you start. The goals are high but attainable, there is always some kind of incentive to exceed goals so its nice! As long as your leaders are supportive it's great."
good,working fr Verizon was a good work environment i use to go in at 12 everyone is people friendly there. The hardest part was when customers are furious before they ever get on the phone with you but it all works out because if you cant help the customers theres friendly faces whom will assist you.
good,I have had a great experience working at Verizon.. however over the years many things have changed.... One of the biggest changes that has affected me is the ability to advance... There are not many opportunities for advancement.
good,"A typical day may include repetitive tasks, such as running and reviewing reports.  A day is not boring as the needs of the business are ever evolving and you have to be ready to adapt quickly.  Fast-paced environment.  The company fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment.  Some of the challenges could be dealing with the multitude of differing personalities.  For me, I don't find it a challenge as I am adaptable and easily forge relationships.  Additionally, since the needs of the business remain fluid, from day to day your priorities may change.  Frustrations may surface when others may not be as willing to do their part or provide assistance.  Since collaboration is a large part of being successful, it is imperative that everyone is on the same page.  Overall, I found one of the most enjoyable aspects of the job is the successful completion of a project.  Or the resolution of an ongoing problem.

There were some challenges however for the needs of the business-we all worked together to get the mission(s) accomplished.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the exposure to different companies.  These were CEOs, Presidents and Directors of companies with revenue spending of $500k and above with Verizon services.  The hardest part of the job was working service outages at 2:00 am.  I had to develop good working relationships with the Central Office Technicians to get things worked in a timely manner.

good,"I love this company.  I have worked here in one manner or another since 1985 - with a couple breaks over the years."
good,"A day in the life would include working each customer that comes in for wither sales or service while focusing on daily sales tasks such as email marketing, phone warm calling returning customers.

good,They are very flexible with you with time off and everything. Management always wantss to help you.  They have excellent benefits they are all in all a great employer.  I had a baby and left for better hours because I was promised great things with charter one and now I regeret it.
good,"I was fortunate to be part of a company that is a leader in communication. In 18 years I  experienced the expansion of employees/teams, offices, management and incentive programs. Not to mention competitive benefit programs, an ongoing training curriculum and career path assistance."

I learned there is a common denominator in customer service, providing quick and efficient services entirely tailored to the client's unique uses-- with a friendly and inviting demeanor."
good,"Very fast paced and unanounced chalenges. Maintain and service all bulding systems like chillers, dry coolers, generators, rectifiers etc."
good,"Great Benefits, Great Environment to work at. People are great to with."
good,Verizon Wireless is a great company to work for. They prepare you and get you focus on goals and building a future and career which helps you not only in the work place but outside of work. Many great benefits. Management is easy to work with and always willing to help form store managers to district managers. The hardest part of the job is the work schedule being that its retail its expected to not have a balance work schedule and it always changes. Best part of the job is always meeting new people and always new experiences with customers and co-workers. Everyday is always a new learning experience. What i learned from the job is how to apply your goals and stay focused on it to reach and exceed you goals and achievements.
good,my over all day here is to watch over a lot of people make sure no fight broke out and to help people when needed

good,"Great place to work! It is enjoyable, and everyday is different"
good,Wonderful Company to work for great benefits wonderful caring people and great pay
good,A typical day was checking and installing land lines for major companys.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of either opening or closing duties. Customer service for customers coming into the work location, or by inbound calls. Sales of services to new customer base, & retaining existing customer base as well. I was also appointed the store lead for small business accounts from 1-50 lines of services, I would coach my colleagues to improve their performances & the teams overall production. I would interact with management daily to work on reaching store goal quotas on a monthly, quarterly, yearly basis. I learned leadership skills, facilitating skills, & strengthen my personal communication, analytical skills. I enjoyed helping customers, colleagues, reaching/surpassing quota goals, & the compensation. I found NO hardships to what was asked/expected of me."
good,"Itypical day was be on time, put workload in order and get in truck and on to work as quickly as possible. small appointment windows, so there was no time to waste. I always made my appointments. I loved my co-workers. great, hard working group. I learned to be fast, quality oriented and safe all at the same time."
good,"The day started out answering phones and creating work tickets for the trouble that was new or taking over for trouble that was already occurring. This would continue throughout the day. Typically I would be on a conference call with three or more people, Technician in the field, customer and if needed a Supervisor. The main drive to help the customer was measured in how  fast the team could resolve the trouble ticket (Mean time to repair). The skills learned on a daily basis would sometimes be from a previous ticket we had worked on and seen this type of trouble before. What I learned is not to guess what the trouble might be, at the customers or the companies expense. If there was any trouble that was out of my scope, I learned to use the resources (contacts) I have made throughout the company. Our staff was full of what I call floaters and sinkers. A floater typically wants to learn more and envelopes themselves in the daily routine of studying the tools we use and how to apply these to solving common issues that arise. The sinkers were eating donuts, talking to each other and complaining about whatever the current topic of the day was (management, pay, workload, etc..) Generally the sinkers did not advance or get recognized in the company. On the other hand the floaters would try to change the company culture and energize the staff with their work ethic. The hardest part of the job was finding a solution to an issue that needed immediate attention, when it was above your scope of understanding. The most enjoyable part is providing a solution to the customer that enables"
good,"I was the top sales representative for four years,  very competitive work environment.  I enjoyed the challenge everyday,  I enjoy fast pace work environment.  The most enjoyable part of the jib was all the wonderful people I met and still continue to have great friendship's with."
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,i love working for verizon i learned a lot about teamwork and it helped me grow as an individual. Verizon made sure you were comfortable and tried as much as they could to keep it interesting. The hardest part of the job were the ever changing metrics soon as you got used to it everything changed not saying i couldnt do it it was just very demanding.
good,Its a fun place to work. I learn something new everyday.Although there are different customers that you have to please it is a productive and fun place to work.
good,"Provide one-on-one support and assistance to customers during their transactions."
good,"Cooperative co workers , great learning experience, essential personnel so no time out due to weather or natural disasters.  Schedules must cover 24x7"
good,An typical day is communicating with co-workers and assisting client with their wireless devices and data devices.  I've had the privilege to learn in detail of the wireless industry and customer satisfaction.  The most challenging part of my job is dealing with irate customer and maintain stellar communication but it is doable and the most enjoyable features of my job is that its never a boring day because we always have some benefit and celebration going on.
good,"Typical day currently for me is spending the majority of my shift coaching my reps on how to be more successful with their own sales and showing them missed opportunities. If there wasn't time for me to show them what I think they missed while customer is our store then we will we do a short role play so that they are more prepared next time. Outside of that, I typically have one to two conference calls to attend per day along with the reporting that I am responsible for as a manager. The hardest part of the job right now is the work/life balance. I rarely get time to spend with my family that we are all together. The best part of the job by far are my reps. We like to joke around and have fun but we are all committed to our individual goals."
good,"Accounts Payable - sort the mail, code the bills, and input data into the system. Print checks and file reports for outbound payments. "
good,"My typical work day would include helping customers on the sales floor.  I would answer questions, resolve issues, and management customer traffic by signing customers into the queue and directing them towards interests.  Then receive, scan, and put away inventory. I would make sure the sales floor is stocked, resolve any transfers, and trouble shoot any issues."
good,"My hours are from 9-6 M-F, I am on time, if I am running late I notify management of the reason.  I learned all lot about telecommunication, I enjoy my co-worker, and management. Each department within Verizon has been a team player.  The hardest part is when personal issues effective work relationship.  The most enjoyable part is work having high standard of customer service with client and internal within the company."
good,I worked my way up through the company.  Before my retirement I was a cable splicer and did PA-1 calls for the company.  I enjoyed my career with the company.  Was a very good company to work for.
good,With Verizon there was always a place you had no clue you were going to end up in. Being able to move from state to state was exciting in many ways. You had a chance to meet different leaders from all over and learn from the best in the business. There was no micro managing at all and you got along with everyone. The co-workers were excited to learn and climb to greater heights within the company. The only bad thing about the job was having to sustain multiple locations in different states in your name with other workers staying there. Very iffy. The most enjoying part was walking up to people you have never seen in your life and closing them on something that they possibly didn't need nor use. The rush was amazing. Later they realized how much they could use the service so everything worked out for the better.
good,"Enjoyed working at the job an learned about what I did not no with the truck hydraulic system. Fun working with the guys that worked there. Not very hard job. Part time or short time job, change over from old trucks too new ones."

I am currently assigned to making sure that everyone is on board with making sure that their quota is up to date. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i see that my customers are happy with the end results."

They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."

good,Project management of over 40 accounts for data and voice management from inception to completion.
good,"A typical work day in the call center would be to take a minimum of 25 calls per day in technical support. I learned that customer service is still an essential part of technical support assistance as customers respond best to understanding, patient and knowledgeable representatives. At times management would be too concerned about ""numbers"" and lose sight of effective customer service experiences. For the most part, all of my co-workers were passionate of their jobs. The hardest part of the job would be when there was a data outage and customers were unable to use their service. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I always did the best that I could for all customers."
good,"Verizon like most communication company's was an interesting place of employment. As a publicly help company, Wall street demands constant change and improvements in all areas of the company."

good,• Maintained in depth knowledge of all Verizon Conferencing web and self-service products.
good,"• Extensive phone experience including billing, trouble shooting and technical support."
good,"Verizon has a lot to offer within its strategic business units. The company is divided into several units, Telecom, Wireless, and Corporate. The best opportunities are within Wireless and Corporate. Wireless and Telecom have jobs that range from entry level through Senior Executive. During my time with Verizon I learned to be thorough, creative, and how to address and lead large groups of people. I was able to apply what I learned in school to the job easily and with good results. Management within IT is populated based upon affiliation. Individuals who can create the right cohort will find advancement within reach. Most individuals are willing to subordinate their personal goals for the best goal for the corporation. The biggest challenge to those in middle management will be obtaining access to the information you need to create a winning strategy for you and your workgroup. When you have good data you will pick the proper focus for your group and be a part of the solution set. If you choose poorly you will find yourself on the margin and thus in jeopardy. The most enjoyable part of working at Verizon is the cross section of people you will meet and with a little effort get to know. I have many friends that I would never have met in my private life due to the time I spent at Verizon."

They contribute to the success of the company while providing positive and negative feedback. Co-workers are a pleasure to work with. Make sure that the customers needs are handled appropriately while maintaining a fun work environment. The biggest obstacle is keeping up with technology as it changes in a very fast paced industry. My favorite part of the job is the customer interaction."

Aside from the high volumes of mail, data entry to be keyed, correspondence, and missing customer information that needed to be located, you had your everyday gossipers, instigators, lazy and jealous people you have to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I can listen to my ipod and ignore the negativity around me and offer my help instead to get the job done. I enjoy staying busy and helping others and because of this, this is the reason why my supervisors would lend me to other departments to train so I would be ready when they are behind."

good,"great company, with great benefits. now compensation has went down about 30-40 percent since 2011. they changed the commission payout. probably because they realized people would work there for half the amount so why put that money in your employees pocket. in 2011 a decent rep would make 50k to 60k. hard working reps could hit 80k or more. that however is no longer the case. it's still a great job and i would say the easiest way to make 50k a year but it has changed. p.s forgive the grammar and typo's"

While I enjoyed it very much from the beginning, I was laid off due to the company getting rid of the position I was hired for in all the stores. The management changed closer to the end of my time there and it was a difficult adjustment for everyone in the store."
good,"Although I think it is dependent on department.  It worked for me.  As expected, there's a lot of corporate bs but I think most of the management does a reasonably decent job on keeping things pleasant for everyone."
good,"Excellent Training, Management Team, Work Environment and Benefits .  As a Sales Rep no more than 40 hours per week and 3 shifts available.  As Store Manager salaried position and work 50 to 60 hours a week"

good,Verizon is making effective strides in updating management approach and organizational structure from a national utility to a global communications provider.
good,"Great place to work for working moms. They are flexible and offer time off and ability to work from home if needed. Great medical benefits. Management is well structured, but needs to do more to promote the employee culture."

good,"It was great working at Verizon.  I enjoyed my time there.  They compensated employees very well and they are increasing the workplace benefits. For example, the headquarters office now has an onsite doctor."
good,"It was a very challenging and stressful environment. From learning about new phones and how they work, to learning about each customer and their privacy concerns."
good,"Good Company, the tasks were dynamic as well as customer calls. There was always a new problem to solve. I'm an ios user but from that job was also skilled with Android."
good,Verizon is an excellent company for people who are forward thinking and fast paced. Benefits are outstanding in comparison to the competitors. Especially the salary.
good,It was a great opportunity to start in the telecommunications business. They offer great time off benefits and career advancement. Also very good training and support throughout your tenure.
good,"Great pay and benefits, but mired in bureaucracy. There is little room for innovation and you won't be challenged. If a good paying stable job is all you seek, this is a great fit."
good,Fast-paced environment with great benefits and pay. Ongoing training and development provided weekly with minimal supervision. Most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility and positive coworkers.
good,Great place to work as this is one of the very few employee friendly companies with excellent benefits and career paths. Values the Credo and mission of the company in the culture of the organizations working principles all the time. Always advised to do the right thing for the customers.

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,"- Ability to travel to different areas"
good,"I was given many opportunities at Verizon, started as an individual contributor and was promoted quickly to leading and managing teams. I started out as an IT developer then Verizon quickly realized that my talents were better used as a business liaison between our clients and IT teams on managing the programs.  This included several roles, as a end to end architecture designer/manager, and eventually ended up managing the program management teams for new product development, legal/regulatory and call volume reductions. I loved that I was never bored and very busy."
good,"I worked at Verizon Data Services for 25 years so I saw the entire industry evolve.  Of course the work culture and management evolved too, I started with GTE in Temple Terrace, which was bought by Bell Atlantic to become Verizon.  It is a good company to work with excellent compensation and benefits."

good,I spent 15 years at Verizon and loved it. I was able to gain many skills and a wealth of knowledge applicable to other jobs I have taken. I was allowed to grow and advanced quickly for putting hard solid work with results. I would still be there had I not been laid off. The lay off was fair and I was offered to take another position in the company or take a severance package. I believe I made a mistake in taking the severance package. Overall amazing benefits and solid training programs.
good,"Excellent company to work.  Great opportunities for building a career, career advancement, tuition assistance, collaborative work environment and work/life balance."
good,"This was a great place to work for. I enjoyed my coworkers and supervisors. Everyone was super helpful and easy to get along with. The only real downside is that there is no opportunity to move up. After years of taking calls, they move you to different positions within the center but never give you the chance to stop taking calls and do something different."
good,"Typical day includes communication with manager as needed"
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for.

good,Verizon was a balanced workplace. They had intense sales expectations but employees were given the right tools to execute. The benefits and perks were outstanding.

good,Verizon prides itself in its culture and training.  They have excellent benefits and stock options.  Verizon is a successful company because they keep up with the competition and is an innovative company
good,It was all about the customers. Everything we did was for a great experience for the customer. We were the leader in the telecommunications industry and the network was our secret weapon.
good,"excellent benefits, generous time off, wonderful culture and people in Charleston when it was here, all different walks of life but they do a good job in the hiring process because almost everyone who was permanent had the drive to be successful and was always looking for advancement opportunity"
good,"Worked in Elgin,SC loved it!"
good,commission structure changes at least one to two times per year which decreases commission compensation. The lack of movement into upper management my cause some employees to leave the company
good,If you can make it past the politricks that exist within the company you can almost write your own ticket! The training and benefits are the best in wireless industry. The company will push you to be better and you will like it. I'd go back in a minute if my current situation wasn't lucrative.
good,"pulled requests from a work email box supported businesses"
good,"As long as you are willing to work with management and come to work on time you can have a secure job at Verizon Wireless. The management will work with you to help improve your job performance. "
good,"Good Job to work, but they offered little under average for Supervisor Salaries. Good people and Environment to work in, Management and Employees were Great."
good,Great company too many cultural changes and accounts shifting difficult to lose accounts and start over from scratch they seem to prefer to pay less to new incoming salespeople
good,"As is the case with most large companies, Verizon checks all the boxes in what you'd expect in a large company -- well resourced, great benefits, competitive salary and the training and diversity one would expect.  That also comes with challenges in getting approval to 'get things done' when you want to try a new strategic direction.   Overall, I'd highly recommend Verizon as an employer."
good,Work /Life Balance is not just talked about at Verizon it is a part of the culture every day.  This culture is supported from the top down and we were often encouraged to refresh and renew our lives with our family and return to work with our best self.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation.

good,I enjoyed this as my 1st corporate job. They are unionized & have a great program to train employees. Work environment is fun & professional. They help me instill a great work ethic. I made lifelong friends as well.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people get through tough times or educating the caller so that they wouldn't have the same problem again.
good,"My only dislike for the job was my location manager in Malvern.  Very ignorant (especially to new-hires).  However, in this union environment, management plays very little role."
good,"Loved my job,  worked with and for great people.   Learned a great deal of  engineering/ technical advancement on the cutting edge as they developed. Company has continuous training to keep up with technology.  Hardest part of job was  constant threat of job location moving , constant commute changes ."
good,The benefits were better than the ones I got working with the state! The bonuses were something else! I loved working there! If it weren't for the hours I would have stayed!
good,"Verizon is a face-paced, aggressive sales environment with lots of opportunity for advancement and growth. Having a commission-based job along with hourly pay and benefits makes this position key for working adults looking to establish financial stability, sharpen your customer service skills, enhance you selling abilities, and stay up-to-date on the latest technologies."
good,"I worked inside in switched services and there was good team work"
good,"Lot's of freedom and flexibility to get my job done. Offered travel within my market. Very few meetings or webinars towards the end. Enjoyed travel to Mpls, Chicago, Denver for conferences and meetings. Sales quotas were getting a bit crazy but doable. I was paid a great salary, monthly commissions, some spiffs/contests from time to time. I had worked my way up to 4 weeks vacation per year, paid PTO, holidays. Worked from home or the office and traveled to my assigned agent doors. Had a great boss and manager. Enjoyed training and training my stores. Offered tuition reimbursement ( my biggest regret ). Was part of a massive layoff. Was offered a nice severance package with health benefits so I am happy with that."
good,Enjoyed going to work everyday working with coworkers and learning all there was to learn.Also loved the challenge of the job itself. The camaraderie was second to none.
good,"if you are used to customer service rep positions and enjoy that field they are the perfect company to work for. they treat their front line well, great advancement and education opportunities, but as with the front line in anything, it takes most of the bullets."
good,"A typical day was steady and Busy  The employees were very nice and easy to get along with. The benefits were always great. I worked at multiple locations Owensboro till they closed. and Terre Haute, Indiana as well as Paducah, Kentucky. Each location was very easy and welcoming in to the location.  At Each Location I was to do inventory and merchandising,"
good,Verizon is a great place to work.  Verizon provides great benefits and a good quality of life.  The only problem is the job security is not the greatest.
good,Very productive alot of changes pay was good benefits was there for 12 years learned alot gained a lot of growth there. Learned to be a leader. Hardest part managing.

good,The best part of Verizon was the coworkers. It started out as just a job but ended up being like a Family. The best place I ever worked. Learned something every day. The culture there was so diverse which made it even more enjoyable.
good,It was a great place to work.  You heard rumors of the call center closing and this one actually did.  It was a shame because we were very close as a team.
good,"Coming in from the outside at a manager level is a rare opportunity and I was determined to make the most of it. Little did I know that between my aptitude/background, a random project and incredible luck and timing, I found myself among the BEST people with & for whom I'd ever worked. I worked on and achieved things I never dreamed possible. Absolutely the highlight of my career (so far)!"
good,Verizon  provides great salary & benefits. Excellent tuition assistance program where they pay upfront for courses. Great  coworkers and team atmosphere
good,"The business was known to get really busy at times, which made the time fly by. During my experience working there, I learned customer service skills and how to sale the companies products."
good,rypical work day involved recieving incoming phonecalls from prospective clients. My job was to get customers on board as new customers whether it was through the regular family service or prepaid.
good,Verizon is a great company to work with awesome benefits. Lots of room for advancement if you work in or near one of their prime locations. Some management styles are not the best so you need to know how to overcome those and just focus on your work.
good,"Verizon was a great work environment with lots of challenges throughout my day. Issues like mine or my teams numbers to a difficult trouble shoot. Goals can sometimes be high, but they are usually attainable. Depending on management each store does vary little by little. Some corporate policies could be revised."
good,Not much different from Amex or Sony. It was a quite work place and colleagues are cordial and helping. Wish I stayed longer but had to leave as we relocated to TX.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Verizon.  I had many opportunities to learn new skills on the job, Goals and objectives were clearly defined for employee reviews.  I had a lot of flexibility in my schedule to attend to family matters when necessary.  I was also allowed to work from home one day a week."
good,"Honestly, Can't really say much about the Verizon call center besides that people were open, friendly, and easy to work with. I didn't get too many hours due to the overload of workers they had, but at the end of it all, I was satisfied with the job at the time."
good,Worked there for 35 years and enjoyed all the people I worked with and the benefits were very good. I was able to work at home and work flexible hours when needed.
good,Great company to work for if you are not a contractor. Majority of work is home based and takes a lot of getting used to. Management are friendly and very encouraging. A very wie range of training and funding for professional advancement. The hardest part of the job is working remotely especially if needing any sort of help during your role. Verizon pays very well for inhouse and contract employees alike. this job is suited to someone that has experience and enjoys working from home.
good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,"Working for Verizon Wireless is very beneficial. The managers I had the pleasure to work with guided me through career development and performance for my next career move. I was able to participate in Woman of Wireless for Verizon Wireless. That is a networking event with many other women in different roles that work for the company. I learned so much in my role as a Solution Specialist from how to communicate effectively with customers but as well as with my colleagues. At the beginning of my career, the hardest part of the job was how to deal with escalations. Currently, I know how to handle these situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is having that fun positive store culture and being able to have a good team relationship."
good,Verizon is a great company that takes care of employees. They provided training and reimburse college tuition. They encourage and provide internal online training to make life easier for the ones that are too busy. The best part of is the culture they have built.

good,"Great place to work, great benefits and really good pay for the Albuquerque job market.  Management is very approachable and has an open door policy.  I truly can't say anything bad about the company.  There are plenty of advancement opportunities and they promote from within first. I have been here for over 5 years and there are many employees here that have 20 plus years with the company so that in itself says something about the company.  If the call center was not closing I would be one of those long term employees."
good,"I worked for a few months as a contract recruiter in Columbus OH."
good,"Callers will insult you based on gender, race, location, and level of education. Callers will use survey and customer feedback will not be 100% accurate.  Company has culture to allow career advancement asap."
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Verizon, however there has been a Reduction in Force and I find myself seeking employment elsewhere. There has been a combination of several departments forcing redundancies."
good,"Managed thirty two sales agents, through ways of developing daily coaching sessions.  One on one meetings to discuss performance and reliability daily.  Creating monthly reviews identifying performance gaps and providing direction on how to achieve desired goals.  Developed National center promotions to drive higher sales.  Managed center budget and inventory.  Analyzed data and forecasted product sales.  Supported and resolved sales issues for agents and Team Leaders."
good,"Verizon is a wonderful environment to begin a career and to create a better life. Although this line of business requires the employees schedule to be flexible around holidays, this may not be the best for individuals with families."
good,"The organizations that I worked in always had clear communications of the objectives and expectations of the company, organization the individual and what each person's part was to succeed as a whole."
good,I was a Product Manager for the maintenance and service products for all of Verizon's business clients.  I worked with the Sales Departments in all the covered states to create competitive yet profitable programs for their business clients.

good,"A customer-focused company with great benefits for employees that allows you to balance work and life. "

good,"I have been an employee with Verizon for about 4 years now and I can honestly say they are a great company to work for. They care about their employees, they also have excellent benefits, nice work environments, and  respectable wages and compensation. I could highly recommend anyone who is looking to start/advance their  career in the customer service industry should definitely consider them as a future employer."
good,Anyone looking to advance their career and is willing to work hard and put in the hours will have no problem moving up in this company. The benefits and salary are excellent.
good,"If you appreciate learning daily via variety of means, this place is for you. Technical courses online, tuition reimbursement, great culture which encourages learning from colleagues. One caveat is, this is a large company so culture varies from group to group."
good,"Family feeling work place. Fair days off. Flexibility. "
good,"Overall it has been a great experience working here. You have a lot of opportunity to move around. They do a great job of hiring from within. The benefits and perks are fantastic. With the industry and business constantly changing, the biggest downside is the job security."
good,"Verizon has excellent benefits.  As a Business Account Manager, you work mostly autonomously.  Your day consists of cold calling, prospecting in your territory for new business, managing existing customer accounts, emails, funnel management.  You will have at least 8 customer appointments per week to meet requirements.  Management can be very supportive or leave you be if you prefer (as long as you are hitting or exceeding your monthly quota).  The hardest part of the job is cold calling.  If you are not comfortable prospecting for new business every day, this is not the job for you.  You will not receive leads from the company.  Every sale is one you find for yourself within your set territory and listed potential accounts.  The pay and freedom to schedule your day are the awesome parts of this job."
good,"Verizon has provided me with amazing opportunities and a lifestyle I only imagined.   The culture depends on your immediate boss.  My workgroup is very focused on mindfulness, leadership and a growth mindset.  Others are not the same."
good,"Learnt a lot at my days at verizon, strong team and team work, great management and also management and staff relation was great and it really drives everyone to be on top of their working game."
good,"projects on a scale not found anywhere else.  Truly global company and customers.  That global element means that customers always have something left field somewhere,  sometimes it is a regulation change in China or Latin America sometimes it is a physical disaster and running to the clients aid.  It is enlightening how when there is a disaster somewhere the senior management expedite decision making to dig clients out of a hole even when it's not really Verizon's issue."
good,"-Meeting many unique customers and always having a new problem to solve kept the work day interesting."
good,Verizon is a great place to work if you like a fast-paced competitive environment. The management is great and will do anything to help you along the way. The only downside is your schedule and the work life balance.
good,I have been with Verizon for 6 years and I'm very satisfied with the company .  I just believe that I'm at the point I would like to go forward soon which isnt a bad thing
good,"I loved what I did at Verizon, the atmosphere was amazing and the people were like my family. The only problem was someone in upper management taking advantage of the money."
good,"It was great to be able to generate new ideas and concepts to explore relevant to 5G and eSports and receive the amount of support and guidance available to us by our mentor, the open innovation lab manager."
good,"I sold Yellow Pages and Online Yellow Page advertising, not cellular."
good,"The morale within the call center was great. In order to maintain morale there is always center- wide activities. Compensation also played a huge role, as long as your numbers were maintained raises and career advancement came around like clock work. Even compensation for overtime was wonderful on top of extra pay. Management for the most part was awesome. Each member of management relied on an open door policy for all employees. The workplace was very relaxed with a family atmosphere."
good,"My tenure at Verizon was due to the transition from Alltel to Verizon. The culture was positive, team oriented, strived to create a cohesive and successful customer service team."

good,Good Work Place. I enjoyed coming into work. The manager of the store is very helpful and willing to teach you. He will tell you if he thinks you are doing something wrong or not the correct way.
