rating,review
bad,"Great place to work in IT until the Broadcom acquisition. After that, chaotic, stressful, and sucked to work at due to the different cultures and technologies."
bad,"Many good people at Brocade.  Unfortunately there is zero effort to creating quality people managers.  I've never witnessed poorer management behavior in my career.  Many micromanagers and a constant focus on negatives.  A lot of quality employees quickly soured and were extremely unhappy.  Most left and created large talent gaps moving forward for several groups. The reason they left, managers that were unreasonable and unqualified for their positions."
bad,"Swings in management's strategic focus from fibre channel storage to data center to SDN to edge of the network/wireless, now being acquired with other parts of the business being sold."
bad,"A typical day was, a place below, on earth. I learned a director would stab me in the back every time he had a chance. The work culture was every one for themselves. The hardest part of the job was getting up each morning and going in there. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got out. I never made more money in my life, and hated everyday I was there. I would not recommend this company for anyone, even my enemies."
bad,"this would be a great place as a stopover to gain experience.  to bad it got acquired.  The acquisition was not very smooth at all, there were to many changes and the time was extended multiply times.  Very frustrating"
bad,Super slow moving and FC product is incumbent in most IT shops.  Partnerships make it very difficult to affect your outcome and ultimately you're paid lower because of it.
bad,Brocade is a good place to work if you are looking for good benefits with a flexible schedule.
bad,It was wonderful to see the residents and be able to interact with them on a daily basis. I loved the District Managers. However the current Administrator isn't something that i would recommend working for. It was overall a great learning experience. I would work for this company again but in another location.
bad,"Good people, questionable management choices.   No extra perks for employees.  Tough business climate against the other networking companies."
bad,This company was bound to fail too many employees that only wanted to do their job and not help out.    Management never cared about the employees but just wanted work done so they could show case the work that their employees did
bad,"A typical day is fast pace, tactical deliverable driven with lots of meetings.  Hardest part of the job is weeding through politics and eroding corporate culture."
bad,"Helpful team, good for fresh grads."
bad,Hands off management style that allows you the ability to get the job done.  There is a team environment within the sales groups where everyone pushes towards quota goals.
bad,"Management, and thus workplace culture, was constantly shifting due to high executive turnover rate.                  Company recently acquired by Broadcom."
good,"Typical day at work - people walk in by 10 and leave by 4."
good,"Work environment has changed. It used to be fun but now it's stressful due to pending acquisition. I love working with the customers, but limited support all around."
good,"From 1997 to 2005, Brocade had vision and executed well. The company more or less single handedly created an entire industry segment for high speed storage networks."
good,"Good pay, average benefits, old school management. Way too much red tape for a company its size. Not very progressive or exciting, it's a job not a career."
good,A terrible elites class of executives whom only believe in authoritative leadership
good,"Good Products, Good Quality, Good Sales and Service."
good,Massive culture change. Culture a 180 degree change after acquisition. Great pay scale. Vacation and PTO is a problem. I enjoyed the first 13 years and fit right in. Received many awards and promotions from Brocade. Great people to work with at the Broomfield site.
good,Brocade was a medium sized company that provided a decent start to a career in tech. However the product I worked on was not doing well and eventually shut down which led to other complications.
good,"They have some of the best networking products in the industry, great benefits and sell to top customers in the US. The CEO at the time had big dreams but they fell through."
good,"Culture is ok  but we are recently acquired by brocade so still little bit startup culture is there"
good,"Leadership is confusing.  Long term goals are unclear.  Upper management lacks vision and execution aka know how."
good,"Offered ability to develop and execute a variety of interesting programs."
good,"Day work activities were governed by project schedules.  If overall planning was good then just executed plan per schedule.  However, when projects were managed by inexperienced manager then daily work would be very dynamic and losing focus."
good,"Brocade has really been changing for the worse and it seems employees are not valued as they should be. There are so many wonderful, talented, competent people there and management is not treating them well. The company is fast moving and changes directions quickly, so hold on for the ride."
good,"A typical day at work involves supporting a territory with all their sales needs including: customer prospecting/cold-calling, constant communication with the local team, managing accounts, passing leads, setting meetings, working towards hitting your quota. I have learned mostly to be self-motivated to come in everyday and continuously pursue new customers even when being told no over and over. This has taught me perseverence. The environment as far as co-workers go is amazing and I get along well with all my peers."
good,"Before being acquired by Broadcom, Brocade was a positive place to work with a relaxed culture. This culture changed to be more Broadcom than Brocade after the acquisition, with less emphasis on customer satisfaction and employee retention. Overall, the pre-acquisition Brocade was a good place to work, but upward mobility was difficult. Post-acquisition, only having been part of Broadcom for a month, it was still evident the changes that were introduced were not in line with the former Brocade mentality."
good,"A typical workday was an opportunity to strategically partner internally and externally. Learned new storage networking, and SDN networking technologies for the Data Center. The most enjoyable skills of the job were the ability to build complete customer solutions for go to market model and alliance building."
good,"Due to acquisition activities, work life balance does not exist and has made it a challenge to work this past year at Brocade. Prior to this, Brocade was an amazing company with tons to offer."
good,Brocade is undergoing a very large and complex M&A which has drawn out over a year. Many employees are feeling deal fatigue and exhausted as coworkers quit and they are left to pick up the extra work with no option for a salary increase or promotion.
good,"Able to work from home 3 days per week, management was virtually non-existent. Company sold to 3 different parties and neither party is keeping the existing support teams."
good,It used to be a good workplace until the acquisition of Broadcom and now not a good scope of the products roadmap for all its suite of products getting acquired by different companies.
good,A great place to work. Great culture. I had an awesome manager who was a wonderful mentor and taught me the ABCs of Project Management. Enthusiastic team.
good,"Brocade has been playing the catch up game in the industry the past few years. This in turn reflects on the engineering who are working furiously to catch up and deliver things at a cray rate."
good,"If you know your VP, company is good for working else some it becomes difficult. "
good,good employee teamwork - lacking in policies and procedures - higher turnover than average companies
good,"Salesforce Development, Analysis"
good,Fun place to work with helpful and cooperative colleagues and management.
good,Good documentation and process procedures.
good,This is a small company learning to be big as they grow within its industry. They are going back to the fundamentals and beginning to implement best business practices. The company is still small enough for employee access and experience multiple aspects of the business. My only concern is personnel/ employee expertise; you'll often find square pegs in round holes in key positions troughout the organization.
good,"Company was on a fire sale when Broadcom bought out the company. Now all the IP assets are being sold off for cheap. Had several rounds of layoffs and the new companies who bought assets out of the company, took very few employees and the closing of this company was not good."
good,"Lots of work to go around with a lot of talent to pick from. Outstanding SAN, Ethernet, SDN and other offerings."
good,"Constantly changing"
good,"Best about Brocade - appreciative of experienced workers.  Lots of competent co-workers and no one was lazy.   This makes for a positive work culture."
good,"Inbound and outbound calls from a queue"

good,Great company until being sold...  Seemed to be on right path until they received an offer they could not refuse....  Executive level management did what they had to....
good,Great Company to work with good growth. Good exposure in regard to technical matters. Good work environment for enthusiasts.
good,I worked at Brocade Communications full-time for more than 5 years
good,Legacy product line funded the operations of the company. R&D dwindled leading to an acquisition at below market value.
good,"Had a good work-life balance and a great manager, who encouraged and appreciated new ideas. The benefits aren't that interesting. Unlike other companies in Bangalore, they don't offer free transport or food. Food is subsidized but is pathetic."
good,Brocade is a nice location filled with many intelligent and focused people.  The company promotes a great work/life balance and headquarters is easily accessible from 237.
good,"I enjoyed my job for the most part.  I was responsible for 2 very large accounts at Brocade.  My day typically started with checking out my accounts environments, making sure everything was running ok. Looking at open records, checking up or following up with customer and attending many meetings."
good,"Right before the acquisition and after acquiring Ruckus Wireless , the products was getting approvals from many end users. Enhanced portfolio was on the horizon."

good,"Recommend people to join Brocade, management is good, co-worker are good. focus on well-being of employees and customer oriented."
good,Great work life balance and you will learn a lot about the industry. Almost not opportunity for advancement. You pretty much must leave the company if you want to progress in your career.
good,"Fun, challenging work however with excellent team however, lots of executive management changes/churn which created constant change and alignment to business strategies."
good,"i already did a review of Brocade, perhaps I should do a review about indeed and how I have to fillin the same company review over and over again."

good,"Core technical work."
good,"Brocade is a fast paced, ever-changing environment that has sucessfully acquired several companies to build their product portfolio. Salaries are fair market value for the industry and there is opportunity for growth."
good,"When first arriving to Brocade, I was entered into a 9 Month rotation, that introduced me to 3 different engineering organizations within our department."
good,"co-workers, business people all were very supportive and co-operative."
good,I began my career at CNT (Computer Network Technologies) who was acquired by McData in 2005 then Brocade in 2007.  Brocade by far had the best benefits and bonus package.  While we were a medium sized company (5000+) the culture was that of a family who really cared and supported each other.
good,"ok, depends on the team you are working with. nice people and facility. convenient location. "
good,"Brocade was a great company to work for.  However, when acquired by Broadcom, the culture change and great people were let go because of a layoff.  I would not reccomend employment at Broadcom."

good,"The place is fun to work and management is very open and broadminded."
good,"It was a good company until they hired bad managers who did not share the company values and started to change the working environment. As a result, key employees left the company followed by lay off and so on. Now they are doing better with the new CEO."
good,"GOOD environment ."
good,"Its turned to the worst after acquisition, Not considered employees when the deal made."
good,"Typical day: meetings with suppliers and internal project teams"
good,Great company culture and pay. Brocade is currently being acquired by Broadcom. They intend to sell off all the IP networking business and keep the SAN products. Future is uncertain.

good,"Company tries to give back to community."
good,"Brocade has been a pretty great company for me.  The pay is good and the benefits are decent.  The 401k plan is ok (Fidelity) with a decent match.  The SE organization is a pretty good place to work within the company.  The leadership in the SE organization seems to understand our line of work very well, which can't be said about other leadership at other companies.  Some of the VPs are very good and are passionate about the Networking industry.     "
good,Overall good work place. Good for people at junior level to learn the technology. Some time work life balance will get lost.
good,"I worked with the software development teams so found the work both interesting and challenging. Management team was pretty good as well. Kept their teams informed on company developments, so communication was good"
good,Typical day consist of meeting with business partner to promote latest product technologies for business partner to resell.  Daily activities include follow-up on current sales targets and plan external events for customers with business partners for participation in network product presentations and equipment education.  Good place to work with a very helpful management team for those who want to learn new skills.
good,"People are really great to work with and care about doing the right thing.  Many of the executives have been in position for more than a decade.  While they have created strong functional organizations, they have been in the same role too long creating very stove piped organizations that are fearful of raising issues outside of their organization.  This results in an upward only management style, with executives making decisions for minor issues.  Delegation and empowerment are needed"
good,"Was a fun place to work, got good visibility / exposure to upper mgmt"
good,"-Great Starting Salary and Compensation"
good,Very demanding. Work-life balance is determined by the managers.
good,"Brocade has a strong value in their employees, not only do the believe in a strong work life balance, they are actively engaged within the local communities.  They provide many volunteer hours for a number of local charity events."
good,Having significant market share and trying to break into something new is challenging. But they are making headway. Significant management changes that were mostly positive.
good,"Brocade's biggest plus was that there were some great people who worked there, who would step up to get the job down.  The down side was that there  were many people who didn't seem to do much and yet they were not penalized.  The management vision was to create synergy across the product lines but the different business units did not work well together and seemed to often be in competition."
good,Worked on Contract in support of Point of Sale reporting.  Work culture was very good.  Good team of friendly people.  The best part of the job was figuring out new Excel formulas to manipulate the data.
good,"Brocade is the market leader in its space, and its products and people are great. I believe there are too many layers of management -- and the company is not as nimble as it could be. Overall... they treat employees well, and most enjoy working there."
good,"Brocade was recently acquired by Broadcom which has dramatically changed the culture of the company.  The company is now highly focused on margin, and less on the employee satisfaction.  "
good,"McDATA seemed to have their management team more focused on the direction they were going then Brocade did.  Working for Brocade was not at all a bad experience, I just think they made some bad choices as far as who to lay off right off the bat.  I wasn't one of those people but my manager was, and that was the main reason for me leaving.  I followed him to VMware."
good,"Brocade is a quite young company.  Here, you can focus to do the best job that you want.  The managers are really want to work together with you to get the best outcome for all the situations."

good,"The work is very good, good learning and feels good to go office."
good,"My division was a recent accusation and was growing fast.  Then the 2008 crash hit, and our largest customer went bankrupt.  Root cause was the repeal of the separation of Commercial and Investment Banking.  See, root cause is not limited to technical issues."

Always pushing us forward to learn more skills; technical skills like Linux, Windows OS, networking infrastructure; management skills like time management, risk management and procurement.

good,"Have been at Brocade for over 9 years and has been the best 9 years in my career. Work culture is about as professional as you can get: managers stay in touch to gain important info/updates as deals move along, and help when help is needed, but for the most part they stay out of your kitchen and let you do what you do well.  Very good pay, but benefits are only ok when compared to other tech companies. Brocade only matches the first 3% of your 401k, whereas other organizations start at 6% and others go up to 11%.  But you can't have it all, otherwise, everyone would work there.  Great company, great people who have become good friends."
