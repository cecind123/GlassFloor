rating,review
bad,The supervisor to whom I reported had minimal experience and was given her position by the manager who was a friend of her mothers.  It was difficult finding answers to question about department procedures.  The departments did little to increase communication and cooperation due to the company- encouraged competitive nature of the employees.  There were people who actually performed the work and other people with higher positions who stood around in each others office drinking coffee and gossipping.
bad,"The group I was assigned to work in was extremely hostile,"
bad,"Only luck being hired on is if you are ex military, company is greedy and looking for a tax write of they can. Also at Noble you become just another number to them they do not value employees like the other company!"
bad,"At the same time I was hired on with Noble Energy they also hired a new site lead around the same time. I didn't stay long because I wasn't treated right. The new site lead kinda let the power get to her head and she started making changes and moving people to different location when she didn't even have the authority to do so.What I meant by I wasn't treated right is. I was taken from my full time position to a part time for no specific reason.Then I was told that I would be moved off the site I was on and moved to another father away. Now I don't know what this woman had against me, I like to think i'm one of the easiest people to get along with.The only conclusion I could come to is I was about 30 years younger than their youngest worker. She knew that I wouldn't be able to work at the new location part time and still make money so that's why she did it to me. So I was really forced to quit. This is the up most and complete truth. Thank you for reading."
bad,"I took this job to learn more about leases and contracts. Once I accepted the position, they decided not to assign me most of the duties in the job description. Since I was not given these extra duties, my job was boring and too easy, and I did not learn one thing I didn't already know. I did not feel challenged enough to stay. Management plays practical jokes on employees that are not funny. Full-time co-workers did not seem interested in getting to know me: only the contractors cared enough to ask. I believe there is a high turn-over rate for contractors. There was nothing enjoyable about working in the Lease Records Department. I understand that contractors need to be separated for legal purposes, but the extent of their treatment was over the top. I am relieved that I am no longer a contract employee for this company."
bad,HR is Abusive.  Management and supervisors are not qualified.  Discriminatory.  Overwork capable employees.  Promote men far in excess of women even when women are more qualified.
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for - Bad Management. Buddy system is all that seems to work here. Older people are let go regularly.  Don't waste your time here.
bad,"If your a Bro, or you can frat guy you should fit in great. If you like to degrade woman, talk derogatory about any race that isn't white, chew tobacco and drink beer you will fit in great with the Noble culture."
bad,"Stay in your office, don't talk to anyone, don't get involved for anything you say, or bring up will be used against you. If you aren't a favorite, watch your back at all times. Constant reorganizations, letting good people go. Upper management is what needs to go.  If you want to do the job of 3 people and not be appreciated for it, then this is the place for you."
bad,The EG BU has been turned into a shadow of what it once was.  Everything has been taken away from the employees and contractors except for the right to work.  The Country Manager is only concerned with his own goals and has little regard for anyone but himself.  Blanket Policies exist only to make his job as easy as possible.  The Administration/Hotel Management division of the BU has more stoke than the Operations team.  It is the most backward place I have ever worked.
bad,"Mangement is weak and unskilled. The primary driver for the organization is image, which is obviously failing, not quality or sustainability. Resigned after 3 years. The Worst HR department I have ever been exposed to."
bad,"Data log meters all day, driving at least 150 miles every day."
bad,"Terrible place to work for.  The culture is toxic.  The management goes out of their way to try and get people to quit by excluding people from meetings, making information deliberately concealing information and neglecting to answer emails."
bad,"Analyze and interpret lease purchase agreements and trade agreements including oil and gas leases, assignments, like-kind acreage exchange agreements, joint operating agreements, geophysical options, and other contracts.  Evaluate acreage, develop lease offers and review title to determine ownership.  Investigate reports of lease provisions.  Coordinate."
bad,Too many individuals in a management role that shouldn't be. You managers with big heads who try to control your every move because they have nothing else to do
bad,"Not appreciated as a contractor, very unorganized IT department, and job description will be different once you start.Seems like stats are more important to supervisors and IT department.Company appreciates lazy people that kiss up to the higher ups, but don't appreciate the real hard workers that actaully finish the job!"
bad,"While the benefits and pay is great everything else is lacking. Degrees are valued over experience causing resentment and animosity. It's not about what you know, but who you know."
bad,"Noble plays favoritism. If you are not a favorite of one of the managers you do not move up or get promotions. "
bad,"Great company for people just starting out of college."
bad,"Once Chuck Davidson left, the culture tanked. There was no trust or support from upper management. Big brother was always watching. People aren't happy there which makes it difficult to enjoy."
bad,Coworkers were great and people I would love to work with in the future! I would be cautious when interviewing with accounting managers; follow your gut.
bad,Management is very terrible here and the chance for advancement is slim to none unless you interact directly with the business and the shot callers. Everyone else is forgotten no matter how hard you work.
bad,"A horrible place to work.  You have to really watch your back, because at any moment you could be fired for the least little infraction if anyone you have dealt with doesn't like you for some reason."
bad,"Expect a reorganization every year. Noble has a good philosophy but does not seem to understand that it is the Management that needs reorganized. As long as you blindly follow Management and praise the powers that be then you will go far in the company. Proof of that is the company just laid off members of the EHS team and not even three weeks later posted an open position for an EHS position. Poor personnel management, I have seen too many good people forced out just because they disagree with management. This company could once again be the great company is was if the reorganization occurred at the management level."
bad,"Complete disorganization everywhere you look and people are constantly changing groups (sometimes forced). The advancement opportunities are based on politics and not achievement. No pay increases for advancement opportunities. Data is a complete mess, their focus is to look good (in the community) other than doing good (as in work, innovations, optimizations, etc). After years of working there I still felt like everyone was either miserable there or just didn't really care, no one truly enjoyed their work"
bad,"The more you were able to do, the more they wanted....bigger work load than was reasonable (this from much experience)."
bad,"When I started at Noble it was a family orientated culture, and people appreciated your work, they helped, and questions weren't frowned upon; now it's all about who you know, people can mistreat you, drag you into HR based on lies, talk down to you, and blatantly cause a hostile work environment and upper management will turn a blind eye and even promote them; while others get written. Up or layed off, be careful of the people not the company"
bad,"There are two distinct classes - contractors and employees. It seems that who you know gets you more job recognition and opportunity than what you know. Social connections count more than job skills and experience do, so if you're on the ""inside"" and fit in with the social culture, you'll do ok. If you don't, you'll be discounted, no matter what you do. Hiring and promotions that I saw were based on social connections instead of quality of the person's work. It may be different in other departments, but that was my experience working there."
bad,"Some co-workers seemed overly friendly by wanting to get to know you. However, I believe it was a way to get you to open up and for ""them""  to retrieve information that could be used for ""their"" purpose (whatever that may be). One example, making you look bad while making themselves look good whenever necessary.  Kind of like insurance, use when necessary.  Typical. Sorry to say, trust no one."
bad,I used to love working at Noble because of the freedom I had. You will be fine until you say something truthful that higher management does not want to hear. Then your days are counted.
bad,Unfortunately Noble Energy allows archaic management styles to persist in order to achieve goals.  Especially when budgets become the focus of the BU you are associated.  Most employees that remain are only there because they have not yet found a new place to work.
bad,Focusing on unconventional so walking away from conventional.They are planning for the short term. They should keep their exploration focus too which was part of their success
bad,Noble was a great company to work for but with the oil and gas market and management changing there is no longer an appreciation for the employee.  Many jobs in Denver are moving to Houston.
bad,"The company is posturing for a sell, so the emphasis is on cutting costs including G&A.  There were at least 4 rounds of layoffs there over the 5 years I worked there."
good,"Noble is attempting to become a cutting edge company. Yet, the methods employed are short side and damaging in the long run. Treatment of Tech level employees needs vast improvement. Upward mobility and salary opportunity are limited at best."
good,I would not recommend working at Noble until they make significant changes to management and their culture.  The Denver Office Culture made working their bearable but this has apperently changed since leaving.  The Houston Office culture is unbearable.
good,"Good working environment."
good,"I was hired on a contractual basis as a Land Coordinator to handle non-pay obligations calendars and resolve issues pertaining to leases and other contract issues.  I worked 9 hours per day and sometimes 10 hours a day on the monthly calendars.  My second supervisor was knowledgeable and helpful, but my first supervisor was inexperienced, did not allow me to have access to computer programs so I could find the information I needed to resolve issues.  The first supervisor was a pet of the manager and should NEVER have been given the position of supervisor."
good,Over-staffed land department plagued with overlapping responsibilities and poor management from middle managers. Very political company culture that was strongly evident in April 2015 layoffs. High turnover rate among 20-something's in the land department as a result of how the land department was structured and managed. Nothing more than a pay check and resume builder.
good,Downtown Denver is nice during the Summer. People working there were uneducated except one. I spent lots of time and effort to get an education. Others did not. Pay was too low!
good,"I originally liked working at Noble for the first 4 years and then Noble started making changes. The morale is really bad at Noble now, use to feel like a family even though they are a mid sized oil & gas company, they are now trying to operate as a major and Noble isn't anywhere mature enough to operate that way.  Change at the top hasn't been impressive but that is what the Board wanted."
good,"The working environment is very professional and quiet. Some have meetings all day long, and some just stay working in their office all day. I was one that stayed in my office working all day."
good,"Good job great people, poor location. Very good staff, new management. good benefits. poor shift scheduling. poor upper management on midstream side. micro managers."
good,"Positive experience at the MBU. Great people, strong safety culture, and good working environment. Collaborative colleagues, good work ethic, and overall great bunch of people."
good,"Noble is a good company to work for, but I felt I had little opportunity to grow. I had good benefits, pay, and good people that I worked with, but it seemed like I was not rewarded for my hard work and that    I could not grow with them."
good,There are many departments at the company and if you are an employee they will let you move throughout the company.  The location of the offices in West Texas does make it difficult.
good,Coworkers would talk badly behind your back. The manager was kind and respectful but the other workers within our section were not kind and would create unnecessary drama.
good,"Overall good company.  Company is experiencing a growth in the onshore US market and managing international operations with 30 year design life, therefore, exciting times for the growing company."
good,Good place to work if you have job security. Management lacks involvement with your daily activities. Work is delegated and ignored unless you're in a critical position. I received very little to do.
good,"Easy to get lost in the system, hard work is not rewarded at this big company.  Lots of management, too much big corporate culture."
good,"Get up work 16 hrs a day on completion work come home go to sleep get up start day all over. What I learned is team work with all groups of the company, production, water, construction and land. My co-workers are hard working people and fun to work around. Hardest part of the job was being away from my family. Enjoyable part of job was that everyday was different in some way."
good,Satisfactory work environment.  A good place to learn.  The facility was adequate and well presented.  The office space accommodating.  I met some very nice people with which I can still keep contact with and use as professional references.
good,"For people working in Engineering this is a great company. They can explore,drill,complete and produce petroleum as well as any. If you work in a supporting role, IT, Fin, SCM, Audit, Etc. the jobs are fairly easy. The performance bar is set pretty low but so are the chances of advancement and pay raises. The company hires externally over internally. Internally HR and IT are seen as the weakest links in the chain because of their upper management and performance. It is a mid-size and growing company that still thinks it is small. They tout tuition reimbursement as a benefit but deny it to most. You can easily spend 10 years in a position as an average performer and if you over-perform you will be assigned more work. A lot of people would leave if it weren't for the easy job and great benefits."
good,"Was a great company that felt like family 10 years ago.  Now is a massive corporation with lots of red tape and management that doesn't understand or care about the business,"
good,"A typical day is much like any other job, show up, do your work and go home. Workplace culture varies depending on what business unit you work for. The hardest part was dealing with difficult people."
good,Excellent place to work.  Every company needs improvement.  Noble is not exempt.  It would be a #1 place to work if they provided more job security and benefits for their contractors.
good,The Midstream group is new and is still establishing their culture.  The operations team is working hard and is very supportive of establishing a good safety culture
good,"Very busy, It is nice getting to learn automation and measurement. Although the job title is measurement technician, there is a lot of automation involved and some measurement."
good,I was in more in a Gas Control role when I had to go out on disability. All is well now. Basically I was given a district that had so many working interest owners out of balance. Management gave that to me because I had fixed another district.
good,"The benefits overall were very good.  Health Care Premiums and Co-Pay were low but now starting come into line with most other organizations.  "
good,"Very nice people and environment with many different people, in many different departments. Makes working here very interesting but useful.  Job duties are basic to the needs at hand for what ever project your working on and of course, making that project successful.  And again - my co-workers become family friends that i will maintain these relationships inside and out."
good,"Cared for their employees and the work they do. Moderately fair compensation. Susceptible to bureaucracy that leads to too many meetings, not enough empowered decision makers, and some inefficiency"
good,"Good working environment, smart and friendly co-workers. Results oriented, however due to rapid growth of the company, planning of projects suffered."
good,All management needs to be more involved with the day to day on-goings of the organization. There also needs to be transparency when the company is not performing to minimum goal requirements.
good,Normal is processing and gathering data for drilling release reports. Storing electronic data on daily basis. Attend meetings twice a week and record details for group.
good,"Great people to work with at Noble. However, the company is growing at an incredibly fast rate and some of the growth has caused some pains."
good,"Noble Energy Corporation offers fair pay, many quality benefits, 6% 401K matching program, beautiful facilities and nice amenities. I left due to my long commute each day and to spend more quality time with my son."
good,The people are great to work with and the culture is improving.  Upper management is working at improving employee morale however they continue to be one of the lower paying oil and gas operators in the area.
good,"Good place to work, but not much room to grow in IT. Great for gaining work experience, but not all that great to advance your career."
good,"good work load balance"
good,"This job was different everyday, I loved that challenge it gave the everyday experience. The laid back atmosphere, and how they were flexible with life and job was appreciated."
good,"Fast pace environmant with a strong emphasis on safety. Energy extraction, deceptive management, great co-workers, physically and mentally challenging, working outdoors."
good,"Good environment."
good,I started as a image technician and worked up to a lease analyst. It was a great place to work until the Oil and Gas market crashed.
good,"Company culture is not inclusive to contractors, being a Noble employee is a preferred position, great people and beautiful facilities."
good,"was a great job and the culture was wonderful. my manger was helpful and useful with regard to my position. I worked at this company for more than four years, however, unfortunately, they were not able to make this position full time and permanent instead of a contract position"
good,"Noble Energy drilling department is made of good people and really care about doing it right.  The atmosphere has really team feel, and never felt like I couldn't openly speak up about concerns or ideas."
good,"This was a consultant post, there outside the normal employer employee relationship."
good,"Excelente condiciones salariales y agradable ambiente laboral. Excelente oportunidades para innovar y aplicar Best Practices a lo largo de la cadena de suministros (Supply Chain). Oportunidad de trabajar en un ambiente multicultural, con personas de diferentes nacionalidades y experticia."
good,Maintain production on a daily route of wells and facilities of different application.  Stay self motivated. Work in year round conditions. Management is open to input. Safety culture is growing. Enjoying working alone or in small groups to accomplish tasks. Some days are overwhelming with added last minute work but manageable.
good,"Things hinge on adapting to market, political, and technical changes. Change happens fast. You stay informed, stay ahead, and keep moving. You will learn a lot. You will work hard. People will move positions and will have to adapt to new people with different perspectives in charge."
good,"My group did tier one and two since we were such a small group."
good,A quality organization that works hard to work in an ethical manner.  Great workplace environment.  They take great care of their employees.
good,"Lots of antiquated processes in place, but has moved up to more modern processes.  I learned to work in ORACLE which was a good thing."
good,Process in invoices in a accurate and timely manner.  The hardest part was not being appreciated for all the hard work and additional jobs that were done.  I loved the people I worked with.  No opportunities to grow.
good,"I was very happy to work for Noble and was very well treated. I had lots of opportunity for company paid training, in the classroom and in the field. I was well compensated and felt that I was a valuable employee."
good,Very dynamic company and good technical people in general. However they have changed gears from exploration to a more production oriented company and in the process is losing accumulated talent obtained over the years.
good,I got a chance to meet good people and made new friends along the way. Great learning experience that I will be able to take with me along my travels.
good,"o	Coordinate Refurbished (repaired) equipment (see work flow/procedure)"
good,Love the half day Friday's. Company culture is very relaxed and no micro-managing which is always a plus. Management understands the need for a work life balance and the compensations and benefits are amazing.
good,"Provide Landmen saved, printed and filed Title and Leases"
good,Noble has a solid commitment to its employees while ensuring company results are driving to increasing shareholder value. There are numerous opportunities for career advancement and mentoring/training to support employees.  A typical day at work never boring and a provides meaningful and challenging environment with employees and teams working together to achieve team and company goals.  The culture is fast paced but rewarding.  Employees with strong work ethic and a drive to produce timely and quality products are well rewarded.
good,"This was a return to Equatorial Guinea where I had previously worked as a Camp manager. The client had leased an Hotel and numerous house in the capital of Malabo which became my responsibility. All catering, housekeeping and janitorial services were organised by myself. The plan was to take over a newly built campus in another location and I was charged with the planning of this particular project, which was completed prior to my departure. The job was made easier as I was able to communicate with the local workforce in French and English."
good,Daily Routine of lease operator checking assigned wells collecting production data. Entering data in computer inspection of equipment assuring proper operation. Deal with all weather conditions. Good time management is a must. Every day you learn something different. Management made for a great culture always provided lots of support. The hardest part of the job is tank management that they don’t overflow. Making sure all valves in the right position. And that all job task are done safely. The most enjoyable part is self satisfaction improving production. Your wells are like having your own business.
good,"Interesting and challenging position supporting drilling and completions engineers, managers and rig personnel. Learned new database. Excellent work environment and nice people."
good,Difficult but great experience. As the CEO i have learned a lot operating a new business. Learned various sales and management skills
good,I have worked in EG for over 7 years on three different assignments with 3 different operators.. Overall EG was a quiet simple place to live but little by little it is getting a bit harder and a little more dangerous.
good,The oil industry was a great place to work.  Although this was a temporary position i still enjoyed the people and work i put in on a daily basis.
good,Short term assignment but was a great assignment. The International Government Relations office is quite busy providing support to Noble Energy Inc. in US and abroad.
good,"Workplace culture for the projects I worked on was enjoyable. Teams worked well together. There isn't a lot of job security for contractors and there is a definite difference in the environment between contractors and employees. I would continue working with the company, whether as a contractor or employee, for as long as I could. It is a really good place to work."
good,Great company to work for when oil is in a good place. They have an easy to work with schedule and take care of there employees. The managers are easy to get along with and work for.
good,"Great place to work if they would only hire you...but they leave on contract for ever. Love my supervisor, fun people. Get off early on Fridays."
good,"I go in everyday and just go into my office and start working, I really don't like to socialize I go in and do my job then go home. There are very family oriented, and they understand that you have a family or kids and they know sometimes people need to be out to take care of their loved one. They also very supportive when it comes to education, so when a person needs to leave early or be out the company will approve that."
good,"Noble Energy is a great company that is responsive to the needs of the business, as well as the needs to the employees.  I enjoyed working with them very much."
good,"Great place, incredible people. It is a true school for anything related to business. Came in as a new employee, learned and left there as a veteran in oil and gas."
good,It is a great company. I would appreciate the opportunity to return when the economy recovers. I left due to a layoff but enjoyed working with the Peloton Team.
good,"Good people, excellent projects, very fulfilling work experiences.  Enjoyed the new experience of travel to Israel.  Project was postponed due to regulatory issues in Israel."
good,"Working at Noble Energy was a great experience. The environment was fast paced, diverse, and interesting. I was happy to have worked there."
good,It is a great company with growth opportunity.The culture is great and management is very approachable. I enjoyed my time there.
good,i m a  serious man respectful hornet since working is this company was very good for me and i learn more hot to deal with customers and with my friends ant work .i learn how to work in group
good,I enjoyed being in charge of the offshore dredge program offshore Israel.
good,"Procurement activities at Noble Energy were a daily grind.  There was significant back and forth with partner contractors to achieve cost savings and decrease spend.  When PPB is low, there will be waves of cut backs that leave less people to do the same amount of work.  Be prepared to work hard.  The reward for your efforts will be surviving the volatile oil and gas market conditions with your job."
good,The opportunities were available however the wrong people were placed in to provide them to the employees. Strong employees however Sub-par Management.
good,Love the company and the people.  Quiet working environment and friendly staff. Colleagues are friendly to one another.  Every one is caring and thoughtful.
good,Advancing within the company is a challenge. If you want gain more skills in an area or want to grow in another field that requires you to train with another department or group is next to impossible
good,"This place is a high energy, high demand environment that brings the best out of you. I have no complaints about this company."
good,"learned to communicate with all kinds of people and attitudes. Had very good understanding with my Co-workers, a great relationship with the manager. Overall liked the environment."
good,"Noble has been a very good employer to me.   Management has recognized, appreciated and rewarded my contributions to the company.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with mass layoffs when the turn in gas prices occurred.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move within departments and learn other skillsets."
good,The organization has realigned the internal Business Services group and shuffled some roles and responsibilities which has stretched internal resources and created challenges to ongoing projects.  The company is well managed with middle management as the weakest link with many creative and very capable personnel departing for other opportunities.  Some turn-over continues due to this middle management challenge.
good,"Pro: Great work, people, pay, accounting, managers, contracts team, great legal team, geologists, engineers, supply chain, training, investor relations, security, diversity, pace, vendors, document controls software and teams, administrative support, parking"
good,"Truly an excellent company with a real world take on employment in an energy sector career. Strongly valued dedicated employees and active participants in their safety program. Advancement opportunities with regular performance reviews and feedback."
good,"Project Management role required a high level of responsibility, including management of third party Detailed Design and Specification of equipment by Engineering, Procurement, and Design."
good,Great job - learned a lot about oil/gas business. well managed company.  Friendly Culture. Organizing and cleaning out existing well files was the hardest part of the job because it was tedious. Working with all the different employee's at Noble was the best part of the job.
good,"Working for Noble Energy was probably one of the best working experiences I have had. The culture in IT was fantastic, the people I had the opportunity work with were excellent at their jobs. If the price of Oil hadn't plummeted I would have loved an opportunity to work there."
good,Great working environment and great co-workers. Can not find nothing negative to say of Noble Energy. Would recommend the company to everyone.
good,"The job requires the ability to use accounting software to verify information and upload invoices, multi-task, and prioritize, prepare, and organize huge volumes of invoices received for payment processing. Invoices received by me were verified, organized, prioritized by terms, type, and age, then scanned and attached as  pdf files into the accounting software, where I submitted/entered them into ADP OPENIMAGE via a database. I also created scanning sheets that had billing information on them that would automatically upload the information into a KOFAX database when the sheet and the invoice were scanned. Once submitted the invoice begins to route to Accounts Payables for coding and approval."
good,"I'm only a contract worker for Noble and I love it here, I love working in Oil and Gas and I've come across some very interesting and helpful people in just the 3 months that I've been here. Management is wonderful and very understanding. The only thing I would change about my job is my compensation which is nice but who doesn't want a pay increase."
good,The international business experience gained at Noble is invaluable. Working with such a diverse group offered a unique learning environment. Management is supportive and encourages creativity.
good,"The work atmosphere is fantastic, very safe place. My supervisor was very good at showing me what was expected and eager to guide me. Would love to work there again."
good,"Noble Energy is a great company.  The managers really encourage a work life balance.  Family time is important!  You are always encouraged to take the time you need when something comes up that might require you handle family matters from a sick child, to a doctor appointment, to even caring for sick pets."
good,"Overall the company is a pleasure to work for. Great company culture and transparent management."
good,Noble Energy is a great company to work for but I am separated from my family and it has become a decision that I have to make between my position with the company and my family.
good,"It's a good place to work. Good, smart and hardworking people."
good,"Within the industry, they really are trying to be the best and get better.  Still has a way to go, but seems to care about the employees, inclusion of ideas and diversity."
good,"A good place to work/be.  Good pay, great benefits, great people, safe work environment. They promote from within, allow for career development.  Most enjoyable part of the job is having tools, knowledge to help people throughout the day."
good,"International positions - always challenging.  Able to meet people from all parts of the world.  Learned that even though we come from different parts of the world, we are all the same."
good,"I was hired as a temp for basic clerical duties and record keeping for their accounting department while the corporation was in the process of digitizing it's files. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Noble Energy in Equatorial Guinea and in Cameroon."
good,"Lots of work and great atmosphere. Plenty of sunshine and fresh air, challenges and rewards. Lots of ups and downs in the oilfield, though."
good,"Really enjoyed my time spent @ Noble!  Noble lived up to their name, as it was a very respected & noble company to work for.  They practiced what they preached.  They had very nice offices & great working conditions...  I can't say enough great things about the company. "
good,"Everyday your faced with challenges and obstacles and yet getting  sense of satisfaction when accomplishing something that makes a difference.  I've learned that no matter what obstacles are presented to me, I'm always willing to go the extra mile for Noble.  Noble has been able to acquire a great management team that keeps the company running efficiently and are always willing to show appreciation for what you do.  My co-workers and immediate management team are phenomenal people to work with. The hardest part of the job is knowing that one day I will have to part with a great group of people.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the people that have become like a second family to me."
good,Always felt like management cared about thier workers and not just the production. Great place to work at. You can call your higher up anytime to ask wuestions and they will never take it offensively. They prefer for you to wake them up in the middle of the night than for you to get hurt.
good,"Each day presents production challenges and opportunities to improve safety. Always learning to overcome the various issues of natural gas well operation and recognizing areas to improve safety and production. "
good,Always understand and no whatever job you have applied for. They expect every one to be safe like everyone should be. Well trained employees on each job .
good,There is a lot of support and exposure for young graduates who work at Noble.  There are many managers who take the time to meet with you and offer their advice and help with any career questions.
good,The pipeline is fast paced and keeps you on your game at all times. If you love engaging the work force this is a great job. I enjoyed it because everyday you show up for work you impact workers in a positive way.
good,"Before 2008 Noble Energy was a great place to work.  They cared about their employees and showed it through activities and wanting to bring the company together,"
good,Working at Noble was a great opportunity. Unfortunately the Colorado Regulatory being conducted from Houston was not working well according to employees working in Denver. This caused a strain between both the Houston and Denver offices resulting in layoffs. I would definitely work at Noble again if given the opportunity. I would do any State/Federal Regulatory.
good,Great place to work! Excellent management very responsible. The office has a very nice working atmosphere.  I highly recommend a career with Noble Energy.
good,"As an employee of Noble Energy, I found the work gratifying and fruitful. I was promoted from well intervention consultant to well intervention foreman and was able to flourish and demonstrate my leadership skills and expertise and applied my experiences."
good,"Great culture and good people to work with, I really enjoyed working here. Great benefits, and good management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that worked there."
