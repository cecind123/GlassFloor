rating,review
bad,"They have a culture of deception--probably top-down. Too many employees told me how they were enticed with promises that were never honored, and this was the case for me when I worked here.  "
bad,don't CARE about the employee management is terrible and they allow them to be. Management treat employee like a body like they are replaceable. gossiping is also a huge problem.
bad,A very fake bank w very lazy people that rewards lazy incompetent people as long as they are friends w Mgmt   Company doesn’t reward success they reward people who are yes men or women that kiss butt.  I have never seen more incompetent management in my life  I have no clue what they even do.   The only time I ever heard from the president of the bank was to notify us the windows were being washed
bad,Huntington Bank is not a good bank to work for.  They do not support men of color at all.  I could out sell and work any of them but was not treated fairly at all.
bad,"They dont seem to care about their employees or their customers"
bad,I worked at the corporate office (Easton) location for almost 2 years and was miserable every single day! The management was horrible! The culture was horrible! The expectations were unrealistic and the entire team wanted to quit!  I would NOT recommend anyone to work here unless you are very desperate to have a paycheck.
bad,terrible culture.  they tell new hires it is about helping do what is right for each customer - but sales of loans and high dollar products are pushed above the customer interest.
bad,"Huntington needs alot of improvement. They make up stuff as they go. They make you bank with them and the products needs to be upgrade, as well as the pay! We do so much to be under paid. Hopefully Huntington make some changes and when they do make sure you include the employees since they are the ones who deals with customers on the phone and in person"
bad,"The culture and upper management does not care about its employees.  When upper management visits the local branches all they are worried about is telling you what you are doing wrong. There is never a WOW, you are doing a great job. It would be nice to feel appreciated. No wonder Huntington has a high turnover rate. Stay away !"
bad,"An abusive situation where the higher-ups swear, name-call, demean employees,  and put that excessive pressure on employees that breaks their spirit and costs them mental and physical health issues. "
bad,The pay should be increased. it is hard to work for a company that does not pay according to other jobs within the industry. The company had a nice atmosphere but the pay is why I could not stay. Unable to take care of my family.
bad,"They do not care about their employees, only money. The first chance they get to severance people, they do. It doesn’t matter how long you have been there, they will get rid of you."
bad,this was a place that we would have to be friends with management to get any type of promotion. Management is terrible I would not advise this as a great employer
bad,"People are mean and rude. No one helps you learn new things. Just puts you in front of a computer and a customer and walk away. Only worried about sales"
bad,"They say they want to be “category of one” and they only target rich people to service. All upper management want to do is line their pockets with cash. Same as the managers. Online trainings never end, and the sales goals are only achievable if you believe in lying to someone instead of helping them. I understand now that this was not a company for the people. This isn’t to bash the company. This is simply me telling my honest opinion. If you can stay away from this bank as a customer or employee, I strongly advise you to do so."
bad,Unrealistic sales goals and stressful environment. Unable to focus on sales as a banker due to constant teller activity. Poor consistantly changing management and policies/procedures.
bad,The culture was very old school business.  They did not embrace the remote working the perception was if you were working remotely you weren't working.
bad,"overworked, crazy hours in the in stores. Advancement based on your manager recommendations and if your manager is not fair and playing politics you will not get advanced. upper management will get a totally wrong idea about your sales and skills. "
bad,Management would not work around my school schedule even though I was a part time employee. This establishment based your success on quotas and we were punished if they were not met.
bad,The management is dishonest. I would never work there again. Managers hire people they knew from  a prior job and they are hired  in with no experiance making more money than people that have been working there for years.
bad,At Huntington you are just a number no an employee.  The motto seems to be do more with less.  Work lots of hours and no opportunity for advancement.  Was there 16 years and let go do to departmental restructuring after I gave my all.  Giving up my life to put in 50 to 60 hours a week for the last 5 years.  It didn't matter.
bad,There is a good reason why this place was bought out.  The management of the company essentially sold us out.  We didn't event know what was happening until it was too late.
bad,Did not care for the corporate culture.  No concern for employees or ongoing efforts.  Management constantly misleads it;s people and does not give clear job guidence
bad,"NO work/life Balance"
bad,"Avoid if you can. Extremely low pay, management is shaky, you're encouraged to let people walk over you, people made more as contractors than full time employees."
bad,Sales was push on a daily basis and lack of training did not help either. Manager was very unprofessional when it to his daily requirement to meet and exceed our set sales goal.
bad,horrible work atmosphere. Upper management was dishonest about advancement opportunities and employees were allowed to be rude and belittle each other with no consequences
bad,FirstMerit merged with Huntington Bank and is no longer open for business.  Any review given is unnecessary as it is now apart of Huntington and I have never worked for them.
bad,They brought in a CEO from out of state and he expanded this bank until he could cash out.  Good luck replacing all the Ohio jobs that are being lost from the latest takeover.  Sell Out!
bad,"Worked their 11 yrs ago. Don""t know much about this company anymore. Was a stressful environment being a debt collector. "
bad,By far the absolute worst place to be employed!  The management is the most ridiculous group of people I have ever encountered.  They run these branches like some kind of a side show at the circus.  if I could assign a negative number to the ratings i would.  Definitely the absolute worst experience of my career.
bad,"I would not go back terrible work/life balance. they hire a bunch of people to just fire the right away. Very cut throat, very judgmental. If you have a life outside of work well dont you wont ever be able to do anything."
bad,I was being harassed by my new manager and I decided to go to the HR department with pages full of issues.  I was fired three weeks later.
bad,The pay was okay but the company is far behind most banks. The room for advancement depends on if you are a manager's favorite. They lie and tell you that you work one Saturday a month then you end up working all of them because the managers doesn't work weekends.
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had the management is very incompetent. There is no room for advance the company doesn't care about it's employees
bad,unless you were a manger or a favorite- no work life balance in collections.  The schedule is ridiculous- very little flexibility. No room for advancement.
bad,"When the house bill came out to regulate payday loans, they took a hit, the area was too saturated with cash advance place. At least 5 in a one mile radius."
bad,"·   Processed customers transactions    "
bad,helping clients with their financial needs was a very rewarding feeling.  also branch staff was minimum so that enabled good teamwork and the ability for everyone to learn multiple jobs.
bad,Horrible. Unprofessional slave drivers.   Worst job even quit day 91. Closed accts and stay away from huntington.  Rather cut strangers toe nails.
bad,The rank and file seemed to hate the company.  Anger abounded.  I was a contractor there and could not believe the tension.
bad,Poor management. Hours are horrible. Very competitive environment. Lack of advancement.
bad,"Long weeks and poor compensation for the work done."
bad,"i was hired as part time but quickly learn they only say that bc you end up working 40-50 hrs a week. we were constantly short staffed, the manager was in her own world. my manager got wind of my looking for a new job and forced me to put in my notice then fired me 2 days later"
bad,High turnover in district managers and staff. Long hours and no compensation and no appreciation. Was the worst employer I ever worked for. Upper Management is not supportive to managers. Look at the stock price. That says it all.
bad,I would never recommend working for Huntington Bank. The management truly has no regard for the livelyhood or well being of their employees. This place was a nightmare.
bad,"Worked there for nineteen months, and was terminated. Did not have a branch manager for almost a year, and inbetween that had three managers in six months. Branch was susposed to be a three personal banker branch, with a branch manager. I was the only personal banker and we had no branch manager. They expected me to the reach the sales goals of the branch based on it having three personal bankers and a branch manager. It did not, so I was not able to reach the sales goals."
bad,Their 24hr grace is a joke! Its a TRAP and I dont trust them anymore!!
bad,"I was told I would be part time (25 hrs/wk), but I work anywhere from 0 hrs to 38 hrs. They consider part time less then 29 hrs averaged out over 3 months. Management has stated to me that ""family will be around forever"" because they were trying to prove to me that I should be able to work more hrs. I have seen them lose customers of 47 yrs, 25 yrs and 15 yrs because the customer service from management and higher up is so horrible and dishonest."
bad,This place only cares about money not their customers. They treat their employees unfairly and not their business needs as to moving up in the work place.
bad,I was responsible for providing excellent customer services right along with process payment for vehicles and mortgages.  They wanted us to assist with every aspect of the banking business without the pay.
bad,Would not recommend. Constant revolving management and poor team skills. Too much drama. Pay is not nearly enough too live off of even at $16 an hour.
bad,This is one of the most stressful places i've worked. Management does not care about the employees only about sales. Split shifts were very difficult.
bad,"Huntington Bank is a bank that should only reside in Columbus, OH. They're not ready to be a competitor with the larger banks.  Huntington hardly recognizes anything outside of Ohio and therefore will never be a true player in the banking world.  They're on an island by themselves.."
bad,Working at HNB at first was a great job. I loved going to work. Then we got new managers and things changed and I did not like working for this company anymore.
bad,"After being a teller for 9 years was fired by a teller supervisor who had been with the company for 7 months because I left a $5 bill on the money counter. I was walked to the door by the teller supervisor (that is policy) and told, ""Have a super-fantastic rest of the day""."
bad,"The manager was very difficult to work for, she would ridicule employees in front of the whole staff.  If she was having a bad day, so were we.  The supervisor had the same attitude as the manager. When I was there, First Merit purchased another bank, almost the same size, the area I was in, the work almost tripled. But, did they think to hire more people to help with the work load, NO. Instead I would be yelled at in front of the entire staff."
bad,"Huntington Bank was a very highly sales oriented business with unreachable goals.  Atmosphere was very thick, no one had a sense of humor.  I learned that I don't like to work in that type of environment.  Manager nit-picks about everything.  Could not tease or joke with co-workers.  Too serious"
bad,"Long days, no rewards for what you did, bad pay, bad management, bad training.  Co-workers were good, management terible.  Nothing hard about the job nothing enjoyable about the job."
bad,Companies that I have ever worked for. Definitely racist company...
bad,"No work/Life balance, constant policy vilations, high turn over"
bad,All they care about it sales. They don’t care about you as a colleague the management is selfish and only cared about himself and he was fake to your face. Working there so long they do not care how well you performed and how much of an impact you made on the company they will find a way to fire you even if you make one mistake and have the cleanest record. Their loss! Don’t waste your time with them you can grow and develop somewhere else. Once you reach banker good luck getting into a management position they won’t allow that unless you have management experience at another bank.
bad,Too much micro managing. They were concerned about sales above anything else. Unrealistic goals and lack of support from upper management. Customer service was devised of everyone saying the same corny lines and not actual one on one relationship with the customers.
bad,"Coaching was offered, never happened."
bad,"Management considers Office politics their primary focus. Very little regard for employees personal life nor career. The bottom line is imperative, but should not be absolute, and to the utter disregard for the employees. There is absolutely no sense of loyalty."
bad,Decisions made by management typically would not accurately represent the goals communicated by the company. This leads to frequent uneasy mood within the business.
bad,When I left it was because I felt as though they were making me out sales in front of my customers. I felt I was no longer able to put my relationships with customers in front of hurrying to the next customers to make sure I had met with the number of customers that they wanted me to meet with every day. Everything was about numbers not my customers. That's not the type of place that I want to work for. After 18 years I had to leave when they were pressuring me to do this.
bad,Very stressful work environment. Political gamesmanship is of the utmost importance. Very little concern for the average employee. Absolutely no concern for employees private lives. Absolutely no Loyalty to anyone.
bad,"The middle managers do not understand the work volume, don't care to understand, value men over women and manipulate information to suit their end goal if they dislike or feel threatened by an employee."
bad,"Very stressful, unreasonable sales goals. Incompetent management without the skill set to coach or train employees. Most managers and employees are recycled from other institutions. District Manager is horrible."
bad,"Too many hours no help when needed. Many in store locations with long hours, as a manager you fill in the blanks I worked way to many 14,15, 21 days in a row."
bad,A typical day at work was fast paced and full of stress due to management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.  The hardest part of the job was having to be in front of my specific manager who would steel sales and then reprimand you for not hitting goals.
bad,"Even when I changed jobs within Huntington it appeared to be easier if I was an external rather than internal.  HR was a mess, they would never follow up on jobs you have applied for."
bad,"Being fairly new to both the banking industry and Huntington Bank I cannot say I would recommend them as an ideal employer to work for. The Management does not care to support or listen to you or any of your concerns, training is not provided other than what you learn from another employee and then you are expected to fully know various jobs and make no mistakes. If you do defend yourself or speak up then you have a huge target on your back."
bad,This place makes you work for nearly nothing and expects perfection at all costs. Trying to get promoted and proving your competent enough to handle all of the outrages expectations isn't good enough for them. They only listen to higher management and do not care about the tellers or the lower staff of the company.
bad,"The only thing they care about is sales, sales and more sales. You get told you will have every other weekend off but that never happens. No work life balance. HIGH TURN OVER RATE."
bad,Not a great workplace. But a great start in banking to eventually move on. Pay is not great and hours are long. 10 hours at time.
bad,Many changes with mgmt. at this dysfunctional dept. of the bank.  Made less money every year I worked there due to cuts in commission.
bad,"Very fast paced, multi tasking environment. Computer system not up to standards."
bad,"They recruited me from management and I find the branch manager to lack management/personnel skills. The co workers are loud, rude and feel they ""own"" the bank and a new comer has no place being there! Treated unfair. Nothing enjoyable. The manager is a micro manager. Could not wait to LEAVE. They do not encourage advancement but rather how you will impact their business if you do move on. Change not accepted by this manager. Branch Manager is always bothered to get up from his desk and assist a customer. Alot of work for very little pay and no respect."
bad,"I agree with former post. I worked at this bank for 2 years. Went 6 months with no lunch breaks or regular breaks. Pay is very low for tellers and sales goals are ridiculous. And the tobacco free policy should be illegal. They hound you every single day to make your sales goals, you are required to push every single product to every customer. No chance for advancement unless u are in with the management in crowd. Very management heavy. Very high turnover for tellers."
bad,Right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. This bank is clueless on accuracy! The upper management is clueless as to what is going on and goes by nothing but gossip! The hours suck!
bad,"I worked there and was hired as a teller. The pay was $10/hr. After 6mos I was assured I could apply to personal banker positions given my sales experience and bachelors degree. After exceeding monthly sales goals, (which must be atleast met to remain employed there the following month), I was denied interviewing until I had been there a year. At my yearly review for a raise I was told I was hired at the maximum amount allowed and denied any raise. I performed at 114-145% of monthly goal limits, led the branch and twice led the district in cross sells. I was allowed to interview for other positions, which seemed to be filled by those connected, or the biggest brownnosers, instead of those most qualified. I quit after 18mos."
bad,Non support from mangement and human resources on any issues.
bad,"the company dos not care about their employees, it always boils down to revenue. No work life balance whatsoever. Management is a joke, you pretty much have to teach yourself everything."
bad,"A good place to start a career and gain experience to transition elsewhere. If you're a true sales leader, the micro-managing environment will not be appreciated."
bad,"Great job if you're looking for something a year or under to. just fill time until you find something permanent. Don't plan on enjoying your time, your management, feeling involved or included, communication doesn't exist and career advancement is non-existent. But pay is awesome if you aren't an existing employee and benefits are nice"
bad,"I am very disappointed with the leadership; the culture is really rigid. Moreover, there is limited opportunity for advancement. The management makes very little effort to get to know employees."
bad,Huntington thrives off installing fear into their employees.  The threat of losing your job is a reality on a day to day basis.  Huntington rarely promotes from within and hires unqualified people for management jobs.  They have to pay their employees high wages in order to get them to stay and put up with the daily abuse.  The Human Resource department is the biggest joke of all.  Look elsewhere if considering the banking industry for your career path.
bad,"As a banker your job is 100% sales.  I'm encouraged to push customers into whatever products or services that help the branch reach its sales goal.  I'm also expected to make 50 calls a day to bank customers to get them into the branch and make some sort of sale.  "
bad,"What does a CEO who comes in and slaps a coat of paint on a business and then eliminates all of it's fee income and therefore can't make money by way of revenue do?  "
bad,"If you live in the Midwest and are on this website often, you'd notice that Huntington Bank is always hiring. ALWAYS. A big red flag that they can't keep their employees. With technology advancing, the banking world has changed dramatically. Everything a teller does can be done online or at an ATM. And with that, banks are competing for business from the diminishing population that still steps out of their vehicle to do transactions at a bank. With that pressure, it pushes bankers to hound existing customers to open more accounts and credit cards to make up for the fact that new customers aren't filling up their lobbies anymore. It's no longer about building relationships with customers, it's become pitching their next loan or credit card. What I've learned from working here? Keep your head down"
bad,"Typical day includes handling cash transactions, customer service and setting up new accounts.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with drama of small staff.  I have learned a lot in regards to the financial aspect of business and financial planning.  I have learned more cross selling strategies to help me further my sales career."
bad,Management stinks! They will always find a reason to make sure that you do not get a pay raise. If you do not believe this ask anybody that works for them now. Anybody!
bad,Huntington Bank is not a desirable place to work and I would personally discourage anyone from seeking open positions with this company.
bad,"The only thing that kept me going at Huntington was my boss. He was the only one that cared and tried to get his to be the best. He was the only person that made sure that I was ok. But the upper management above him sucks. They dont speak and the are rude. There is no advancement there. And the pay is sucks    "
bad,Managers are not held accountable for the way they treat their employees. Others in the company have said their managers are either amazing or horrible.
bad,"Management is awful and does not care about you. Very stressful place and the only way to get ahead is to become buddies with the boss. When you move your desk, they don't even give you time off the phones like normal call centers do. They want you on the phone while you are moving. Look Elsewhere. PLEASE!!!"
bad,Learned a lot at Huntington and thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with. Hours are good but salaries are not based on personal productivity and job duties.
bad,I didn't like Huntington at all the mangers were very cut throat! I was stressed out on a  daily basis to sell products! banking is not for me! I did not like this Job
bad,Having an inexperience upper management makes it extremely hard to work for. Social pathic characteristics is what her style of leadership.  Co workers were great people to work with.
bad,"This is a regional bank that obtained national customers by providing loans. Vehicle loans and second mortgages. They were able to provide loans with their banking customers funds. However, they promoted self service to their banking customers."
bad,"this job can be changeling, they make you choose your family or work you work every weekend with no potential of weekends off. they are misleading with you."
bad,"Typical day at work... Show up at 7:30 and start working, rest of team shows up at 9:30. Stop for lunch at noon and leave at 5. ususally responding to work tickets, emails, and phone calls."
bad,Upper management affairs with subordinates and are promoted later not to mention no criminal reference checks for current employees to investigate behaviors of people handling money of the public
bad,"Wasn't the greatest job in the world. Constantly having to deal with difficult customers and having them yell at you for their mistakes. I dealt with vehicle collections from 30-90 days and repossessions. I learned about the collections industry and what you can and cannot do. Management was always there screening your calls, saying ""you could have done this better"" even though i was promoted to their top collector. Hardest part was knowing that you meant nothing to them. The most enjoyable part nothing really we would have a cook out every so often, but other than thats about it."
bad,"I worked for a bank that was bought by Sky Bank and then bought by Huntington. Upper management was never changed after being bought. I had 11 years with the bank and could not move up. No one taught me anything, I learned it all by myself. The only way that you got anywhere was if you went out partying with the managers and district manager. They were all divorced or unhappy at home, so they never wanted to be there. There was supposedly always someone who had more experience than me even though I had been there longer. When I found out I was expecting my manager told me in front of customers and other employees that ""as my friend she was happy for me but as my boss she was p****d"". I assume that it was because the company had to pay me for maternity leave and my manager would have to do my job while I was off. After that, my manager had her friends call upper management and complain about me. She was so mean and nasty to me. i asked other employees to talk to human resources with me but no one would. KARMA! what comes around goes around. She made it so horrible that I my doctor had to put me on medical leave early and I still went into preterm labor. When my leave was up I tried to go back but I just couldn't. Not going back was the best decision I ever made."
bad,"I have worked at Huntington for three year. There was a time when I could not wait until my alarm went off so I could go to work, The boss the girls the customers ,it was a blessing.Now I realize no one from the bottom to the top cares about anything but money. I know that is what a bank is for,but from 70 year old people that live on a fixed income"
bad,"Politics, favoritism, nepotism and discrimination in promotion and career advancement."
bad,"stressful environment and lack of guidance from management. pure pressure on sales. "
bad,"The manager at the UNION location is not someone I would ever recommend working for. Narcissistic and made some very inappropriate comments about women. Frequently made customers uncomfortable, quite a few left due to his demeanor towards them. I saw him actually yell at a customer in the lobby rather than try to be understanding and explain things to him. It was a gross display of control."
bad,"Huntington pays well, but the culture is horrific. The upper management does not care about anyone but themselves. They dont care about your success, but only if you agree with them."
bad,Overall culture is balanced as far as work/ life is concerned. However the HR and senior management should monitor the middle management for showing discrimination /bias to the employees.
bad,"As far as the compensation in concerned, Huntington does provide a good compensation package and unfortunately it stop there. Their management is so concerned about Giant Eagle branches and back office support is lacking very heavily."
bad,This place is a horrible place to work. The management goes on the principle of everything is a performance issue. There is no building on the positives. Everyone I worked with was actively looking for a job with the exception of a couple people. I do not recommenced working here. There is a very high turnover.
bad,Worked as a head teller for many years and had day to day contact with customers to transaction completion.  You are instructed to SELL SELL and upgrade all customers accounts.  The banker will take care of the customer after you sell the products to them with little to no credit.  The difficult aspect of the job is lack of proper training and having the selling pressure on top of audit procedures you are always stressed out.
bad,I worked over 43 hours per week I enjoyed my co-workers and my customers. Huntington is not a customer service oriented bank they are more interested in getting new money in the bank. Management was not very helpful or knowledgable.
bad,The experience was the worst there’s a lot of micromanaging.. the hours were long and the company doesn’t promote the employees to help clients with there problems... the management is always moving a lot they over look people in career development and advancement
bad,I wouldn’t suggest anyone to work here unless you just need to quickly make money. The pay is decent but the stress and horrible environment that comes with it isn’t worth it.
bad,"In the beginning, the job was amazing (First Merit). Then after a merge (HNB), it took a turn very rapidly. Management was stressed and it was shown daily. The respect began to decline for the employees and the job became overwhelming. The job duties were easy it was management that made things practically impossible. The expectation level was not equal across the board for everyone. The treatment of staff was as if we were a number, not people. "
bad,The CEO is great but managers and executive managers DO NOT display or share the sentiments of the CEO and DO NOT treat employees with respect or expectations as described by CEO or as written in HR policy.  I would not recommend my worst enemy to work here!
bad,"Huntington promotes a culture of verbal abuse, and ""do as I say, not as I do."" There is no regard for chain of command, and C-Suite leadership does not set up downward layers of management for success. "
bad,FirstMerit Bank merged with Citizens Bank and unfortunately the culture changed dramatically.
bad,"The branches are way understaffed making it hard to maintain a work life balance.  Everyday is a stressful experience either with sales pressure or not having enough people to get through the work day. Sometimes you won’t even get a lunch break.  Upper management lies to you all of the time, claiming they care about you and that they will help you, they don’t.  You can’t trust anything they tell you.  You can’t believe anything they say.  The only thing you can believe is that everyday will be stressful"
bad,"Worked at Huntington Bank. Everything is goal heavy. Your management cares about nothing else. Not the people. Not the team itself. Everything is product pushing. When First Merit and Huntington combined, Huntington’s Genesee County Area got all of the cut throat managers from First Merit. They like to give people things they don’t need. Very high turn over. I worked with over 20 or more different people within a year of working as a Branch Relationship Banker I"
bad,"Someone else summed my feelings up with this statement: Management was do as I say not as I do. Not at all a nice person. We just didn't like each other. She called me into her office on a daily basis for using ""Slang"" I asked someone for their Sos.Social security number. Everyday it was something new and ridiculous. I am a hard working person and very committed to doing a good job and she was very critical of everything I did. She felt threatened by my skills and knowledge."
bad,No work life balance. Poor managment. Lack of training. Very long hours and no balance.Nothing matters as much as your job. It is all about HNB. It is all about the bank.
bad,The manager's are constantly watching. No room for growth. Did not want to help move me forward ad I was a dedicated worker; Over 112 calls per day!!!
bad,"The location I was at was horrible. It was constantly busy, you could never get your training done like you were supposed to. Even the training was bad, I was not properly trained and because of that I did not do well at Huntington."
bad,"Working experience was okay, was good working with the group of people I trained with...But the one thing I hate about this company is I was told when I had my interview that I would receive a $500 bonus for telling someone about the job and they get hired and works a certain amount of days I would receive my bonus! That never happened! So I quit and was told because I quit I wouldn't get it! I was lied to!"
bad,"First off Huntington LOVES to tout how inclusive they are. Which is great if they really meant it. Higher ups send out revenue projection emails on how they will profit off of Pride and Pelotonia. "
bad,"Answering phones to talk to angry people about their money or the lack there of, Bank fees, up sell bank products, explain whats going on about their account."
bad,open longer than the average bank. does not have good training. forces you to have call night twice per week which is even longer hours. Managers only care about getting sales and not the customers.
bad,"They offer an assortment of benefits, and there is always a call center ready and available for both employees and customers."
bad,"I'm sure some people love working at Huntington, but I could hardly bare it.  I had some a phenomenal branch manager and 2 fantastic assistant managers while I was there, but upper management seemed completely out of touch and reluctant to give us what we needed to do our job.  I was at one of the instore branches that was extremely busy, and it seemed absolutely impossible to do my job.  Huntington instore churns through employees at a neck-breaking pace.  If you take a job at Huntington instore, DO NOT stop looking for work, you will not want to be here for more than a few months."
bad,"They'll treat you like a child.   Selectively enforce sales targets.   And generally make you feel expendable at every turn.   Sure, $11 an hour... I'd go with $9 any day to avoid this."
bad,There are a great deal of people working there with tremendous sales and service skills.  The work environment is positive however the sales incentive was challenging.
bad,"Long hours make it hard to maintain work-life balance. This bank is closing several locations in MI as they're failing and based out of Ohio. They will send you far for training, for days on end."
bad,District Manager preaches behaviors but does not execute on their own. No coaching. No one on ones. No communication unless they think someone is gossiping about them and thats the only time involvement is occurring within the banking center. Looks and speaks very polished but once you really look into the day to day behaviors actions do not line up with words being spoken. Lies about being in office visits and when you finally get in touch with them they claim they are in a meeting but their dog is barking in the background. Very manipulative and ruined the culture.
bad,"Since I left, management has changed. I department manager has been demoted. Unfortunately, it was a case of too little, too late. Too many good, skilled people were cast aside or transferred out of the department."
bad,"Good Job, on phone at all times. No much to it. There could be more benefits. I am happy with the incentives. They pay you monthly for selling"
bad,Busy fast paced heavy work load.  Must be able to multitask and work independently. to keep Loan Officers on task. Problem solve and complete loan documentataion for different clients at the same tim
bad,"My typical day at work was always pleasant with my customers. Of course  you had some who were not to happy but you have that with any career. It made me feel better once I was able to help them with why they were upset. I learned a lot in such a short period of time about banking. The hardest part of the job was when I had exhausted all my resources, guidelines and tools at my disposal and was not able to help someone. I have always loved sales but also kept in mind that I treat every person who I am helping like I would want to be treated."
bad,"good management team and job culture"
bad,"The manager was not professional. She did not create the conditions for a successful work, the team was gossiping and divided. The Upper management care even less. Full time people abused the system and were mostly working from home and/or spent a lot of time shopping or dining out."
bad,"They just started sending out new check machines to banks and I was the one that walked them through the setup, and made sure the machine was working,"
bad,A typical day at work is counting money from merchant deposit bags and waiting on customers with their deposits and payments and any customer issues they may have. Refer customers to personal bankers to open new accounts or apply for loans.Answer phones and let people into their safe deposit boxes. We also have to take quizzes and lessons on the computer to learn all the rules and regulations of the state and government when it involves any banking. I am responsible for balancing the vault and my cash box. At certain times I have to count the ATM and balance it.
bad,"For 20 years I worked for this company and in the past 5 years under new management the values of the employees was very poor and unappreciated. My department used to consist of 5 people they have eliminated 4 positions and I for the past 5 years I have been doing the job of a department of 5. In my position dealing with financial crimes, we all know crime is not getting better it's only getting worse. One person could not work proficiently in this position. I loved my job, I loved the people I worked with! But in my opinion it was unreasonable for one person to handle the job of 5 in a 40 hr. work week."
bad,"Hunningtion Bank acquired First Merit Bank.  I am hoping things have upgraded and changed, however, from corporate to branch management the atmosphere was extremely poor.  The branch was severely short staffed.  We never had adequate lunch breaks. Pressure sales.  Overworked and underpaid."
bad,"This is a nice pace to work if you work well under pressure. The call center has to work under specific goals that are sometimes a hard to reach . They want you to handle a phone call in under 4 minutes, which is okay for simple calls ,but for complicated calls its not obtainable. Customer service is something that shouldn't be timed, the customer is first and shouldn't feel rushed off the phone. I am a believer in one call resolution which is hard when you are pressured to hurry , meet other goals as well. Teamwork is a joke. Whenever you do reach out for help to solve a customers problem, nobody wants to help which causes your handle time to increase and now your manager is coaching you. Nobody ever wants to help and everyone is for themselves, its all about numbers and not customer service."
bad,"My time with huntington was bogged down with ineffective management and a lack of planning for the future of the bank.  during my time there, branches were being scheduled to close and people were being laid off constantly."
bad,"When Huntington was openign all of the In-store branches in the Meijers in michigan it was promising its new employees the world. 8K+ a year in bonus pay blah blah. As soon as they had the whole market staffed they cut incentive pay to nearly 0 and set the sales goals so impossibly high they literally are 0. You will work sundays and you will work nights, they dont care what you have going on."
bad,"Typical work day. Offer customers services they don't need. Always looking over my shoulder, because people are constantly quitting or getting fired. Management plays favorites & never wants anyone smarter or more talented than they are to advance. Compensation is terrible & way under the current market. Unless, they stole you from Chase."
bad,That Branch culture is all about sales and goals. Upper management lying to people to get what they want out of them. Ageism and verbal abuse at Branch Manger. When I was there brought HR into it with documentation and I had run out of patience with sales bring deverted to 20 something .  It Actually made my work environment worse. Another bank reached out create a position for my skill set.
bad,"They train you that it is all about doing the right thing for the customer but it is really all about Huntington’s bottom line. I met my sales goal every month but I was written up because I did the right thing for the customer instead of selling a certain product. The hours were crazy and it just wasn’t a great experience, I was happy to walk away."
bad,"During your interviews... that’s plural because there is multiple interviews to begin with. Along with months of training courses, they explain Huntington to be this wonderful work place, striving to be that employer we all hope for . Once you finally are on the job they do an awesome job shoving her head full of everything about making , which is great! Until you’re on the job and have no work experience using that knowledge.its so competitive and stressfull that I developed an ulcer due to abnormal stress."
bad,"They won’t tell you in your interview, but once hired you will have to drive about 1hr each way at least 5-7 times a month. This is for training purposes as well as so called “meetings” that could have been sent in a email. "
bad,"This company is a scam. they say one thing and do another. them trying to be a category of one company is a joke, comparing themselves to Starbucks,target,chase and amazon. they don't care about their employees, they are always closing branches or cutting incentive to try to figure out how to balance their books. they are playing with peoples lives like it is a joke. they bring people in from bigger banks and then completely screw them. management is a joke and completely unethical. you will get a break but be told that you need to stay in the branch because their is no staff even if you are not on company time during your break. please do yourself a favor and don't apply here."
bad,The category of one is only for customers and not all customers and really not for employees. Management will not have your back in certain situations and will protect themselves and not employees
bad,Managers exercise preferential treatment to certain individuals.  They are not supportive of employees concerns for improvements. During my time I witness many unethical practices that I brought to light and was not proactively addressed by management.
bad,"worked hard every day and contributed to the overall success of the branch, however never felt appreciated or recognized.  i was never paid for my referrals to the personal bankers and banking partners.  Passed over for promotions that were given to younger unqualified workers, lots of age bias.Very much underpaid for my years of experience.  Very poor management!!!!"
bad,Successful management on backs of professional team; undue pressure to produce short term results and no strategy; customer is not always well served.
bad,Management does not know what they are doing with all of the new changes. Its a guessing game. They have no clue what their long term strategy is. Our field is a dinosaur and they refuse to change.
bad,"They suck , they lay off people without any warning or freaking heads up .. terrible company  Waste of my time..  i worked there for a year and was treated with no respect when I was let go."
bad,They overwork you  and treat you awful while doing it. They never respect you and don't care if you are mistreated by your manager. They don't compensate you very well
bad,"I worked at Huntington for twenty three years it went from the best place to work to the worst. The facility department kept getting worse and worse. I'm just glad I was able to retire they kept wanting more and more and didn't want to pay the overtime but I  made them pay in the end and I hope I made it better for a lot of other people.The management was a lot of people with little experience, and thought they new it all."
bad,"A lot of the employees were great to work with, however at the branch I was employed with, our Manger and Assistant were rude, used their positions to try to intimidate you, and lacked professionalism when dealing with customer complaints. FirstMerit is very BIG on SALES, SALES, and more SALES, therefore causing customers to leave and go elsewhere. If we did not make our 25 referals per week, then we would either be made to stay over until 7:00PM (2 hours after closing time) to make calls, or be wrote up, which went against your LEADS (evaluation). On two occasions I was wrote up for clocking in late, which was due to Management showing up late, and upon hiring I was told to never enter the branch alone. One week our Assistant Manager was on vacation, and even though I was a Teller Level 1, I was to take over the vault and cash shipping/ordering for that week. After she came back from vacation, I was called into the office, and again wrote up for violating company policy because only Asssistant Managers, or Teller Level 3's can run vault. There were numerous times that Management would forget to complete Branch Capture for end of day reports, and I would receive telephone calls to go back to the branch, late at night, by myself to submit the report because Management couldn't be reached. I was cursed at by my Assistant for things I made mistakes on in areas where I was not properly trained, or showed one way, and then told another. I constantly walked on eggshells for a year, before I was called into the office, and was then introduced to a representative from HR, who explained"
bad,If you do not have an in with higher management you will not move up at Huntington Bank in the Cleveland area. It is sad to say I did not enjoy working for this company at all
bad,"Their are some wonderful managers, however, they all have to follow the role required. It is a stressful environment."
bad,"First Merit bought out Citizens Bank before they were ready. They had a very old system in place and no good staffing, especially for training. It was a very stressful workplace for everyone with poor management. I did learn how to work in a fast paced environment and multi-task. I also became an expert on patience and dealing with upset customers."
bad,Expectancy theory was broken over and over again. The amount of effort it took to get sales incentives sucked. They have no idea how to manage employees or managers. Everythign is decentralized causing chaos throughout. The actual workers were great but it was hard to motivate sice expectancy and equity was completly off. They should thank they lucky stars they are not sued for wrongful termination and ADA issues/
bad,you cant reach goals and the whole team has to anyway before you get paid anyway
bad,Not a very happy group of people. Manager seemed to have little control. Pay was minimal. Job was misrepresented.
bad,"It was a decent place to work . Good benefits, I did feel the pay was not competitive"
bad,I was wrongfully terminated after over 10 years of service due to the department placing ONLY ME on a bogus goal even though I was meeting my numbers. To make the matters worse I was also unfairly ranked and lost my position at the bank and was forced to step down even though HR knew I was being harassed and sabotaged by my manager and they even fired him due to this reason. There are many reasons why this happened to me which I wont post on here because I'm still working on some of these issues right now. I have to live everyday with this sadness. All I asked for was a severance package because I was unfairly ranked and they refuse. I also wanted to know why they ranked me so poorly and I still don't have the answer. I would not recommend any one to work at Huntington they don't take care of there employees and they are not truthful. I Had no performance issues and was a great asset to the company and this is how I was treated.
bad,"I was told that I was coming in to first merit to begin a long career. Turns out, they are moving my position to Flint, MI and only needed the group they hired in until December."
bad,The pay was awful at Huntington and there were little to no opportunities for advancement with in the local branches. The managers were catty and expected you to sell your self to the company to meet monthly goals yet gave no incentive to achieve them. Huntington bank is great to customers just not great for employees.
bad,"This could be a better work environment with better management, pretty good salary and benefits, if you don't mind a tough and stressful working environment."
bad,Company touts a great tag line and treats its customers well.  Employees not treated so well.  I liked the people and most peers but management is too concerned with politics and replacing the entire team with clones of themselves.
bad,"The managers are in it for themselves.  They attempt to promote a culture of ""colleague of one"" - but unless you are ""diversified"" then forget it. "
bad,"Dependent on the department, the work days are full, more work than hours in a day, which allows you to stay busy.  As a company, Huntington has pretty good benefits and they have a good CEO with a great vision.  If he can get his vision pushed down through the other levels of management, he will have one of the best companies to work for in Central Ohio.  Until then, the managers need training to properly manage people, as well as a diverse culture."
bad,"While I did enjoy my employment, it became more difficult for work/life balance. The attendance policy is fairly strict, with little forgiveness. The annual raises were just merit increases."
bad,Culture of fear; not progressive.  Senior management is not receptive and they will berate you when you leave.  They thrive on replacing automation with manual processes.
bad,"Not the place for you unless you can sell something to every customer you come in contact with. You will be put on an improvement plan for numbers as soon as you do not hit them. If you can sell, and hit numbers you will do fine ."
bad,"I worked in a couple of different business areas at Huntington. I was in retail at a branch receiving quarterly bonuses. Yes, that was nice however they stopped recognizing employees with over 100% scorecards if they were not in their top 3. We were told it was to make us more competitive. Our regional manager never recognized our branch with great customer service surveys but rejoiced at us finally getting a bad survey. "
bad,"I worked with this company for almost 20 years. I began when knowing who your customer was and knowing their name to a company who believed that only numbers mattered. I began as s Teller (customer service rep)  and worked my way up to an Assistant Manager (Personal Banker II). I loved what I did as far as helping my customers but that didn't seem to be enough. I would refund overdrafts or chat with my customer too much getting to know them, and their family, better to see where else I could help them. I didn't qualify for becoming s Msnager because I had no degree. However the person that was Manager, while she did have a degree knew nothing on how to interact with the customers. I was sad to leave my friends, co-workers, but very happy to leave this horrible company. Think twice before applying for any job within this company."
bad,Good job management is very risky and no work life balance at all. I dm is very not likeable at all he is very critical to employes.
bad,"Not enough help for what was expected."
bad,"Job was very easy; co-workers were great to work with but no one was happy, including myself with the compensation / benefits package. I exceeded all of my goals every month for the exception of October 2011.  I loved working with the customers and providing them with options to fit their needs. Job was very easy and I enjoyed it, I just could not afford working there due to the bonus plan was not what was described in the interview. The months I exceeded was not paid based on an single individual meeting their goals, I would show the gross higher based on exceeded goals but at pay out time it was much lower, I said nothing until after two months. At that time I was informed that if the entire office did not exceed goal there were deductions made  based on the store goal percentages regardless of one exceeding goals. When asked about the policy, my Branch Manager was unable to produce the document. "
bad,"What can I say about Huntington Bank? I had acquired a job at Huntington Bank for a part time position 25-29 hours a week, they assured me I would absolutely be able to keep my second job, and promised working two Saturdays on two Saturdays off. In a work place of 6 people, it was nothing but gossip all day long. I was not trained the full amount of time, or trained by anyone who was actually certified to train tellers.Most days I worked 7:30-6. I was there 6 weeks, after working 45 hours a week average ( 15-20) more than what I was hired for I, and also 4 Saturdays in a row I handed in my two weeks notice. It was a very unprofessional environment, with almost no option for upward advancement. The management was allowed to make mistakes, but came down hard on other employees when they did. I have held many jobs, and put everything I had into this one, but I honestly think they expect too much for too little."
bad,Huntington as a whole is a good company. As far as work/life balance there isn't any. The management is not concerned with you as an individual. The goals are extremely high and the expectations are unreasonable. Once you accomplish your goal for the month the next month is so stressful.
bad,I am a very positive oriented leader and was hired into a very negative environment. Every staff member was unhappy for one reason or another. I coached up or coached out as needed. The district manager was typically political but also meddlesome. For every step forward the branch would take the district manager would bring the branch back two steps.
bad,as a personal banker customer service was very important. making sure the customers were taken care of in a timely and very professional manner. Helping my customers was the best part of this job. Unfortunatley I was laid off from this company after a bank merger.
bad,The work place is unethical and the HR department is a joke. Most Managers are lazy and not knowledgeable at all. Huntington as a company really throws CSA workers out to wolfs to answer questions they haven’t gave you the answer to. Would be a better company if they had better leaders.
bad,I came to Huntington from another employer. I lost so much skill because I worked next to a banker that had been there for forever. I had to fight to get my initial raise and my manager never supported me because they could get their raise off the other banker. I ended up being a glorified teller. The favoritism is also aweful.
bad,"****Expectations vary largely on location****"
bad,"Unfortunately my experience in my department was very bad. The management was not helpful, the amount of stress they put on you is ridiculous, especially when there had been NO formal training and they left us to figure out our jobs for ourselves. You ask for help and training several times and then you just get ignored but when something goes bad you get in trouble for it, even though you asked for help. The benefits of the company were nice and so are the people but for the job itself it was not an enjoyable experience."
bad,a lot of turn over no work life balance management changes constantly no consistency of expectations compensation was good benefits were good too many hours
bad,"The banks keep selling out to each other and new managers all the time. The best thing is the time off"
bad,"Huntington is an excellent bank for their clients, but they do it at a great expense to their staff. The management isn't well trained and as a result much of the staff isn't well trained on understanding banking needs of the clients. "
bad,"The company on a whole, has a 'turn and burn', mentality. Burn and stress the employees, when they feel it, find a way to replace them. When an employee does all that the person can do, but the 'numbers' fall slightly short, said employee is then told to begin looking for another job.......HORRIBLE mentality for a company that only looks for numbers. It's another Wells Fargo,  disguised as a 'family institution'. Only wanting to occupy every financial and investment option of a person, on the FIRST interaction!! Forget building a relationship, earning trust. GET THAT WALLET is all that matters!!!"
bad,"Not enough experience between employees and higher management."
bad,"Company was all about the company and their employees were ""replaceable"". Nothing was ever sufficient. They took people with nearly no experience and put them in front of customers."
bad,"Face paced, extremely busy, easy to get overwhelmed in a stressful environment. Management can belittle & not be very accommodating even to the most  prompt, reliable, dependable employee. You are lucky if you get 30mins of your 1hr lunch, no breaks ,must harass customers to meet goals, So much expected of each banker & they promote completion ,not teamwork. Penalties if goals are not met & threats of job loss is a constant to remind us to sell .When approach with threats of being harassed by another employee ,management does not take seriously & would not honor transfer requests ."
bad,"I am working so many hours because my branch is short staffed...I have been demoted even though I was hired as a Banker because apparently my branch is not supposed to have two bankers,,I am so unhappy with this Company!"
bad,"I worked for firstmerit bank for 6 years in different departments and different branches, hoping it would get better. My last position was a lead teller and we had no staff, worked 8-6 almost every day, it was stressful and i had to do so many audits monthly and pressure to get checking accounts, credit cards and savings accounts open (sales). Tellers get 10.00 a hour and leads get about 11.50. It's not worth how much work u put in. Probably why some tellers and bankers are lazy."
bad,line of work was not in my interest. It did teach me valuable sales presentation skills but not a great environment to work.
bad,I worked in several departments. Some had good training and a nice work environment. Others had poor training and a very high turn over. Some of the managers were hard to work for. Each department ran differently. some had good training and were fair to employees. Other departments had poor training and a high turnover.
bad,"co-workers are friendly, but the job consists of continous cold-calling due to minimal visibility in market. Constant pressure to hit goals."
bad,I thought it would be a great company to work for with opportunities to advance. That was not true.
bad,"Working at FirstMerit on a daily basis involved many different hats and the ability to work with a ""micro"" manager and co worker each and everyday!  They do not provide tools to assist you in advancement they want you to stay in your current position. Worked with customers all day and transactions to customers satisfaction."
bad,"I have worked for this company less than a year and had heard all the rumors that not many last. I was promised in the beginning that I could advance being a banker by getting my series 6 & 63 but 6 months later when I brought this up to management I was turned down due to the merge of the company with another company. If you are promised something when you are first hired, get it in writing! Also, my manager was late almost every single day and it was always a new excuse but since they were salary it didn't affect them, only me! There is no communication between mangers and bankers. You are just told to do better but manager doesn't set goals to do that even after you ask. If you’re working at an in-store location make sure you don’t have a life outside of work because with getting out at 7:30pm during the week and working Saturdays and Sundays you can't have a life. Manager will switch the schedule last minute and you may have the weekend off but the next day they need you to work. I didn’t mine people missing work due to sickness but when I’m told I have to cover them and if I don’t it will be a no- call/ no- show it makes me feel like a slave. I have had my schedule switched so many times in the past month that I realized I have worked the last 5 weeks and my manager has taken every one of them off. Issues have been adding up and this topped it off and my 2 week notice was in the next day. Thank you First Merit for teaching me what warning signs to look for in my new job to make sure I’m not get the butt end of everything. "
bad,"I worked for Huntingtong for 10 years I recieved outstanding reviews and merit increases untill the last year and a half, we got a new Asst. Manager that hewrslef was (demoted or steped down) and she made life miserable for everyone in the office."
bad,"Have not worked for them in over 7 years. When I was employed there in the In-Store enviroment, sales was the sole purpose of the job. Promotion opportunities were only available if you were a top producer."
bad,"I was only here as a temp job-but I didn't care for it at all. The training was terrible, and when I got to corp. office I have never been in such a dirty building-"
bad,"Caught management talking about new employees in a bad way all the time. They didnt care that I had a child or illness, they went above and beyond to make sure I was NOT accomodated. I was harassed during my bathroom breaks while my boss would send people in after me or yell from the hall. I've never hated working somewhere so much. They give you unrealistic goals based on poor training"
bad,Huntington bought First Merit and a bunch of good people were screwed out of jobs. Bottom line is all big business cares about is money. Happy to leave and move forward
bad,Very slow paced environment. Not my ideal location to work if you have a family and bills to pay on a regular basis. Not enough room to grow within the call center.
bad,Upper management lack of understanding of the specific business I dealt with made it hard to progress as a department and on an individual level. Corporation wide it seemed a good company.
bad,"I worked with a good group of men, had a lot of laughs, but the job was ok. We enjoyed the perks of the Bank, luncheons, bonuses, etc."
bad,"Ummm... So, it was like there was OnBase but only the Sages and Wizards knew where it was hidden within the secret servers that needed special access permission to be granted by am act of congress"
bad,is when you're able to assist a customer professionally and in a timely manner that makes the customer trust you with their account ad request your help.
bad,Good work environment. The job is stressful and the caseload is high. Supportive supervisors help the team. The job is naturally stressful but the pay is good.
bad,Well ...i did not have a good experience with my manager. My entire team left the company for other opportunities. Intense work life....and very bad work life balance.
bad,"Fast paced, friendly customers, learned the basics of banking, management was unreliable and  blamed employees for computer problems that caused overages/outages on drawer that was later found. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the different customers."
bad,"So far anything good about HNB is the competitive pay. However with the recent conversion between First Merit and HNB, it is clear that they no longer have a focus in the chicagoland region. Many managers are on the hot seat and employee turnover is steadily increasing. This would be a great company to work for if not for the recent conversion. Leadership should focus on what thing at a time.Current manager changes our branches focus every other day and it is frustrating."
bad,"•	Provided customers with their account balances  "
bad,Working in an in-store environment is stressful. No work/life balance. The sales goals are unreasonable and unlikely to meet.
bad,"its ok, and you answer phone calls all day, have breaks and lunches, and then leave for the day and you clock in and out."
bad,I learned a lot of customer service skills working for First Merit. The job was decent for a temporary position because there wasn't much opportunity to be promoted.
bad,"Lead teller was indifferent about a lot of issues in the bank. She regularly fought with her ex- husband over the phone in the back room and screamed at him so loud that customers heard it. She also told a potential customer that if he wanted to open a saving account that she could open her purse and he could put his savings there. One of the Level 2 tellers showed up late to work because she was getting her makeup done by a friend that was applying for a job as a makeup artist. Another Level 2 teller took a picture of $4000 in cash and posted it to Instagram. All 3 tellers were often snotty to customers. Personal banker was an expert at making all of the women feel completely uncomfortable with unwanted advances and the branch manager seems completely confused at times, but he was nice. The only saving grace for this establishment were the CPD officers that would come in and guard the bank. They were awesome. Other than that, gut the entire staff and start over with this place."
bad,"I learned a lot about banking and how deposits work, I learned about the holding period for transaction. Working here for a short period of time taught me how to manage my money better"
bad,"The service is pretty awful and therefore, most phones you will sell will have issues."
bad,"This job has helped me strengthen my customer service and team work. I have learned to prioritize all daily activities to succeed. I have developed many relationships with clients that keep them returning for me to offer solutions for their everyday life. At times boundaryless communication has been a struggle; concerns about staffing, branch needs, and improved processing are set aside by members of the management team."
bad,"A typical day began with reviewing customer accounts, cold-calling on a hot-list of prospective customers, assisting new customers with accounts and cross-selling additional products"
bad,"When I first started working there they had the mentality of a smaller regional bank: customer service, fairness, and doing what's right for the customer. As more time passed corporate culture changed to that of a larger national bank: fee customers as much as possible, sell products that customers don't need to help the bank's bottom line, and always operating understaffed. By the time I parted ways with the company, my job description was sell as many products as possible no matter if they're beneficial or not. Management would punish employees by making us stay late to make sales calls if we did not set a certain number of sales appointments for each week. I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,Would not recommend. The culture of the workplace is not inviting or friendly.
bad,"I had a very difficult supervisor that wouldn't help you if you asked her, she spent numerous hours on the phone with personal friends. She avoided talking to customers. Though I learned alot about customer service and had alot of friendly customers that it was a joy to get to know them. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with my supervisor on a daily basis. She was mean and nasty all the time."
bad,"The job itself of being a Bank Teller is great, you get to meet and help great customers. The management of this entire company from top to bottom is awful. Everyone is a micro-manager, you’re constantly criticized based on how many product sales you got in a day when they claim to only want you to focus on good customer service."
bad,Low pay!! Spend the majority of your day at the teller line especially if you work at a slower branch. Not a lot of opportunity to learn if you're in a slower branch/low income area. Surprised that there have been times that I have stayed later than 5:30 pm with balancing at the end of the day.  Its nice that everyone is welcoming and expect that you welcome EVERY single customer when they walk in. but that can be overkill at times especially if you are working with a customer at the teller line. Thought I would enjoy this role more.
bad,"Very top heavy on management, with multiple managers not not knowing the entirety of there reaponsabilties within the organization. Poor communication skills displayed from top-level management, leaving many departments working towards completely diffeener goals and missions opposing each other. Additionally, due to close proximity to a corporate chase location, Huntington has a habit of hiring managers that wash out of chase an are unable to comprehend the  different strategies between a national and regional bank, often time working towards risk appetites and goals seperate to that of Huntington."
bad,"Overall the company's culture was one that I was 100% percent on board with and wouldn't be sad to work for them in a different capacity. But I was unfortunately placed in a location with a terrible manager and after reporting issues to HR, was lied to and forced out. Other bankers had different experiences at different locations but vacancies for jobs like these are rarely due to people moving up."
bad,Manager was a terrible person and she is still there!!! I started with 7 wonderful women and worked their for a 3 yrs now there is only 1 left if that tells u anything!!!!
bad,"I had no work life balance and no management support. We were always short staffed. The hours were long. Training wasn't always detailed enough, so it was difficult to apply things in the branch."
bad,Huntington supports a division between the business and IT.  Project managers are encouraged to align with the needs of IT instead of solving the problems for the enterprise.  The project managers report to the technical sponsors which puts them into a conclusive conflict of interest.  The technical staff and technical managers don't respect the need for information from the team to adequately run the project.
bad,Huntington does not properly train you completely. Huntington trains you enough to say they did but there is no follow through to ensure you were trained enough to do your job properly.
bad,"The family not a file culture preached by upper management is incorrect and does not correlate to how files are managed. Communication between any management and direct reports is extremely poor, and job guidelines are not clear"
bad,"Huntington has a mission statement, and all of those that buy in, buy in big time. This would be a great place to work if you have a high motor of energy, and don’t really have a life outside of work. If you have a family, or if work is not your main priority in life, it’s definitely not for you. Management act like a bunch of Huntington robots that spew the company lingo and want you to talk to customers like pre programmed androids. Meanwhile, you could provide excellent customer service, but if you’re not selling well, it’s a problem. Banking is sales, but they never tell you that from the jump."
bad,"Huntington offered great compensation, however lacked in other areas of importance (those being work/life balance and less than impressive leadership). Although there were some negatives, there was a lot for me to take away from this experience. Notably, how to work as an independent and how to think outside of the box when it came to problem solving. The job role itself was quite enjoyable, however there seemed to be a disconnect between upper leadership and hourly employees. I would recommend this position to someone looking to get their foot in the door in the world of banking, probably not so much so to an experienced banker."
bad,Management is cut-throat. SALES SALES AND MORE SALES. Higher ups will find ways to get rid of you if not making sales. Tellers do not matter to managers. Good sales process
bad,Firstmerit was a company with offices in Ohio and Chicago - acquired by Huntington Bank in the past few years.  Culture changed over time and opportunities for advancement were limited due to the size of the company.
bad,"Higher ups are constantly sending out emails and calling out employees that are doing something wrong.. instead of focusing on what's right. Awful hours (in stores) back stabbed. Still employed.. put in my two weeks.  Pushy, sales motivated, revenu driven, not good"
bad,High stress job. I started drinking everyday when I worked there. They say they care about their customers and employees but there a lot of pressure on both. Sales goals go up every month no matter how long you work there. Sell sell sell ok great but how will I find the time to help the customer in an average of two minutes per customer with an average of a 100 calls in a day. Great benefits and compensation for sales. Base pay is Low for how hard you work.
bad,the company when I first worked their was awesome. It had an amazing culture and we had a wonderful tight knit group to work with and we became friends. Things have change recently where they are more concerned about your work there and the numbers and less about work life balance. I believe I was discriminated against and was happy to leave because the culture had changed.
bad,"Career advancement options are suspect to current employees. Many commitments are not carried out. Expectations are hammered home, while results are largely ignored."
bad,"I worked with Huntington for a few years, customers were great, uniforms were nice (although you buy them with your money and you must return them when you leave, odd you are forced to give them stuff you buy) . Flint area grew when they bought more locations. Company is all sales and they do not care how you get sales.  Area Management is horrible and not professional. You would have thought our Top management would have saw this. You do and say what Your told no matter what, they don’t listen to feedback and if you give them feedback it’s always bad.  We all felt bad for people in Burton, Davison locations area management was horrible, not fair, and your job would be on the line if you didn’t tell their boss what you were told (many lies)... but do you need your job? The company Direction is not always what your district will be.  You better sell sell sell or ready to be lectured. Get people in debt so they need you is what you here"
bad,the job was just ok management was too micro managing for me. They overwork and strive to please customers that are ungrateful and displeasing. I couldnt deal
bad,"the company as a whole is a good company to work for. Now which branch you work at will make or break your experience. Specifically the traditional branch in Solon Ohio is a horrible branch to work at. Management there is disrespectful, nonexistent, and nothing but drama. If you enjoy being put down and not trained then this is the branch for you."
bad,"It was alright, nothing to write home about. It was a contract position for me and at the end of it, my manager had no idea that I closed more tickets than any of the current techs."
bad,"You are only as good as your last sale. Bad managers getting promoted and some are on serious power trips.If they don't like you then good luck making over 1 year. Anyone over 25, I would not suggest this job."
bad,unfair lending practices. work life balance was poor.  job was fun in beginning.
bad,"Transferred from a part time position at a branch I was totally appreciated at but did not get adequate training, to a full time position at a branch that I never felt appreciated or a part of the ""team"".  Was getting singled out & written up until got fired after 3 1/2 years unjustly. Had earned an incentive which they did not pay me even tho it was earned 3 months before my termination!! Needless to say I would not recommend Huntington as a bank or employer!!"
bad,"Huntington is a great place to work work your resume, but keep looking. Management is set with no need for new blood."
bad,"Customer service. Checking accounts, loans assisting customers in finding products to better serve their needs"
bad,The jury is still out= Good company but needs more diversity and inclusion. They want to be in category of one and have made many strides but they have a long way to go.  The top down is mostly white males and that is not good when you can not identify yourself moving up in a company that so called promotes diversity.
bad,The hardest part of the job was not making enough to pay my bills and being overlooked for certain positions because the area you worked needed you at that branch and they would find a reason not to advance you to a better position. Listening to how a whole department was pink-slipped without warning just to implement a lousy system that created more problems than it did eliminating them and then wondering when you are next. They even terminated the manager because he stuck up for me when I expressed the reason I was terminated was not because of the over/short policy but because the system was unreliable and they would rather get rid of those who had a problem with it rather than pull it until you find a better program!!
bad,They never provided you with enough staff and then expect you to stay late every night to get done the work of 6 people with only 2 or 3 people. They want you to be a category of one culture but the gossip and “clicks” are ridiculous. I felt like I was in high school again and being bullied by management.
bad,"Hours are great, but the job is repetitive. After 3 months I am bored with my work because you never see the end result of the job you start. Sales, sales sales."
bad,"At Huntington, you sell or you don't have a job. As a personal banker, you have a required sales minimum. They are a good company in that you have a good number of paid vacation days and good benefits, but if you don't focus fully on sales, they will find someone who does."
bad,"A typical day consists of managing a team of investigators, who at most times are frustrated due to the lack of consistency within the department regarding procedures and guidelines. I have learned much since staying on with HNB; however, it is not always easy due to the various opinions and processes of seasoned HNB employees who seem to do things their own way, but are always referring people to read procedures, which doesn't appear to be followed consistently. Since the merger of FirstMerit Bank and Huntington, morale has dropped considerably and employees who once exceeded their daily work expectations are now failing at their job and seeking outside employment. The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone positive, as their is no incentive to want to excel when perks have been taken away, but expectations have increased. Unfortunately at the moment, there isn't much that is enjoyable about going to work each day."
bad,Very manual and out-of-date processes.  Many lay-offs occurring since the merger with Firstmerit.  No consideration for established employees as far as securing another position within the company.
bad,"the most enjoyable part of my job was working with clients and helping them with their financial needs."
bad,"Some love it, some do not... I really do not have much to say because the experience really has to do much with who you are at FirstMerit. This will hopefully improve as they become Huntington National Bank. Very little diversity & inclusion within the organization."
bad,"I liked working with the people. A lot of them were really nice."
bad,very customer friendly bank but hard to find work life balance
bad,The boss had a favorite and was rude and very obnoxious about going out of his way to talk to everyone but me. He made he feel terrible and not wanting to go into work
bad,"The job its self isn't hard but the equipment is outdated and can quite  working. This can make whichever job you may have very difficult. The people that I worked with were amazing including my immediate manager's. Anyone past that were detached number puncher's that didn't really care about us, only the number's and where we were with the base lines. Also if you are looking to get up and out think again because promotions are defiantly a who you know and or what kind of numbers you have bases.  It was surly very different than what I expected it to be from Huntington, not the family focus we're in this together speak they give you when you start."
bad,I worked here for 7 years it was a great company! The larger they became they less they cared about work life balance and the employees as individuals
bad,"The best part of my job is the work from home option, 3 days out the week and the flexibility. I work in an operations so procedures are gathered from mistakes; which is discouraging because this teaches the employee to be more paranoid."
bad,"Huntington’s grocery store branches are unable to retain employees and are therefore constantly understaffed. Rather than asking themselves why people keep leaving and what could be done to prevent it, management demands more from employees to cover for the losses in staff."
bad,"Standing for 8+ hours every single day, pushing customers into sales that are border line harassment to meet a ""sales goal"", life gets worse if your other co-workers are not willing to work or help. Management was surprisingly as helpful as could be with the given circumstances. They are put under the same sales pressure from their bosses and so on and so forth. They don't succeed if you don't. How ever the Meijer locations feels like where you go to die, so to speak. Ive been gone a year and that location has turned over probably 5 different new employees since. Just know you are a cog in a corporation and you'll do just fine."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 1/2 years. They were purchased by Huntington Bank. When this occurred, the department I worked in was let go. We were given over 9 months from the time we were told that were being let go. I felt this was only to use the department to get through a conversion."
bad,"Huntington is a good company, however management is too concerned about sales than their employees. They claim that we do whats best for the customer, however, if you don't make goal, its a big deal."
bad,"I think they have a core problem, someone in a key role within the management leadership of the company. I didn't expect to leave but the management had replaced and they didn't hire people they would have to pay for there worth, instead toook the cheap approach to save money on rebuild after first merit purchase."
bad,"Long working hours, good benefits, below average training, great company culture outside of the branches, good room for advancement, nothing more to say."
bad,There is to much micro management. They don't care about their employees and they have even said so. Some of the head bosses are 2 faced. I enjoyed being a vault teller. I love the employees I work with. It's usually face paced and busy there which I like. I don't like how money hungry the company is.
bad,Overall I think the company is wonderful but the leadership and management skills that I had personal experience with was quite literally disgusting. Total disregard for working moms and women in general.
bad,Too much of the daily routine is focused on finding things to do versus being focused on your main task. Management is highly demanding in impossible ways.
bad,"I like Huntington very much as a company and still bank there."
bad,"Overall easy job, management is not very helpful. Don't expect to get hired in full-time. Bank needs major updates to keep up with newer banks, systems are old."
bad,"I have learned how to use mailing machines and Track-point software. Co-workers are easy to work with. Hardest part of the job are the hours, i only work 5hrs a day, would love more but so much is changing in the banking world that they can not offer me more. "
bad,Being in the financial field at  lower level position can be very very stressful. Huntington cares about their employess to a certain degree but tellers are not really paid well...I would never go back. Thankfully i had a great mgr that made it easy to work for.
bad,"Good place to start working, but now as a full career.  The salary is not current with today's work force.  My branch had poor management.  There were too many daily rules that did not have anything to do with the work day."
bad,"Great people to work with, great managers. Good hours, do not have to work overtime but a lot offered if you want it.  Too sales driven and sales goal orientated."
bad,"Even though our Branch Manager was investigated along with the ""Investment Advisor"" for fraudulant activity she remained at the Chesterland Branch.  He was let go.  "
bad,"It was fast paced environment"
bad,"very nice pto policies, health benefits were available for part time employees, hourly salaries were not sufficient for the responsibility you had, did not adequately provide protection against armed robberies"
bad,"Working here was a very high level stressed job. Being that is a bank, you had to always be high sense of alert. I was always on egg shells making sure that I wouldn't cash a bad check or give out the wrong am out of money etc. One thing I really  wasn't a fan of was trying to get customers to obtain different services that the bank had to offer. Most of the customers had been members for years and wanted exactly what they had."
bad,The decision is not to advise of any Negative thoughts and keep them from being projected in this review.  So no further comment will be offered on this company.
bad,Its a high stress job because often sales goals are quite a challenge but overall the company is decent to the employees if you do your job properly..
bad,"A typical work day includes angry customers, disorganized work space and short staff. I learned how to do the Teller Supervisor position minus the pay. For a place with only three management positions I saw 11 different managers in two years. The training is minimal and the staff was mostly very young and not very hard working. The hardest part of the job was that none of our management team was on the same page about anything all the way from corporate to in store. The best part of the job was the set schedule of operations, I enjoy working first shift and no Sunday's. This is only concerning one branch but I have heard about others operation generally the same."
bad,I had a very enjoyable and pleasant time when I worked at Huntington National Bank.  The bank is very customer and customer friendly.
bad,The commercial lending aspect of banking is very different from residential.  I learned an abundance of different information everyday.  I enjoyed working with the different lines of business in order to close a loan.  I was very involved in the process from processing the loan all the way to post closing..
bad,"Miscommunication in regards to policy and procedure, Lack of Staffing, Bad Management Team, High Stress Work Environment, No Breaks for Lunch or Restroom Use"
bad,"lack computer technology to complete daily functions, led to a frustrations. Great bunch of people to work with though."
bad,"Long hours, Management doesn't help you unless your a male."
bad,Answer between 115 and 130 calls a day answer questions about the company products and helping bettering customers banking experience
bad,I loved my job. I loved working with the clients in the branches. What i didn't love was the mind numbing stupidity of the management. Everything is a dumpster fire that needs put out right away. They have no idea how to manage a sales force. They solely rely on upselling current bank clients and put no emphasis on finding new clients.
bad,"waiting customer, making transactions, balancing cash drawer and making sales"
bad,"A good place for a quality of life job, not a career. Co-workers are friendly but there is a lot of gossiping that goes on in the bank. FirstMerit is very resistant to change and the lack of technology is extremely frustrating."
bad,"The bank teller position is very stressful . I was also a float teller and would have to be at different branches through out the week , this had plus and minuses."
bad,"They do a great job with customer service. Unfortunately, they have poor manager skills when it comes to coaching and guiding. Takes a long time to get familiar with the banking world."
bad,"I was recently hired as a Universal Banker. Was very happy with the offer that was given. I had recently quit smoking which I did reveal to the Branch Manager but, it did come up on my nicotine test as positive. I was immediately dismissed. I understand that Huntington is smoke free however I would have appreciated retesting at my own expense. I am confident that my nicotine test would have been negative. I understand its more cost effective on their health insurance however, what would you say to an obese person? You can become diabetic, suffer a stroke, or even heart disease. My question is where do they draw the line?"
bad,"loved everything about the job except goals that had t be met."
good,I use to truly enjoy working for Huntington until our new Manager came. This is not the place to work when you have younger children who need you. They are not considerate when you have to call off for an emergency.
good,"I’ve worked at huntington for multiple years with no help for advancement and career growth. The managers there sit on their phones all day, and it’s really all about who you know, not what you know. They are informal, and disrespectful towards customers that are combative with their policies. I also don’t agree with how they talk about their customers through “skype.”"
good,"This place has a culture of different rules for different people and lots of empty promises.  This is only my experience, it may not be that way on other teams or in other departments. The health benefits were not great, very expensive and had to pay to park and use personal devices to do work without any compensation."
good,"Huntington CAN be an enjoyable place to work. However, if you end up at the wrong branch with uncaring management, you are made to choose between your job and family. The hardest part is talking people into referrals unless you are excellent at lying to your customers. Be prepared to to the job of three people because it it severely understaffed."
good,This company typically want to you stay in your postion if you are doing well in it. Career advancementis not the goal of or the culture of HNB.
good,"Working at Huntington in their branches will leave you vastly overworked, underpaid, and stressed out. Policies are constantly changing, and their sales models change arbitrarily. As a branch service manager who will be responsible for not only the teller line, coaching junior employees, branch operations, and sales referrals to bankers, you will also most likely be an administrative assistant to the branch manager. The company does have a good culture, they are inclusive and open to all, but they have a very long way to go before they can be considered a category of one company; especially in the pay. Branch service managers who are responsible for the operation of the branch are HORRIBLY underpaid, in fact they are paid less than the bankers whose only job is to sell to customers. They eliminated the ONE nice thing for BSM's as far as incentive goes, and gave it to the bankers. So in addition to being underpaid, your quarterly incentive is a fifth of what the banker's is, and for all of those referrals you're sending over to the bankers, i.e. basically feeding the bankers their sales, you will receive ZERO compensation.  On top of all of this, you can receive a glowing review come year end and still only get a 2% raise, a raise that doesn't even cover the cost of living increase. The decisions made by the HR department also seem arbitrary, as someone who has SEVERAL write-ups, is on a Personal Improvement Plan, and is still not performing their job and is also causing trouble in the branch will not be fired, but someone who has never had a write-up, PIP, and has had glowing"
good,"I worked in the in-store program. At the four different branches I worked for, short staffing was a consistent issue. Made for long work days, and consistently having to pick up slack for other people. Management is to be desired, there are a few great managers, but they usually leave to work for better companies."
good,"management was not supportive, very pushy and job threatening for not getting referrals. money hungry company with little regard for employees. unnecessary to be open until 6 on fridays"
good,Very focused on reducing expenses and competing with larger banks.  Success is largely based on who you know at this firm and less on what you bring to the table.
good,I learned a lot at this company but once management change and they relocated us everything changed. Promises were made and never kept. It is not that bad if you are not an off shift worker however if you are your shift seems to be forgotten about all the time and your problem don't seem to matter all that much.
good,Working for Huntington is okay. No room for advancement once you hit your 1 yr mark and become knowledge on procedures. Pay is horrible in retail can barely support yourself.  High turnover rate in retail and managers try to keep you in your position for years before you can advance within the company. Some mangers don't give you the support you want. Some managers throw tasks on you without you knowing how to do them so you have to ask seasoned coworkers to help you. Your required to hit your goals for the month or you will get written up after a few talks with management. Huntington does offer good benefits.
good,"A typical day is running an overdraft report, filing. Do data entry, send or pay bills, prepare mailings, things that are more routine. This is a good time to get routine jobs complete."
good, 
good,"Worked as an assistant manger for 6 months in their new in-store program, I left Chase bank to work here excellent pay horrible hours only 4 holidays off and branch is open 8-8 which was the schedule I work majority of days. We were terribly understaffed and upper management just expected you to deal with it. Turn over is insane in the time I was there at least 5 people quit with in their first 3 months and at least 6 people were fired in that same time frame."
good,"This is cold calling current Huntington customers for home equity lines of credit (PCL-personal credit line, in Huntington lingo). The leads are recycled every few months, so customers have often been contacted recently and are annoyed by your call. You churn thru 80-100+ calls a day and occasionally get lucky, but they also offer the most convoluted compensation plan that I’ve ever seen. Aside from that, the management team is not at all trusting of their employees and it’s nothing more than a “watching over your shoulder” outbound call center environment. Keep looking "
good,"Continually adding in ""outside of work"" hours for call nights on Tuesdays til 7 pm and coming in on Saturdays for 2 hours of calling on the weekend. Harsh sales goals. A branch with hardly any foot traffic and one with much are the same goals making it hard for smaller branches to achieve anything."
good,"It's is a great place to work...but you will have to work...dealing with the public, having to be able to take care of people. Work as an Branch Service Manger...responsible for the teller line."
good,I'm sure the bank as a whole is a great company to work for but at the local level I was not treated well and was very under appreciated as an employess.
good,Management was absolutely terrible! I worked in Charleston WV..and your over worked! Nothing was ever good enough! They made my pregnancy stressful once I got pregnant! Even fought me having a chair!
good,"Huntington National Bank is a great place to work. The atmosphere is professional and the people are great. During a typical day of work, knowledge is constantly being obtained. The intricacies of banking are really taught on a day to day basis."
good,"The duties of a personal banker include recruiting and retaining customers, opening new deposit accounts and cross selling additional products. Acquiring new loans and investment accounts, Mortgage referrals and covering the duties of the tellers."
good,"I loved my position and how I was able to build great relationships with the customers. What I learned is Huntington focused on sell, sell, sell, the high dollar customers, and pushing products. If you don't push products you don't make it with this company. That great customer service, being reliable, punctual, compassionate and a team player, is not the employee they are looking for.  Management, has a lot to learn about  being professional and helping their employees. Hardest part of the job was the goals and how they paid on products you sold to meet that dollar goal. There are employees that will succeed at this and their are ones that won't be sells people and no matter how you look at it, you are selling!!!! The most enjoyable part was the customers, helping people to reach their financial goals. Or figuring out how to make it through a hardship. Its about the customers not about selling another product. Sometimes a product can be sold to help but not always."
good,"Very tight credit culture; difficult to get approval for new business and hit goals.  Focused on minimizing credit losses, as opposed to new business development."
good,"My experience is with recruiters and management not promoting base on qualifications, skills and experience but based on who you know. There is not structured training."
good,Long hours as a manager. Little help when short staffed and micromanaging by managers at the district level. Good 401k matching. That's all that I have
good,A typical day depends on your customers. Mostly not well. I did learn everything I need to know about banking. Management is a laugh. The hardest part is making sure that the people that have been there longer than you actually do their job in compliance with the legal and company rules and regulations!!! The most enjoyable part was making customers lives better.
good,"Management was do as I say not as I do. Not at all a nice person. We just didn't like each other. She called me into her office on a daily basis for using ""Slang"" I asked someone for their Sos.Social security number. Everyday it was something new and ridiculous. I am a hard working person and very committed to doing a good job and she was very critical of everything I did. She felt threatened by my skills and knowledge."
good,Huntington is ok to work for I don't like that they don't fix problems you have tabs only the ones they want get promoted even if there is a better fit for someone else
good,I work in the mortgage vault with one other coworker. I learned how to multitask and meet deadlines everyday. Great understanding management.
good,"Working with Huntington National Bank in Toledo, Ohio was a great experience. I learned all that I know about banking from there."
good,The specific branch didnt care about their employees and never stayed an entire shift. no coaching. Branch manager was a terrible person and couldnt be bothered to help anyone advance.
good,Typical day was to process any and all transactions for customers. Balance every morning and night along with balancing our vault.
good,"In 9 months I had 3 different managers due to turnover.  My on-boarding experience was terrible, and made it extremely difficult to learn my job the right way (which I am happy to say that they ARE working to fix this).  In-store is a very inconsistent environment right now. Turnover is 60% and most employees do not make it to 6 months with that position. Those numbers are scaring the company finally and they ARE working to do something about it, it was just too late to keep my attention.  Unfortunately due to the work/life balance, poor training, and inconsistency amongst the company, they have lost many great employees over the past several months."
good,A large part of their call center did not have the proper working systems. Either you were showing logged in late or not showing logged in at all. Even if you are taking calls.
good,Was ok working for Huntington. Cheap on Salary. Ok in Benefits. Some opportunity in growth.
good,This job is a great step towards building your resume and gaining some professional workplace experience. I do not recommend it as a permanent career path unless you are interested in management or have a strong passion for banking. You have to be prepared to self-train and the culture can be quite stiff. They tell you that you have a support staff but you are essentially on your own.
good,Very fast paced work environment focusing on sales.  Clothing allowance and community involvement is one thing that is encouraged and taken very serious. Training provided.
good,"I was let go from the company a few days ago - completely blindsided from a minor mistake I made the month before. I opened a checking account with an expired ID. Mind you I have opened hundreds over 400 kinds of accounts in a six month period. According the quarterly sales, I was the top banker out of 40 in terms of revenue gained. In all humility I had no problem admitting to making a mistake, however I had to first realize where I may had made a mistake, and all the while I felt I had to deny doing so at risk of being let go (talk about a double-edged sword). Once I began to inquire about the possibility of advancement, it was all downhill from there. "
good,Huntington always pushed sales and at times not for the benefit of the customer. They are a political management and even when prof was given of an unprofessional racist manager they still covered it up and moved her to different branches that her than firing her because she brought in sales even though it was at times not for the benefit for the customers
good,Only move up if you are a man. Women work extremely hard just to get noticed there.  Lies are told about opportunities for advancement but advancement has already been decided before jobs are even posted.
good,"The regional manager that was in office during my time there, was not the right person for the job, she might have had all the right paperwork but her attitude and willingness to help were not there, she would lie to employees blaming her direct employees for issues that are out of our control.."
good,Huntinton was a good place to work. as with all. companies there are internal issues with staff. i could go on an on but I will leave it at the bank itswlf is great.
good,"Huntington Bank makes it public in the credit & collection side of their business that they prefer to hire waiters/bartenders etc. with a preference of hiring individuals with no collection or banking experience. End result is a unit that doesn't have the ability to think through situations and provide the best resolution for customers. Philosophy is ""regardless of the situation, get customer to agree to your options or transfer to another department"". Process resulted in customers being transferred over and over with little chance of getting issues addressed. Each department is only concerned with their function and this is the structure as employees are never trained to understand the workings of a financial institution."
good,Working for Huntington was fun however the management is absolutely terrible & uncomfortable. The job itself is amazing & fun but the managemnfenf & communcation they should have with their co workers is terrible.
good,"I liked my job at the Huntington call center, I like my co workers, "
good,"At the branch I was at, there was no team attitude. It was everyone for themselves to get sales even if it meant hurting someone else. There is lots of cold calls involved if you are a personal banker/branch relationship banker."
good,They cheat you on commission and pressure you into making sales with no encouragement only threats. When 1st starting they will make you feel important and that they’re happy to have you but then will flip the switch once you start.
good,Stressful n depressing. Not really a good place unless you like the stress then it's for you. Too many high demands with no time at all to accomplish.
good,A typical day at work would be fast paced and pretty busy. I enjoyed the lunch breaks and getting to know my coworkers. The hardest part about this job was getting difficult customers.
good,First Merit acquired Citizens Republic Bank Corp in October of 2013.  The transition was extremely challenging as conversion from one system to the other was not executed as well as anyone would have hope.  Many customers loss as a result.
good,"I used to like my job, as I was given much latitude with how I support my application systems. Somewhere along the line, the management placed more emphases on the BAs and the developers are told to get directions from the BAs, which was hard to do, as most of the BAs lacked technical knowledge."
good,"This company does not know how to deal with personnel issues. When ever a department does not like someone, they write glowing recommendations about them so they get promoted and become someone else's problem."
good,Very prejudice upper management. If you are  person of color you will not move up regardless of how good of an employee you are. Just look at all of the sales executive's (not one person of color)
good,Pay is great not much flexibility however. Benefits and hours were good. Nice  people.long time employees. Buce bonus program and overtime  was helpful.
good,"Typical experience with this company as a customer often involved misleading or inaccurate information."
good,The work day is always busy and not much down time. They have great traning if your able to take the time to do so. There is a lot of changes. Very high turn over rate due to lack of management.
good,"Working in the phone bank is a joke. You are told at the interview, there is opportunity for advancement-well, that is IF your immediate boss likes you enough to give you a recommendation. I was also told that sales were optional when I accepted the position, however the phone bank is now considered a ""profit center"", therefore it is a requirement.  Low sales quota=bad scorecard which equals no opportunity to advance. Perks such as HSA contributions, and bonuses are a struggle to get from them. It is the first of Feb and I am still waiting for my core distribution which was ""suppose"" to be Jan 1. The insurance is not great. There is a high deductible EVEN for prescriptions. And dealing with CVS/Caremark is even worse than dealing with the HR department at Huntington. Training is very intense at first, so it leaves you feeling like they care. But, once you are on your own...there is not much guidance or direction other than reading emails or being pointed to a website. You have the ability to change your work schedule, however it again depends on approval. There is always a catch or a lot of fine print!!!"
good,"copany itself is not bad but one of the manager at warren, mi branch was really uncooprative"
good,It was a great place to work until they moved most of the jobs back to Ohio.  Most people in Indy lost there jobs!
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy, on your toes and an unpredictable setting that you learn something new in all the time. The great thing is being able to be part of a team that is encouraging and positive. It is sometimes difficult to balance the uncontrollable things but it is rewarding to know you have helped others and gotten the job done."
good,takes forever to advance even if your more qaulified than people who worked 10+ years there.. No room for growth!! all about who you know and not your quality of work being displayed
good,"payments, sales, deposits. Very demanding on the sales, and management left something left something to be deserved"
good,"My rating does not apply to the company as a whole. I would recommend a friend to work for Huntington Bank, just not my particular department. The company aims at providing a diverse culture. Salary should not just be based on years of experience, but having a college degree should be a factor when it comes to salary."
good,depends on the day of the week. you  have everyday customers and you have new ones but its a very friendly place to work. Mix culture. carling and fun place around the people you may like
good,Very little room for advancement. Poor upper management. Stressful environment. Little coaching or assistance in bettering yourself in your career. Little development opportunities.
good,I would go in to work and be Professional towards everyone. I would do my job to the best of my ability and I would leave. I worked for First Merit Bank which was taken over by Huntington. I tried my best to do what my new boss wanted me to do without much training.
good,"The pay makes up for the stress of working 7 days a week."
good,Not a place I would recommend to anyone to work at. Goals are always going up when they take away needed people to help achieve the goals. They don't tell the truth as to what the company is doing.
good,good place bad management lead to poor decisions and unrealistic goals that put pressure on sales goals to be made.  In happy work conditions ensued and job lost any bearability.
good,"I mostly enjoyed my career with HNB, I chose early retirement due to the 2+ hour daily commute ever since I moved to the country in 2010. Huntington National Bank is a wonderful employer."
good,Several years ago people used to join Huntington IT in order to help make a difference.  Individual efforts were noticed and encouraged where the colleague could help push the company forward in a positive direction.  Over the years Huntington has grown and acquired new culture from larger environments.  This culture change is noticeable and no longer a differentiator for Huntington; politics and groups are now commonplace within the department.
good,"Since I started working as a teller and moved into working with the automated banking, then became a personal banker and finally operations manager.  I had the opportunity to see all aspects of the banking office.  I got to deal with everything from cashing checks to closing a home equity loan.  As operations manager I had more opportunity to do reporting based on the individuals I managed.  I experienced the banking world during Y2K and what needed to be prepared to move forward."
good,There has been a massive change in the culture since the First Merit merger that makes things uneasy. It is hard to know what changes may be next and how the changes will impact your job.
good,"A good place to get your experience in, but horrible management where they do not care who they trample on and dis-value their good employees the second they make an honest mistake."
good,"Being a Personal Banker at Huntington is very much like any other bank. You are responsible for generating sales and helping customers. "
good,FirstMerit does not exist any longer. Huntington bought them. Overall it was a good place to work. I was sad to see the company be bought out. I have not worked for Huntington long so I cannot speak on Huntington.
good,"Management could be better with helping employees be more successful. Management could also be more understanding to the needs of employees. Overall great surrounding. Although, cubical desk instead of tables would be nice"
good,Very focused on revenue. too high of expectations in selling. Good if youre very good in sales and amazing in customer service.
good,"* Quality of files sucks"
good,"I come in and work hard, learn what I can so that I am a diverse and cross trained in every area that I can so that I can assist in just about any job function in my department. I am a team player and can say that for the most part I work with a great group of people. Our team is small but mighty...meaning for the number of staff we have we get alot of work done. My manager micro manages which makes me feel less than an adult. The hardes part of my job is dealing with co-workers that needto be babied. In an adutl envoronement we wll have to be adults and works towards getting the end result of our daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job is to know that I am assist other groups in the bank which in turn assist the customer in staying in their home...its a win."
good,"I review loans for our TPL department, I recenlty have learned the new TRID regulations, the hardest part about my job is the system issues we face on a daily basis, the best part of my day is talking to my clients"
good,In the short amount of time there did not allow to form an opinion.  My exposure was minimal and was unable to form an acceptable response.
good,I loved the people but the salary is below the industry and not enough to survive.
good,I was a client service representative that managed customers bank accounts. Ordered banking supplies and sold banking products. Immediate management was great. Did not have much interaction with higher level management.
good,Team leader of the tellers at main office and remote location. Managed 7-10 tellers dailey.
good,"Working as an in-store banker for Huntington is horrible, the hours are awful and it is incredibly mismanaged."
good,"Held meetings worked on accounts, opened checking and savings accounts and did loans. Management was decent, coworkers was great. Hardest part of the job was getting loans approved in that particular economy at the time."
good,company seems more concerned about upper management opinions
good,A good steady job but always wondering if you will have a job the next day
good,"Huntington allows you to balance you hone and work life well. Management treats you well. However, the company appeats to lack in employee loyalty."
good,"In charge of scheduling, coaching, supervising operations side of retail banking office."
good,"I worked for the in-store branch. It was an aweful experience. I work 6 days per week, could not request a day off, worked at least one 13 hour day per week, worked almost every evening, worked every weekend. They will not work around a school schedule, or your children. So if you or your kids are involved in anything, be prepared to give all that up for this job. Also be prepared to be afraid that everyday will be the day they fire you. They use job threatening to ""motivate"" their workers. My point is, just really think before you take a job in the in-store"
good,Huntington was a cool company to work at but it was hard to grow in a company where you aren’t compensated properly and can’t move up due to no opening of possible opportunities.
good,"Employees competed against each other for the same business and it was up to upper management to fix the problem, which they failed at. It created internal issues among employees and limited productivity."
good,"Its a great place to learn. But, the employee politics and gossips are the worst culture there. They treat contractors ill mannered, they show lot of discrimination between employees and contractors. The management has no clear picture on what an individual employee/contractor is capable of or currently working"
good,"Even without a ""direct sales goal"", you are required to help meet the ""branch goal"", which means you have a sales goal. Drink the kool-aid as they say and you could potentially move up, but its pretty tough to stomach."
good,"This has been a good opportunity to expand my base knowledge of enterprise fraud systems, I just feel like I am at a place where I need to move on. I am consistently looking for new challenges and new ways to test myself."
good,"My position was acquired in a purchase of First Merit Bank buy Huntington. HNB was new to Wisconsin and I think the overall culture of the company as a whole was good. The Wisconsin culture and management left much to be desired. The manager I worked under directly rarely came to work, and did not hire to replace the three employees that left before me, leaving us severely  understaffed."
good,"A typical day was intensive customer service, loan documentation.  I learned to use Micro Soft Office Suite."
good,"Company was sold and many people left. I was one  of them."
good,"FirstMerit gave me an opportunity to get into banking and taught me how to be a banker.  "
good,"If you are looking for your next career opportunity, Huntington is a good place to go. It often gives you the experience you need for your the next step in your career."
good,"I came from a bank known for being very sales driven so when a position opened at huntington i was super excited! the pay was great, it was close to home and the company treated the employees really well! "
good,I worked the drive thru which was very fast past. It made the days go by fast. I didn't like that I had very little face to face  contact with people. Management was very push with sales considering I worked in the drive thru.
good,"More concerned about inclusion, helping customers and growing than employee families.  That being said the staff are fun to work with.   If you are in the service or support areas of the company you will probably enjoy it more.   Branch positions are very stressful"
good,This bank pays its employees a small amount for a lot of work. The company is no longer in business. The culture was all sales and not about what is best for the customer.
good,"quick advancement"
good,"Long hours, old teller system that need to be upgraded. Uniforms had to be worn. FirstMerit was acquired by Huntington Bank a lot of branches closed. Remember to meet sales goal quarterly"
good,"Overall it was just an okay place to work.  I learned a lot about banking.  Management was okay, everyone was very friendly.  Clean environment. Did not like that it was open 365 days a year."
good,Job Assignment for the day  communications goals to meet learned how to micro manage ..I enjoy my co workers always learning some thing new every day. I have recommended other people but for positions held in a different  area I just did not think they showed that there employees were that valuable
good,"Lots of work. guidelines were not specific - one person would do it one way, you were told to do it a different way, and then someone in Cleveland would be angry that you didn't do it the way they wanted and you would be admonished."
good,The environment was energetic. My coworkers were very knowledgable and it was a pleasure to be part of that team.  I will miss working with the customers who I have had great pleasure knowing.
good,"Huntington Bank was a good employer, and the end of my employment they were demanding more and more on the sales staff without any kind of extra compensation."
good,"It's a good job to start out at but there's not much room to grow as a person or an employee. Also my required schedule has changed many times since working there. Huntington isn't very organized when it comes to the schedule, customers, or their employees."
good,"A day at Huntington Insurance consisted of incoming and outgoing phone calls, problem solving, and processing endorsements.  I learned better phone time management and how to use Sagitta and Image Mananger.  The hardest part of the job was sitting all day.  The most enjoyable part of the day was helping clients and staying busy."
good,"Banking center and staff were acquired from Bank of America by Huntington National Bank as of August 15, 2014. Was a Sales and Service Specialist with Bank of America."
good,"Being under the right management makes all the difference in this position. Some really take advantage of their employees. Others you will find great mentors and they will help you excel. This is a ""BOY's"" club still even in 2016."
good,"Working for this company was definitely a great learning experience. During the initial transition from the collegiate world to the professional one, the people you work with are extremely helpful and what nothing but the best for you. However, as you progress through the months while working here I began to notice the massive number of deadlines that were missed, the strain on the team due to an excessive workload, and generally intolerant management."
good,The work atmosphere is very busy depending on which branch you are located at. If the branch is under staffed the work environment is very stressful.
good,"The company, as a whole, is a good company for which to work.  However, I did not feel mentally stimulated at all.  There were several times when I had little or no work to do."
good,Overall the culture at Huntington is what attracted me in the first place.  Over the years there has been a large influx of Chase colleagues and the culture has shifted dramatically.  The IT environment is not one that I would recommend at this time.
good,"Each work position had similar hours from 8:00 am. to 5:00 pm.  The local location had required Saturday hours from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers..  They were very hard working and we all got along very will. I returned all voice mails to my customers. Check my to do list for the files that needed worked that day. The hardest part of the job, was to closing loans in 30 days."
good,"* Great people - from management to the mail room"
good,"I love math, so dealing with numbers was enjoyable to me.  Dealing with the public for the most part was enjoyable, having unhappy customers always come along.  Co worker some ok other not."
good,I prefer not to share a review regarding my current employer.
good,senior management was good middle management were wana be's
good,Overall I like the bank itself.  They HR and choice of employment is questionable
good,enjoyed coming into a place of work were it felt comfortable to be around coworkers that you had to work with 8 hours a day.
good,I made many new contacts and friends at this company
good,You get to know your customers very well. The girls are amazing and are beyond helpful.
good,Great company but some of the management only look out for themselves and do not help when help is needed.  Basically doing your best to survive at that point.
good,i would say this is a good place to work if you are ready to adapt to change on a daily bases. They have great benefits. there is a lot more that can be explained
good,Huntington National Bank was an ok employer. I don't know now but back then the employee turnover was very high due managerial issues. Things may have improved .
good,"management is great if you don't abide by the rules they set, otherwise they will sneak around and turn the entire team against you. The company overall is amazing, benefits are exceptional and pay is above that of most banks. They strive for work-life balance, which can be challenging, but they supply you with adequate PTO to alleviate your normal shifts."
good,I don't have an opinion about this company.  Good employees were continuously thrown under the bus by other employee(s) who continuously dropped the ball on projects.  Management did nothing about this.
good,"The sales goals were unrealistic. If it came down to spending time with a customer to help them with their check book or spending time cross calling customers to sell them more products, management always made it clear the sales were priority."
good,"is the flexible work schedule and the ability of working remote. The workplace culture is also nice, Huntington has an employee appreciation week every year."
good,This job was a decent job. There are things that would have been improved. There was a little bit of favoritism towards certain employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. The good days there far outweighed the bad days.
good,"I think Huntington holistically has the best mission statement in banking, thus why I joined the institution. However, the management is filled with weathered in-branch leaders. Which means they are set in their ways and adapt to old sales models and management styles , and this makes coaching session difficult to sit through as it lacks sales inspiration. Which makes the weekly mandatory coaching sessions hard to look forward too. If you are new to sales than this company and position are for you. Learn the ways and embrace the critical based sales coaching. "
good,"This was a tough place to work as far as demographics, but I got the job done. In an area where there aren't many African American people, it was very difficult at first for people to trust that I knew what I was doing in my role as a banker."
good,"Very sales focused. When guided properly, it is truly for the benefit of the customer and the bank at the same time. However, it has recently become a much more aggressive approach. I have learned a great deal of knowledge about the right and wrong ways to manage people as well. Work/Life balance is far below average, especially in branches."
good,"Adviced a lot of room to grow but that came with a lot of stipulations that were not mentioned during hiring process, I also was miss lead on how shift bids worked."
good,"I wanted to get back into SBA and USDA Lending but took this position in Special Assets and learned a great deal during this year at Huntington Bank. "
good,"i love the people i work with every day. my typical work day is seeing customers, providing awesome customer service, processing their transactions, coaching my current tellers and training them so they can move on and learn. Hardest part is having an employee that doesn't like to listen. most enjoyable, would be teaching my tellers and improving their every day knowledge about their job and helping them move on"
good,The job is what you make of it. The more you put in the more you can get out. Everyone is very fair and the company does a lot of great things for the community.
good,Huntington purchased FirstMerit.  I haven't worked for Huntington but I hear that's it's a good place to work.  FirstMerit had very high goals and had some difficulties getting loans closed in a timely manner.
good,I worked at the Commercial Loans Collareal Release area.  I really enjoyed my job but the Holland location was closed down.  All Loan Files were sent to Ohio to be processed.
good,Long hours and not enough time to do my job the way I would like to do my job the pay is good if you have enough staff and time to do your job which I'm good at but I have been being a teller more than a personal banker which is what I am
good,Very sales driven . Bank is open long hours and seven days a week which is hard for a single mother . I loved the customer relationships I built here.
good,"Limited flexibility, Very stressful. Monitored daily. Incentives make it a challenge.Salary not enough for the amount of knowledge that is required to do the job and succeed to be rated as a top performer for better shifts and promotions within the company"
good,This is an okay place to work.  Management is not consisted and petty on something.  If you come to work and do job they wonder why you are too quiet or too yourself.  If you have too many questions your a trouble maker.   It was hard to just stay in lane. If you do a great job manager are afraid to advance you in fear you will take their job. depending on the person it may be hard to advance especially if your older with a lot of knowledge.
good,I learned how to guide consumers how to be financially responsible.  Plenty of opportunity for advancement.  The company is growing so it could be a good time to get in.
good,"company pays the best in the industry but here are reasons behind it. "
good,To work with and for Huntington Bank as  whole is great. But with my department there is no room for advancement and moving to something other than collections is a very difficult transition whether one is qualified for the position that they are applying for or not. It is just at this point I am feeling stagnant and not able to move forward. I am no longer being challenged or able to increase my skill set.
good,"We are a back office function responsible for processing payments for homeowners insurance, property taxes and completing annual reviews of escrow accounts.  It is fast paced with daily, weekly and monthly functions/processes.  We have daily wires to vendors that must be completed timely and accurately.  We have reports to help ensure we are in compliance and have all items paid.  We meet with the vendors bi-weekly to ensure we keep lines of communication open and work through any issues identified.  We provide support for our mortgage call center using tasks entered through the system.  We also provide support for an escalated escrow call center by addressing customer issues/concerns and providing direction on how to resolve the inquires. I have trained all the staff on their functions and continue to provide training as needed.  We have completed process reviews to ensure we are working as efficiently as possible.  All processes are documented and updated annually.  We work with other departments when they have an escrow concern and help to improve department functions when they cross.  I prepare files requested for the internal, external and investor audits as the occur and assist in answering any questions they have on our processes."
good,Hunting is a nice place to work. My district manager is really good and treats people fair. I also like the team I'm working with.
good,"Not a bad place to work, they have a good process for getting people the proper training material and process for training"
good,Worked in HR as an assistant to the HR manager; Electronic Banking - learned how to process fraud disputes on checking and savings accounts;
good,Our office has cut back on our teller staff and one person is now doing the job of 3 people. The hardest part of this job now is giving our cust quality customer serve that they deserve.
good,Learned all areas of the banking industry in a short amount of time due to lack of staff.
good,Job opportunities were always available. Management was always fair
good,Worked as a teller responsible for accurate transactions and maintaining sales goals .
good,"Work hours are typical.  They have a great mentorship  program in place, too bad I never had a chance to experience it.  I was told by a manager that I had to take time-off to shadow my mentor and pay for a computer class offered by the bank. Since my department did not use the program and the project manager was not in a department that we supported, it did not benefit our department. The fact that HNB was trying to gain the experience within the bank so we could hire within was apparently lost on this manager.  Of course he was wrong!  Coworkers were great but like in any large company you have people that you wonder why are they still employed or promoted.   Special projects is the best because your input is heard early in the process."
good,"I am a full time teller. I love to be neat and organized so I find myself cleaning out drawers and cabinets. I enjoy working on task that is given to me. I usually work on most of the audit task that is due monthly, quarterly, or annually. I am very up beat and happy person that keeps the other employees laughing and having a great time at work. I am a very hard worker that puts the clients first at all times. I enjoy helping clients with their financial needs and referring them to the banker to help the bank and our clients."
good,"On a typical day, I assess financial needs of clients, as well as bring awareness to the products and services we offer to help save clients both time and money.  "
good,"excellent customer service "
good,"Typically, the overall environment of the workplace can be monotonous. I've learned how to enhance my interpersonal communication skills in a professional manner. The co-workers are extremely friendly, kind and loyal to the business. The hardest part of my job was to satisfy the needs of all of our clients. The most enjoyable aspect of this job were the bonus incentives."
good,"I learned to develop a professional demeanor, put the needs of the customer above my own."
good,Managed daily operations
good,"I worked at Huntington National Bank since I was 19 years old. It was a nice starter job. My co-workers were fun-filled people to work with. I felt like I had a second family. The job was pretty routinized. It was a laid back environment. I was able to wear jeans at the department I worked at. Unfortunately the company merged with Sky Bank from Bowling Green, OH and lost a large amount of money. I was part of the lay off that occurred back in 2008. I wouldn't mind working for them again because I think they took care of their employees and didn't leave us laid off employees empty handed. I enjoyed my experience here for the company."
good,decent environment not that professional management is not very concerned regarding their employees but the pay is decent and the training in in depth
good,What I love the most about Huntington is the people. We truly care about doing what is right for our customers. And the best part is how much we give back to our communities.
good,"It has been great working experience at hnb. Customer has been very supportive and cooperative. Work culture is good, we have grown the relationship year in year."
good,"Best company to work with  and enjoy the team I ever work with where work in   abandon  and  keep yourself busy"
good,My experience at HNB was a poor work life balance.  Due to lack of layering on managerial responsibilities caused unnecessary hours to be worked after 6:30 pm and usually both days on the weekend.
good,There were some good people who work there. There are opportunities for growth in certain ares of the bank. It really depends on the team or department you are affiliated with.
good,"Because of the lack of marketing in the WI market, it was tough to let prospects know who they were.  That caused Huntington Bank to be sold sold to a local bank."
good,I don't think this is something I feel like answering this seeing I am retired from the company.  don't receive any retirement pay for this at all just was old enoungh
good,"Huntington is a perfectly fine place to work, but its far from being the ""best place you'll ever work"" (which contradicts one of our multiple corporate objectives)."
good,You're job is never done and you are never truly off.  You are salary and raises are slim.  Benefits are ok but I am aware of several companies that offer MUCH better benefits in the same industry.
good,"While working as a teller at Huntington's predecessor, First Merit, I was able to learn the ways of a successful retail branch bank.  My coworkers were pleasant and engaging."
good,"Huntington National Bank is sub-par in the retirement 401(k) arena. They are not streamlined that you would think a bank would be."
good,I worked in different capacities for Huntington and got a very good overall knowledge of the different areas of mortgage banking.  I was given many opportunities to grow within the organization.
good,collections is not where i wanted to stay.  customers upset about calls and account information threats daily and in one room that included every employee in collections like a call center
good,"Huntington Insurance is a VERY small part of Huntington Bank. Fees earned by the insurance division added a little to the bank's overall profitability, but were consistent contributors year over year."
good,"I appreciated starting there very young and learning about the banking industry, I loved it at first. After a while, the company would push sales goals on the tellers but yet lower our incentive pay. Great people but a highly stressful environment"
good,I really enjoyed working for Huntington but they sold out their Wisconsin market and I feel abandoned by them. There was not fair opportunity for advancement.
good,"The culture was fast paced and kept everyone on their toes.  There were issues with revenue, and checking accounts.  The CRM was very good.  The overall technology was also very good.  The revenue goals were unrealistic.  Only about 50% of the bankers hit their numbers."
good,"Typical Day, learning, Work Life balance, compensation, Benefits, Management, Job Culture, Medical Dental, Vacation, Sick time, Dental, Short Term Disability"
good,"If you like having to constantly push sales, this is the place for you. They are always ultra focused on your sales goals above everything. The in store location hours are not traditional bankers hours and can make work/life balance a chore."
good,I was judged on the bank that I came from because Huntington had brought us out and the employees of Huntington were upset because their stock had dropped in price.  Employees for Sky Bank had worked hard and Huntington employees did not value anything we had to say about our clients or anything in the region.
good,"Huntington was a good company overall, poor management, poor communication with staff from management, good benefits, has other programs such as fmal, loa, and lots of other programs to assist financially, 401k."
good,"changed a lot while I was there, evolved into much larger and sophisticated organization. Management changed at the end very different. Sold out to larger organization."
good,"The best part of my experience with the company was working with the corporate offices during the transition from the previous owner to the new owners. My direct coworkers were a great team and we worked well together to help each other develop our knowledge of the processes old and new. "
good,The bank was bought out by Huntington National Bank in 2016. It was initially a great company to work for but as time went on as with any financial institution change happens and most likely not for the best.
good,The bank keeps goals in reach but heavy focus in micro managing the employees   Advancement is difficult because the layers are thin.  It is important to produce in this position
good,I cannot fairly review this company as it has been over 13 years since I worked there and I was only there for a short time. I enjoyed the time I did spend there though.
good,I do not wish to share however the website mandates that you share something to educate future company prosect that look to gain employment by the company be asked to rate.
good,Overall decent company to work for. You got full benefits and 40+ hours a week. Management structure needs to help. Difficult to speak with a manager when needed.
good,"great place to work, enjoyed the clients and employees.  I learned alot in the first year and had great training and support.  First Merit cares about there clients, unfortunately they were bought by Huntington."
good,"Huntington is a great job where you can quickly move up the chain. You have to be willing to proactive with your request. If you are interested in a position , make it known to someone who knows the person to get your name on the radar and it will work wonders."
good,"Huntington was a nice place to work, but I no longer wanted to work with the public and moved on after receiving my degree in Human Resources and left the company"
good,"Being a PB at huntington national bank, was challenging as i never wanted to become a salesman..I had to, to become successful with this bank"
good,"The job itself is not bad. I enjoy the customers and the employees, but the management seems to have been given their promotions based on sales rather than their skills as a manager. "
good,"When I first started at Huntington, they prided themselves on not being the Big Blue Bank, and that they were content being the Bank of the Midwest. That began to change quickly, and before you knew it, they became like the Big Blue Bank, with regulations and micro managing, and quotas, and projections, and reports, and it lost the midwest, hometown bank feel. All of that is fine, because that's the evolution of business, but lost in all these record profits that were posted was the incentive and compensation of the big banks. I feel like they lost their way and are in a position now to lose or fail to retain top talent because of it. Wish them nothing but the best, but there needs to be a re-identification of whats important. Profits or people?"
good,can be stressful at times but overall a great place to work the customers can be a little stressed a typical day can e face paced the workpace is very cultral
good,This bank was purchased by Huntington bank and therefore no longer in existence.  Mostly a positive experience but it did not end well.  Overall a good experience.
good,Working with Managers and Banker to coach and develop them to have ability to grow in their career.  The culture with partnership was key to success. Huntington has done a great job with building a good sales process.  How to help the customers with their needs.
good,I really appreciated the opportunity to be apart of an organization that really cared about the community it served. This bank was purchased by Huntington bank.
good,Somewhat of a political environment.  A lot of bureaucracy and red tape in order to get things done.  Sometimes hard to get colleagues to take ownership of issues.
good,The company changed its incentive program because of salesman making too much money. Lots of practices that don't make sense in the new aged banking world.
good,"Was an ok place to work.  The hours were typical ""Bankers Hours""  Felt very pressured to make sales, when the position was not a sales position.  When questioning management, was continually told  ""just do your best"" but when it came to reviews, ended up hurting my ability to do well."
good,"The constant change in upper management made it challenging to understand expectations. The bank has great products for customers, in fact the best products I have seen in my banking career."
good,"a Typical day was getting there at 8:30 am and being there until 8:30 pm while getting a break maybe for an hour if you have coverage to do so otherwise you go to the deli in the grocery store and munch on what you can. "
good,"The company and the managers are nice, and helpful, although the wages that I am receiving for my job title are not at all satisfactory which is why I have to do so much overtime. PTO amount given is fair, benefits are not great and are expensive, advancement is non-existent. It is a good employer to work for if you are looking for job security but not much more than that."
good,A great place to work. A busy and fast pace. I enjoyed the opportunity. It was Equal Opportunity. It was a great location. Company took pride in customer service.
good,"The bank was acquired. The business process was not prepared for the acquisition.Overall, the acquisition did cause negative impact to the First Merit employee base."
good,I was a FirstMerit employee that was let go do to reduction of work force because the Akron mainframe site was shutdown.  Huntington headquarters are in Columbus.  The Akron technical site was changed to a Call center.
good,there was a lot to balance and a lot of responsibility for one person. they job wasn't bad it was just the customers that would give you a run for your money
good,Worked as a teller and enjoyed it and hours where good.  Other employees there where very helpful and help was there when needed.  Very friendly people and had an hour lunch.
good,"I did notice a lot of micromanaging. They had a tendency to talk down to their employees, as if we were not very smart people. Co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was dealing with management. Employee appreciation took place a couple of times a year with free lunch and cookies."
good,Huntington is becoming a leader in community volunteerism and has been a long time supporter of cancer research.  They are continuing to increase their community outreach programs.  One of their core values is work/life balance.
good,it is a good place to work at. Benefits are good. Need to offer work from home to be more competitive. Workload is heavy compared to compensation. WEF
good,"I felt as if I did soo much work for little pay.  Even tho it was in a call center environment, when the call center had high volume calls we had to step in and assist."
good,Good pay but always short staff people getting fired or quitting out of fear of getting fired. Always wanting you to work OT. Fine if single & no life. Decent pays & benefits on the plus
good,There has been a lot of turnover due to recent acquisition.  conflicting messages sent to employees.   culture suffered at hands of senior management.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was providing client solutions such loan alternatives, saving them money, protecting their assets, reducing their debt service. "
good,Sales driven environment.  Lack of camaraderie. High turnover job.  Decent work life balance.  Lack of training in various areas.
good,"Great place to work, strives to be the ""best bank in the midwest"". Maintains a prominent and positive image in their communities."
good,Not a fan of the bank model for investment pros.  Too many meetings.  Meetings about meetings and then more meetings. Branch model on it's way out.  Not exactly a lot of higher net-worth folks willing to spend time with the kids they hire to staff these branches.
good,"the co-workers are absolutely great,  but the management could be significantly better. i worked many long days, doing very stressful work and most of the time it wasn't stress caused by those around me, not the customers i worked with."
good,The company does not focus much on continued learning or advancement of employees. The pay is not very competitive in my opinion. It is a good place to learn the basics of the banking industry.
good,"Morale is down, pay is average, management doesnt always focus on the most important issues departmentally, just an average job with average benefits."
good,The management was a very helpful. My co-workers were always ready to assist if needed. Typical day would start with a data quality call and exactly what data was required.
good,This job you spend all day cleaning and sometimes your by your self so you get bored or miss interaction with people making it hard to want to stay and complete your job1 you think about how slow time is moving
good,at this company you have to know how to move up you have to be on your game dont worry about anyone else just get up how u can. the managers are just really there to get praise from their managers and also people are very nosey. like i said do what you have to do and there wont be a problem and keep to yourself
good,"It was a fun experience being involved in the world of finances, and to start it at FirstMerit, where the company was growing in revenue, and  in clientele"
good,"The bank as a whole was great to work for prior to the announcement of the Huntington Merger. I'm not sure what the future holds for current employees, but the behavior by most management members does not coincide with my morals and ethics."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is average. I Learned transparency and collaboration is important, and also doing the right thing."
good,"A typical day involves a short conference call, reviewing daily results, meeting with the team to go over the day's priorities, calling/soliciting present customers, problem solving with both employee issues and customer questions or concerns, opening new accounts, taking loan applications and administrative duties."
good,I learned a lot about finances and expanded my customer service skills. I learned how to use different softwares and hardwares that will come in handy in the future
good,"Very professional"
good,"I enjoy working here and with the team, it is a good environment to meet lots of different types of people. I enjoy helping customers with their daily transactions and any other needs they may have. We are getting ready to merge with Huntington Bank so we are all eager to see what this brings."
good,FirstMerit Bank is a healthy regional bank who focuses on commercial clients.  The Bank has expanded in the Chicagoland market and this will be a strong focus going forward.
good,"It's my job to oversee branch operations. These responsibilities include scheduling and performing audits, ensuring everyone is up to date on policies and procedures, training my team new bank technology, and conducting daily huddles to keep my team motivated with servicing customers."
good,Was a great place to work. I enjoyed my co-workers and the management was friendly. Its was not hard to advance within the company.
good,cool people to work with. enjoyed the travel and learning new financial opportunities. banking knowledge was great to receive daily.
good,Great company to work for with a lot of room for growth. Positive environment with great co-workers. Management was productive and condusive to my success in this company.Training was thorough and complete which helped me with my sales and interactions with customers.
good,"Huntington Bank is not a bad company to work for, but in my overall review I would not recommend them to anyone in particular.  Job security is decent until the banking industry went bottom up, but advancement and pay are mediocre at best."
good,Family practice medical facility that was busy at all times. Very busy days that went by very fast and a fun and helpful staff to work with everyday. Never a dull moment
good,"A fun place to work, this organization cares about their employees and gives good benefits and the ability to advance if you work hard."
good,Company is forward thinking and community oriented.  Utilizes current industry technology.  Focused on expanding and developing  their brand throughout their regional foot print.
good,Treated me disrespectfully and will never work for them again.  Not flexible with families or school.  Good job for a single person right out of school.
good,Not a good paying job. Lot of favoritism going on. Position was deleted but was not offered another open position. I had to get laid off and apply for any open positions.
good,Left do to lack of competitive pay.   Was starting a family and could not make ends meet on the level of pay they provided.   This was a long time ago so things might have changed.
good,I worked at First Merit for ten years and learned a lot in that time period. I went from a part time teller working my way up to Customer Service Associate.
good,"My biggest problem is with career development. The company promotes advancement, but rarely gives anyone a chance to advance said career. For example, I had an interview for an internal position, and I never received an answer one way or another about an offer or anything. I found out about a month later they had hired two people externally for the two open positions. I have also applied for other positions internally and never even received a chance - the company typically hires externally. It's almost as if I'm stuck even though I'm ambitious."
good,Was a summer intern at Capital Planners. The team was very hard working. The job required self discipline and a passion to succeed.
good,"There are many departments within the company to work, however job security depends on the department and economy."
good,"Hardest part of the job while being the new one on the block is that you did not sit with co-workers so very hard to work with them.  Documentation of the application in order to support customers when production issues arose was not available.  Very little documentation was available."
good,"A typical day at work is long as it is a 12-hour shift working nights and weekends. I have learned that the best way to learn anything is to take it on yourself. Co-Workers are good and the hardest part is trying to move up, difficult to do working night shift.The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay."
good,"Great way to develop strong relationship with customers.  "
good,"Nice, friendly work environment.  Too far of a drive for me though"
good,While working at HNB it was an eye opener.  It was like too many chiefs and all felt they were right.  Training was back and forth.
good,Very conservative environment.  No outside the box thinking.
good,"Good place to work, wonderful people. They promote core values and a good life balance. One of the nices bosses I have ever had."
good,"I worked customer service, opening accounts, teller transactions, etc. I learned a lot about discovering needs for the customer."
good,"For never working in the banking world before, it sure is interesting. I like working with the customers, but I must say it does get tough to deal with some of them. Customers at the bank are far different than customers in a retail store situation. I have learned much patience and how to ""kill them with kindness"" over the short time I have been with the bank."
good,Good co-workers and great customers makes the day a great one each day.
good,Banking and Customer service.  I really enjoyed working at this bank.  The only reason I left was because of pay and opportunity advancements.
good,"Productive and fast-paced work environment. I like my manager, but the Teller Team Lead is always so rude about everything. I don't think he really likes his job."
good,"Worked on large projects and provided support to internal customers. I learned great deal while working there. The management changed multiple times while working there. I enjoyed most of my co-workers, we've all since left.  The hardest part of the job was the stress of trying complete projects on time."
good,The hardest part of the job is learning the different systems and keeping up with the change of business.
good,"Headquartered in Akron, OH with recent expansion into Michigan & Wisconsin after the merger with Citizens Bancorp."
good,"An average company to work for.  Supervisor not professional or encouraging at all.  "
good,n/a i have nothing bad to say about company. i come in to work assist my customers take advantaged of my extra incintive
good,I liked working here but I struggled with getting referrals. I was only part time seeking full time but never got
good,"Great for building customer service skills"
good,"I was a teller I greeted customers and made their transactions, deposits, and withdrawals. "
good,it was a great company to work for and the customers were great!
good,I love the job. Processing currency deposits and balancing trusts and ATM's are just part of what we do. The best part of the job is the team I work with. The most difficult part is being in a secluded work area. After 8 years you get used to it. There are some management issues but overall and great place to work. 
good,"Most of the employees are nice. at times its a bit like high school. people are clickish, vengeful, and shallow."
good,Run customers transactions or help them with any banking need they may have. Answer phones if not with a customer. I love all my co workers we work as a team and they are amazing ! The hardest part of my job is meeting our sales goal each month but we never give up trying and we are our hardest! The thing I enjoy the most about my job is that I meet so many different people and my customers are the best. They really do care about us just as we care about them.
good,"Mid-size bank with large back feel. Typical day tasks include writing, debugging, testing code, and working with various business units. I learned most of my skills there. Management is very professional. Co-workers are a diverse group. Hardest part of the job is that everything is locked down by security. Most enjoyable part of the job is that most of the people are friendly."
good,Huntington offers opportunities for advancement.and is always seeking to improve customer service
good,"It has been a very long time since I worked there, but I enjoyed it although the pay was very low."
good,The banking working place is excellent and the people is nice to work with.
good,"Job was managable but wouldn't go back to work for them. At the time i worked for them, it wasn't a very stable position."
good,Start work at 8:30. Open night vault and work on processing all night deposits. Have a quick meeting with management then open at 9:00 to customers. Manager was very pleasant to work for. Co-workers were worried about gossiping about eachother and others. The hardest part of job was to make sure you balanced your drawer after a hectic day. The most enjoyable part was waiting on the customers and making sure they had what they needed. I loved a happy customer. I received many awards for customer service. I also received awards for employee of the month for not missing work.
good,Overall not a bad place to work.
good,good workplace.
good,"Need better software, hardware and communication throughout the bank. I work with wonderful pewople."
good,"working in the branch let me experience different people with different problems, Loved helping to solve problems. What I did not like is that I would never know my schedule for the next week before saturday"
good,"It's been almost 17 years since I've worked for this bank. I started as a part-time teller, worked through the management trainee program, served as a branch supervisor, asst.branch manager, than was involved in a management cut and worked as an adjustor, then a consumer credit loan officer before I left."
good,FirstMerit Bank is a good bank. I ran and balanced a teller window. My management was strict but fair. My coworkers were catty. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers. But I enjoyed the hours.
good,"The company overall is a decent company to work for. However, was told that my incentive would plan would be much, much better than it actually was. I was told by other employees that they had trouble keeping employees sure to this recurring issue."
good,A typical day at work consist of reviewing up to 40 mtgs a day and resolving problems. The hardest part is dealing with peers who think they are management as well when they are your equal
good,I enjoyed working there. meet a lot of new people who i am still friends with. learned how to work well under pressure.
good,"Huntington is a smaller bank thus I was able to build deeper, recurring relationships with customers. They were very strict on selling products in which we were lead to believe that the major focus was on customer service rather than becoming salesmen in our initial interviews with the company."
good,"Being a teller requires being accurate, detailed, and polite. Customer service is your biggest responsibility after balancing your cash drawer. It is also the most difficult aspect. Having the support of management and co-workers makes it must easier. I liked blancing the cash drawers and was very accurate."
good,"I've learned so much in my 5 years here, especially the last 2. my current position has provided a variety of experiences (good and bad) that have helped me learn and grow."
good,FirstMerit is a Super Community Bank that has a large presence in the Akron area. They offer the usual products of most banks but thrive on theire good customer service.
good,"The company is really together with their systems and progression in learning your role. However, they do not treat you well if  you’re not a manager."
good,"The typical day at work includes transaction, meetings and calls. The hardest part for me for working at Huntington was that they told me that there was a career path for me and room for promotions. They told me that I would get a raise in three months but more typically 6 months. The best part of the job is that you can really impact peoples lives for the better."
good,"I like the culture at Huntington, management is great, however, there are many issues that the company has to fix and I can cite couple things such as high employee turnover, they higher very untalented people, they hire those who never been in college to work as bankers..!!!!! additionally, it's very hard to get promoted where you want, they want to promote you where they want, not where you want, if they see you are doing great at your position, they make it very hard for you to move up or they put you where you want. there is also mediocre income especially since they change the sales goals. I like the company, has great culture but there is a lot that need to be done, I have been year there and I really want to quite. "
good,"I was with them for twenty years and they were great to me.  It was very fun for a very long time.  I worked my way up to Branch Manager and did that for ten years, but just had no desire to go any further within the Retail Bank.  I had enough of customers and management and just needed a break.  If the corporate office was local and I had an opportunity to work in Finance for Huntington after completion of my Masters, I would have probably never left.  I was just ready for a change after spending my entire working life in that environment."
good,"I worked from home a lot, only communication with my manager was on Wednesday's meetings which were conferenced calls. Was pretty much responsible for about three people's job but it worked out"
good,"As with most jobs, the experience depends on who you work for. I worked for FirstMerit Bank prior to being purchased by HNB and loved it. I planned to work there forever. I was offered a position within HNB; unfortunately my manager was a very poor leader. He gave zero direction, did not communicate clear expectations, and was extremely concerned about his reputation over developing his team. There were a few unethical situations that I reported to HR after confronting my manager directly, and the HR rep laughed and said ""yep, sounds like him"". Thereafter, there was retaliation against me and I thought it best to remove myself from the company. It was really unfortunate, as I've heard other former FirstMerit employees speak of very positive experiences at HNB."
good,"Lots of ""discretionary"" arbitrary things regarding who and when someone is written up for discipline. And it can back on you from months ago which is unfair"
good,"The company promotes work life balance and wanting to take care of their employees, but falls short on all levels. The pay and benefit package is low and leaves a lot to desire. schedule constantly changing, do to employees leaving."
good,"Very Very busy and you had to stay alert at all time.I learn how to work fast and keep my focus on what I was doing to please the customers,the most enjoyable part is doing that the customers was satisfy."
good,The OnBase team was a pleasure to work with and allowed me to be involved and learn from the beginning.  OnBase was a new tool for me and I was able to get up to speed with assistance from others.
good,"If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you can go far. The benefits and pay were good. Office drama could sometimes be a problem. Profits are the foremost on management's mind."
good,"Typical day At Huntington was very structured. I worked with a great group of people that really valued the Bank's policies and procedures.    "
good,"I loved everyone i worked with, and a great culture compared to some other places i have worked. I would still be there today if it wasn't for an offer at another company that was too hard to pass up on."
good,I worked in a fast paced department.  Knowledgeable employees that take the time to assist customers with questions and concerns.  Good benefit package.
good,A typical day involved handling customers transactions and every day needs. Since it was a small group of people that you worked with in a branch everyone became like a family. My customer service skills were greatly improved with this job!
good,"I was a contractor for about 15 months as a project manager. They are not technology in the fore front, but have adequate technology to support a regional banking footprint."
good,"It was a pretty stressful environment.  Management wanted to maintain a level of insecurity within the sales ranks.  Incentive shrunk over the years, while goals increased."
good,"The size of the company reflected the availability for work morale. For the most part, management of day to day operations helped the work day flow. Interdepartmental relations was plus."
good,Huntington cares for it's customers and employees and is not afraid of change. They are constantly looking for ways to improve products/services to create the best bank of the Mid-West.
good,"Several years ago, I would have recommended Huntington to anyone; however, over the last few years, the benefits given to employees has decreased substantially."
good,"The work environment was great. The people were very kind and professional. However, the employees are under paid. I was hired in at 11.25 per hour and advanced to 12.00 plus commission. But management cut 90% of commission."
good,Management is fair and works hard for their employees.  Very friendly environment with a family atmosphere.  Most job duties carry many hats due to the small environment.  You will have to be a jack of all trades.
good,Pushed very hard to cross sale products to help the company grow and no chance for promotion or raises during my time with the company.
good,"Its a great place to work if you like predictable, simple, and safe environments. Otherwise its boring. The shifts are long and never changes."
good,"Huntington is a nice place to work with lots of opportunity for advancement.  The employees are wonderful and Management is okay.  However, it isn't the most flexible job and has a poor work/life balance.  It is hard to get time off for your family due to inadequate staffing."
good,You get pulled in a lot of different directions as far as what you're told.  Your supervisor says one thing and your manager another.
good,"•	Identify new prospects and revenue opportunities for services using Banking Center referrals, Business Banking, Investments,  COI’s, and lead lists generated for assigned market territory"
good,"Huntington is a great company with a history of benefiting its customers.  However, in their ongoing goal to benefit the customer the employees are often forgotten.  They pay a decent wage and offer good benefits, but they harass you when you work overtime but do not offer help to avoid the overtime."
good,"Huntington is a growing, efficient bank focused on the Mid-West. They focus on growing deposits through their ""Fair Banking"" philosophy.  They do not looking to grow their CRE portfolio and are taking a low to moderate risk approach to middle market lending."
good,"Not a bad place to work. I worked for Citizens Bank for many years which was acquired by First Merit. My biggest gripe with First Merit is the software used is very old. Other than that minor detail, it was a great place to work. Fun staff, we were well informed, and my immediate management team was great!"
good,A typical day at work is mostly slow. There are times where it gets moderately busy. I don't always feel we have adequate coverage all the time. I have learned a great deal and I would love to move forward and continue to learn more and grow. Management is very supportive as are co-workers.
good,"Once you work for the company for a while, things change greatly. Sales requirements are too high. Customers got tired of me asking them the same thing since there were minimal products to sell. Job Security is the biggest detractor from this job."
good,"A typical day is making sales calls, aisling for leads, transactions, opening accounts, and lending."
good,"Typical Day : Productive "
good,"Started off as a great company to work for and things still are not bad; however, they are definitely changing. The company has terrible systems and cuts costs in the wrong areas."
good,Fun place to work. Learned and gained valuable experience in SBA loans. Good friendships with co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is calling the client and letting them know their loan has been approved.
good,a typical work day in the branch setting was strenuous. Huntington Bank promoted extended hours in the Cleveland-area retail market. Promoted depository and lending products in an effort to achieve operational excellence and satisfy Huntington Bank's overall goal.
good,"I enjoyed working for Huntington for the most part, however, it is all about sales and I am just not a sales person. If you cannot devote your life to your position as a banker, it may not be the best place for you."
good,I enjoyed working at first Merit people were great/best benefit was the tuition reimbursement/put me through school and I obtained my associates degree
good,"I learned that no matter how hard you worked and did your job plus whatever else was needed, it was useless if you weren't playing the game. Doing the right thing didn't matter. If you were incompetent and mgmt liked you, you were good to go, because their was always a guy like me to do the job."
good,Hours of operation are too long being they are open later at night and 7 days per week.  Too much out of town training especially for those with a family.  Relaxed environment and fun staff to be a part of
good,"work environment was competitive and very sales driven, very fast paced. Advertised as very low key sales job, but is very strongly focused on sales. the hours were great and the employees were amazing."
good,"It is a good bank to get experience working with a bank and getting use to how things run. Over all the career advancement stalls out if you are in the teller role and the banker role is slow, unless you want to move to a point and stick to that position then the overall job security is there."
good,I worked in the Escrow Accounting Dept as a customer service rep/escrow accounting rep.  My main job was to pay Private Mortgage Insurance and take care of Homeowners Insurance claims. Dispersing of funds from escrow.
good,"Great Branch Manager. Team player and always had her employess back. However, the company across the board has poor staffing issues . I rather work under her leadership . She definitely helped me grow"
good,Training could be better- you get let go if you don't meet your goals- some of the people are not that nice. I would not have taken the job here if I knew then what I know now
good,It was a great company to work for. I learned how money processes through a banking environment should be handled. It was a great experience. I would recommend anyone to apply.
good,"I worked for the company through the merger of Citizen to First Merit, this was a disaster. After the upgrade of software systems the job became much better. I was in a very small branch and felt that there was not enough staffing/coverage."
good,"Great start, good management, opportunities to grow. Should be able to stand long hours and be patient with clients that not always nice.     uniform is provided."
good,"I have known Huntington Bank for my whole life, as my mom works for them. They are a phenomenal bank with great products and services. My branch was the #2 branch in our region, with me being the only banker for a vast majority of my time there."
good,"Day to day daily operations including transnational. In store engament, daily call blocks for account reviews. Home lending clinics and seminars provided for those who need more training."
good,"This is a great place for someone wanting to get into IT, or learn from the ground up as a new graduate. Very fast past call center environment."
good,"Early career"
good,My experience with first merit bank was amazing to start. The staffing is all fun and friendly and so were the clients who banked with us. As I continued to work at this company I received multiple special notices in the company newsletter as well as recognition for a high volume of sales. Despite my track record there was 0 room for moving up. I had completed all my training for my next promotion immediately upon learning of them but was never moved up until my job was at risk. (the company has policy that if you do not earn a promotion within a year of employment you will be terminated without severance) The second time this happened i went to management and was told i was intentionally being held back to cut payroll and to keep my commission lower.
good,It was interesting to try a new job field. However I believe retail and customer service is a better fit for me. I love the people I work with and that makes my work days easier.
good,"Typical day at work involved me balancing my cash drawer, helping  a line of customers quickly but efficiently. Profiling the customer in front of me to refer products. Make quick decisions on whether to take a risk against the bank or not. Stay organized and focused to be able to balance at the end of the day. "
good,Handling customer 's personal finances. Learned how to up-sell products. Co-workers and management were nice. Hardest part of job being accountable. Most enjoyable would be the people.
good,The Company had great benefits. Enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. I was given the opportunity to use my artistic talent. The hardest part of the job was working with some of the more dominant personalities in the area. I learned a great deal about the banking industry through some computer training that was made available.
good,"reviewing all my tasks to complete that day or by a dead line. I have received invaluable loan knowledge for a wide variety of loan types.  The hardest part of the job is leaving on time for lunch. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I have helped a customer reach a goal. All my co-workers are team players including me so, we reach are deadlines on time. The management is very knowledgeable and trust that their employees know their jobs and what is expected of them."
good,Great benefits but treat their team members like numbers instead of people.  Goals are unrealistic. They let you know you can be replaced.   In the last two years my branch has had over 3 branch mangers.
good,"Huntington is a great place to work, however, making an impact is difficult."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy as we are a high volume, high traffic office. I have learned how to communicate and listen to customers better because of my employment here. I have also learned how to better understand people.  My team members are wonderful. They work really hard and we all work together. The most difficult aspect of my job is not being bilingual.  The most enjoyable aspects of my job are working with my team members and learning new languages. "
good,"Tight time lines, within short time, controls need to build and tested."
good,"I love working here, but getting off at 8:30 at night then coming right back to open at, 7:30 in the morning is tought to spend time with my family."
good,I worked out of Toledo ohio and let me just say I love being a banker but Huntington’s management style is horrible all the way up to  higher level management! Racial discrimination is clear in many locations and tolerated by management.. I quit my manager not Huntington! Huntington’s culture is amazing and I love what they stand for but they need to do better hiring appropriately
good,"I worked in the bank operations conducting a process improvement project. The entire leadership team was very helpful, willing to coach and help, and empowering. However, the bank itself has a very rigid structure and I couldn't see many opportunities to grow if I ever got hired."
good,"Huntington Bank is a great place to be if you are looking for a company that will grow with you and allow for further advancement. As a teller at Huntington, I was placed in a very busy branch, my day started a 8:00am and normally did not end until well after 5:30pm. Working at that particular branch we were held to high expectations with little room for error."
good,"I started at Citizens Bank, which became FirstMerit Bank. While, I did lose a few benefits through the merge, they were still a nice company to work for."
good,"Extremely flexible, busy but quiet. Very active in charity work including pelotonia. decent food options and comfortable work stations. helpful and friendly environment."
good,"Huntington provides growth and many different opportunities in the banking industry. Also, they provide career building path to help you get to where you want to be."
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,My team is awesome. They get what it takes to succeed. FMER is trying to catch up with its competitors and the demands of the economy.
good,I worked in an inner city branch. It was a culture shock. Many customers wouldn't use my window because of my color. Had a difficult time managing tellers because I was different. The corporate office was as supportive as they could be. All in all I was humbled at this job.
good,"Very enjoyable company to work for, the only thing that I wish I could change would be more equal hours. Management was very easy to work for as long as the co-workers."
good,"Conservative in banking, great people to work with and great managers."
good,"Had its pros and cons. Good pay, extremely stressful. Have to have the skin for it. I didn’t like the policies for the customers, but it paid my bills. They closed the building I worked at so found new work."
good,Huntington really respects family life.  They are not as competitive as other companies in salary or health benefits.  HNB will actually implement employee feedback ideas they receive.
good,"Great place to work, just a stressful one. Take a lot of calls each day and have time constraints to get all the work done. Managed well, good hours, and good pay."
good,"Fun place to work, the people here are amazing and it's in a nice little suburb. Many restaurants and shopping centers near the bank. Easy to go out to eat for lunch"
good,"It was very productive and quiet. We always had a lot of work to do when we came in at night, which made time go by quickly."
good,"nice place to work, benefits for part time were worst benefits ever, which no one tells you about until your 90 days are up. also, your vacation is classified as""PTO"" so if you have not used it when you leave, they are not legally obligated to pay you for it"
good,"Good work and life balance. Great team of investigators and great case load. Plenty of room for advancement and good perks, plenty of travel opportunities."
good,"This was a very stressful job, not what I thought it was going to be. when you are an institute for others money it can be very streeful, especially when you don't quite have the concept down."
good,"I love Huntington as a company, the job I had I would never do it again, customers are very cruel, I got threatened, screamed at and cussed at every single day. I would recommend this company but not this job itself."
good,Overall Huntington is a good company to work for.  Some branches are better than others.  Compensation is low but is what it should be for the positions you're in.
good,"On a normal day I answerer over 100 phone calls a day, assist them with acct changes questions and nsf fees. I have learned a lot about banking managing an account, how to handle customer complaints and angry customers along with banking procedures and computer systems. the hardest part of the job is keeping the conversation calm and professional while the customer is doing the opposite. I love being able to help others whether it be fellow employees or customers."
good,"The Huntington was nice place to work, it was laid back professional dressing and you can move up in the company. A lot of nice people to work for management was very professional in the work in my department was easy."
good,"This company was ok, the work was non-stop but the pay was terrible.  In the 8 years I worked at this company, my pay only increased by .50.  Terrible pay for the amount of responsibility."
good,"The expectation of a Manager are ever changing but clearly defined as; meet or exceed your sales goals with the minimal amount of staff in the branch. The district management team is supportive and in a small to medium market, the success of each branch depends of the cooperation of the branch management team in that market."
good,"Firstmerit was a home away from home. I definitely enjoyed working with the staff. Since I was away from home and didn't know anyone the employees do the bank were my family."
good,"At this time, there is not a place for me to move forward in the operations end and that is where I would like to further my career"
good,Horrible management the further west you get of Columbus and Detroit . Retail is the worse division followed by the Investment Company. Corporate leadership needs to take a look at the western areas recently acquired.
good,"This job was a routine job in which was difficult because I like variety and multi-tasking, maintained effective communication with clients via telephone. High-level maintenance job with securing documents and files. Co-workers were able to have limited communication, this job was one in which is was individual to team work. Quotas were met to secure job and salary"
good,Nice paying job. No work/life balance. Very stressful. Stand all day every day. No feeling of job stability.
good,"One of the first jobs I have ever been on that has limited it's employees from being able to advance. Employees that have been top salesperson in their entire district still are left at the starting rate. Poor advancement for ambitious individuals."
good,A typical day was quite. No one was really close and they did not really welcome one another like they said was going to happy. The management was okay but not the best and the co-workers were just boring.
good,"Management, will say they will promote, but this is a false promise. Even if youre goals are met, if you do too good, they want to keep you were you are just so the branch and the manager gets noticed. Schedules are never consistant. Hard to have a personal life. You're expected to always be working outside of work."
good,"HNB places a high value on its customers, if you don't appreciate your customers you won't be as happy and it will show. There is plenty of room for growth within the company."
good,I have no opinion I wish to share at this time.  The employees as a group are great to work with though sometimes the hierarchy is tough to navigate.  Thank you.
good,It was s great company to work for. I loved my clients and had a great time learning a lot about customer service while being a teller there. Our team was small but very close
good,"Huntington is a good place to work for. The bank continues to grow and has great customer service. Plenty of growth and career opportunities, inclusive culture"
good,"As much as i loved Huntington, they do have their shortcomings. Was passed over for promotion three times for people with less sales and management capabilities. They do play favorites with the hours they give you to work. and with the extended business hours and 7 days a week, it is hard to have a steady work life balance."
good,"Opportunities with new prospects were rewarding upon discovering, educating, recommending and implementing strategic solutions. Fellow team leaders were a helpful resource for navigating the challenges of processing business. Many opportunities to regain customer confidence after market conditions negatively impacted portfolios by upwards of thirty percent with no probability of recouping losses due to nature and duration of certain investment vehicles they were placed in by previoust advisors."
good,"This company is wonderful to work for. You can tell from day one that they care about each employee. Unfortunately, the branch management needs to show more compassion to their team as well as become more fair with the work/life balance with scheduling."
good,No work life balance. hard to get anything accomplished outside of work. One day you will close and get out of the Branch at 8:30 at night and then have to be back the next day @ 7:30 in the morning.
good,Loved working with Huntington Banks. Would suggest it be a great starting point for anyone looking to get their foot in the door.
good,I always  over exceeded my goals and build a rapport with every customers.  Also will go over and beyond to make my customers happy and see a smile on their face.
good,Decent place to work. Its mainly the management that makes it difficult. The work is okay. The salary needs work. I dont feel we are paid enough or any advancement
good,"Location was close to home, enjoyed the people I worked with. Learned about high volume accounts and research for balancing. No stress.  Team members were always willing to assist when issues arose with balancing."
good,"Job was good, because you were able to talk to different people everyday. Flexibility with scheduling. Bad that you had to work on Saturdays with no set schedule."
good,I worked in one of the busiest locations. For five years I work to provide customer with financial understanding. I love my job and the people I worked for(customers)
good,"Once you get into Huntington it is truly a great place to work. They unfortunately moving up their ladder is very..... ""click-ish"" if you do not know someone on the other side in order to help you , your numbers will just get you noticed but not advanced."
good,Typical call center job with the potential to be so much more. 100+ calls a day and only 5% of those calls I feel I honestly get to be influential in peoples lives with helping assist them in finding a solution to their situation. The other 95% are dealing who people who feel entitled and want to off-set responsibility.
good,Gave this bank 22 years of my life and thought I would retire there.  Got downsized after coming back from New Year's break.  Not a good place to work now.  To many people that have worked there or still work there complain about the company.
good,"I would get to work 1 hour early sign into my work station. I would help customers with setting up their new scanners, that would help them scan checks for the bank. The co-workers where willing to help if I had a question, also I helped them if they had a call for a scanner setup, because I was the specialist on that."
good,"On a typical day I opened the branch, did the night drop, which sometimes took until the lobby opened, sold money to the vault, balanced and replenished the ATM, got money ready to ship out, ordered money, did change orders for business customers, balanced cash advance machine, and helped my supervisor with audits."
good,Was a Good company to work for. Increased employee cutbacks and increased workload makes it hard to reach person goals; Very hard for worklife balance. Overall good place to work but company culture has change over the years
good,"Some branches are wonderful, others not so much. I have had some good years working there, but the last year and a half were miserable. I know plenty of people who still enjoy working there."
good,Company tends to overwork their employees and not listen to when more hands are necessary or when current employees are begging for help. They try to focus on work/life balance but do not pay attention to when that is not happening.
good,you could work your tail doing everything asked of you and more and not get promoted as then they had no one to do the work.  You could be incompetent and succeed as someone else would pick up the slack.
good,There's not much to say here - sadly it wasn't the company I thought it was. I hoped to be there for a long time and sadly that is not the case. I loved the people I worked with and the customers were great
good,"Some days were very stressful and others were relaxed but we had a good team that worked well together which really helped on the bad days."
good,"Great bunch of people to work with.  Everyone helps each other out within the Phone Bank.  Branches don't help out much, they don't realize what we do. Great inventive pay, but tough sales goals to meet, sometime unrealistic. No room for advancement, don't like to see anyone leave if successful."
good,Overall the amount of work can be stressful. Co-workers are the best thing of the job because they make it fun and they help out with any issue you may encounter.
good,I was given many opportunities to learn different aspects of Benefits and gained valuable knowledge working with vendors and resolving benefits issues for employees.
good,"My position is very fast pasted, I accomplish a lot in a 9 hr. work day.  Everyday there is something new to learn.  It is a very changeling yet a rewarding career position."
good,"I have worked with some great people inside these walls, that are ready and willing to help others anyway that they can.  Even after you no longer work specifically for them, they are willing to assist you."
good,With a new management team in place from a larger prominent bank in the area Huntington Bank was still feeling their way through the murky waters.
good,not very good with following up and retaining customers. Product pushing and customer's needs not usually taken into consideration.
good,"Calendar Management"
good,Company is a good company to work for the culture and values are great however the management in the area was not trust worthy
good,"Daily responsibilities include managing inbound and outbound calls from colleague referrals "
good,Open help customer and sell products work with bankers. balance drawer and close down bank
good,"Handling customers personal checkinga, savings and loan accounts can be stressful, but working for the bank i learned patience,and self control. The postion was stressful because you have to learn to tolerate what people say to you."
good,"First Merit Bank was a very large and important part of learning to multi task in extremely different tasks. The job had various roles that would have to be taken on at all times. There was never a moment when the role let you have down time. There were always customers, filing, phone calls, paper work, self improving tests and other things to do. The most challenging task was always being sharp and always making sure you had everything in order. If you had an off day where things were forgotten you would be written up immediately. All promotions would be on hold if you made any mistakes. I truly enjoyed working with all the customers and all of my co-workers at First Merit. Assisting people with their finances would make them so happy. I enjoyed seeing all the smiling faces I helped everyday."
good,"Impressed with resources for employees and with upper management, but the mid-level managers do not seem to care about your growth or career path....managers in title only it seems. Unfortunately, this is not uncommon in today's banking world."
good,"It was my first position after my military service. They were good to me, I did enjoy my job. I did excel quickly, but some people don't like the stress of dealing with people"
good,Huntington is a good job great benefits. Its just the customers that you deal with on a daily that can be stressful. Other than that i enjoyed the hours and my co workers
good,Good company with a lot of room for advancement. Business banking is becoming more of a priority because they excel in this space. Give them a try and you’ll find a good job.
good,The Huntington Employees are bright and a pleasure to work with.  The systems are fine.  The tools provided are fine.  The work was challenging and sometime manual intensive
good,"While I agree with Huntington's core values, I wish that the Job had opportunity for advancement. The manager's are not quick to help you better yourself and are often two-sided when speaking to either other colleagues or giving instructions. My particular department may need some work but overall I would recommend Huntington as a great company to work for."
good,Overall okay place to work. Not always easy to get promoted though. Management tends to pick and choose from their favorites. Some days are busier then others.  Working with the public and helping them can be rewarding.
good,Huntington has great products and services to assist our customers in their financial needs. They have great benefits for colleagues.  They believe in building relationships with their customers.
good,"Huntington is a great company and very passionate about their mission and values; from the CEO to all colleagues, they are all on the same mission. Very customer focused and great place to get experience in the banking, customer service industry or lifetime career. They always promote from within."
good,This is going to make for a late night if you make me do this for every company that I worked for.  It is a good thing I deleted 3 other companies from my resume
good,"Great place to work, a lot of opportunity for growth, training was very hands on management was personable. I would recommend this company to people who are just starting their professional life"
good,"The credit card department was severely understaffed, often times i would be of 3 people in my call center taking calls on Weekends. Advancement opportunities were guaranteed at time of hire but not followed through. I met my stats applied for a different position which was filled but I was not informed until almost a month later."
good,"Benefits are decent regarding healthcare, vision & dental. PTO is very good. Pay could potentially be better as other banks pay more for similar work. Management is poor and could be more consistent, favorites are played regarding new vs older employees."
good,"Good Place to work but lacks Diversity in senior management. A growing company, Hopefully it will start to have a more diverse senior management team. Also hard to get out of retail banking into other areas of the bank. Maybe the company should look into some internal internship type of program."
good,I would recommend Huntington over the larger banks. I worked for Chase and would never recommend them for a career. Huntington is pretty down to earth and not super aggressive in sales. However like most of these jobs there were too many unproductive meetings for my liking.
good,"A typical day at Huntington is working on a auto dialing system for majority of the day, handling inbound and making outbound calls. I was collecting on past due auto mobile loans. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help a customer to resolve their delinquency. The environment is fast paced and stressful."
good,Huntington has a great culture and has a platform for non-management employees to have their voice heard. There is opportunity in the area of work life balance.
good,Cares about making customers happy.  Takes employees advie on how to improve company.  I had to leave because of a mistake I made but I have no ill feelings towards the company.
good,"This bank was a nice place to work but the turnover rate was a revolving door. I went through 5 managers in 10 months, not to mention the number of other employees that came and went."
good,My coworkers and I worked together to make sure the work was finished correctly and on time.  Management always made sure everyone knew how to do the job required and to do it efficiently.
good,I have been with Huntington for over a year now. They pay their tellers and bankers decently. There is room for bonuses and incentives based on referrals and meeting goals. I would try to get into a traditional branch if possible. The in store branches have long hours and people don't want to do their banking in a grocery store. As a banker it is very difficult to hit your monthly goal in an instore. In the year and three months that I have seen 6 bankers leave the instore I am at. In the traditional stores the turn over rate is not as bad. It also depends on the demographic location. Some instores do well based on location and management.
good,Lots of great colleagues and fun atmosphere! They are generally willing to help answer any questions about a particular part of your job. Many advancement opportunities available.
good,"Huntington Bank - as a first time experience in banking Huntington gave me the tools necessary to achieve quarterly goals, make sales and develop relationships."
good,The job is production driven.  You must be good at problem solving and negotiation.  Give top-notch customer service and meet daily and monthly goals that are set by management.
good,"No advancement , fast paced , great benefits "
good,"We just merged with another back, that included a lot of extra hours and weekend work time. After the merger was over they did a week long employee appreciation. Which included a free lunch, free ice cream, and free gifts. It was a nice way to say thank you."
good,"Huntington is a great place to work , the pay is great. However they are very sales driven at Huntington. If it wasn't for my manager I would still be there"
good,I assist customers with all of their banking needs and always did for new sales opportunities.  I also look for new business opportunities as well when working with customers.
good,"Communication is not very good with branches, tellers, managers and upper management. Excellent compensations for employees. A lot of turn over putting a huge strain on all of the other employees of the branch."
good,"FirstMerit Bank was acquired by The Huntington National Bank. As Huntington is based out of Columbus Ohio, the International Trade department was kept in Columbus."
good,"I really enjoy working for FirstMerit Bank, I've learned a lot while working for the company. I've worked in quite a few departments starting as a temporary employee."
good,Started as Encoder and assisted in the mailroom. Switched departments and worked in Lockbox. Very high volume of work and very fast paced. Very team oriented.
good,"Increased business through networking and building new client relationships. I marketed retail deposit accounts and consumer loans via cross-selling the features and benefits to the consumer."
good,Day to day co-workers and managers push you to be the best worker you can be. Daily coaching to improve sales and to make you become the best you can be.
good,Company is consistantly wanting sales. The goal is high each month but is do-able. However if you dont have the sales personality it is a difficult career to be in.
good,"The most enjoyable part of being a bank teller was the customer interaction.  There were many ""regular"" customers that I was able to build rapport with. I was responsible for opening and closing the bank.  That included balancing teller drawers, locking the vault, accepting incoming monies, and processing deposits, withdraws, and payments."
good,Branch is a very busy location. Service customers from different locations. Love helping out customers to the best of their needs.
good,"A typical day at work was processing routine financial transactions for clients, answering questions and making referrals.  I learned to balance & maintain a cash drawer, to work as a team and to give attention to important details. Management was friendly but firm.  My co-workers were friendly and hard-working.  The hardest part of the job was pressure to sell bank products.  The most enjoyable part of the job was immediately seeing the results of my work."
good,"Insurance isn't cheap but they do try the best that they can to provide a good balance between work and family life."
good,I have gained a lot of Valuable financial experience working at FirstMerit Bank.  There was always an opportunity to learn more as things were quickly changing.  My co-workers are great team players and management is very support of growth.
good,"Huntington is a great place to work. Depending on the location you work at will depend on how great the management is. I worked for two different locations. One which, my manager was amazing! The other, not so much. You do work every other weekend. Also, you could work up till 8 pm some days. If you have children this might live up to work/life balance."
good,Huntington Bank was a great place to work.  I would recommend this company to anyone.  They are very professional and customer focused.
good,Huntington Bank offers a great starter sales experience for young professionals just getting out of college. there is a lot f turnover from the top down.
good,I just moved to the area and working in a bank was a great way for me to meet people. I would have worked here longer if I didn't have to work the weekends.
good,"A typical day includes building and maintaining databases and monitoring the department printers to ensure they are running smoothly. My co-workers are fantastic! If someone needs help with something, they will all offer to help."
good,"Worked under high pressure but learnt new things during this project."
good,I worked in the call center and after your 100th call you've taken for the day it begins to wear on you. They have great benefits but the daily grind wears you fast.
good,Love working with my team in Fremont. Great staff and also a good company. Innovative processes for banking and excellent training programs.
good,"Worked at the Polaris location.  So many people, but many opportunities to advance or move out of your department.  Polaris traffic was the biggest downfall"
good,They take care of the employees. The pay is very good but the stress and goals are very high as well. The training program is excellent and they have a continued education program to continue learning your job.
good,Everything is routine and repetitive  Huntington is committed to helping the community with aiding in the Pelotonia  race.
good,"I worked for Huntington Bank for 19 wonderful years in the collections department, I enjoyed the co-workers and the benefits at Huntington Bank."
good,"Good place to work overall"
good,Enjoyed the culture and co-workers. I managed a staff of 150 direct and indirect reports in multiple servicing sites.  I was offered many opportunities to grow within the company over the years which resulted in my personal and professional growth..
good,Great workplace and very understanding to their employees
good,I never got to see my children. Would never go back and work there.
good,"•	Develop and oversee relationships with high- and ultra-high-net worth clientele in Ohio"
good,A company that invests in it's employees by encouraging a healthy work/life balance. Great management program that trickles down from the top. Great place for women to work their way up.
good,Acquired great experience in teamwork to meet and exceed monthly sales goals. Great company to work for for someone who is looking to pursue a career in banking.
good,"A typical work day would include completing required audits, coaching team members on operations, services, and sales. Completing a monthly schedule for all employees."
good,This is a good starter job for someone who is interested in sales. you learn about many products as well as how to sell them. You feel like family
good,Great way to get involved in a company that cares about your personal and professional life.
good,I worked on the teller line for Huntington National Bank. The management is great! They are very helpful and let you know in a productive way if things are not going well. My coworkers were great!
good,"A typical day involved processing customer request, opening accounts, managing tellers, manage cash flow coming into and going out of the bank, and ensuring proper operation and regulations of the bank and government."
good,At Huntington I managed the mortgage research and customer service departments.  The customer service department was responsible for answering customer inquiries by telephone and the research department responded to customer inquiries via written correspondence.
good,"Days consisted mostly of customer service, developing relationships by asking need based questions. You can not help a customer without first knowing what they need. I cherish the times spent with customers discussing business and some personal needs. I was honored to work with some of the greatest co-workers at HNB. Very dedicated, caring and fun individuals that I hope to continue our friendship."
good,"Not a fan of bugging shoppers, but once you get a customer base you won't have as much time to do it all the time which is good."
good,Huntington offered a lot of perks to their employees. They also were flexable with schedules.
good,"i left thinking the grass was greener on the other side, but it was not. This company has been the best place i have ever worked and will try my hardest to make i end back up here. They take care of the people and awesome work life balance."
good,"many different items came your way each day "
good,Very good company to grow with. Co workers are friendly management is great.
good,"If you get pasted that the leadership is all about themselves, the company is a great place to be. they look after you and encourage the best with some sales pressure."
good,Huntington is a good place to work. Nice environment and polices.
good,I have grown with the company for the past 6 years. I've been able to excel and develop my career from being a teller to a small business underwriter.
good,"As a Co-Manager at Huntington Bank, I participate in and oversee all daily activities.  This includes opening/closing procedures, cash shipment, night drop, ATM and sales/operations coaching.  I also oversee all policies and procedures in the branch to ensure we are up to pace.  I am also responsible for viewing reports and closing month, quarterly and yearly gaps."
good,"To develop and maintain knowledge of all loan products, bank policies and procedures within the bank to better myself within the department. To complete all regulatory training to help be make the correct decision to resolve issues to process loans without error. I display a high level of energy in my position. I’m very eager to help with my department as needed. I’m a very reliable employee and my attendance is excellent. My work ethic is one of my strongest qualities. I interact well with employees within and outside of the department. I always do my best to resolve any issues that the personal banker or management brings to my attention in a timely manner."
good,Normally a prety busy branch but our clients care about us and we care about clients. I love when clients that have been with the bank for years come in and they have anew life event they cant wait to share with us or need help with and we know for different things we can lean on our clients too.
good,"great work environment. Worked as QA thru contractor, Learned agile methodology."
good,Worked on the teller line doing daily transactions and cash handling.
good,My typical day at work involves prospecting current customers for new opportunities and seeking new customers. I've learned asking questions leads to a better rapport and more accounts. My management team provides training to enforce our culture. My co-workers and I work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is reaching potential customers to promote the bank. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing a solution to the customers concerns.
good,"I have learned a lot about people in my position. I have made some good friends out of many of the customers, as for you see them on a weekly basis. With economy there has been a lot of cut backs with positions so you are forced to do more work per person which doesn't give you the chance anymore to be as friendly as you would like to be."
good,Hours and expectations very demanding compared to compensation.
good,I am a fun outgoing successful self motivated individual.  I am pursuing a position where I can utilize my strategies and entrepreneurial spirit to build strong customer relationship.  I have a proven track record of being a top performer and am ready to show those skills to a new company.
good,"Working at a bank taught me a lot about analyzing and being precise. Making sure every transaction was correct, audits were completed and money was accounted for was very important."
good,I was a teller and I worked with the public daily. I learned how to deal with every type of person. My co-workers were enjoyable to work with.
good,"Ok benefits, ok vacation. Small bank which is nice, you get to know lots of people. Advancement somewhat difficult."
good,Great corporate culture. Progressive organization.Great work life balance.
good,"Challengeable, learn alot on line, work well with others,"
good,A great place to start in the work field. Really diverse company. A great job for those who need a more flexible schedule.
good,A New Atmosphere at A Quick and Challenging Pace and Great Co-Workers however Short Staffed
good,I enjoyed the sells aspect of being able to make my own paycheck.
good,Good benefits and pay is better than most banks.  The sales goals are high and the environment is stressful. Good customer focus. They promote community involvement but on personal time.
good,"in my position while i worked at huntington, for the most part i was left alone and not micromanaged.  I had to occasionally train others, but I could just quietly work and do my job without issue."
good,"Attention to detail is a must, as well as people skills and handling money.  You will count out a lot of money in this position.  Hours are okay and can be flexible which is nice. Seniority gets first pick for time off so that can be frustrating at times.  But good coworkers make it a fun, relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Good company. The only way to make more money is to keep changing department. Besides that working for the company was a good experience.,............"
good,If you’re in with upper management it’s great. Not the best pay for everyday folks who do the customer facing work. Banking is moving to more digital base and those of us with 10+ years experience aren’t as valued as we once were
good,"Although the pay and health benefits lack, the benefit of working from home is hard to beat. There is a lot of great people at Huntington to work with."
good,You will only excell if you meet sales goals. There is a lot pressure on sales. Offers good benefits. Be cautious of the location you apply to because that plays a big role in sales.
good,"High pressure for results but good team environment and everyone willing to help each other, good open door policy with my one up!"
good,"This was a great job with awesome benefits.  I loved my coworkers and my managers.  I was provided the training needed to completely do my job, I just wasn't a good fit."
good,Huntington is a great place for a person to start as a teller and work their way up to management and other roles. Opportunities are endless. You are able to stay in retail banking and then work your way to other avenues.
good,Great place to work. Very productive and always looking for ways to improve the process. Benefits package was excellent. Some managers needed to work on the people skills.
good,"This is not a bad place to work, but like every workplace there are challenges. The workplace culture varies from branch to branch and from branches to corporate offices, and there is often a feeling that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, which can cause confusion. The company overall is pretty great, but the employees could be more pleasant to one another when communicating between departments."
good,Decent place to work. Call nights required. Monthly expectations for revenue growth. Hard to advance within the company. Overall a nice place to work.
good,"I loved the job four years ago when I started. This past year, we were part of a large acquisition, and there were a number of changes in the company for the worse. Things became much more cutthroat. There is a lot of turnover, particularly in the in-store locations. It is also very cliquey within certain groups of branches. There hasn't been a lot done with the turnover issue, and ultimately, it falls on the branch manager for making up the hours, due to the no overtime policy. The bank just seems to have become more greedy, and don't seem to have the employees best interest at heart compared to a few years ago."
good,"I learned a lot as a person who did not know anything about banking other then monitoring my own accounts. I'm glad the hiring person took a chance to hire me when they did! I had a great trainer who was patient, willing to help me understand things and so where some of the managers I had. "
good,The typical work day was about 9 hours however the time always went face because the amount of work. It was a great team work environment.  Everyone was always will to help each other.
good,"i learned about different types of loans, handled customer concerns.  the one thing i didnt like was when they took over another bank, they told us our jobs were not at risk, that was a lie..."
good,Everything they do really is for the customer.  They pride themselves on it.  From starting 24 Hour Grace to making it easier to buy a home they stand beside doing what is best for our Huntington family.
good,"working in the middle of a project that requires 50 - 60 hours per week. Its ok because it for 3 to 4 months. Then the hours get closer to normal. The people work hard but they have enough people to do the work. There is no excessive work loads when a person leaves. The bank replaces the person. The promise was that there would be interaction within my group and I am glad there is none. On the first day, I was not introduced and had to find out the line of management via org chart. My peers are in a click and talk bad behind people's back just about every time they meet. Its a very immature and management allows this to continue. However, there are very good folks scattered there."
good,Co workers are great to work with.  Meet a lot of customers and their families.  Easy to pick out what you are wearing in the morning as attire is uniform
good,"A fast-paced, call center environment. Great opportunity for advancement and a supportive management system.  Training leaves a little to be desired but they are taking steps to improve."
good,We had a lot of mergers and acquisitions during this time so it was challenging.  It was rewarding when I help to solved problems and move the projects along
good,Employees are not rewarded for good work. Bonus structure needs work and employees need to be paid similar to the market standards.
good,"Worked great hours, learned a lot in the short period, and met great people."
good,This has been an extremely enjoyable place to work and I have become experienced working with consumer loans as well as mortgages that are backed by the institution as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The day does not get to be overwhelming and being productive is always top notch as far as importance.
good,"High pressure sales, long hours, and frustrating business practices. Decent pay, but no chance to move up without being upper management's friend."
good,"set schedule was nice"
good,"long hours when you work in the instore environment."
good,"reviewing loan apps for accuracy"
good,"Overall, I believe Huntington provided a good work environment. The internal job posting process can be difficult to navigate, since your current manager will know that you are posting out and may be able to throw a monkey wrench in your plans if he/she needs the staffing. The benefits were great when I worked there, though I hear that has changed."
good,"It was an alright place to work, however, there was no flex time for the non-important staff. There was often occurrences for every little thing. "
good,"Ran transactions for customers at teller window. Team Lead for the teller line. Conduct monthy suprise audits of tellers, vault and ATM."
good,"Typical day is going from one thing to another, a constant pace, good thing to be able to multi task and keep everything together..I have learned the agency side of personal lines having previously been part of the company team. The management is focused on sales but sometimes does not seem to listen to concerns about risks that are not able to be placed with carriers that are available, which then becomes the hardest part of the job. With my experience in underwriting, i can relate to the carriers guidelines and market appetite . The most enjoyable part is the team i work with. We work upon each others strengths and weaknesses and therefore make the team strong by working together and not against each other"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was when the customers appreciate your services.
good,Great place to learn retail banking
good,A growing financial company with a mid-west footprint. A great place to learn the banking industry and develop internal audit skills while maintaining a work-life balance
good,Work environment allows for constructive conversation and task completion. Atmosphere and work load (stress) is typical of most banks. Like most banks it depends on your manager and team as to how you happy you are with your overall job.
good,They take care of their colleagues! Look out for their customers and ensure they are an honest and thorough bank. Huntington is a bank for the people and has been a good fit for me as a colleague.
good,"Growing Regional Bank based in Columbus, Ohio. Decent salary packages with excellent employee benefits and a welcoming and inclusive workplace culture."
good,"Good place to work but some management was great, and others were poor. Semi-stressful if you were not good in sales. Great benefits for both full and part time workers."
good,Huntington was a good place to work; nice people and a professional environment. I was just hired on for part time work so I eventually had to find a job elsewhere with reliable hours.
good,"instore hours used to suck but were at least flexible. now they just suck, working weekends (saturdays and sundays ) lead to 11-13 day stretches. and with shortened hours on the weekend you are working 930-715 most days to make up hours."
good,"Huntington is known for its focus on diversity and inclusion as well as their commitment to professionalism and culture. I enjoyed my time at Huntington, but felt left out of the more exciting advancements being located outside of Columbus or a thriving city-center.  With limited opportunity for advancement, I assumed a position at another company. Overall a 4-4.5* place to work, which I feel is highly impacted by business unit and local management."
good,Good Bank to work for.  Partners are all professional.  Most difficult obstacle is the sheer fact that it is bankingm which is highly regulated..  Good benefits and culture.
good,Great place to work within the right department. Some areas have unprofessional management. Continuing education resources available. Team culture promoted.
good,"Though I worked for Huntington a short time due to health issues and relocating, I had an overall pleasant experience with this job. Management was always concerned for your wellbeing and how your day was going. You were also trained extremely well for the job at hand, and it was made sure you felt 100% comfortable before working alone. Pay was also decent. The only small issue I had was that my coworkers were a little standoffish when I was new. They had formed a tight bond from working together for a while, and my personality just didn't click with one of the coworkers. It made for a tense work environment with her specifically. Other than that, it was a great place to work."
good,You will get to engage with customers regularly and develop strong relationships with them them. The work place culture is fast paced and it can be difficult to focus on operations while making sales at the same time.
good,Based on daily activities there's was not enough employees to successfully fulfill and deliver consistent great customer service. Management could've been a little more hands on and with more of a leadership mindset.
good,"I was in secondary auto finance, I would review files on potential customers to be sure all needed paperwork was included. If anything was missing I would contact the dealership & advise them of what was needed.  what a great group of individuals these people were. We were a small department and the chemistry was great. I so enjoyed my time here & was very disappointed when we received the news we were being laid off."
good,"it was a lot of stress the environment was peaceful, Management did not contribute must to the performance of the contractors was written a excellent note about my performance and all the work I was doing but still let go after contract period"
good,"Banking allows you to learn many applicable skillsthat you can use for advancement in banking or in other places of employment, Huntington has many branches to work for."
good,"Customer service was good. They genuinely care about their customers. Not much room for advancment in the company. Hard to move forward, has since been acquired by huntington"
good,Well run Bank through the recession. Unfortunate that upper management decided to sell. Great middle management employees and dedicated colleagues.  Learned a lot about commercial credit administration.
good,The position was one I enjoyed as well as the people I worked with.  It was unfortunate how abruptly it ended without warning though.  My position was eliminated without warning.
good,Nice place to work with great benefits upon starting. Nice people and environment to work in on a consistent basis. Good experience working here.
good,Overall the Huntington National Bank is a good place to work.  It is a fast paced environment that always keeps you on your toes.  The benefits packages are decent.
good,"great people, salary very low, great customers, no training, work environment pleasant, a lot of time off, paid holidays"
good,Productive and fun to work Dynamic work culture. Good supporting staffing  .The HR polices are transparent. Perfect work life balance
good,"Great company to work for. With the merger of First Merit,  Huntington has grown to be a 100 billion dollar company . The colleagues are wonderful and always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,Everyone holds down the fort. There is always someone available to help. Hardest part of the job is remembering the names to new faces. Customers are great and very polite.
good,"The management and work culture was great.  Impressive PTO program, but disappointing pay rate for the work required.   The hardest part of the job is the sales aspect.  Expected to set appointments based off customer needs, but customers are often not open to hearing the sales pitch."
good,"Huntington is in the process of acquiring FirstMerit, so any review would not be reflective of what a great place FirstMerit is to work."
good,Great person to work for good Coworkers learned how to balance monthly statement and the in and outs of banking. A typical day at work would be balancing statements removing exceptions
good,"Every day I either deposit or with drawl customers money for them and help them see how they can save their money. I also get to know every customer because most of our customers are regulars. I am a big people person, I enjoy having conversations."
good,I worked here for 20 years. (left for a brief time to care for a family member) Its a larger bank and there were many opportunities for advancement.
good,The best part about working in banking is the hours.  I was lucky and have had the chance to work with some really great people!  Its a very sales driven company!  The bonus incentives are nice and the benefits are good also!
good,"I really enjoyed the work I did.  It was other factors to the job that were difficult to deal with.  Days were flexible, too much ""extra"" training."
good,I like working for huntington but it is very hard to move up and getting a raise is also a struggle. its nice having a job where i can work at my own pace
good,"ok place to work"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know and assist the customer who come in on a daily basis. The work environment is also relaxing and easy going!
good,"Huntington is a good company to work for if you want to stable job with mid-range compensation. "
good,"Huntington Bancshares is overall a good place to work.  They provided me with the resources I needed to do a job and they were considerate of what I needed to get the job done."
good,"I worked in the IT department at Huntington Bank.  Overall, Huntington is a great company to work for,  Unfortunately, the culture of the IT department has changed over the last few years, and not for the better."
good,My experience at huntington i would rate as okay. The people I work with are fun and outgoing. My biggest complaint would be management. I feel like you could ask every manager the same question and you would get a different answer from every one of them. If you are a figure it out yourself type of person this would be perfect for you.
good,I enjoy working at Huntington. I just wish they gave more hours. When it says 20  to 29 hours they keep you as close to 20 as possible.
good,"A typical CSA takes about 100+ calls a day, if you learn what they teach its not half of what you need to know."
good,Electronic Fraud Prevention.  Debit Card/ Billpay/ Wire Transfer Fraud Detection.
good,All together good job. Great Co-workers. Customer Friendly
good,Not very much room for advancement. We I started 10 years ago they were a company that invested in its employees. While they have competitive benefits they no longer have the bonus benefits they once did.
good,"We login and take incoming and outgoing calls through an automatic dialer. I've learned better communication skills when dealing with frustrated or irate customers. Management makes everyday seem like an interview. Co-workers are busy working most the time like myself, we had the biggest training class in this dept so far and most of us are still here, they are just as good if not better. The hardest part of the job is the responding to constant feedback from managers while on a call with customer. The most enjoyable part is speaking with the customers and really helping them resolve any issue that I can within my limit."
good,I enjoyed working at Huntington until a reorganization of some of the departments caused many changes and lay offs.
good,I work with a great group off individuals. Most know how to laugh and get through a day in a productive manor. The only unsure thing is if and when I'll be hired on. Either way its a great experience!
good,"Working as an accountant in the payroll department offered a very fast pace day to day.  It also led to numerous challenges with system upgrades and the processing and set up of new taxing locations involving multiple entities, multiple states and jurisdictions. "
good,Overall my experience with Huntington was a good one. I upgraded my skills with my team
good,Expanded my knowledge running multiple z/VM LPAR's and hosting over 200 z/Linux guests. My co-workers were great and went out of their way to help when ever needed. 
good,You never know what will happen each day when you work in a bank.
good,"Greeted customers entering the store to ascertain what each customer wanted or needed. Performed store opening duties, including counting cash drawers and checking all equipment for proper functioning. Described product to customers and accurately explained details and care of merchandise. Answered questions regarding store and products, while maintaining knowledge of current sales and store promotions. Computed accurate sales prices for purchase transactions. Worked as a team member performing cashier duties, product assistance and cleaning while providing excellent customer service. Assisted customers in person and via telephone. Maintained cleanliness and presentation of stock room and production floor. Performed store opening duties, including counting cash drawers and checking all equipment for proper functioning. Produced money orders for customers. Accurately balanced cash drawer after every shift. Handled cash stock and inventory balances."
good,"This was a very good company to work for and the work is consistant, however the call center had a very high turnover, which makes it very sad to work there at times."
good,"A typical day at Huntington Bank involved assising customers with checking accounts, safe deposits, and IRA, retirement packages. I have learned valuable policies, cash handling, balancing, organizing and customer service skills. The hardest part about working at Huntington was that we were open 7 days a week and stayed open to 7pm which is later than most banks."
good,"Overall, the experience of working at Huntington has been a good experience. They have given me a change to learn a number of different skills that have enhanced the skills I learned in my MBA progam. The only drawback is that the pay seems to be far less than other companies in the area."
good,This job is meant to be a good intro or a last step the work load is bias to skill level  so whether your just entering or exiting it is a good fit however the room to advance is few and far between so it is just experience your gaining.
good,Everyone is committed to providing best experience and support to our customers while enjoying flexible schedules and friendly inclusive atmosphere.  Flexible schedules and management that listens and supports the teams.
good,"Huntington is a great company with good compensation and benefits and a strong company mission. The downside to Huntington is the stressful work environment of customer service, meeting sales and revenue goals, and poor management within office and corporate as a whole (not always, but a lot). Like any job, it is what you make it, as long as you have a good team environment."
good,"I really have no issues. The pay was good, and the work life balance was good, I did have some family issues to tend to, and they were very accommodating."
good,"It was a nice place to work. The job is very fast pace and you get used to it after a few weeks. The cafe had get food to eat during lunch time, but it can be a bit pricey."
good,It was a great place to work. It had tons of opportunity and the company made sure that they hired within the company first. I learned a lot about banking and credit. The most enjoyable part about working with Huntington was my Supervisor before she retired
good,Huntington provided me with four years of experience in the banking world. They sre incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about banking and helping their clients.
good,I’ve had a great career with Huntington but just feel like it’s time for a change. They hire great people to work with and have enjoyed my time there.
good,I worked here for a short amount of time but Huntington provided me with work experience I had not obtained yet.  Friendly environment and supportive staff.
good,"I enjoyed working at Huntington.  Due to restructuring, I was laid off in my first year of work.  I received a great compensation package and would work for them and my prior bosses again."
good,"Company really drives to focus on what is best for the customer. The branch I am located in is one of the slower branches, but when we have customers/meetings, a typical day is spent helping the customer open an account or a product, and get the most out of a relationship with them to uncover any other opportunities we may have that can benefit them."
good,I loved my direct manager there were some issues with upper management that needed to be worked out. I loved having my regulars that came to me all the time!!
good,Working at Huntington is very goal based.You have sales number you need to meet monthly. If you are a talkative person and can sell it could be an ideal job
good,Maintan and grow Customer relationships through lobby engagement phone calls and appointments. Consult with customers reguarding their unique financial picture.
good,Working with customers to provide them with the best insurance prices and keeping current clients happy in the process. We are also required to keep certain documents on file to better serve existing customers.
good,I had a pleasant experience working for Huntington Bank. I was a new college graduate and Huntington hired me and allowed me to gain experience in customer service.
good,"Many of my colleagues became dissatisfied when they continued to lighten the incentive plan, making it harder and harder to reach any type of incentive payout.  A large rush of employees within the Commercial and Retail LOB's left the bank.  Some had been there for more than 10 years."
good,"a typical day at work is busy, there is always something to do. i learned a lot about how to deal with people, and about finances. very educational place to work. the culture is alright, you will find a lot of people stressed if you work in a branch setting. the hardest part of the job is probably dealing with the people and balancing a drawer. i enjoyed learning about things that could actually help me in life."
good,"I would recommend Huntington as an employer to anyone looking for a stable job, potential for career advancement, and anyone looking for a welcoming environment."
good,"Great management , but office atmosphere was sometimes toxic . managers were always available and compassionate . There were many times managers seemed like family ."
good,"High turn over, but always had great managers who supported my work and encouraged me to take on new projects.  Unfortunately, management was not consistent thru all branches."
good,I enjoyed working at Huntington in the call center.  The pace was fast and the work was fairly easy.  I would likely still be working there had I not decided to relocate.
good,Huntington Banks was a good place to work.  It provided a decent work/life balance and allowed me to develop a wide range of skills to help in my growth and development.
good,"My daily job was to process customer transactions while finding more financial needs through conversation. Balancing a drawer, sells and service. There are advancement opportunities with Huntington and a good pay scale."
good,"When you work for a large bank you know what you are going to get. The culture is fairly conservative, but I will say Huntington is a very self aware company and they really do their best to take care of their employees and to promote a positive culture of ""doing the right thing"" for both their employees and customers"
good,"While Huntington does not promote a positive image of work life balance, they do give you the opportunity to run departments as if they were your own."
good,"I worked for FirstMerit a many number of years. My most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I met. These people supported me through my ups and downs, and still continue to be blessed with friendships. Managing people from all walks of life, and helping them continuing education and moving towards their goals within the corporation."
good,good place to start if you plan to move up in a bank. I felt like there was no room for growth they would rather hire new instead of promoting within. very picky with management positions.
good,"A typical day at work involved customer service, cash handling and computer knowledge. Enjoyed working with clients on a day to day bases. I learned how to meet sales goals and earned various awards because of my training."
good,"One of the best banks to work for in urban areas. Overseeing daily branch operations, customer interactions, all the while providing world class customer service."
good,"I enjoy working for Huntington Bank,  I love being the financial relationship banker for my clients and customers.   I am looking for an opportunity to grow and develop my leadership skills in without having to travel to a larger city for employment.  I love my community and want to stay involved here."
good,Huntington has great compensation and benefit packages. The work life balance is difficult if you are in a in store. the traditional branches also lack banking hours due to call nights. it is very product and sales driven.
good,"Wonderful people to work with, but not much room for advancement. The turnaround of employees is more often than expected in the current field and sales are very important for this company. If you don't make the sales they want, you won't go anywhere."
good,Overall the company is a big mortgage company that can cut employees with no expense. The employees are great to work with love the environment.  I learned a lot about Home Owners Association and title companies.
good,Concerned about employees. Often provide special awards or lunches to individuals or entire group. Emphasize training not discipline. Highly recommended.
good,Great company to work for but the work life balance is difficult if you are an in-store employee. Opportunities for growth are definitely available. Don't work in an in-store.
good,Huntington was a great place to start out and get some good experience. It was OK pay with good benefits and vacation time after your 90 day waiting period. They like to push sales so need to book withthat.
good,Always worked around the hours I needed and was a pleasant place to work. Employees were NOT compensated enough. Working for Huntington was fairly low stress and they did an excellent job training their employees.I learn how to interact with strangers.
good,Decent job. It was steady and the hours were good. Was pretty boring and tedious day to day. The workplace culture was very inviting and they really know how to treat their people.
good,Good work environment. Be prepared for accountable sales goals and sales minimums to attain incentive. Management will help you grow within the company if you show drive and dedication. Overall a good place to work.
good,"While at Huntington I expanded my skill set extensively.  I gained experience as a loan officer, analyst/auditor and assistant branch manager.  I enjoyed the people while I worked here."
good,Overall great place to learn and grow within the company to work for. You are responsible for your commission and etc. Management Genuinely cared about your growth and making sure you got where you needed to be as far as career path.
good,The hours are great as we are open nine to four. Allows you to have a nice balance between work and life. I have learned the foundation of banking while in this position.
good,I enjoy talking with customers and helping them. I get along with all employees. I work as a DDA Collector. Majority of customers are nice.
good,Enjoyed it great place to work great co workers good training nice pay! pretty decent benefits long in store hours was the only complaint that I have about this company.
good,"While working at Huntington I enjoyed great benefits and had a great manager. Unfortunately the goals of the company from corporate were constantly shifting. It always felt like one quarter we were chasing down new households for checking accounts, the next we were tracking how many widgets, or services, the client was using. Success was measured on items like text alerts, and online statements."
good,"I was the Team Lead of the Booking Department. I assisted the supervisor as well as the Team. Our days were very productive and hectic, but we managed to have fun and enjoy each other."
good,"After 28 years, my  career  was very fulfilling and I have met a lot of nice people along the way. Working here could be stressful at time but most of the time my job was fun. It's all about team work."
good,the company provides a lot of ways for you to advance within the company. Management is great and are looking to promote from within.
good,"I was lucky to enter into this job with 2 terrific managers. After about 6 months, both managers left. The satisfaction in your role as a banker relies heavily on who your manager is. Nonetheless, I learned how to be flexible and how to deal with multiple different managing styles. "
good,I like Huntington as a company.  However the work life balance and hours are hard with having time with family.  I have great co workers which makes it nice to come to work when you like who you work with.  The hardest part of the job would be working a lot of 12 hour shifts.  The best part of my job is my nice friendly customers.
good,"Good company to work for. They ensure you maintain a good work/life balance, and offer exceptional incentives and benefits. The job challenges you to grow and perform to your best ability."
good,"You are treated well, but no matter how great you are they make sure you know you are a body in a chair and you are expendable."
good,"Huntington has been a great place to work. I worked for the company once, left the company due to being in school, and then came back. I love it more than the first time I was here. With any growing company, there have been many moments of stress. But through strong leadership and hardwork, Huntington has truly been an amazing place to work. The challenges are daily and varied. I have grown a lot working here and see a lot of potential for me to grow in the future. I enjoy dealing with the public on a daily basis as I love to talk and help people."
good,"This company offers great incentive programs, wonderful benefit packages, and the potential for career advancement. Although I left due to personal circumstances, I would definitely work for this financial institution again!"
good,"I worked in various departments here and all were different.  Some management was almost offensive, others were great.  If you did your job well, you did get recognized for it."
good,"We have a morning huddle in our office to determine where we are at with our goals and where we need to be.  We concentrate on specific things for each day such as loans or mortgages or credit cards. "
good,The company has a strong sense of commitment to core values.
good,"Enjoyed working with staff and affluent clientele.  Daily activities include calling clients for relationship review appointments, conduct 2 client appointments per day.  Uncover client credit, deposit and investment goals and sell tailored solutions to meet short and long term goals."
good,The co-workers here at Huntington is a great team and we all love working hard and helping each other out.
good,conservative and cautious approach taken in all of their steps. Recently launched credit cards and performing well.
good,"I learned about sales for Huntington and loved my co-workers,  The job was challenging and I learned new stuff daily."
good,"Was a great place to work.  Was laid off in 2008 so still soured by that.  However, they did promote from within, I was promoted 5 times and moved 3 times for the company."
good,Good place to work. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement in all aspects of the financial industry with Huntington.
good,"I loved my job but did not love that the company was so focused on sales rather than actual client needs. Sales are obviously a vital part of the job but not every customer needs 2-4 checking and savings. Other than that I loved my job, loved that for the most part I got overtime whenever I wanted. loved the people I worked with"
good,Helped customers achieve their banking needs through offering products that met their financial goals. I learned how to work with customers and provide excellant customer service. The management always had the best interest at heart of the employees at the bank as well as the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was seeing customers in financial situations that did not allow them to meet their goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and fostering relationships with them to meet their needs.
good,"Good company a lot to offer as a bank but depending where you live the opportunity for advancement could be great or could be slim just because of availabilty. It is a company you can learn a lot from working there. You learn how to deal with the ""politics"" of big companies. Some locations live up to the stereotype of its who you know not what you know. You learn about banking a lot of course which then teaches you about yourself and your finances. It is a great place to learn about the city you live in as well. They have a great number of volunteers and opportunities available year around helping all ages, races, and genders."
good,"I had good co-workers, friendly place to work,"
good,I have been very lucky to be a part of Huntington Bank for almost 8 years. Over the years management has been very supportive in career advancement opportunities.
good,This company has many opportunities of advancement. Educational services were offered to help with the job. Management was friendly and willing to work with students' schedules.
good,"The management and staff are nice. The environment is similar to any other call center. Strong focus on maintaining stable call times, shifting breaks in order to prevent long waits on the phone. There are some days where communication from one department to another can become a hassle in the operation center. A majority of those in management are responsive to their employees."
good,"I will typically spend my day working via email, with some phone calls. My portfolio of coverage consists of commercial clients, whom i support with their online banking and treasury services. I also partner with other business segments to fulfill client needs. The work varies day to day, which keeps things interesting and fresh, never encountering the exact same problem twice."
good,Work consisted of many meetings revolving around assigned projects in order to determine the potential impacts and the needed requirements to move forward on the project.   You had numerous opportunities to learn the business and applications you were assigned to.  You also were afforded the opportunity to meet different level of management at various events that were held throughout the year.    The hardest part of the job was the twists and turns with trying to get the project done by the deadline that sometimes moved for various reasons whether it was because of impacts or because of priority changes by management.  But throughout the project life cycle the people were great to work with and really bonded and supported each other in whatever manner they could.
good,"This position required self-motivation and great attention to detail.  I worked predominantly with self-insured health insurance, which required extensive work directly with the client, and the claims administrator.  Also responsible for marketing the accounts annually, and all reporting."
good,"Conservative, mid-western regional bank.  Nice work/life balance with a good culture and people.  Not always easy to execute strategy on the commercial side, particularly in nuanced industry sectors."
good,"I loved Huntington's philosophy of putting the customer first, which is different than most banks. Scheduling allows for a great work/life balance. They have great benefits and time off. Management can vary greatly in experience, drive, and motivation depending on the branch. I would suggest making sure that your manager's goals align with yours prior to beginning to work here. Overall, a great place to work."
good,Grate company to work for good benefits. Amazing atmosphere managment is amazing. Monthly insentives.  16 hourly to start 401k with match paid life. Offer medical dental vision and a good price. Short term and long term disability.  128 hours of PTO.
good,I enjoy the culture at Huntington.  They are very forward thinking.  I have worked for two departments.  Managers want to see you prepare for success.
good,"a snowy day"
good,"Easton location in Columbus is a great environment, cannot say I have heard the same about other locations but overall a great company to work for with job advancement capability"
good,"Really fun atmosphere, great learning curve along with good exposure."
good,Excellent place to grow and apply your Agile/scrum skills.  Great for product innovation.  Digital Channels is the place to be in for new and Large initiatives
good,The hardest part of the job was physical. Standing on a hard surface in one spot for hours if very rough on your back and feet. On slower days where you could move around it would not be so bad but when busy you could not leave your computer and chairs were not provided or allowed.
good,HNB has a great culture. They have a CEO who really lives the mission as well as his whole administrative team. Inclusion is a big piece of their mission and they live up to it.
good,Huntington is a fair company to work for with opportunity for growth and advancement and positive environment.  They stay compliant with government guidelines and ongoing training.
good,Huntington has a great place to work. Very diverse and the culture of putting the customers first among the employees is second nature. The management team on all levels keep the employees in the loop in regards to important information needed.
good,"Huntington has come a long way over the last 10 years toward becoming a category of one company. They have an inclusive culture and support various business resource groups to help foster inclusion. They still need a little work on their work-life-balance, but have come a long way."
good,Shifts were very wide spread but you were required to work every weekend. Time off was hard to come by in this call center setting. Time was monitored  down to the second.
good,Huntington itself was a good place to work with great management. Insight as a contracting company was terrible to work for as they had little communication and lost the contract and thus we lost our jobs.
good,"I only had issues with in store branch hours, location. Long lunches making long days. There were a lot of complaints due to the fact that turnover in the in store branches were reducing consistency."
good,Compared to other banks Huntington was very good about pay scale. Job was fast paced at times but training was good enough to handle it. Goals were high but obtainable.
good,First Merit had an above average Accounting and Finance function and was very well managed from a budget perspective. Good Challenges and ability to learning new concepts and practices.
good,"FirstMerit Bank was a very good place to work, When it was acquired by Huntington Bank, I saw a very different style of management. At FirstMerit, employees were assigned tasks and the  individuals made decisions within the scope of that task. In the period of time while the merger was awaiting regulatory approval, I became aware that Huntington had separate management areas that didn't really communicate well with other areas and were intent on maintaining power. In addition, decisions were made by committees, resulting in numerous meetings and much wasted time."
good,"Plenty of opportunity within the company! Sales are fairly seldom to achieve. If you have a great team at the branch, and an active pipeline this job is right for you :)"
good,"If you are someone who can take the retail world and the stress of learning a lot on your own on the fly, the job may be for you. Thankfully, it isn't push sales, but the training (despite being very extensive and hard to keep up with) leaves a lot for you to learn by teaching yourself, especially if you don't have supportive coworkers. My manager was extremely nice otherwise, though, and I have heard similar stories with other managers. Not by any means the worst job ever, but it can get repetitive and a bit stressful very quickly"
good,Loved the office and the managers. everyone was eager to help and they worked well with my school schedule. I would recommend anyone to work here. Flexible with scheduling and training for other positions.
good,"really depends on your management, every branch and district is different. just like all places of work there are some good and some bad eggs. The benefits are good, attainable goals for bankers, and it is a good culture overall."
good,"Smaller national bank, tries hard to do right thing for customer.  Has typical limitations for salaries but good with bonuses depending on where you work.  Needs life work balance policy."
good,"I absolutely loved working for the bank as a regular phone bank customer service rep. The pay was nice, benefits are great, and environment is extremely friendly. However, I was ""promoted"" into another team, lost my chance at incentive bonuses, barely increased my hourly salary, and added a significant amount of stress."
good,"Huntington has great culture and benefits, in depth  training programs.  However, high turnover with staffing shortage which takes effect on the whole branch and job expectation"
good,"Typical work day "
good,"I learned all about mortgages and rates, how to build credit. Management in the branch was great, but corporate was all about the buddy system. Hard to move up unless you were close to a higher up."
good,I think that best part of working with Huntington was the benefits. They offer great insurance as well as options for 401K. I didn't like how competitive it was with selling certain products or accounts.
good,"Well managed company,  Positive working environment, employees are encouraged & rewarded to learn and advance.  Teamwork was integral part of the corporate culture."
good,For a long time HNB has been a good place to work.  I would still be there if my job hadn't been eliminated due to a reduction in force.  The pay was good and the hours and workload were reasonable.
good,"The company offers excelent banking products to consumers and businesses."
good,Great management to work for. Work is environment is very good. The most enjoyable part of my job is the staff i work with. A typical day involves being assigned 5-8 cases a day and working through those cases.

good,"There are many plusses about working at Huntington, including the ability to work remotely, progressive/supportive executive leadership team, nice facilities, sustained growth, etc.  After two years in my current role, I am hoping to explore advancement opportunities."
good,"I found advancement to be a great service within FirstMerit, as well as training and technology.  I was disappointed with the lack of professionalism overall with management as absenteeism, no followup, and unapproachable.  The company was very supportive and rewarded employees with gifts for appreciation and vacation days."
good,Served the Collections department in the role of an Administrative Assistant. The Management Team at that time had an open door policy and would listen to their employees.
good,Overall a great place to work.  Huntington takes care of their customers and their employees. Had the opportunity to advance within the company rapidly and liked that they hire from the inside first.
good,Working for Huntington bank gave me the opportunity to utilize my sales experience and education to grow with the bank and be an assistant manager. Even though it is a challenging position because you wear different hats - it allows you to be resourceful to the team and the customers. It allows you to be in charge and handle any situation that comes to play.
good,Great community with great co workers. Lots of room for advancement. I loved my managers. Everyone was eager to help me transition into my role as a bank teller.
good,"FirstMerit was a great place to work.  Upper management constantly showed there appreciation for their employees with company activities and holiday gatherings.  "
good,There is little work life balance. Sale goals are impossible when youre at a slow branch and favorites are played as far as promotions go. So advancement doesn't exist anymore. Turnover makes work life horrible.
good,"Maintain and make repairs to 61 bank branches, learned how to become very efficient with my time which helped me grow as an employee. Management is helpful and is willing to discuss any issues that I may have and give solid advise. My co-workers are top notch and as a team we all are willing to help each other, especially when work loads at times become increasing difficult. Most enjoyable part of my job is everyday is different I am always learning new things."

good,"very results driven culture, quarterly results and pipeline management is very important.  Lots of turnover in some lending areas makes it hard to get a foothold.  Very competitive industry."
good,"in store channel hours could be better and incentive seems average."
good,Huntington National Bank is a great company to work for. They strive to deliver simply the best customer service. There is a lot of room to grow quickly with the company so that is also a plus in my book.
good,I worked for FirstMerit as my first banking position. It was a good learning experience and taught me the basics in banking.
good,Great environment that allows you to develop skills and grow. The job of a personal banker allows for daily interaction with both new and returning customers. You can really make a difference in your customers'' lives daily.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is working with wonderful colleagues.  We are truly a team and communicate well with each other and are always available to help each other when needed. Days are spent underwriting and we are paperless which had proven to be a better way to underwrite more efficiently.
good,"Fast pace environment. You take call after call one after the other. Need more staffing."
good,"I start my day at 12 pm  as i work the 2nd shift. Always greet my co-workers  with a smile. Been there for a total of 23 years which makes them feel like a second family to me.  I sit down at my desk, clock in on my computer and immediately begin to correct by 10 keying the wrong amounts, account numbers etc for each check or item. When that is caught up, there is another system i go into for balancing. Occasionally there are times when i am asked to do other various duties i share with other co-workers  such as calling the branches for information, encoding work for  balancing and scanning items to be processed.  I have learned so much at the Bank. Being that i started in 1993 in the Proof Department actually working with checks and balancing with paper to today where there is no Proof Department anymore but the Item Processing Department and everything is on the computer. Amazing how Technology is advancing so quickly. I have the best managers. They always have the time and patience to sit with anyone when needed, The hardest part of any job is learning what you have to do. I have done that and can honestly say there is no hard part to it. I absolutely love what i do. I enjoy the drive to work everyday knowing what i am going to do and who i am working with.  Always happy when a manager has something new and/or different for me to do."
good,I have learned a lot while working with Huntington. great place to work.
good,"Answering client inquires, working in fast paced and sometimes stressful environment. The management team are hands on and most have worked their way up in the company in an entry level position. Co-workers are team players that look out for each other and help each other to grow. The hardest part of the job is all the information that one has to retain to complete job effectively and proficiently. This also is an advantage to learn so many different aspects of the job and allow you to learn bits and pieces of other roles and positions of the company that allow you to grow within the corporation."

good,Customer service in the banking industry offers a lot of useful information for your personal life. Opportunity to grow with the company provides goals to work towards. Hours can be difficult for people with families or other commitments.

good,"The work environment is pretty relaxing for most part. The team I work with is incredible. I am not sure if I can have a better team anywhere else. When things get hectic, everyone will work together to work through it."
good,My experience with Huntington is very simple. If you work hard you rewarded. They notice your work ethic and support you in all of your activities. They pay attention to what matters to you as a colleague. I would highly recommend them to any banker.
good,"Helping customers with their day to day banking needs was an enjoyable experience. Much different than todays online banking world. The enjoyment was having relationships with the very regular, incoming customers."
good,Good environment for both customer and employees. Paid well and 401k was matched by the company. Management was great and you learned a lot during tenure
good,I liked working for the company but like any other company there is alot of room for improvement. Management turnover rate was a little high and to much switching of branches and it was almost to competitive.
good,"Meeting new people."
good,"a good company if under the right management"
good,"My daily activities evolves both projects and production support"
good,"Extremely fast pace, always changing climate with employees. Company has a wonderful culture not always followed by all leadership. Loved helping people with their financial life. Big goals and big rewards"
good,"I learned quite a lot at the bank, worked with great people and had room for advancement every year.  This job did have its stress, but nothing that wasn't manageable."
good,I haven't worked for this company in over 5 years. So I'm not exactly sure what I should be putting here. I enjoyed working there during my job. Thanks Indeed...
good,"Its a large bank and most people have a great time there, my scenario was a little different because I hired into a closing branch not knowing it was closing"
good,"Always busy, from open to close know matter what job your on! Loved working in Installment Loan Dept, Great Co-Workers, everyone was always pleasant to one another!"
good,With collecting on accounts it can become very boring so the manager came up with ways to bring moral back to department by creating different fun tactics to provide so that we enjoy our jobs
good,"Training is good. Professional ,team work. Opportunities."
good,Enjoyed working there worked in several departments. I left the company because of the pay I feel like they can do better as far as paying there employees better.
good,"You never know how good you have it until it is gone!!  Family atmosphere, everyone helped one another. Your opinion was respected and valued.  Miss working there."
good,I expected to make deposits and help people with their accounts; but instead I was there to push people into other products that might not suit their needs.
good,Sometimes unorganized. Unhappy clients and always changing the way things are done each day. Very stressful but the people you work with makes it easier.
good,"I've been working for Huntington for 2 years now since they took over FirstMerit Bank."
good,"it was a great place to work. environment was great, people also. room for advancement. i would tell people about banking with them and working with them."
good,This was a very cheerful place to work with every one working together to accomplish the job that needed done. They always had better opportunity with in the company.
good,I would start the day off by greeting everyone with a hello then I'd go to my desk. After getting situated at my desk I would ask my manager if she had any work for me to do or filing. Once I'd finish the assignment she'd given me I'd go and ask for another task to do from the commercial bank lenders. Most of the time it was organizing paperwork.
good,The branch I work at is great. Co-workers are great and awesome. Willing to help advance career within Huntington and if they can outside as well. Always wanting the best for employees that we have. Management is awesome. Flexible willing to help and have your back.
good,The manager was very nice.. The clients were nice most of the time. I enjoyed working with money. I learned different things while working there. The manager was always willing to help.
good,"The corporate bankers/relationship managers were in constant fear of their job.  Each new manager brought changes and there was a lot of new managers.  "
good,"Huntington, as a company has the right culture, wanting to always improve customer service,  to always do what is right for the customer and supports diversity.  But certain areas (depending on the management) don't care about doing what is right for the customer  and focus too hard on making sales goals which feel unobtainable.  Actions speak louder than words, and the actions that I've witnessed is favoritism amongst those who achieve goal, leadership by fear to those who may need more coaching and training."
good,"I loved working here."
good,I worked at Huntington on contract basis prior to permanent hire in different departments.  There is opportunity for advancements in other areas.  It is important to meet time lines.
good,I had worked my way up from teller to the operations center and was introduced to high transactions and responsibility. It was a good work enviroment and got to see the operations of corporate banking.
good,"Loan Processor. Collect documents from customers. Order appraisals, title work, credit reports, and schedule closings with the customer and title company"
good,CEO and upper management have done a great job making Huntington a major force in the Midwest banking industry.  Raises and bonuses are typically very low but career advancement is definitely possible which does allow you to climb much faster financially.  Routine raises are typically sub par but raises for new positions can be quite lucrative.
good,"Bankers starting at Huntington are recruited from all over the service and customer service industries. Huntington has possibly the best and longest training to get their new bankers ready. If you perform well, they will promote you and are very serious about career advancement"
good,"I enjoyed my position as Ops Manager with Huntington.  We were able to run our office like its own community bank, with decision power to the management team."
good,"good place to work, great work life balance, they have increased there base pay which is good, and them seem to have a good feel for taking care of their employees"
good,"I was sad to leave Firstt Merit when they downsized I enjoyed working there and was excited about the advancement program, until they started laying people off..."
good,I have not worked here for at least 10 years so I am not sure if my opinion would count.  I am sure the culture at Huntington has changed in that time frame
good,"loved everything here except the pay... lower than the industry. great manager, laid back work setting... nice schedule., .friendly helpful coworkers.. . just low pay.."
good,For a smaller bank Huntington came right along side the larger banks when it came to training and systems.  The location I worked at was on the slow side though which could make for a long day
good,I enjoyed waiting on customers. The staff was a great one when I was there. I do miss those coworkers. Benefits were good too as much as I can remember.
good,"I like the customers that come into the banking center.  Employees are always caring."
good,if you enjoy people this would be the place to work. A normal day consisted of helping with customers needs. something new to learn everyday. working with people was the enjoyable part of my day
good,"The best part of this job was getting to know the customers and having the customers wait for you to take care of them, no matter how long the line was.  I had customers call in or come in and ask for me personally, and this made me feel appreciated.  They would bring in gifts for each holiday or just send over lunch for all of us."
good,Huntington national bank was a great place to work. The benefits were amazing. The job was not stressful. The change in management left also was a change in the work environment.
good,"I loved working at Huntington. I think their attendance policy is so strict and unforgiving that it's impossible to come back from a family illness or something. They don't automatically apply your FMLA benefits, or at least they didn't for me. Typical day at work in the role I had consisted of calling clients trying to sell Huntington products and benefits. It was a good job. Professional environment. Lots of opportunities for advancement. I learned a lot about banking and finances, as well as bank and federal regulations. The hardest part of the job was learning to do a sales job. Most enjoyable part was the mon-fri day hours, being off on weekends, and having all holidays off! Oh and they have an amazing HSA program where they reward you with up to $1500 onto your HSA card for doing simple things like a health assessment or biometric screening. I loved it and took advantage of it both calendar years I was there."
good,The people at Huntington National Bank are great! Many learning opportunities. Management staff can be very supportive. Many fun activities with co workers outside of work.
good,"Great learning culture, opportunities to advance, competitive pay with bonuses. Only left because I was granted admission into The Ohio State College of Dentistry."
good,"I would handle deposits and cash checks due withdraws. I learned a lot about handling money. I loved my manager, we are still good friends. I loved going to work. It was a very fun atmosphere. The hardest part about my job was paying close attention that way I would balance every night."
good,"Great benefits package, great and flexible paid time off. There was a salary cap and bonus and commissions were capped off too. Great hours and flexible."
good,"Fast paced, cut throat, but expectations are clear and people are nice. Good commission and decent benefits. Depending on which branches you work at corporate perks as well."
good,Its a very nice place to work with very good work culture. Lot of exposure to new technologies. It will definitely be a place for those who are eager to learn new things
good,I help customer every day and works with a great group of tellers and love my people I work with. I like the job I do and would love to be able to work more with the operations side.
good,There was a lot of freedom in this position. The only flaw I saw was the lack of meaningful work. Management was supportive. There was opportunity to work from home once a week.
good,"happy with work environment, they put a lot into training their employees, and they want everyone to succeed in the roles they are placed.  sales are a must."
good,"Working for HNB has been a wonderful experience. The job culture and dedication to the community is something I have been honored to be a part of. Throughout the leadership teams, everyone is dedicated to one or more of the causes that Huntington will sponsor."
good,Working at Huntington for me involved me answering phone calls to assist customers with almost any accounts they have at this bank. I learned a lot about the bank industry. The hardest part of this job was being able to handle the stress customers can bring onto you.
good,Thoroughly love what I do.  Very fast paced environment.  A typical day is filled with the unknown.  Never a dull moment. There is always something crazy happening.  Love the fast pace.
good,I enjoyed some of my time with this company.  Management was always flexible with time off due to project completion concerns. was room for advancement.
good,"Working with FMER was a great experience. They always assisted with your career goals as well as providing the tools to just be the best at your job. The company as a whole was great with the ""take it own it and resolve it"" motto with all spectrums of service."
good,"I loved working here. I was a Facility Manager in Columbus Ohio for the corporate offices. Days are busy, but very enjoyable. I enjoyed the daily interaction with fellow employees and resolving any issues that they had. I loved the day to day tasks that were given and also new ones that arose. Working here was never the same day to day. I learned alot about my administrative and managerial duties and had full support from upper management. Company training opportunities are few but there are some available, such as continuing education which is required yearly."
good,The managers were nice and as long as you did your job they treated you well. You had paid vacation for both full time and part time employees which is hard to find.
good,Workers rave about being part of a company that is doing something that matters in the region.employees respond favorably towards the company’s culture. Huntington shows it cares about employees by providing health and fitness centers on site or through health-club memberships
good,great place to work. Company has a good work-life balance. You can move up within the company. Great pay and great atmosphere to work. I would recommend this company to anyone who loves real-estate
good,"Each day can be different depending on projects & daily work flow. I enjoy the communication with the client's and resolving any questions or concerns they may have. I continue to learn each day if we have new accounting system. Our Management always keeps us updated on any new developments that we should be aware of within the Corporation. My co-workers are the best. We are family and work as a Team.  The hardest part of the job would be completing deadlines within a certain period.  A little stress, but I get the job completed.  The most enjoyable part of the job knowing I make the client satisfied. As a token of their appreciation I receive personal notes stating how much they appreciate all I do for them.  That alone puts a smile on my face."
good,Met good people that i will have lifelong relationships with because we were around the same people all day everyday but you dont mind after a while..
good,"This is a good place to work for  I have worked for First Merit for 23 years.  Great people, well organized. Processing loan documents, defects, commercial and consumer loan processing."
good,Never a dull moment.  Every day is different.  Job security.  Have been with the bank 16.5 years.  Pay could be better for all of my responsibilities.
good,"Business calling efforts are good, but working in store is a bit challenging compared to traditional banking offices. Staffing is a challenge as well as being able to attain incentive. Benefits are ok, but cost is high in comparison to many companies. Work like balance is good."
good,"Huntington is a great company with a lot of promise. The work atmosphere is relaxed and enjoyable. Depending on what role you're in, the work/life balance may be challenging."
good,"Huntington bank has gone through a ton of growth lately while many other banks are downsizing. This has created a lot of opportunity for those seeking a career in banking. Along with this rapid growth is a shortage of training. It seems as if the training focuses more on the basics and the sales process but not so much on how to get things done in the field. Most would say to just ask another person at the branch but when you're the most senior person there with 10 months of experience it leads to having to ask those at other locations to talk you through certain procedures via the phone. This creates problems at many levels and leaves bankers looking unprofessional in the eyes of customers. Many things need resolved while the customer is still in the branch."
good,"The customers in West Lafayette are really great. The company cares about the employees. A lot of opportunity to move around if you're willing to relocate or already live in Ohio or a big city elsewhere. Also a lot of incentive opportunity. I average $400 per month on top of my already decent wage. Co-workers are somewhat gossip-y, but that's typical of any bank, I think. Flexible schedule, even with school."
good,I enjoy working with customers and having an everyday interaction with them. Since I've been working at First Merit I have learned a lot about banking and first merits products. I enjoy getting to know my customers and selling our products.
good,"when i started working there, there was a lead teller change and she flat out did not know how to train other people, which ended up costing me my job."
good,While at Huntington I have continued to increase my customer service skills and sharpened my management and coaching techniques.
good,"sales, opening accounts, loan applications, calling customers, had call nights weekly, set up customer reviews. worked teller line as needed."
good,"Huntington Bank was my first experience at working for a banking institution.  It was a good experience, but it also had it's drawbacks.  The experience developed character in me as a person."
good,"Productive work environment, sales focused and customer service oriented. Personal Bankers responsible for managing the loan process, acct opening and closing. Credit Cards, meeting sales goals. Advising customers of the best product for them. I worked my way up from the teller line to this postion."
good,"Doing transactions for customer, balancing vault and ATM, helping customers balance their checkbooks. I learned how to respect money and its value to my customers. My co-workers were very good and helpful. Managment was helpful. The hardest part of my job was having to answer phone while waiting on customers. I didn't fee this was fair to my customer in front of me at the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of my customers."
good,"Great place for movement and education. Although this is a large corporate company they treat you with small town values, like family."
good,"A typical day as a personal banker is nothing typical. Each day is something different with something new to learn. On any given day, I am opening new checking accounts, assisting customers with their current accounts by answering questions or making deposits/withdrawals, taking loan applications for mortgages, credit lines, and/or credit cards and getting to know all my customers. I really enjoy the fact that I know 90% of my customers by their first name and talking to them about different products is easier because they trust me and its not all about the sales when we talk, its about helping them to the best I can."
good,Worked for several branches during my time with Huntington. How enjoyable this job is is HIGHLY dependent on the manager and team you end up with. First location had a poor manager and team that was very cliquish. Had a hard time learning or advancing under them. second location was a fairly independent location where i only worked with one other person. Enjoyable but not very engaging. Most recent location had a great manager an awesome supervisor and a very supportive team. Learned and advanced more in my time there than the whole rest of my time with Huntington. Who you are stationed with makes all the difference. Full time spots do not open up often in the branches but there is definitely an opportunity to move around within the company. The products are easy to sell because they are actually good quality. employee benefits are nice. part time employees are still treated the same as full time and can get benefits such as medical.
good,My time with First Merit Bank was a positive experience. I will miss the great people I met and worked with.
good,"A typical day as a teller consisted of handling all customer transactions. I was also instructed to produce sales such as getting customers to open new accounts, credit cards, and loans. I was also in charge of daily maintenance around the branch such as ordering supplies like paper, ink, staples, and of course, cash. At the bank I learned how to overcome objections, and how to deal with unruly customers. My branch manager did a fairly good job of treating us all fairly and equally. She was a good leader. I had one other co-worker and we got along very well. He was also a hard worker. The hardest part of my job was when I was unable to cash check for non-customers. Those individuals usually gave us an earful. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers open new accounts at the bank and help them earn better savings rates. Overall I had a good experience working at First Merit Bank."
good,Good quiet days.  Good management.  Computer system needs to be updated.
good,Regional Director and Department Manager have an open door policy and is willing to assist employees to attain the goals and advance careers within the company.
good,"Greeting and processing customer transactions. I learned that you can be promoted if you work hard at your job.  The management uncourageous their employees to move up. My co-workers were great and we helped each other out when we could. The hardest part of the job was trying to get my full-time hours when we only worked half days on Wednesdays or Saturdays. The most enjoyable part to the job was challenging myself to get my cash drawer balanced in as little time as possible, since we usually had to balance with a lobby full of people."
good,"A typical day consist of opening branch and processing all night drop transactions and working as a teller until teller staff arrives. Once the morning rush begins to slow, I would transition to the ""platform"" side of the branch and focus on sales and service that includes face to face interactions and phone calls, turning service into sales to meet the needs of the customers. During my time here i have learned multiple effective leadership and management styles for multiple personality types. The management here is very good at training and developing employees in order for them to take the next step in their careers. My co-workers here are amazing, simply put, they all know their jobs and go above and beyond for the customer in order to make them feel welcome. The hardest part of my job is simply just finding time to complete all tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job come from this lack of time because I feel I work well under pressure."
good,A great place to start a career.  They treated me well and allowed me to advance.
good,"great place to work, work around your life. loved working at this job. the customers are great"
good,"accepted cash and checks for deposit slip'"
good,"I've enjoyed working with Huntington Bank for my nearly four years that I've been with the company. While I'm not in agreement with their management, hiring process and overall training and development, I understand that the company is growing and learning each and every day. This a company on the rise and should the right people be employed, this company will continue to grow at a massive rate. I have a team of fraud specialists that I love working with on a daily basis, so much that I work as much overtime as possible just to spend time with the team and grow as an employee to become the best that I can be."
good,Huntington is a great place to work at. On a typical work day I come in and set up my computer with all my necessary programs to get my day started. From there I run withdrawal/deposit transactions while I talk to the customer and find out there potential banking needs. I have learned a lot since I have started with Huntington. I have learned about the banking environment and about building customer relationships. The people I work with I can consider my friends and they are always more than willing to help if a complicated problems shows up. The hardest part of job I think is that I don't really have a work/life balance. I personally think the best part of the job is that I have repeat customers that only like to see me because of the customer service I can deliver to them.
good,"daily work was very enjoyable,"
good,"I usually start work at 8 am. We open the vault, and get all the supplies we need for the day. Then we open our night drop, and write down what businesses drop there deposits off at night. After we run the deposits, it is time to open. During the afternoon we are steady during lunch, and then we die down around 4 p.m. I love my manager at my branch. She works with all of our schedules, especially the ladies who have kids. The branch manager helps out alot when we get busy, and always acknowledges the individuals work. My co-workers are very easy to get along with. There are seven women in the branch, and we all work together. The hardest part of the job is up-selling the products. When you get a rush in the branch, it is hard to look up the person to see what kind of account they have. During the slow time it is easy, because you don't have a lot of people waiting in line. What I love about my job is the people. I am a people person. I love talking, and hearing stories from our clients."
good,Ran the merchant window most days. Expected to cross-sell 10 accounts per week. Job security based solely on that. Management was very helpful with encouraging there employees in creating ideas to be more productive in sales. My co-workers were friendly and we worked together as a great team. The hardest part of the day was having to meet quotas. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing up for the day and knowing that I accomplished every task i was assigned.
good,"Daily responsibilities include managing inbound and outbound calls from colleague referrals"
good,"Prospected, cold called and dropped in to meet with prospective clients.  Managed a portfolio of small businesses with a gross annual sales revenue up to $6 million."
good,"Same duties as Genoa Bank with addition of investment sales."
good,"good company pay is nothing"
good,NA Nothing to put at this time other than it was time well spent and learned a lot.
good,"Huntington has been a wonderful company to work for, but unfortunately my career is ending because I am moving out of state."
good,"The Operations center was a friendly environment to work in with plenty of internal opportunities to advance your education within the banking environment itself. I worked in Returns.There were constant time sensitive deadlines throughout the day but you were always part of a team and Supervisors were more than willing to pitch in to help meet critical deadlines when needed. The mission of Huntington to become the best bank of the Midwest meant that customer service, whether internal or to general public was the first priority. Overall, it was a positive environment, despite the fact that my area was in decline and there had been layoffs. Management tried to always transition displaced employees to other growth areas of the corporation if possible."
good,"Working for Huntington Bank was a valuable stage in my life. Contrary to many financial institutions, Huntington tried to be a company that worked as much for customers as it did for shareholders."
good,Assisted the Bank Attorneys. . enjoyed working with the team of
good,Near Coe Lake for walks and lunch on nice days. A team approach helped the staff work well together.
good,"A typical day is calling customers to deepen relationship, review goals with branch, review profiles and objectives with Personal bankers, set expectations, volunteer and be present in the community, and grow revenue for the company and my branch."
good,Enjoyed working there. Did not like all new rules made right before I left. ALOT of people where fired.
good,Each day I would check in and review the plan and goals for the day. I would visit my clients and did a lot of cold calling at first to build my large client base. We sold several products and I was one of top producers nation wide and the largest in Kentucky.
good,I worked at this location for several years and was always involved in high activity areas of service.

good,"There are all types of people that one receives calls from at Huntington. Some calls were clear-cut and easygoing, and some could be quite stressful, due to either the unfortunate situations customers had put themselves in or due to the ways they chose to speak to those of us on the phones. Luckily, the preparation for this was worthwhile, with the advisors at the center more than open to help us out when we needed it."
good,Working for Huntington has it's pros and cons. I love the hours that I currently have as well as the paid time off. A typical day of work is very fast paced.
good,"I learned to work in sales & I learned that it is hard work to work in sales, especially when you are viewed upon that to keep your job.  It is a great benefit when you meet goals as far as sales."
good,The work day can vary.. Some days are very stressful and difficult. Have to be very organized and be able to multitask.  Some days are slow. Very sales oriented. Hours aren't too bad but not your traditional bank hours working in a grocery store.

It is a heavy sales environment and you will have personal goals to achieve if you are a banker and your branches success is your goal when you are in management. The culture is great and very diverse. Huntington is all about inclusion. Management can be a bit much at times, but depends on who you get.

The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers and my customers. Our store was a work-family, and very supportive. Our regulars made our days go by faster. Training was good. Role playing could be used more, even though people don't like it. Role playing helps fine tune your sales process. "
good,"Answered 80-100 calls per day regarding account maintenance, loans, advanced loans, and online banking. Learned to navigate several computer systems simultaneously. Reported to three different managers over the course of one year. Turnover rate was high. Endured additional training to take more difficult calls, but compensation for said training did not increase. Worked with very wonderful co-workers. Really nice benefits, including vision and dental and extra life insurance for next to nothing. Goals for call incentives were out of reach for me."
good,"Overall in my time at Huntington in the few positions I've held I've enjoyed being an employee for them.  The one exception is one of my managers was terrible, but I guess you run that risk wherever you work.  Overall they have a good corporate culture and chances to advance, the reason I'm looking to leave is BECAUSE of my manager.  Sad but I feel like I don't have much of a choice."

I loved working with all of the people that were on my team, except for my managers. They only cared about themselves and not the team. They didn't understand on how to even run a team and help everyone work together. The hardest part of my job was biting my tongue about my managers lack of work ethic and leadership. The most enjoyable part of this particular job was getting to make new friends and relationships with my customers and team members. I made some life long friends and enjoyed each day that I was working there."
good,"In the reconciliation department each of us we were responsible for about 20 general ledgers on a daily basis.  These would change every month so we could be crossed trained on multiple accounts. I learned 90 % of the jobs in my department before the the merger to First Merit.  My boss was caring, she let us work independently to get our jobs completed. She was a firm believer in teamwork, that is why our department worked great together.  Two years straight in a row we received High efficiency rating from the auditors. My co-workers were great, each one of us specialized in certain areas with in the bank and when we were asked to be part of the reconciliation team, all our talents came together perfectly.  Everyone helped each other out when needed.  Even now we have group lunches and meet up since we were let go on November 8th due to lack of position at the bank. Accounting departments and functions were all centralized in Ohio.  The hardest part of the job would probably be the month end balancing.  Simply because it only comes once a month and we had to rely-on other departments to get us reports to finalize reconciliations.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was doing the work.  I liked it when the reports we receive did not equal the general ledger balance. I always love a challenge and looking for the out of balance issues were always fun. I don't like to be board, I always love having something to do."
good,"A typical work day at First Merit consist of having a lot of patience. It can be very frustrating, but the one thing I have learned and always kept in the back of my head is, it could be me in their shoes. So always be willing to listen.

good,"Typical day consisted of taking care of clients and balancing my drawer. "
good,"Leadership"
good,"Only thing I have to complain about is I was doing the job of two people which became very stressful.   I worked my 8 hours then had to come home and work more hours on my laptop.

Other than that loved my job and the people I worked with."

Being one of the growing regional banks in the industry, there are several opportunities allowing for individuals to learn and grow across many areas. Typically that allows one to have a broader view within the company which can open many doors."
good,"Along with the strong team environment, the management is very supportive. My main reason for seeking other opportunities is the pay. The benefits are great,  however the pay is typical call center pay. Although there is incentive pay that is not enough to live comfortably. Other than that, it is an excellent place to work."
good,The department I work in is only a total of 5 colleagues.  Very casual atmosphere.  I like interacting with all other colleagues and departments within the bank.  I'm looking to find a company that will allow me to work remotely.

good,I really enjoyed working for Huntington. I still bank with them and like what they stand for. I just did not like the position I was in and the inability of upper management to help me get a handle on it or suggest other career paths within the bank. Some people can rise above somewhat abusive and humiliating types of motivation but I am just not one of those people.

I helped the with ordering of their checks. I learned that people come from varied lifestyles and that all people have individual characteristics that make them unique. The workplace is a happy atmosphere. We greet everyone and try and personalize their experience.

good,"Huntington has been an incredible corporation to work for. They are inclusive, embrace diversity, and the base pay for starting employees is awesome. Huntington loves to promote within and there's definitely opportunity to grow your career. The only cons I would need to provide is hierarchy structure. Each regional manager does things a little differently and in turn each district manager does things a little differently. This can lead to sometimes chaotic miscommunication. Most companies are like this, but I feel it would be much more beneficial to employees to have like-mindedness across the board when it comes to retail management hierarchy."
good,"Great place to work, Great colleagues. Excellent management. awesome people. good work and life balance. Would love to work at this place if I was  full time. I am looking for something else because I am a contratcor."

I was responsible for preparing the branch for our annual audit. I got along very well with all of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the constant customer interaction. The hardest part of my job is having to say no to a customer or not being able to help them. As part of management I have learned to stay very calm in stressful situations and I pride myself in that.

good,"Overall, my experience with Huntington was great. For the most part, they were very dedicated in doing what is right for the customer. Unlike other banks, the products that they advertise provide exactly what they say they will, and there is nothing hidden in small print. Most accounts are non-binding other than those that explicitly state they are, such as a CD. The company is EXTREMELY inclusive and diverse. They do a lot to give back to the community. Their largest fundraiser is Pelotonia, a bike race for Cancer held each year in Columbus, Ohio. They provide a great work-life balance with up to 16 paid vacation days as a new employee.

I learned alot about banking that i did not know.I worked as a store manager for over 20 years and was told from my dr. need to take a step down and relax, so i went to work at the bank. great experience.

good,"I had great personal experience. I was able to get promoted into different positions within the company, my coworkers were great, and I had a strong sense of purpose"

A typical day at work was, for the most part, good; some days more stressful than others, however, there were incentives to do what was expected and it kept morale high and goals were met. Employees had a flexible schedule that allowed them to easily balance work and life.  Managers had the option to work at home at least one day a week. The health benefits weren't as complicated either. I was with FirstMerit Bank for 22 years prior to the merger and we didn't realize how good we had it until it was all taken away."

good,Even working in one of the most stressful groups in the bank as the front line support for everything technical I think most of my colleagues and employees would agree it was a great place to work. A typical day could be anywhere from running constantly to solve one problem after another all the way to sitting around like the Maytag repairman waiting for something to go wrong while doing simple preventative maintenance. Out management structure was well designed in that we always got our direction from our direct manager and never from his superiors. We also spent a great deal of time training with other groups in the bank for our own possibility of advancement as well as working with those under us to help them advance to our level. During my tenure I only once hired an outside candidate rather than a bank employee.
