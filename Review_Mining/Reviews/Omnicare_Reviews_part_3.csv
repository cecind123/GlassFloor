good,"My shift always started smooth, employees were hard working and Store Manager communicated very well with everyone to complete daily tasks. Closing one night and opening the next was tiring at times but manageable.  Team work and great work ethic at its finest."
good,There was a wide range of tasks that could be done through out the day. The management was awesome and it was the greatest work experience I have ever had.
good,"I really liked CVS Health. They have good pay and a great benefits package. They have 3 Kitchens. 2 bigger ones and one smaller one. They all have microwaves , toasters and Refrigerators. Plus vending machines. They also offer advancement in the company. I thought it was a great place to work."
good,"CVS Health is my favorite company I’ve ever worked for. Working in the pharmacy allowed me to develop real relationships with my patients, and being able to fulfill very important needs of theirs was very validating. I would definitely recommend this environment to someone looking for a professional environment with good benefits. It takes a lot of training to become proficient, but once you do, it all pays off."
good,"Working in the pharmacy at CVS over the past five years, I have gained much knowledge in the medical field, which is always a plus.  Although, the days get busy, having a supportive staff who communicates well together helps us all succeed for our customers and company."
good,"Quick advancements paid holidays great manager and co workers, i enjoy working with the public, challenges me daily weather its handling escalating customer issues or just job duties"
good,CVS Health was a fast paced and educational experience. I learned a lot about different insurance companies and their formularies. Management was positive and complimentary for hard work. Our department was closed with a 2 week notice. Severance was given based on time worked.
good,CVS is a fun place to work and build a great team. You have some great leaders in the company. Work life is balanced with free time. you have to be a team player.
good,I loved working for CVS which was Coram Infusion Services and when I was hired Apria Health Care.  I only left because I needed a full time position and that was impossible at the time.
good,I enjoyed every day at work and had multiple opportunities to advance myself. I felt supported and valued. Not a single bad experience. They offer great benefits to their employees.
good,"i loved working as a pharmacy tech. I enjoyed helping customers and assisting the pharmacist. I filled prescriptions, assisted with inventory ordering and stock"
good,"best place on earth to work"
good,"i just ran the front of the store, greeted customers and rung them out. stocked shelves, put up sale signs, and stock/ face items. it was a very relaxed pace"
good,It's very interesting to work on real life problems in the company which is helpful to take decisions by the Walmart Buyers. The work culture is good and the mentor motivates me each and every day to work hard/smart. The staff and manager are really very co-operative and get the work done in time.
good,Cvs pharmacy Is a great company to work for they are very flexible and will always offer you a growing position with the company it is a job where you can continue to learn and expand your experience.
good,"A typical day is relaxed but fast-paced and productive."
good,"The coworkers and management are friendly and helpful. Feels like a family instead of just a team. Advancement opportunities. I would definitely recommend for a start out job, but it’s not going to be enough to sustain you financially for a career. However it is a great place to work while you are still attending school or just need a little side income."
good,Quality organization that offers many opportunities for advancement and career growth.  A leader in the industry that is well respected and lives its mission to put people on the path to better health
good,"I was only with them for a short time.  The Billing Management Branch I worked in was closing and we found out 2 weeks after I had been hired and left a very high paying secure job to work for CVS.  It was too bad, but I did get hired to also help build the new branch billing and career team.  I declined to relocate to AZ however."
good,As a customer service  rep  i leaned how deescalate heated situations with each and every customer no matter how upset the customer was  knowing that in any situation the customer is always right
good,"Provide customer service to all with a smile. In the pharmacy, I would acknowledge, greet and assist all customers even while doing daily tasks. As a tech, I would Pull, Fill, and Cash Out the customers’ prescriptions. Customer Service was implied on a daily basis to the Patients, Family, and Staff. I would Answer Phones, and Take Messages for Co-Workers and address them accordingly. I would work directly with upper management to do any necessary tasks that weren’t in my daily routine, alongside with my daily routine of pulling “out of dates” from the shelf. In performing general office duties, I have had to fax, copy, scan, and know an accuracy of performance to handle the job. I would collect cash, check or credit cards on a daily basis for the upfront collections that are the patient’s responsibility for the service that was provided by the pharmacy or clerk staff."
good,"CVS Caremark seems intimidating at first, but when you learn the work, you can go anywhere in the company. Great Company, Great Pay, Great Hours, Very tolerating, and gives you plenty of Grace to learn work."
good,"the work load is typically large and extremely busy, but its nothing i cant handle. the pay could be much much better for the work we endure. the benefits are great. and management is fair."
good,I was employed at two different CVS locations. One was a small store that was fairly busy during the summer months. The other was a huge store what was extremely busy all of the time and had a lot of workers there all the time. I tend to prefer the smaller store environment where I am able to interact more with the customers.
good,A typical day at work would be answering incoming calls from medical staff or physicians on medication authorizations or authorizations statuses. I learned the steps it takes to obtain an authorization for a medication. The most enjoyable part of my job is reviewing the medical records received from the physician's office.
good,"I get to work with some incredible clients, and very supportive coworkers in a well designed program every week. My supervisors are supportive and personable, and I always feel confident that my coworkers will be there for me when I need them most. I think my favorite thing about Sample Supports is that our clients …"
good,"I love cvs health. Since It’s a part time position, the hours and pay is kind of low. Management and pharmacists are great people! They train you pretty well and it was overall terrific."
good,"Corporate doesn't care about their customers or employees. Their #1 is making profit and lots of it. They cut hours, staff, janitorial services, security wherever they can. It is really stressful environment. My immediate coworkers are great and my customers are great. The only problem is corporate has control and everything and they do not give us the proper tools to be able to run the pharmacy smoothly and efficiently."
good,Great company wish I never got laid off!  I worked from home so the job was flexible for me.  Been at the company for 10 years.  Really miss my coworkers.
good,My responsibility were to stock and restock every item to its place back. I  also work vacuum the carpet and dust every counter. Replace any expired food or item.
good,"CVS Health is a very good company, that challenges you. The company pushes you to accomplish more than you thought you could. you're constantly learning new things and surpassing your goal. The best part of my day is knowing  I am helping someone as far medication or even a better understanding of their circumstances. Overall its good company that I will definitely recommend"
good,"I would work with the team that handled baby medicine. Contact parents and Dr. offices, get the weight of the babies. Verify if the parents insurance is covered. Set up delivery dates for the medicine to be delivered to the Dr's office or home."
good,A typical day I clock in and proceed to load my orders on to pallets. The best part for me about this job is that I could sit there and actually focus on nothing but what's in front of me.
good,I loved working here! just wish the pay was more. the people i worked with were great and i truly enjoyed working here. I gave them four years and would gladly go back if i ever needed to. now you do a lot of work for the little pay you get but you also gain so much knowledge and learn about things you never knew. most people think that we just slap a label on prescriptions and give it away but its a lot more that goes with this job and they really don't give enough credit to pharmacy techs or pharmacist. working fast paced and dealing with customers attitudes or just listening to someones life story is all worth it knowing that you can just be there for others and help them the best you can. great place to work.
good,Multi Tasking is a must.  I don't know why they are making me do a review.  Its a great place and a great company.  I love my customers and the environment but I do want more as far as pay goes
good,"A great company to work for, besides the best health, dental insurance i know of. Most of the management team are good to work with, great environment ."
good,"I would say that once you join the team it is hard to understand everything that goes beyond the cashier register at the pharmacy. Once you start learning, where this is a place where you never stop learning. Its fast pace, stressfull at times, but still very fun when you know what your doing. There is alot more to just filling vials of medicine. From the drop off station, to the production station and then to the pick up station, where it all ends. Of course there is alot more to that when you are working there, like restocking meds, filling the robot maching, and answering phones. I was not able to return after I had my child due to a major head surgery he had to go through after 6 months of birth. But I would recommend anyone who likes the medical field and loves the never ending learning. They also help you get your state license, along with your national license. I had the luck of having great pharmacists as managers."
good,"CVS corporate office is an excellent place to work.  The management is very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  They are very understanding when ""life happens"".  The best part of the job was sitting at my desk and not being bothered, you just come in, sit and work.  It is amazing."
good,Greats Days At Work I learn how to stock the store use the cash registers management was fair work enviroment was awesome there was never a hard part in the job the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers
good,CVS is like one big family and we work well together to get the job done. Managers are very helpful with any issue you may have and our team is very resourceful.
good,"This company is great for people just starting off, they pay pretty low but for a student fresh out of school this is a great place to work. Friendly and room for advancement overall a great place to work."
good,I have worked at Target/CVS for 12 years and I enjoy the past fast environment. I work with a wonderful group of people who are enjoyable to work with and very supportive
good,"The pharmacy probably varies wildly depending on where you work, but at this location it is extremely hectic and fast-paced. If you can't multitask, this job isn't probably for you. The pay is ok for not requiring prior experience or a degree, plus they will pay for you to get your technician certification. And at this particular location, they will work with your hours, especially because many employees are still in college. The managers are very polite and expect you to maintain a professional attitude and environment, but do not breathe down your neck about it, which is great. It's something I would recommend to somebody in school looking to make enough money to get by."
good,Great for initial experience. Lack of room for advancement. Management is supportive and strive to make the best for work/life balance. Family friendly.
good,"I love being a tech, but I am wanting to go further up in a career and at CVS there is no more options for me to move up. It is a great environment, and very fast paced location. You are always moving and always interacting with customers/patients."
good,CVS is a great place to work in my District.  each District varies in culture so its important to differentiate that CVs in another District may not be as highly rated
good,professional environment. Must be flexible with work hours. low manual labor but high stress environment. must be able to work as a team to have the highest performance in your individual pharmacy.
good,"Great company to work for in pharmacy. Controls many aspects in health marketplace ie:pharmacy, insurance, walk in clinics, etc. Sets high expectations for health standards, no cigarette & limiting opioid dispensing. Best company out of all big corporations in my opinion"
good,Open every morning with Pharmacist. Assigned work station to each tech with daily rotation. I would stay over 10 hours on some days due to delivery day or script count very high.
good,The ability and opportunity to help customers daily. Working with great coworkers. We are to work together to get the job done. Some days are better than most but some are hard and aggravating be you have to stay focused and do your best.
good,"The job is easily learned and not too stressful, however it does get busy and you will have to deal with a customer based setting. The manager is a little intimidating at first but you quickly learn he's an okay guy to have as a boss."
good,"Amazing staff but  corporate  needs to pay employees better. The team I worked with was beyond spectacular and everyone put their best foot forward. The pharmacists were kind, caring, patient and great at their jobs."
good,"high energy needing work place atmosphere to tab & tally employ / task management , all around team player high demanding jobs , customer comes first attitude etc."
good,"One of my more enjoyable Jobs I've had. Worked in Repack and was a good fast-paced job, I worked over night 10pm-6am, and was my favorite shift at the time, before my son was born. Unfortunately I hurt my back working a machine that I was new to and impacted my work speed and resulted in dropping before the average goal. Ended up leaving due to my goals not being met, and moved on to a job where I could not stress my back more."
good,"I worked here without any type of degree. I interviewed for store associate in the front end, than they immediately had me interview with the pharmacy, I had absolutely no formal training, and was trained once hired. It was was very easy and laid back. The hardest part to learn was the insurance part. "
good,"It's a great work environment. Lovely place and great team to be around . Learning curb is also great ."
good,I was a temp filing technician for the compliance department for 9 months.  I loved everything about the job and I didn't want to leave and hoping to go back.  I don't have anything negative to say.
good,I loved work as a Pharmacy Technician here. They really tahght me alot. When I was stuck with things or wantsd to give up they offered me alot of help. Once we stopped accepting few BCBS (Blue Cross Blue Shield) things started to get slow and hours werent so good. Overall i love this place.
good,CVS gets a bad reputation but is truly what you make of it. Of course certain stores and locations are much busier than others. The only downside is the pharmacist is not truly given a lunch. You have to eat as you go which can be a struggle.
good,"Great place to work if you know your field. This is the place that will make or break a career, based on one's skill-set for a particular field. Staff is great at helping newcomers get to know their environment, and on the job training is quite efficient. Most all staff proved to be quite pleasant. Cafeteria foods are amazing too, and priced at a value where all could afford to eat - twice if hungry enough!! Overall, a great place to work."
good,Busy pharmacy with great staff!! Customers are very kind. Very understanding to what customers need and very knowledgeable about medications and side effects.
good,great company very fast pased so make sure your always on your toes because everyday is different and alot faster some days are slow others arent so be ready to work
good,"day is very typical as the other companies."
good,I had an amazing experience working with a different Pharmacist and Pharmacy tech everyday and assisting them fill prescriptions and  interact with customers.
good,"As a pharmacy tech we had many task, with a separation of duty, which would switch stations after every couple of hours. We had three stations drop-off, production, and pick-up; Of the three stations production was my favorite, at production we would retrieve the correct medication and confirm the NDC( national drug code), count the amount prescribed then label and put in chronological time order.  Every prescription has a time order, medication coming from a doctors office or a patient who is waiting are the orders we would need to complete first.There is a box at the bottom right of our screen that would lets us know how many orders are in each 30-minute queue. That box was extremely helpful in determining the pace we would have to work at to keep up with new and existing  prescriptions. Besides working at the three stations in the pharmacy we had to keep the pharmacy clean, sign for deliveries that did not include narcotics, and unload the truck of new medication that we receive twice a week.The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with a customer who are in a rush or upset. We were taught and trained to show genuine empathy towards patients, for they may have issues of their own so it is in our best interest to keep calm and listen to the patient. I really enjoyed the fast paced environment and working for the people. I would highly recommend this job for anyone interested in pharmacy or any in the health field. I have learned so much from this job, from customer service to learning medications and learning what it takes to assist the pharmacist."
good,I loved the people I worked with. Management was amazing. Everyday was a good day to go to work. I never woke up dreading to be there. The hardest part of the job was all of the illnesses and colds floating around.
good,Great employees. Work task has great training. Room for growth. Must be focused and willing to to learn and grow. I would recommend others to work there.
good,"Even though is a retail job, is very fun to work at CVS. I was the beauty manager and was in charged of everything that had to do with personal care and makeup. The only issue I had is that one of the managers thought she was better than others. Great benefits even though it was a little bit hard to get days off when needed. I was also a cashier and photo tech. I helped to unload the truck which it was fun to do. Excellent environment."
good,"This had to be the most relaxed job I've had. Although it is never easy to follow HIPPA regulations when you have a DR or Nurse demanding certain tasks and not having the Patience (haha get it) to provide the required information to prevent prescriptions being sent to wrong individuals or simply following HiPAA Guidlines. The management is a little shady but over all very welcoming, understanding and really motivating. They served the BEST cake like every month for birthdays.This was a Temporary assignment with alot of growth opportunity."
good,I was able to work there for a year before something unforeseen happened in my life.  I have since move to Alabama to be with family due to these unforeseen circumstances.
good,Pay was great. Benefits were a mix of fantastic and standard. the workplace environment is pretty fantastic you're mostly independent but there is plenty of support should you need it. Very high standards. Mostly attainable.
good,it was a great place to work where I learned new skills and made lasting friendships. The overtime was overwhelming during the busy months. Management made sure that we felt appreciated for the work we put in
good,Scanning medicines and making sure medicine was properly place in its location. At the end of the day medicines were delivered to the proper nursing homes a d hospitals.
good,"I've been able to learn many skills with this company including the computer system, health insurance, customer service and time management. Positive environment."
good,"•	Work together with insurance companies and physicians to ensure patients prior authorization are approved for medication"
good,I usually closed with few coworkers. busy mornings and nights. Sometimes not good enough coverage or growth opportunities. Great benefits and regular customers.
good,"Working at CVS was very informative and fun. The atmosphere was friendly, I counted pills, and filled prescriptions on a daily basis. I also handled a lot of customer transactions during their picking up prescriptions. Didn't really get paid enough, or enough hours. New Training was due like every other day."
good,The bosses and other employees were great to work with very relaxed with a flexible work schedule. Study flow of customers and never  overwhelmed or stressed.
good,I Feel As Though CVS Is A Very Caring Learning Environment In To Help People On There Everyday Adventurous Or There Troubling Health And Health Them Grow Healthy And Active
good,I have received many opportunities and had a very rewarding career with this company. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering working for this company in the future.
good,Overall I liked CVS they had great training. It is more like a hometown pharmacy situation. Not very many techs are working at a time so for the most part we were all pretty close. But you would also bond with the store front. It was very family oriented. It was hard work long hours and the pay was just ok.
good,Great place to work and contribute to customer health outcomes and satisfaction. Opportunity to advance as new positions or promotions are available on line.
good,CVS Caremark provides the opportunity to advance. This is a fast paced work environment and requires the ability to meet turn around times
good,I enjoyed working at Omnicare I loved talking to nurses and doctors as well as working with the pharmacists either filling in orders or taking orders over the phone. I worked in many departments my station was in the compliance department with the C2 controls I learned a lot just from the short time that I was there.
good,I enjoyed my job though I do believe they need security there on overnight shifts. Peole were nice and at times I do think it should have been easier to get assistance behind the register.
good,"I love working for cvs pharmacy. We are always busy, but manage to get everything done and customers always leave satisfied because we go beyond and over to make sure they are happy before they leave."
good,I loved working for CVS but i had issues with my manager i was 7 months pregnant working there and i told them i couldn't work Saturdays and the still scheduled me every Saturday then proceeded to fire me saying i was unreliable
good,Fun place to work with individual teams. caring and nuturing enviroment that cares about its customers and employees healthhealth. lots Of customer care and plenty of overtime
good,"I love my job, i just transfer from a store in newton to brookline , my current manager is an awesome person, she is very supportive , and always be there to help the staff, she works really hard and provide assistance to help staff. "
good,"This job embodies a typical retail pharmacy setting. The relationships with patients and co-workers is amazing.  However, there is little room to ""climb the corporate ladder"" without becoming a pharmacist or a store manager.  Monetary compensation is lacking, which leads to a high turnover rate in both the pharmacy and the front store.  This job is ideal for students and people with young families, as the hours are generally flexible.  Dealing with the public and working in situations where staffing is at a minimum make this job difficult.  However, if you have a good team and thick skin, this job can be quite rewarding."
good,"A typical day would be starting off with a review of the tapes from the night before, then a walk around the sales floor to check to see if any thing is out of place. By the middle of the day I would at leas catch two or three shoplifters.Then by the end of my shift I would write the reports up and end my day. I've learned how to be more obbservent and I also learned how to be more organized. My co-workers were very nice and always helpful. I love how the job had great benefits and I love how we traveled to store to store. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what the other person would do once u apprehend them. The management staff was pretty good with keeping us updated with new information we needed to know about."
good,Heavy load of work and fast pace. Occassionally we had slow days but it was rare. The employees were team players and everyone worked hard. It was days were the work was over whelming.
good,Medium paced. Loved interacting with customers and associates. Great opportunity to grow with the company. Allowed me to work at different locations to help and to get more hours.
good,"When you think of working retail, you can cringe.  But CVS takes great length to make sure their employees are taken care of and happy."
good,"filling prescriptions and answering the phone, typing prescriptions, helping customers, ordering medicine, training new techs, cashier"
good,"Working at CVS Health is very regular. Just get working done go on brake and get back to work pretty much, Not very fun. Everybody was nice but employees use to work on their own according to what the manager assigned to do. Overall it was a nice work experience"
good,Great purpose on helping people on their path to better health. great teamwork amongst enterprise associates.  able to grow through effective feedback
good,"I enjoy working for CVS because they are very patient-focused. All large corporations are going to focus on numbers as well, but CVS has a special place in focusing on patient health, customer service, and the well being of their employees."
good,Pharmacists and co-workers were helpful and fun to work with. Hardest part was to meet quota every month. Working with customers on the phone to help fill there prescriptions and have mailed out to them.
good,it was my very first job and i have to say it was almost the best you had more say and everyone is treated equally nobody is left out as long as you worked hard you got great hours and besides the fact it was bi- weekly it was the perfect job
good,"When I worked for CVS, a typical day consisted of managing cash handling duties, providing customer service, providing information about products of interest, and answering and directing calls accordingly."
good,My days would vary a lot between working in the pharmacy or up front. I was asked to be crossed trained and really enjoyed working with both sides of the business. My manager is a great person and very understanding. He is outgoing and you never see him sit still; he lends a hand in any part of the store possible. The hardest part of my position is remember all the names of the customers. I am still working on that part.
good,"It was a fun experience, there a lot to learn at cvs. I had the job in Arizona then i moved to California and decided to find new work."
good,"Review emails"
good,"I just go their to restock the shelves, the hard part of the job was trying to find the correct exact shelf to place the item but sometimes I wouldn't be able to stock them because it was either new or it didn't have the right serial number on the bar code. The most enjoyable part was being done or getting a free item before we leave."
good,I enjoyed the years I worked for CVS Caremark.  Reasonable work hours.  My coworkers were like my family. Most enjoyable pert about my job was talking with vendors and the hardest was getting vendors to return the calls.
good,The hardest part of any job in customer service is getting the job done under the pressure of not knowing how busy you will be.I learned that multitasking and deligation are  great tools to get things done.
good,management was great and willing to accommodate for anything. Co-workers were very diverse in personality. Hardest part of the day was loading machines and keeping them full. Most enjoyable part of the day was any time not loading machines. I really enjoyed this job and would go back in a heart beat.
good,Loading lines with product and unloading trucks and loading trucks and helping stock when needed plus helped others when i finished my work load.
good,It is a start up company but the HR and VP are great person. This company has a ability to achieve everything in medical sector.

good,"CVS Specialty treats their employees well:  good salary, great time off, and a sense of accomplishment."
good,"Being new to HealthCare, every day was/is a learning experience for me. From a fresh man in the Medical Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) to an expert in 1 year and 4 months is unbelievable for me. That's the level of learning experience i was going through. Handling multiple clients directly on call everyday was a beautiful thing that can happen to any employee. I enjoyed every day working here. Everyone believed me and gave such a tough project to me and I proved them correct. My manager and my Director were so confident in me that i can deliver and i did exceeded their expectation. Co-workers were so kind and were ready to help at any time when there is a need."
good,As a pick tech you both pull and fill prescriptions in a fast paced environment. They are very good at cross training and teaching all the various systems they have so as to make you an even more prepared if ever they need help.
good,"enjoyed working with people from different ethnic backgrounds"
good,Many politics involved and little to no wiggle room for growth but otherwise a fantastic place to work if you love the fast paced pharmacy enviroment.
good,"Great team to work with. Learn so much from the Pharmacists. Enjoyed the customers, hardest part of the day was near closing time when you get the last minute, I forgot customers. Like meeting new people. Establishing recognition of the customer so that you could great them by name."
good,"Management are really great they take the time to let you know what your performance is and how to improve it if need be. This company recognizes when employees are doing a great job."
good,"Era sempre bem movimentado, pessoas muito bem educadas, aprendi a classificar medicamentos, ler receituários médicos, aprendi mais sobre o mundo por traz dos balcões de medicamentos, e também medicamentos tarjados, e de risco, ver validade e fazer retirada, etiquetar e reparar por ordem alfabética e sistema pepiz, tinha bastante cobrança da gerencia, porem faziam questão de tirar 2 horas do horário de trabalho para treinamentos mais complexos e direcionados para cada setor, aprendi com a gerencia mais sobre dermocosméticos e composições, aprendi a enviar emails formais para RH, Financeiro,T.I, Coordenação Regional e etc. Meus colegas de trabalho não tinha oque falar, todos sempre se ajudando, sempre focando no trabalho em equipe, todos vestiam a camisa da empresa CVS Caremark Onofre. A parte mais difícil era ter que ficar sempre em cima de alguns clientes com atividades suspeitas, pois existia um índice de furto muito alto, a parte mais agradável era quando batíamos a meta dia ria,semanal e mensal."
good,CVS is by far the best company I've ever worked for. Great pay as well as benefits. The hours of work are ideal. Plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,"As a csr or Prescription benefits manager at CVS I had to be very self motivated and detailed oriented. Its a must to keep up on all plans and changes but if I got stuck there was always the senior team to assist. During our peak season there was always food, games and things to make those long days stress free."
good,"I learn alot at cvs protaining to warehoude work, i learn alot dealing with the shipping end and i got really good at inventory and it was a great deal to learn and being there 5 years i learn alot."
good,"CVS was a fun place to work. I seen and met a lot of people, people that I actually hang out with today. CVS can teach you how to care about a lot of things in life."
good,"I was with CVS Health for a total of 10 years and in that time I worked in 3 different departments. Overall, I loved working there but my favorite department to work in was Federal Employee Program Dedicated where I worked as inbound Customer Service Representative and also as a Resolution Specialist Representative. The management is pretty good and most of the supervisors are approachable and easy to talk to. The benefits are really good and they also have a 401K plan."

good,"Everyday there is always a lot of work to do. the hardest part of my job is when I am standing in one place all day, I like when I can move around or sit sometime. I always move around and do different things in different departments so I don't have that problem all of the time. My supervisor is very supportive and helps me when I need a question answered or cant figure something out. My co-workers are very easy to get along with, there might be a couple people I do not talk to but I seem to get along with everyone very well. The thing I enjoy the most about my job is that I get to go into work early and my overtime is usually in the morning. I have a little girl that is almost 2 years old and Its really nice to not get out to late and be able to spend time with her. I also like a lot of the work I do, it makes me feel important that people count on me not to make a mistake or send out the wrong paperwork or medication."
good,"A typical day at CVS can vary from very busy to a casual day to catch up on workplace chores. In this job I have learned many things including pharmacy language, the process of billing insurance, and filling prescriptions accurately. The managers and co-workers at the company have been the most trustworthy and dependable I have ever had the pleasure to work with."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at CVS is the ability to see the smile on customers faces as you help them to obtain optimal healthcare in the pharmacy.
good,working at cvs helped me to develop people skills. although the work wasn't hard encountering different kinds of people presented a challenege

I also would scan in the new medications that would arrive once a week from the company Cardinal. I have learned a lot more about medications and how they affect the body also on how to read prescriptions that the doctors would write and entering data information into computer systems for patients as well as submitting insurance information. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with customers that were angry about the cost of their medications and not having a set schedule. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about medicine and how they interact with the body along with meeting many different people through out the day and working with other employee's as well as the pharmacist."
good,"nice place to work while it lasted. "

good,"I loved working at CVS Pharmacy! Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. Management was so nice and always willing to help you learn more about the company. The hardest part was it was a lot of lifting so my back would get sore but I'm still young so it wasn't too bothersome. The most enjoyable part was working with some really great people, and the ""regulars"" were always get to see and talk to!"
good,"Omnicare of Fort Myers was a great place to work. That being said, I never thought that Corporate would shut down our facility. We provided great white glove customer service to all of the facilities that we serviced. However corporate felt it was more cost effective to consolidate our facility with Omnicare of Tampa. So job security is a low priority, as is with all corporations."
good,Typical day of work would be to start immediately doing med record sheets and checking to make sure all orders were current and up to date.  Answering phones professionally and speaking with nursing departments from the facilities that we serviced. I worked anywhere from 8-10 hour days. I loved my job and I was very good at it.

I had great coworkers that pushed me to be my best. A typical day at work was usually pretty easy. I was a cashier so I rang up all the customers. At the end of the night we would got through and straighten the shelves to make them look presentable.

good,Have enjoyed time here and learned a good deal about the industry.
good,"Among all of the big franchise pharmacies, CVS has to be the most alluring with their ExtraBucks. But each CVS is different. I was blessed to be under good management in a decent location. The work ethic and procedures are not followed by all locations and if I ever had to cover a position in another location, it was gratifying to know that I brought a discipline and breath of fresh air to the regular customers in that area."
good,I enjoyed cvs a great deal. Very acommodating and professional. Good working environment.
good,"CVS is a great company to work for, the management as well as the culture was great."

Pay starts out as minimum wage, yearly raises. customers are normally very friendly, training is on the job. i learned how to work the photo lab which can vary from store to store. Some of the hardest things to do were dealing with people who used coupons that are no valid. something i did enjoy was getting to know all of the regular customers."

The management is always supportive at all times.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my fellow employees and team leaders. the hardest part of my job was possibly the assigned schedule."
good,our job is a big and very important job. there's always something to do

I also assist in inventory, and returning drugs from old prescriptions back to stock."
good,"Working for CVS was a great experience that challenged my customer service skills. My previous job experiences adapted me to a certain general younger age group and setting. Typically CVS attracted a bit of an older age group testing both my communication skills and proper being. Every day of work was enjoyable and well balanced. My manager was wonderful and understanding to all personal employee needs. He was careful about whom he hired, making sure his employees will get along and do their job correctly. This made my job and work day easy and enjoyable. I would say the only hard part of this job was calling for assistance as needed."
good,Loved talking to customers on calls. Great coworkers and excellent manager and team leads
good,My experience at Caremark came at a very pivotal time in my life.I was able to start over after coming through an divorce.
good,"It was always fun going to work, i woke up looking forward to it. The hardest part of the day was the lunch hour rush, it was a vacation area so it was pretty hectic but it never made me dislike any part of it."
good,My typical day at the job was making sure the member was satisfied with their prescription order and that they received on time .Staying in guidelines with HIPPA The sad part is when a member crying because they are on a set income and don;t have enough money to pay for their medication .The people you work with is a joy because you be around your coworkers more than your own family.
good,I always learn new things about presciption handling and laws. the experience in very different as you are at the maximum exposure to customers and dealing with their issues with the prescriptions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers about prescription and insurance issues. The most enjoyable part is the fun environment between co-workers and pharmacist. The co-workers respect each other and is a great place to work at.

good,"The store I'm currently working in is very busy. It's very important to remain focused and it helps when your fellow workers are there working as hard as you are to keep everyone happy. I have a great RPH in charge, she commends our integrity and good customer service. The hardest part of the job is telling someone their insurance will not cover a certain drug,or the insurance is termed. The most enjoyable part is working with a great bunch of people and having customers leave the store satisfied."

The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing your hard work to stock and restock shelves with product, is paid off."
good,"I worked as a Data Entry Technician. To succeed at this job you must be able to sit for long periods of time, keep quiet and focus. The management and pharmacists are very kind. We did stretch time to break up the day and there are many mandatory opportunities for overtime (only if you keep up your daily typing rate)."
good,Caremark is a very good and enjoyable job. Helping people is always fulfilling. This is a rolling very fast paced incoming call center a typical day is taking calls placing orders and researching and solving any problems with an order. We are all team players.

good,"High integrity company, they promised to upgrade everyone's computers and they did it. They are highly regulated and make us follow a rigorous process. All process and procedures are defined in the manual, which is detailed and exhaustive, easy to follow and doesn't leave me wondering what to do next. They do not micromanage and allow an employee to be in charge when to do his job, as long as I complete my work on time and without defects. Great team culture, team members are encouraged to share knowledge and help each other. People are very friendly and knowledgeable."
good,This is a great Job to have as a first time job here in America. It will introduce you to many faces of people in this city and as well as all over the world. this is located in the center of the Strip where you'll meet up different kinds of people from Elite to superstar to rich to standard down to homeless people. From arrogant rude feeling high standard to fair kind hearthwarming personality. From quite to suddenly brawling of guess outside and inside store. This is a fun place to be. Because after everything we just laugh about what happen and go on.
good,Thew diversity wad great. People always help each other ans everyone gets along great.  It is really nice to be able to help keep customers happy as well.

good,"Not all stores are the same, I just so happened to get lucky with an absolutely amazing store manager and operation manager. How you feel about working at cvs is all about the specific store you work in. I can only speak for the locations I have worked in, but I have seen some very poorly ran stores."
good,"The ability to answer phones and enter data was overwhelming at times but very satisfying more often than not. Reading sometimes unreadable prescriptions proved to be extremely challenging at times. CVS was a sea of different cultures, ethnicities, and personalities cooperating to achieve a common goal."
good,"It’s an easy job, we work together in teams. I have never had any trouble with CVS. They have pretty much always worked with my school schedule, and they are flexible."

good,"Customer service, as always, is very important"
good,I worked as a front counter cashier and consider this to be a great company to work for when starting out/working while in school. I was shown great support from coworkers and management in regards to my student schedule. I believe that the success of the store starts with the strength of the management team that then trickles down to the support of the staff. I worked in a wonderful CVS with a supportive management and team that gave me a good example of a healthy work environment. The cashier position was not a heavy workload but it gave me the chance to see how a pharmacy is run and a chance to work on customer service skills.
good,"That was the best job that I ever had and I regret quitting it. Cvs offers flexibility and it’s a great environment to work in, the management team cares about their team members and customers. The job offer great hours and promotions are easy to get based on work ethic and style ( come in on time, go above and beyond for their guests, and be reliable , etc...) CVS IS THE BEST JOB YOU COULD EVER ASK FOR!"

good,"It is a nice place to work there.The working environment is really good.I worked as a cashier,phone answering ,photo printing and also assisting the customer about the coupon.And also I worked inside the pharmacy as a pharmacy tech ,it was nice to learn something new too."
good,"CVS pharmacy was a great experience. I learned so many things in a short amount of time. Although the learning environment was fast-paced, I was able to grasp and retain most of the information successfully. Some policies and procedures had to be studied and learned by way of repetition. Management was awesome with the workplace, I noticed that we were understaffed with management and this made it difficult to complete certain tasks as a unit. At the pharmacy, the managers are also the Pharmacists. A few major tasks cannot be completed without the Pharmacists' approval. This caused congestion with getting the customer's in and out of the pharmacy in a timely fashion."
good,"CVS is a great company to work for. I enjoy the challenges and the comradeship. Additionally, I've learned allot about retail in my current role. In my opinion CVS is a stable company providing job security."
good,"Amazing company, excellent experience! Truly blessed to be a part of the company. As a professional i've grown due to CVS business practices and culture. CVS is truly a first class organization."
good,What I enjoy most about this job is seeing my customers happy when they leave even when we don’t have what they need we substitute with something that may help.

good,Working here has helped with my passion for assisting people. I’ve become a better leader. My store manager is awesome! My customer service has improved over the years. We are a team at CVS!
good,It was a pleasant place to work.. You can get free visit at the minute clinic.. Products were always fully stock employees are team players and management was very involved with employees..
good,"During my time at CVS, I was promoted from cashier to shift supervisor in less than 6 month of being there. I was able to train new employees and we all got along very well. The manager of the store worked very well with hours and those who went to school. The place was constantly clean and we worked well with customers."
good,"Its Retail. If you want to advance, this job gives you room to grow. If you just want a steady paycheck, show up on time, and your job is pretty much secure"
good,When first started with CVS it was enjoyable and felt like i was really helping people. Even though some of the policies seemed to change and focus on ratings this day versus assisting the patients. It still was a great experience.
good,i love working here. there is a tight nit family when it comes to working at CVS. i come in and a lot of customers know my name and it’s fun and sometimes challenging but i’m up for it.
good,"No two days are the same, however I enjoy developing my team. CVS always offers opportunities for advancement to those who exceed expectations. The main challenge is that hours are always tight."
good,"It was a very great experience. I enjoyed working there and learning about that side of the health industry. It is a very demanding job and you need to really use your brain and be quick. But they fully train you, and whomever I worked with was very willing to help if I had any questions. The only downside is they do have a slightly higher turn over rate so, if you dont have a full team, and when it comes to asking for time off or calling in sick it is the end of the world. But it all depends on who you work for."
good,"Friendly coworkers and good hours available. Customers are mostly friendly and know staff well. Management has changed 3 times since working there, but it doesn't make any difference to the overall work that takes place."
good,"If you want to move up within the company, while showing the proper routines and discipline, then the management staff helps you to advance your career."
good,"I worked at CVS Pharmacy for just shy of 2 years. During that time, I was responsible for inputting, filling, labelling, and dispensing at least 600 prescriptions per day with the exception of 12-24-07 since a blizzard made travel almost impossible. Most days we were over 1000 prescriptions filled and processed. Technicians were expected to take phone orders from physicians or nurses as well as handle third party insurances. Stocking shelves and maintaining inventory counts was equally important. I could not find myself returning to pharmacy work however due to the low pay and high output that pharmacy technicians are expected to achieve."
good,Pays well. Customers can be difficult but also sweet. Lovely place to work. Apply if you genuinely need a job and would love to stay there for a while. Not a quick job.
good,"I've loved working at CVS pharmacy for the past 4&1/2 years I've been employed there. great working atmosphere. Nice, respectful and hardworking team as well as management both front store and pharmacy manager. I love helping customers to better health and to see them happy  or at least smile."
good,I love what I do I greet people  and assist  them if they need to find products and watch as well.I walk around the store  making sure thing were righr.and making sure the store was clean in my path
good,Manager was very flexible and preffesional. Co-workers created a friendly and goal orientated enviroment. Customers always kept you on your toes. Not the greatest area therefore many personalities come through the door. Both good & bad. Should invest in a security guard for that specific store because the employees pay attention to multiple exits plus the register. Definately gain multitasking skills. The pay is pretty low and during the winter months should be provided with cvs sweaters. Other than that. Loved working for the company with great management and co-workers.
good,"I loved this job amazing people great pay best benefits and the location was very convenient . I learned a lot working here.  Stability,responsibility the best thing"
good,If I could work for this company again I definitely would. I enjoyed my experience very much and I would recommend this to anyone looking for their first job.
good,"I have worked for CVShealth call center 10 years now, i think we are in a better place than we have ever been as far as support from managers and our new Vice President customer care;  she really cares about the people and the employees.  Excited to see new positive changes"
good,"It was good for me to work a few hours a week to make some extra money. I enjoyed the staff and made some good friends."
good,CVS is a slow paced work environment with very little stress. We all work together to provide a great shopping experience for our customers. It is a team effort everyday and great camaraderie between employees.
good,"I absolutely love my position at CVS."
good,The job it’s self is easy...the only thing  I hate is I have to drive an hr to work and they won’t offer work from home in my position...but I do feel they are for their employees..yes it’s a company they require you to actually do your job!they offer OT all the time..I mean all the time it’s never a slow time lol..but I would def reccommend
good,"PHARMACY TECHNCIAN"
good,I loved working for CVS. you can enhance your skills in many different ares while working for this company. the only downside to the company is that they don't offer many hours so that can cause a conflict.
good,Being a pharmacy tech has a lot of rewards to it. I have almost been working here a year and the time has flown by. It is pretty rewarding to care for patients and help them get what they need. It is also rewarding to learn about the different types of drugs and their uses. Staff is super friendly.
good,"My job is very challenging.  I take over 30 inbound calls per day ranging from pharmacy, credit and debit and product calls. It is a non stop environment."
good,"It was fun working with CVS Health. Great people, great personalities. No bathroom breaks and the company delivers excellent customer service. We demonstrated exceptional problem solving skills as we dealt with the community."
good,"My time at CVS Collinsville VA was very rewarding. Best team/managers I've ever worked with. I enjoyed the fast pace and being able to get to know my patients on a personal level. They do not have competitive pay and I sometimes had to work lengthy hours, but I loved my store and it felt like my home away from home, so I didn't mind the extra time spent there."
good,"Great job, great people, learned a lot, cashier, answering phones, helping in production, helping with insurance and adding coupons for expensive meds"
good,"CVS helped me familiarize myself with other people. Being a cashier made me deal with certain situations that weren't always ideal but nonetheless had to be done. I rang people up, filled out money orders, send money, help with scratchers, propane tanks, stocked the shelfs, work in the back, i did a lot besides ringing people up.

Training for the computers is difficult because after you meet with the trainer and you are in the store it is very busy for someone to help with things you do not know.
good,"This is a great company. Was in deed my very first job when I came to The States. Most customers are ""repeat customers"" who knows you by name and you also know them by name. You can predict what they will buy and tell them if their product is on sale as soon as they walk in to the store. Loved when it was busy since the time flew faster than during slow days.

good,I loved the company and loved the people. The management could have been a little better but she did what she could. I liked that they were very flexible with my schedule when I was taking classes.
good,"Your typical work day at the cashier/clerical level consists of fast paced, but sincere customer service. In my own experience you should learn the system rather simply and at a quick pace. The management team at was very helpful, as well as encouraging. The hardest part of the job was the sparatic breaking system implemented by our manager, often due to the fact that only two people work the front of the store. Both only a supervisor and a cashier which inevitably leads to the missing of one's lunch breaks. Besides that it was a great learning experience and a company that I would recommend to anyone seeking employment."

good,"have to work in a high pace, always busy at the store, The store is a very busy store. co- workers are really not up to speed with customers demand and medication."
good,"I am in charge of the front registers, making sure they are clean and neat and servicing customers with excellent service. CVS Health is as much about its customers as it is its employees. There are plenty of opportunities to expand work knowledge, such as, learning photo and pharmacy. Every store I worked at has great teams who respect, understand, and work together to accomplish tasks and resolve issues. Over the past five years, CVS has worked with me while pursuing my college degree at UConn. The company made it very easily to transfer and work within my schedule. The hardest part of the job is learning how to deal and accept a diverse audience of customers. However, over time, it becomes a part of your identity at CVS and, personally, I would not have it any other way. I love my customers and making them smile! The best part of the job is knowing that you can make a difference in the lives of others even if you do not think you are. The impact of a simple smile or offering help can make a customer's day! Honestly, there is not a shift where I feel like ""I don't want to be here"" or ""this is boring!"" I'm always eager to go in and service my customers while helping the store and the company maintain a positive reputation."

good,This job is a great workplace to work in. Very professional. A typical day at work overnight is having a complete assignment to do and it is required to be done before your shift is over. You often learn new things every night.
good,"A typical day at work in CVS Pharmacy is walking into your co workers helping customers with prescriptions, counting pills accurately, reaching out to our pharmacist for further questions, directions patients to other CVS benefits, etc.. I learned everyday in the pharmacy; learned what each medication is used for, side affects of medicines, learn to maintain a friendly and close relationship with patients/customers. My co worker welcomes with open hands when I first got hired as a technician. Super friendly and very helpful! Hardest part of the job was to maintain time according proscriptions fills, but it gets adjustable. Overall great experience!"

I took upwards of 80 to 90 calls a day from Patients needing Gtube supplies and took Escalation calls when equipment was failing the Patient. I taught myself how to work the Pumps used, via YouTube, and Googled information about the pumps and how to troubleshoot. This was the reason I was promoted to a Senior Escalation Customer Service Representative. The Group that I worked in and the Supervisor that I worked for were really great. I enjoyed the fast pace and helping the Patients anyway that I could. "
good,"I did my externship at CVS Pharmacy Hollywood (on Hollywood Blvd/Sycamore) store."
good,"I would come to work and make sure all the bins on top of the counter were empty.  Putting all prescriptions in their places per their last name. Filled by last name, helped people find certain items, checked them out.  If they were dropping off a prescription, I would make sure their date of birth was on it, the doctors signature, and people's address.

Print a label to put on the bottle."

If there was something I did not understand, one of the team members made sure I understood and was always helpful. CVS was a learning environment. I had a chance to learn more about drug to drug interaction. The experience of filling prescriptions was great. The customer/patients was so kind and they felt safe with us filing their prescriptions. When a customer would ask a questions about a drug I was always helpful to them, because each day gave me an opportunity to learn more of what I did not already know."
good,i love working there. but its not for everyone. good pay great benefits. just the hours for me wasnt good. they have opening ending shifts soooo if you have kids or in my case just had a 2month old and a 3yr old then THIS IS NOT THE JOB FOR YOU. you come in but dnt have a time to get off. you get off when ever your group is finished. you might pull 12hours or 16hours but you still have to be back the next day ON TIME. but other then that great work environment good caring managers.
good,CVS is a great place to work I still work there on the weekends. I need something with a set schedule. CVS has free flu shots for employees and they are always wanting you to learn new things.

good,"It was definitely one of the best places to work. I would highly recommend it! A typical day of work consisted of both inbound and outbound calls. Prior Authorizations, and reviewing the RX for any mistakes, or medications that may affect other medications. My co-workers were all amazing very friendly and it was an amazing experience. Management was also very attentive, the only thing that I disliked about this experience was the leads that would walk the floor wouldn't be the most approachable. Other than that I loved CVS Caremark."
good,"While working at CVS I learned how to run a cashier, stock shelves, and how to be involved with customers. A typical day at work involved using a cash register and interacting with customers throughout the day, also stocking shelves on truck day and front-facing the store when the store was not busy."

good,Typical work day was slow but steady. I learned different ways to print out photos. The management was great among the co workers because everyone worked together. The hardest part was  trying to work the photo dpmt and cashier at the same time when we were short handed. The most enjoyable part was working with the photos.

good,"Steady work; keeping our patients/ customers happy, knowing them was a joy.  We had a strong team.  The CEOs came from Rhode Island to find out what they could do for us to make it a better place to work.  We got extra raises based on our knowlege.  It's too bad that I had to move."
good,"Enjoyed working with my co-workers, was always busy, management was always their for employees. I really enjoyed my job."
good,I loved my job and I really enjoyed putting data into the computer.

good,Fun fast and friendly work environment.Loved assisting with customers learnd more about insurance ect
good,"A typical work day at CVS Health, is greeting each customer with a smile, asking if they need help offering that customer to walk them to the item and thanking them for shopping. While others might hate the idea of having to deal with rude and disrespectful people daily, I enjoy it cause it teaches me patience and how to stay calm in different types of situations. Everyday in CVS is a day to look forward to, you never know what might happen especially when you have a multicultural staff and management that listens and respects each other."
good,"It was a part time job working just 20 to 30 hours a week only overtime on holydays, it was mostly unloading trucks and stocking the merchandise on shelves and crushing boxes in a bailer, there were no such hard work and mostly enjoying,,management was cool, the co-workers were nice, the hardest part of the job was they cut hours to employees making us working less and making us quit because of the miserable hours"
good,"I always enjoyed my work.it was fun.some time it was hard but i belive life is a chalenge and i have to accept it.im sure i did pretty good.i learned different way to work,different people,Manege the people,their opinion,a lot."
good,"I love my job personally because of the people that I work with. However, the pay just isn't enough and I would like a full-time job in general. On a different note, I believe the hardest thing about my job is dealing with some of the rude people you come encounter with but working in retail that's just something you've got to deal with and to keep moving on and to also not take things so personal, they're rude people everywhere. My favorite thing about my job would have to be being able to interact with different people and to know that I may have made a difference in their shopping experience with us and maybe even in their lives, it is very rewarding to hear ""I just love coming here because the people are always so sweet and helpful,"" and that as a customer service representative is always rewarding."
good,"It was a very productive environment. My boss was stern yet fun, and always kept things lively. the nights were long and boring but overall it was interesting to say the least. I met a lot of interesting people."
good,"Every one from the top C.E.O, to the bottom warehouse worker were all very dedicated and caring, and professional hard workers. Every one cared or got the heck out. Deliverys had to always be 1000% accurate or else some one could die. And every one knew and understood that."

good,"After many years of working for CVS Pharmacy, its come to the end of my time. There were the hard days, where you could get nothing done and everything went wrong, and of course the good days where it all worked flawlessly. The thing I will miss the most though are the coworkers I toiled with for so many years. Day in and day out we would come do our job, prepared for the worst and hoped for the best, and usually finding out it landed somewhere in between the two. No two stores are the same, both in employees and customers, but each offered to me something new that I can effectively say molded me into the person I am today."
good,"daily operations, planning, ordering, P/L reporting, inventory control. Co-workers are the face the company and I always challenged them. I lead by example and raise the bar on customer service. I enjoyed what I did and I cant name the hardest part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work I learned how to react to different customers and how to make sure each customer left with a great experience. Management wasn't always at its best but I appreciated the good times we did get to share. My co-workers were the best people anyone would love to be around and get to see every morning or even during the middle of the night. The hardest thing about this job, was making sure others gave the customers the satisfaction and as much customer service as they deserved. You can't force anyone else to love their job as much as you do. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the regular customers and coming to work looking forward to greet them once again."
good,"Engaging with customers to receive prescriptions and fulfill them accordingly"
good,"We are a fast paced pharmacy who prides ourselves in excellent customer care.  I was a line cook before I came to work at CVS. They took me in and trained me from the floor up and I am so thankful for the chance to become the super tech I have strived to be."

good,"fast pace, get to meet all kinds of people. good management, team work."
good,"Management is great and the staff is amazing. CVS is very flexible when it comes to re arrangement of your schedule. overall, this is a great company to work for!"

good,"Its great to work for CVS, Helpful staff, great environment."
good,I really enjoy working with this company but I need more hours because I am becoming a mom soon. It would be helpful to have the extra cash to help me. The hours were split between three employees and everyone else hours were cut drastically.

good,"I worked in DR for more than 3 years and quit with a $7.75/hr rate. There was no advancement and the pharmacists are stupid and weird. I guess because they don't pay them well too. Anyway, my starting here is waaaaay over $7.75 and CVS just sponsored me to get a pharm tech certification that they paid for and I am now certified. The pharmacists I work are nice and hard-working. My store is so busy and the pharmacy never closes. There are 3 people iworking in the day shift and just 2 at night.  I like it here. One of the pharmacists,  a filipino has talked me to go to college. I am now doing that. The management gave the adjustments i need for my sched to go to my classes. I like it here!"
good,"A typical day would be typing in prescriptions that customers had dropped off and then filling the medications by pulling the drugs off the shelves and counting the pills, labeling them, putting them in baskets for the pharmacist to check. Also, assisting customers with questions, and helping customers at the drive thru by refilling medications or cashing them out when they pick up a prescription. Also, mixing together compounds and liquid medications, checking in and putting away ordered inventory."
good,CVS provided me with great opportunities to gain more experience and knowledge. I was trained in HIPPA and learned a lot about different medications and interactions with foods and other medications. The management was wonderful. They provided flexibility around my schedule and provided me with the amount of hours I requested. Working closely with pharmacists taught me a lot about pharmacology and prescriptions. The most enjoyable part about the job was gaining new information about medications and what they treat.
good,"It was nice that we always had something to do. Work stations were rotated so that everyone knew every aspect of the job. In a typical day I would run cash register, manage inventory, data entry, customer care, process insurance claims, and much more. The hardest part of my job was insurance processing."

good,"I enjoyed working here the only problem was some of the staff there. They were lazy and two people including myself had to do most of the work. If they get new techs that place would be great. You learn a lot here and get to know a lot of people. You actually get lunch and good working hours. Then again it all depends in which cvs you work at. But, overall its a good place to work at."

I can't speak for every branch but, as far as my branch is concerned, great people work here. It is a very close ""family"" environment and everyone is always willing to help everyone else out."
good,I learned to think fast on my feet and to make on ur toe  decissiones. To work as a team.
good,"company was good to work for put 40 years in good benifets, "
good,"My first thought to CVS was that they were strict and I was right. So many mistakes I made in the beginning, but they were patient enough for me to learn it in my own way. Not only have I learned to be a better pharmacy technician in training, but I have also learned to be a better employee to not only the customers, but the pharmacy itself. i wished I have stayed longer, but the externship only allowed me to stay for only a little over a month. Thank you for the experience and hope that the pharmacist, pharmacy technician, and clerks have a great time being there."
good,"I work Monday- Friday 8a-4:30p as well as on call 24/7. I have learned alot from CVS such as how important customer service is and how important our customers are to us.

The best part of my job, is important and needed everyone makes me feel. :)"

good,"Very busy environment, but the overall job is very enjoyable. Truck nights are easy, distributions takes no time"
good,"One of the better employers I have worked for. Very busy, however very stressful. In all I work with a good bunch of people but corporate keeps adding responsibilities and obstacles we have to jump through in order to complete our jobs and they hinder us completing them in a timely manner."
good,some days are busy. when flu season was around it was booming. I get along well with all co-workers. it is a great work place and love working there.
good,"Working for CVS has been a great experience, this is my first retail job and I certantly learned a lot including reading prescriptions using the medical codes used by doctors, reading health insurances cards, handiling the customers is very enjoyable. Management is absolutely great, they are very hands on and helpful when needed, very open to helping customers as well. My co-workers are great and we are all team players, which is a must for this kind of work. I would say the most difficult part of the job is the very long hours we have to work since we are open 24/7 and we can not every leave a customer without their medicine meaning when you need to say longer and step up you have to.

On the flip side, they need a better security system.

Also after I worked there, the got robbed last year.(it's a bad neighborhood behind them)"

Making sure all aisles are clean of debris and customers are safe while shopping in the store. Informing customers of our sales and up selling any holiday items we may have going on.

good,I have worked for CVS for 4 years. It is a fast-paced environment for sure but my team is great at collaborating together so the day goes by quickly. My pharmacy manager is very reasonable when it comes to time off. The pay is not great but you have to also remember that they pay for you to become a certified technician and will pay for you to be nationally certified if you request it so that is a bunch of school and money you are saving. I have been in school while working here and it is great because they are able to work with my school schedule every semester. I think it really depends on the store you work at as well but I have been fortunate enough to work at two different pharmacies in different districts with great management and staff. I am a part-time employee but I know the full-time employees not only get paid time off but they also get paid holidays if they work them or not.
good,Its a great place to work; loved the fact they treat you like a family more then just an employee. Pay is Fair and competive every year. You can grow in the company

good,"The PTO is great and carries over. 3 weeks a year plus FLO (floating holidays). You can use those first as they do not roll over but you can get 3-4 a year so you almost have a month off. "
good,Great company to work for. plenty of room for career advances. great people to work with always friendly and helpful. highly recommend the CVS brand to friends and family.
good,I really enjoyed the detail metrics and support provided to me by my manger. The work could be tough but I was always given great coaching and tips. Had access to a lot of education that helped me take on a variation of work. Great transparency.

good,Management is great.  Work days provide challenges to help you grow within the company. Stable work outs could be improved upon. CVS is a rewarding job with helping customers daily with their purchase of various products.
good,"Lots of teamwork needed in this company, they hire people that work well with others and help each other. Management is kind and loves to find ways to reward their employees for doing well."

good,It was a great experience to work for CVS and advance my career with a company that balances work with life and secure your job in emergencies and provide a great work environment
good,It's a great learning experience for new technicians in pharmacy but very understaffed and extremely fast paced based on whichever store you're at. ..
good,"Enjoyed the work  rptayip. schedules, every other 3 weekend off"
good,it was interesting to be placed in the work place at such an early age. I enjoyed learning from my manager and I am aware of what i need for future jobs to come.
good,"I started as a tech trainee, got my license became a tech and advanced to inventory specialist. Went on maternity leave came back to a job position that catered to my needs and even though I did not stay with the company it was the best i have worked at so far."
good,On the phones all day with a headset helping members with health plans and ordering meds. in a 90 day supply to mail out to members and helping Doctor's with P/A. I also learn new program's. And management is good to work with as well. The culture is good my most enjoyable part of the job is helping the members and the overtime.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ensuring orders had no errors on them, and that they would process in a timely manner. I learned most of my computer skills and customer service skills while working there. I truly enjoyed the place while I worked there. My manager at the time was a wonderful woman, she was always there for me and always made the days a little brighter. The hardest part of the job was when we got really busy, it could get stressful - but you just have to stick with it. I worked long hours when we had overtime, and made great pay. I started off as a contractor and then got hired on full-time. Once I was hired on full-time - they had wonderful vacation time once you get hired on full time. They had decent benefits and a great little café upstairs. I did not intend to leave but personal reasons unfortunately left me with no other choice."
good,"Great management, lovely workers, work and life balance, helpful with growth, many growth opportunities within the company, customer services development"
good,"This company was a good fit for me, Some of my co-workers probably would think differently.  Good pace, good managers, good supervisors.  Would like to work for CVS again"
good,"The typical day is usually busy and you are always learning something new. The workplace culture was great. I worked with very smart people who were passionate about their work. What I enjoyed the most, was the collaborative work environment."
good,workflow is smooth if everyone shows up on time or shows up at all.  Manager not forceful enough on call outs and employees should be written up..this was not done enough at all.  there should have been a wider pool of staffing.
good,I have enjoyed working with CVS and I have learned a lot since being there. I have moved up since as a Staff Pharmacist and now am a Managing Pharmacist.
good,Probably aces across the board. Telecommuting encouraged. Department employees very helpful and friendly. Warm and professional environment. Would love to go back someday.
good,"Having no experience in pharmacy, I could not have asked for a better first job. The community here (coworkers and patients) is tremendously positive and supportive. I was given the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to my team and shape the way we managed our patient population."
good,good place to work and they offer advancement and tons of training. nice environment to work in. Looking for a full time position and insurance. they dont have the openings right now.
good,great place to work great career opportunities for growth great salary rates great management great co workers nice environment  nice customers weekly pay!
good,Structured schedule and work  skills. Given scheduled assignment each day. Your expectations are well known. Learn in different  stages and different aspects of the job over time. Hardest part of the job is not getting bored. Best part are the friendly coworkers.
good,CVS is a great company to work for but they are demanding for results.  I believe they are patient centric but they do put a lot of responsibilities on their pharmacists that can make it stressful at times
good,Coram Infusion Services owned by CVS Health had the most amazing nursing manager.  She was absolutely the best.  Unfortunately she recently resigned. :(
good,"I travel to 3-4 stores a week to help support them in areas where they are behind. I enjoy helping store managers progress in a positive way , whether that involves daily tasks or weekly projects."

I was a floater all around the coast 150miles. I love it. Helped training the techs and learning this for myself. Would love to work for this company again if any availability came up"
good,I worked for a 24hr CVS Pharmacy which pushed me to my limits. The PIC was amazing and made me do better at work. It was a very busy store and that helped me grow as a worker.
good,"The work in itself is very busy but very influential and educational. I the 3 years i have been working a pharmacy technician I have gained so much learning opportunities regarding the work itself and also regarding interpersonal skills with patients, other health care providers we exchange patient information with, and the insurance companies.

I have become a part of a team that has become family. i have since transferred to a different cvs pharmacy, which, of course, is not the same family, but still an enjoyable job. Being a pharmacy tech, i have been able to build meaningful relationships with patients, doctor's offices, and my previous team and it has become a big part of my life. i would recommend this position to anyone."
good,"The work was intense due to the customer flow, however with a good team and proper management, the job is enjoyable."

good,"I worked for CVS finance department for a year  and I loved it .They have great work ethic , culture anf overall amazing company! They really care about employees and customers health ."
good,"I just graduated today from a 6 weeks Training as a Customer Care at CVS. Overall it was fun, typical 8 to 5 for 6 long weeks. First day was orientation for 8 hours they gave us a lunch voucher to eat at cafeteria. My Trainer was amazing as well as the three nice seniors that helped us from day 1 till the end of Training, They were there every step of the way and I can't thank them enough. If you work 8 hours you would get 3 Breaks; two paid 15 minutes break and one unpaid 30 minutes lunch. There's always a potluck! Theres also a dollar pay differential if you work past 7pm and I believe two dollars overnight shift but you have to wait until 6 months of employment to be eligible to work nights, theres also an opportunity to work from home! they provide everything you'll need; phone, computer, internet etc but this is after 6 months of good employment. CVS is a great company to work for. Theres a lot of departments you can be in, I know exactly where I'm heading. I know CVS will be my employer till the day I retire!"

good,This was a great learning opportunity.  The team worked very hard each day to accomplish all work tasks and provide great customer service at the same time.
good,I hate to leave CVS it is an amazing company with amazing people who truly care about the job that they do ! I would recommend it to my own child as a starting health care career!

Every person of management i've encountered were great and very well understanding/easy to work with. I've typically been in fun environments and it makes working there a pleasure. I've learned more about pharmacy because of this job and I appreciate my experiences there. The hardest part about my job I would say is that I feel like we do A LOT of work for not much pay."

good,On a regular day what i would do was check to see what they had for me to finish. If they didnt have anything for me to finish i would go out to the floor to check what needed to be stock up and stock it up. Then after ill go work on the carts then ill bring the carts to the back and then restack the carts for next time we need to stock up the floor. I wasnt old enough for the cashier or the box presser so i didnt have that kind of experience. Some days when its slow ill go fix the seasonal aisle or vacuum the store.
good,"working pharmacy is fast paced and fun I learned to multi-task , management was the usual, co-workers were kind, hardest part was the stress level most enjoyable  was working with the public"

good,"A typical day at work consisted of filling prescriptions in a timely manner, filing actual hard copy scripts in chronological order,pulled and counted prescription drugs, rang up sales. This was a continuous learning environment for me. Management was very helpful with everything and co-workers worked as a team to accomplish daily tasks. The hardest part of the job was getting in contact with busy doctor offices while patients waited for their prescriptions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the on going trainings and learning new procedures everyday."
good,"Working as a pharmacy tech at CVS allows me to not only work within the medical field, but it also allows me to interact with customers."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of doing plan-o-grams, developing film and customer service. We have kiosks for the customers to print there pictures off their phones and i spent a lot of my day helping these customers because i worked mostly in the photo lab. What i learned the most about working their is if you have patience with a customer and listen to them and treat them with respect alms any issue can be resolved. My co-workers were amazing and so was my management i am actually still friends with most of them and i do their hair at my school. I think the hardest part of the job was indeed the photo machines they always were breaking and we had to figure out how to fix them or sit on the phone with the photo company for an hour. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to see customers facing when we restored a really old photo. Sometimes it the last picture they have of that time or person and we brought it back for them."
good,"Working at a retail pharmacy may be challenging for others because of the customer service but our store is one of the best places I have work at. When I first started, they sent me to at least 5 different stores for training, and as a floater. I observed how the workers at different stores barely talk to each other. Communication plays a big role in the pharmacy; and that is what we have in our store. I work with the best 3 staff pharmacist. They are very reliable, knowledgeable, helpful at all times; also, my co-technicians are also very much team players. We are all equal in the pharmacy, our lead technicians do the same work as we do, same with the new hires and interns and inventory specialist (me). We are a team and that makes our job easier although it is undeniably difficult most of the time."
good,"Its a very good place to work to Learn new skills ."
good,I loved working with this company. very friendly work environment. they demonstrated patience to the fullest when training me
good,"I had a busy day at work today, I learned how to have more patience, and listen. The management was awesome because you learn a lot of  new things from you manger and your co-workers. The hardest part about my job is when things  get missed handled the wrong way and you have too pick up the your co-worker slack. The most enjoyable part of job is to see the customers smile because I know that I was able to them give there medication."
good,"A typical day at CVS Pharmacy is non stop. To work in the Pharmacy you must be patience, intelligent, and urgent; along with a sense of humor. Most patients that drop off or pick up prescriptions have no idea of the process to get their medicine. I have learned a routine to distribute all prescriptions. A lot of patients do not even know what medicine the doctor has prescribed. It important to know most medications to briefly explain what the pharmacy has received for them. While doing the hardest part of multitasking. You are talking to one patient about their needs and filing other prescriptions at the same time. Luckily I have my co-worker to help service other customers and if I get tripped up on a question I have a great management team to step in explain and give one-on-one training afterwards. It is important that we always keep an updated profile for the patient to keep in contact for various medical changes. Some patient will try to challenge you in your common knowledge and that's where the sense of humor comes in. To work in a pharmacy the only thing to take serious is distributing the correct drug as it was written for the patient."
good,"Being my first supervisor position, I learned a lot on necessary skills. Daily bank transactions, Delegating hourly employees. Responsible for the whole store and staff."
good,"At TCF Bank, it was all about getting accounts. It was not a fun job, I never had problems with getting the account. The only problem was that I never planned on pursing banking career."
good,"My typical day at work is very structured. Time slot to call medical insurance are very early therefore time management is a plus. Work load is very typical for a collector due to its volume to have an account receivable manage accordingly. My co-workers were very helpful in many areas, we often have gathering in or outside the work area. My hardest part of job has to be receiving reimbursement on time from the medical insurances, they can be very difficult to deal with. But when I do receive reimbursements, it can be very enjoable because I have worked hard and the results are rewarding especially when seeing the data quarterly."
good,"I worked in a diverse open minded environment. My colleagues worked very well to achieve the departmental goals. The Management always encouraged growth, skill development and presented many challenges that enable critical thinking, problem solving and skill development. I had the great pleasure of working for CVSHelath for 9 years and learned a great deal about the PBM industry. Additionally I acquired many skills that are applicable in any industry and this is thanks to the challenges presented by management, the projects assigned that pushed me out of my comfort zone but enable me to exercise my judgement and problem solving skills."
good,I helped the pharmacist and other technicians to fulfill daily functions of the pharmacy as well as fill all prescriptions.
good,I have learned a lot of information over the short period that I have worked for this company! They have trained me very well and in a way that I could comprehend. I love the management team and the people that I work with.
good,The pharmacists went out of their way to teach me everything about the medications.  Brands vs Generics.  I learned customer  service and how to be a good listener.
good,"There's alot to remember as far as processes. Training was one month. Co-workers are helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. The hardest aspect of the job would be memorizing processes for password resets (around 20 different systems are used) and escalations. Once you absorb everything, the job is enjoyable with a lot of downtime in the late afternoon."
good,"I really enjoy working here and learning new things, Being able to help someone in a time of need is a great feeling. A normal day at CVs is very busy. The management is very good at stepping up when needed. One of the hardest parts about the job is trying to learn everything and I really enjoy working with the co workers there they are very friendly and positive"
good,I loved my time here. It helped me grow in the pharmaceutical field. I learned the importance of teamwork and patient safety.
good,"Working at Coram has been a great experience to go through.  The people I have worked with have always been warm and welcoming. Being a Commerical Billing Representive has improved my computer skills, and has overall taught me more about the medical billing and medical claims functions of successful healthcare.  In a typical day I would review claims, paitent information, and patient insurance information; making sure that all information was correct and where it was suppose to be before releasing the information to the patient's insurance.   Managment and my coworkers, alike, were all eager to help one another in order to get to our shared goal of getting claims out to insurance companies with the correct information.  The hardest part, I would have to say would be the down time that would sometimes happen due to not enough claims available to work at a given time.   But by far the most enjoyable times when there was always something productive to do and accomplish."
good,"This is a private facility so everything looks good. It is also very small so you get to know everyone, including nurses, visiting pharmacists, recreational therapists, and even the residents there. Volunteering there was fun and you see a lot of volunteers come in for various types of jobs to do. Overall it was a good experience."
good,"Greet customers that walk into store. Ask the customers if they need help looking for anything. Help them find the products they need. Help stock the shelves to keep them full. Also ring customers of their purchases. On delivery days help unload the delivery truck and unload totes into the stores to stock shelves up. Coworkers were so great to work with. I am honored to have worked with my great coworkers. Even though my management changed many times, most of all my managers were great to work with and they have taught me lot of valuable information. The most difficult part of this job was to multi-task. I would have to ring up customers, help answer customers questions, help develop pictures for customers all at the same time. The enjoyable part of the job is that it kept me busy and I enjoyed working with the different customers that would come into the store."
good,"The staff was friendly and helpful. The CVS location was very busy, but being busy made the work day go by faster. This internship was very informative and educational."

good,This store started with Eckards then we were bought out by CVS and my store had our change over in 2005. My customers were my part of my family. The are still some that I still keep in touch with. My co-workers were great we all worked hard together as a team. My most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I put a smile on our customers and made sure that if they needed anything they were to call us and we would help.  This was a place that I loved going to work because everyday was a adventure.
good,"I learned the most about interacting with patients through retail at CVS Caremark.  Working with medications, cross checking contraindications and double checking with pharmacists creates a unique personal relationship between pharmacist and patient.  That, for me was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Co-workers were pleasant, friendly and had a great sense of camaraderie.  There is not much that was not enjoyable during my employable during my time at CVS.  The best experience I took away from my employment at CVS Caremark was the building blocks necessary for communication with other entities and physician offices."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was that I could pick my own hours, advance in the company quick and there was always incentives."
good,It's been a great place to grow and work.  I have no problem doing my job or what is expected of me.

good,lt was a good place to work at...everybody there really care about the people who came to shop there....
good,"There not one thing I can complain about the co-workers that I used to work with.  Everyday was a busy day for us, throughout the day, but we always had each other to work as a strong team, & be real goods friends so we can share.  Our manager, he was a very friendly and extremely informative in the field of pharmacology. Even though I had many customers, I remembered most of their names, and they always appreciated our work with words or gifts."
good,"Good people to work with, great customers and employees. "
good,"CVS pharmacy technicians carry a number of important responsibilities. On a typical day, pharmacy techs collaborate with pharmacists to ensure customers receive quality care and meet all health and safety standards and protocols. Specific job duties include sorting pills, creating labels, reviewing medication side effects, greeting customers,answering phone calls,making sure insurance companies and everybody's insurance goes through perfectly well when they're picking up their medicine, and ringing up purchases....I would definitely say my favorite part is the people. CVS is like a people kind of company. I don’t know if they do personality tests or something when they hire you, but I know that the people I work with are really good people"
good,I enjoy my job here at Coram.  Great people to work with.  I learn something new everyday.
good,Typical day would be me at the register ringing out customers having at least 2 to 3 customers in line and then when I clear those people out usual someone would need my assistance with finding something I would actually bring them to the item and tell them that I will be waiting for them at the front when they are ready to check out. Of course we have our rushes each any everyday around the same time so it will be more people coming in and needing help.
good,At CVS everything was a team effort and my management staff truly cared and were very flexible as long as you showed results. CVS truly cares about the customer and making the staff happy. I worked as a pharmacy tech so I dealt with customers on a daily basis face to face. My most enjoyable part was learning about all the different medicines and learning from the pharmacist.
good,"Responsible for organizing and maintaining medical records for both active and  inactive  patients, on a daily basis."
good,First thing is look at the board and see where you would be working on. Cvs was really hands one with costumer which made the job more amusing . The employees where really hard working and kind to each othher and costumers .

good,I enjoyed working here because i was able to see regular customers and new ones each day.
good,loved working at the call center.
good,This was a fun place to work. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with. A day at work consisted of doing the deposits first thing in the morning and getting the registers up and running before the store opened. Then it was making sure that all reports and payroll was entered into the computer. After all office duties were finished then it was time to work the stocked room and stock the shelves. If we were expecting a truck then things had to be moved in order to accomodate the new merchandise in the stock room. The part that I liked the best was the resets and displays and the training of all employees.
good,I loved my job at cvs pharmacy. It allowed me to learn about different medications. My boss was a very nice guy and my co-workers were very friendly. I leaened about a lot of medication and their different uses.
good,"i've been very blessed to have worked for such a great company, they really care about there employees and family, They care about your health problems if you have any, cause i know i did and were very understanding. I do hope and look forward to continue with the company very shortly."
good,Its gets stressful sometimes but overall you have to have positive attitude to the public eye. You learns vary things that you wouldn't obtain on a daily basis without working in the pharmacy..

good,ansewering inbound calls about prescription benefits. Ordering medication for mail order. Working beside co-workers who are able to help if you need it.
good,"Managing the payment and other functions of individual accounts for a homecare provider that at first I didn't realize was a homecare provider. At the time home infusion companies were relatively new and I stumbled across this employment opportunity by going building to building turning in applications. It was during a time period when less on-line approaches in applications were in place. I learned that you never know what will turn up till you try. The position was the beginning of a number of years I have pridefully had with healthcare applications, something I believe we all will need eventually. My manager basically gave me a huge opportunity with little experience. Unfortunately, the company decided to close the location so many people were unemployed. She was a pivot for the transition into my next job following and undeniably and excellent professional individual who was a great role model. My coworkers were more than easily helpful with training and welcoming me into this role. The hardest part of the job at first was coordinating care and response from patients who had critical plus chronic illness. The best part of this job was when patients sent appreciation for many efforts regarding the coordination of their care."
good,Co-workers are great and so are some managers as well. Working here was great laid back and dependable on your co-workers.
good,"I will check the schedule board after clocking in to see where i'm suppose to be. I normally work at pick up my first 2 hours which i verify name and date of birth before ringing patient out, and ask the patient if they have any questions for the pharmacist. next 2 hours i might be on prodution which is printing and pulling and also counting pills, next 2 hours i will be on drop off i make sure patient is in database if not add them in database and type scan and send script to production area. also i clean, stock vaccum,and collect 14 days scripts out of bin and return them to stock make patient calls to assure they know there either out of refills or due for refills"
good,A typical day at work for me would be getting there at least 15 minutes early to prep for my day ahead. I usually work for for two and a half hours creating cases for patients and following up with the doctor offices before I take a five minute break to get a snack from the companies vending machine then its back to work for another two hours before taking my lunch break then it back to working hard for another three hours.

good,"Decent job. Offers flexibility. Many different job opportunities within the company. Lots of on job training . Good work ethics with management. It is a retail job, so as long as you know what to expect with any retail job, you won't be surprised. Cvs pays less than other retail pharmacies that i have researched or knew employees of."
good,I work from home and it is  a great thing. I do miss being around people it would be a good job for people who are caring and outgoing. If you don't have a passion to help then this is not the job for you
good,"It’s very good jobI recommend everybody to work in this company I don’t like this job because it was 24 hour working "

good,My experience working at CVS was hands down my best working experience out of all my jobs. The only difficult part was dealing with irate customers and handling the situations accordingly. I got along with all my coworkers and my work environment was more of a family atmosphere. I also enjoyed interacting with customers and learning new things every day.

So the first opportunity I got to work with them again I took it! I have worked 3 different positions within the retail and pharmacy side of CVS and I have been thoroughly satisfied with each position. I started in the front store right out of high school and worked my way up into the pharmacy as a certified pharmacy technician (CPhT). CVS paid for my national (PTCB) certification and they give you plenty of opportunity to advance your career with them and as you advance they give you adequate pay raise. My favorite position so far has been inventory manager in the pharmacy, which was quite a lot of responsibility but I learned so much about the pharmacy, different medications, drug interactions, and a lot more. The co-workers and pharmacists that I have worked with have been super helpful and for the most part fairly knowledgeable. I would recommend this company everytime for anyone who is looking to be with a company that has room for you to grow and have personal gain and not sit in 1 position. I now work as a shift manager and I enjoy the front store just as much as the pharmacy. The pay is good and so are the benefits that come with the job."

good,The CVS/Pharmacy was very welcoming for all backgrounds. There was a lot to be learned at both customer service and knowledge of all the medicines. Great place to understand how other people feel and helped with m own understanding of other people.

good,I have worked for CVS for about 7 years now; for the first 6 years I was working full time and the past year i dropped down to part-time due to my full-time job. CVS is a very fast paced job that requires you to be meticulous at your job. You have to alert and careful at all times when you are handling medications.

I would recommend working for CVS health to anyone because of the great support and educational opportunities to grow with the company.  The most enjoyable part of my job is caring for and getting to know my patients.  The most difficult part of the job is seeing patients decline and pass away.

It isn't always easy when you have to talk to patients and hear about their struggles. But this job is VERY rewarding. Knowing at the end of the day that you've helped a person get the medications they need is a wonderful feeling. I loved knowing I was helping people. On top of that, the benefits are great, the team I worked with was wonderful, they have an on site cafeteria, and the food they serve there is pretty good, too. They also have a Baxter Credit Union branch inside their cafeteria that is only accessible by CVS Caremark employees. They give frequent raises and quarterly bonuses based on performance. There is a lot of room for advancement. The attendance policy is really strict, and it can be a hassle to get absences approved. They don't accept a doctor's note alone. You have to fill out a form for either FMLA, or accommodations. But the management is very helpful in this process and very understanding. Their system isn't perfect, but all things considered-- I would definitely work here again in a heartbeat! Even with the negatives taken into consideration, it is still the best place I've ever worked. Highly recommend!"

good,"It's very straightforward. Most of your time is spent making sure the store is organized when you're not ringing someone up at the register. Management was pretty relaxed just do your best to call in advance when you know you're going to be late. Honestly the, ""hardest"" part of the job for me was entertaining myself because the store I worked in only got busy at night but I only worked the day shift so I'd be by myself at the front of the store while the manager would be in the back doing their office work or taking care of business in the back part of the store and as soon as things picked up at night it was time for me to go home."

Customer service is what drives people to come back and shop at our CVS location.

I enjoy training colleagues to be the best, and let them know that CVS promotes within. The hardest part of the job is when you run across a customer who is very angry, and you have to alleviate the tension. I always keep in mind that we don't know what that person is going through in their  personal life to make them so upset. So having that in mind I tend to be more passive and patient to our customers needs and make sure they leave CVS happy. Then I know I have done my job well.

On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the customer, finding out – proactively – what their prescription are  meeting with team for half hour to communicate the customers’ needs. I do this on Monday so that the rest of the week is well organized and we can effectively use our team’s time in exceeding customer's expectations and avoid Friday evening surprises.

My role involves extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not an option."

Management was very attentive and helpful in getting situations resolved for the workers and the customers.

Management wise, handling customer issues has been a large portion of training, and has helped me along the way to solving other issues outside of work.

I feel accomplished every evening when I finish my shift that I put a smile on my customer's faces when they leave my store."
good,CVS Pharmacy is one big family; the customers and the employees.  You are able to grow within the fast past environment.  I loved the concept of fast fun friendly to reproduce returning customer base.

good,CVS provides a great work/life balance in that they give you all you need to do your job when your there and the freedom to leave the job at work when you go home. The compensation and benefits are heavily competitive and the are big promoters of internal advancement making job security and moving up within the workplace viable. I have never seen or experience better management. The management is informative and listens at the same time and the open door policy is really felt. They have a great job culture that makes every employee feel like someone important and not just like another warm body for count purposes.
good,Working at CVS Pharmacy helped me to develop a better rapport with individuals for future care. I also learned of health care and different drugs. Highly recommend
good,"Almost exactly the same as Walgreens, they both seem to be competing with each other in terms of business plan and patient base.  Gobbling up the independent pharmacies."
good,"Very productive work space. Treated employees with the utmost respect. Supervisors walk you through every step, make sure you are comfortable with your assessments."
good,"My 10 years in Orlando was an awesome experience, no doubt about it. Chemung DC is a different story. In my very personal oppinion, there were to many new and inexperienced managers and they wanted to push so hard to reach ""unrealistic"" goals which put so much stress in the associates that you could cut the tension with a knife. Shifts of 12 to 16 mandatory hours deteriorate little by little my point of view. By thenI had already moved my kids to upstate NY and honestly did not wanted to move back to Florida. I had no option but to resign and that is when I worked at Best Buy until I moved to PA."
good,"I worked with CVS as a Pharmacist for 3 years.  My day started at 8:00AM and ended at 9:00PM."

good,great place to work great atmosphere. would recommend to others.I kept myself busy with my task given to me. Mangers were easy going. The store always looks very clean and organized.
good,"A typical day consisted of team work in getting a patient's order ready. It included, data entry, filling medications, verification, and counseling. Also inventory check-in takes place after 11 am, so that the medications that were not filled or partially filled would be ready at the promised time. The day also included taking prescriptions left on the voicemails, from doctors on the phone, and actually hard copy prescriptions. It included great communication with physicians and other healthcare professionals. I learned that team work and communication is really important to accurately fill prescriptions in a timely manner. The managing team was always available to answer questions and help us solve customer issues. The entire team was collaborative in making sure the patient's needs were satisfied. Thus this created a culture were everyone highly cared for the well being of the patient. The hardest part of the job was to make sure we do not fall behind on the priorities. This means communication among team members was really important!! Communication helped the entire flow of the pharmacy moving. However, this in itself was also fun because it kept us on our toes and helped us make our patients happy. It is really rewarding to see a patient come back asking for you (pharmacist) because they have so much faith and confidence in you."

Then, I was hired by the temporary staffing agency to work at CVS Caremark. Although the position at CVS Caremark I was hired for did not involve the handling of any drugs or working directly with licensed pharmacists regarding the dispensing of prescription drugs to patients, having a current pharmacy technician state license and certification with the National Certified Pharmacy Technician Board PTCB  was a requirement to be employed by Caremark CVS at that time. CVS Caremark did training for several days to assure that the temporary workers would be able to know what to do  and how to do the data entry and the processing of the appeals for the patients wanting to have their prescriptions approved by their physicians and the insurance companies. The employment was standard work hours during the day and the building that the CVS Caremark worked in was a large light and airy office building shared by other companies in a nice area of the city where there were many restaurants to eat. Everyone at CVS Caremark seemed to be interested in trying to make certain that they worked as quickly as possible processing the drug appeal paperwork to get caught up since generally,"

good,"I walked into to this job with it being the first job i ever had. i was scared and had no idea what i was doing but they took me in showed me how to operate everything at my own pace. i was slow at first but after about 6 months of working there i feel i was a semi pro at anything the store could throw at me. i closed the store usually and occasionally opened on weekends or busy holidays. a typical workday would go like i would clock in, and the previous worker would let me know what was going on and what i would need to get finished. i would then work on mini projects, front face, and help the customers until it got about an hour to closing then i would clean up the store and shut down the photo lab and prepare it for opening the next day. the management was doubtful when i first began working there, but i must give her thanks because i probably wouldn't have gotten the job as it being my first job if she wasn't struggling as a manager. the new manager in the last couple months of me working there was a spectacular manager. he had goals and expectations that eventually helped the store grow incredibly. he definitely knew what he was doing. i loved all of my co workers like they were family. we were a team and we got our jobs done with a smile and had a bunch of fun. the hardest part of the job would have been multi tasking between keeping our standard of making sure our customers were satisfied and taken care of at a fast pace while stocking the store with new items on truck day. the best part of the job was being able to walk into work and not having to force a fake smile"

The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unhappy customers and trying our best for them to leave the pharmacy happy. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I had retained with the customers over time."

Also keeping the front, Photo Lab, and behind the counter clean at all times; keeping a clean work space shows that you are neat and makes the store look very presentable. What I learned while working at CVS had to be taking out/loading film in the printer.

good,"The 2 CVS's I worked at is great... being a tech is always challenging, and not each pharmacy is the same. So perhaps I just got lucky and enjoyed the pharmacies I was at. The first CVS I was had had very bad co-workers but they all left after a few months and only the nice employees ended up staying, so so I ended up working there for a year and enjoyed it alot with staff I enjoyed working with. The second CVS I was at was even better then the first... even less political and competitive... you just come in everyday.. get the job done and leave... pretty relaxing place to work."

good,"The most enojoyable part of the job is making sure you are making your customers healthy and happy. I have learned several things about the pharmacy most important is being able to multi task and do things correctly and accurately. Typimg perscirptions, affixing and labeling prescriptions,knowing brands and generic medications are just a few of the daily tasks that must be met. I enjoy working with others I am a very outgoing person so being around others is easy for me. I would say the hardest part of being a pharmacy tech is the fact you get alot of the abrupt customers and you have to know how to handle situations which may be hard until you have been in too many of them to count. That is why management is always useful in cases where you can not give the customer what they want or do not know how to satisfy the customer,the manager should always be behind you."

good,"Help customers, count and secure funds, supervise 23 associates, unload and pack out trucks, planograms"

Co-workers are nice and helpful. I think the hardest part of the job is having enough people so that we can take care of the customer, if you don't have the staff then it very hard to take care of the customer when you have to count drug's and take care of the counter. I enjoy working at CVS and filling prescriptions for customers."

good,I worked at CVS as an intern in customer service for 3 months and it was a lot of hardwork and memorization. But my coworkers were very helpful and generous in showing me what to do and what not to do. This job was suppose to give me some work experience for job appilications because i was inexperienced in the working department. This job put me in a whole different prespective for retail workers. It was not easy at all except for slow days. For anyone who wants to walk in retail i recommend this job. Its hard for the first couple days but its way easy then you thing once you learn. Overall working here was a great experience for me and im very happy to have this as my first job without pay. Only thing is i was hoping that were going to hire me because they always told i was a hard worker but i was to young. They told me to come back when im 18 and they'll see what they can do. I'm 17 years old.
good,"Being an intern at CVS was a great experience for me. Everyday was like an adventure in regards to the many nice people-- customers and co-workers--that i had met during the course of my internship. A typical day at CVS was always a busy day, filled with many customers and unexpected outcomes. A typical day required me to stand up, be alert, and be ready to assist customers at all times. I enjoyed that about being in the pharmacy, because it taught me how to be more responsible and more professional in the work field. My achievments would not have been reached without the help of my great co-workers. As an intern, i was unexperienced in the pharmacy environment. My co-wokers did not see it as that, instead they saw me as a capable student, who was determined to learn. Although i was being taught by a great team, their were still hard obstacles i had to oversome. The hardest part of the job was helping the customers with written prescriptions. At most times i could not understand the handwritten of the doctor, nor was i able to find if the medication prescribed was even available at most times. But in the course, i was able to progess and further advance in comprehending the handwritten prescriptions. Furthermore, the most enjoyable parts of the job, was being able to help every customer that came within the pharmacy and see them depart with a smile of their face."
good,I had an amazing experience while i did my internship hours at CVS.
good,My typical day at work involves talking with patients and giving them advice or telling them where to find a certain product they are looking for. I spend a lot of time calling insurances to verify coverage and get authorizations. Anytime I deal with a problem I try to look at the solution through a broad perspective rather than getting caught up with the details. With the challenges I face day to day its easy to forget the main goal which is: to facilitate an easy and smooth rendering of services for the patient.
good,"The morning consist of busy work such as checking in the outside vendor delivery and making phone calls. The afternoon has a steady pace and from 3pm until the pharmacy closes, CVS is full of customers. My co-workers and management work well together which creates a great work flow for the customers and us. CVS has a system that makes working there enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is witnessing the older customers leaving the pharmacy empty handed because they couldn't afford their medicine."
good,I would rate Coram Health Care in the highest regards due to their high regards to patient care nation wide. I learned a lot from the collections department to the billing department. I would like to become a part of ever growing company.

good,"On a typical day at work I worked at several different work stations to fulfill the needs of customers. Some positions were less customer based such as filling the prescriptions or putting new prescriptions into the computers. The other positions such as; drop-off, drive-thru, and register had more customer involvement. You had to work as a team at this job, and selfishness wasn't tolerated. The hardest part of my job is dealing with insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of my job is filling the prescriptions."
good,"I worked for CVSCaremark for a little over a year. The people are awesome. Almost everyone is nice. You'll have a few people who are rude wherever you go. However, I worked C Shift then transfered to A shift. I quit due to moving out of state. It's only been about 2 weeks since my last day and I can honestly say I miss it a lot. It really is a great place to work. The benefits weren't too bad, though I really never had to use them."

good,"CVS Caremark Nashville, TN"
good,i will if there any opportunity work for them again. I REALLY ENJOY WORKING FOR THEM.
good,"I am very happy with my current workplace and CVS Caremark's management team. It is a call center that takes incoming calls and also has an automated call system that makes outgoing calls. Intensity of the daily duties and work is very high, but I have grown to master it. This job taught me patience. The patients we speak to are all terminal patients. Because of this, our patients have taught me patience. I have a supervisor in my department (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension division), but also work under other supervisors from other departments on a daily basis, along with the pharmacist supervisors, all of which I share a good, professional relationship with. My coworkers and bosses truly make my job enjoyable. Everyone is very welcoming and easy to get along with. I think the hardest part of the job would have to be the very rare, uncooperating patients. Most of the time, those types of patients are new patients. They are normally scared about transitioning to infused or inhaled therapies that we provide them, and tennd to take the pressures of their condition out on us, because we communicate with them so often. However, because we have a strong team of pharmacists, nurses, and service representatives, situations always end positively."
good,A great company to work for. Excellent work ethics and encourages employees to do their best.

I had a tight schedule during the marching band competition months but the management still worked with me. I had a great time working there and I was there for almost three years. I started off as a cashier then progressed to photo tech and then made my way to the pharmacy and became a certified pharmacy service assistant, PSA. I was training to become a pharmacy tech but had to move away to go to school. All in all I had a great time working with CVS. The company took me under their wing and I went from knowing nothing about communication and selling to the best cashier/customer service representative in the store."
good,- Accepting and processing new prescriptions and refills.
good,"A typical day for me at CVS was filling prescriptions. Helping the customer refill their prescriptions, send faxes for approval on their medication, giving them their prescriptions. Answering phone calls and dealing with paients. I learned how to deal with angry customers in a professional manner.

good,A typical day at work is alot of organization and hard work but pays off to have the experience to be very clean and neat. My manager was pretty hard to understand his accent but it was no problem learning my tasks and getting them finished and i could always got to him if i needed any help. The hardest part of my job is getting a hold of my boss to sign my internship paper since i only worked 2 times a week on times he'd be busy.

My customer service is so great that I have stepped in a few times to assist my assistant manager with customer issuses. The hardest part of the job is when your trying to do your job but you don't have all the material you need to complete your job! I don't like having unfinish work. The most enjoyable part of my job is just being able to help!If it's helping a customer save some money or giving information to a customer to make things more convenient for them,Or just being very helpful to the point where there just pleased with my customer service overall.
