rating,review
bad,Don’t apply horrible place to work management has no clue what there doing not sure how they tie there boots Maintenance supervisor is trash Has to google how to spell his name
bad,"The most stressful company on all United States , the more complicated company, the number one company try people like idiots ,that most of equipment is to oldies never work right"
bad,The supervisor who is friends with an operator who has been there for while makes sure he does the least amount of work possible. Making other operators work much harder.
bad,"It was a terrible job, mostly Hispanic people that could not really speak English. The supervisors and foreman treated them like second class citizens. Not even citizens."
bad,"This Has to be THE WORST JOB I have Ever Had.  at the most Dinosaur Facility in ADM History .  With the Worst Management I have ever Seen.  Lost 9 people just on my Shift in the first 2 months.  Everyone I talk to HATES to work there.  They lie about your Hours,  and then your told to just COMPLY. Dirty Environment. With deplorable conditions. Especially in the vitamin room on the 3rd floor and the cutting in floor.   Shift leads are just puppets . Everyone is ready to quit, All the time."
bad,This place is trash! Working there you work for peanuts.... Management sucks and they overhire then fire people.WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?........................................THE PLACE IS NOT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ADVANCE IN LIFE!
bad,"Good paying company if all you want to do is work every day of your life.  "
bad,"I worked for ADM as Laborer in Byproducts and it was nothing but downhill. Working there for long shifts your basically living in there and it pulls you away from spending time with your family, They give you points for having emergency problems outside of work, you have to basically die for them to somewhat care a little there cause they don’t care about there coworkers at all, The management sucks, and have too many supervisors thinking there bosses and doesn’t know their roles. Now There were some cool coworkers, but the older ones were the worst cause all they do is whine and hate change! The only good thing they have are benefits and good pay, other then that it’s not somewhere you dont want to further your career with"
bad,No life all the company care about is production. A lot of overtime. In the supervisor will try write you up just to make themselves look good. Only good thing about the job is pay that's it.
bad,"During my time there I worked in the 'mill', shift supervisors were vindictive and overly concerned with their 'numbers'; quit when it became clear there would never be any real future there as far as getting a decent 'bid', also I understand that at this time(2-28-19) there are contractors cleaning out one of the crude oil tanks, during their breaks they like to smoke pot, which might be considered a real safety hazard, glad I quit"
bad,Don’t do it!!!!!! Please stay away. Low pay. Farmers are were cool. But management no!! Starting pay 10 an hour. Really???  You are nothing to them. Trust me stay away!!!
bad,"Be aware of the low self esteem folks ( blue hats or ADM employees) as they will tell lies on others as they have very limited knowledge. Management is even worse as I would classify their knowledge level equivalent to that of a  poultry processing plant reject. After all this facility is  a food manufacturing  plant.  If you want employment whereas you get treated like an idiot everyday, this is the place for you... The person writing this review is 50 years old with over 25 years industrial and management experience. By the way, I was just recently hired into management by one of their competitors for a lot more money! Good Luck  Lori and Tara...In conclusion the folks at ADM need to understand there is absolutely ADM has that I need!"
bad,"look at the pay scale average for this company , that should cause you pause. The company safety slogan is zero is possible, more accurate would be zero is probable, as anything that might happen to an employee at the workplace will be blamed on the effected employee 100% of the time regardless of any circumstance. Management has zero accountability , I worked there for 23 years before I finally got fed up , it was not hard to find another job that could beat what they offered. There are many good hard working employees who work there mainly on the hourly side they deserve better. On the salary side this is where the fat needs to be cut, most make very little or no contribution during any given work day. ADM is a 10 billion dollar per year company. After  three consecutive years of record profits ADM rewarded its employees with a $300 reward , that was the equivalent to about 1 cent for each hour worked worked for the hourly employees during the three years of record profits. Do your self a favor and keep looking you can do better."
bad,"The best thing that ever happened to me was getting laid off from this company.  It is the most political, cut-throat company that I have ever worked for.  "
bad,"I hated working therewith a passion. hours long rotating shifts. asshats for management only good think was they paid half way decent, and had good benefits"
bad,All I can say if you want to make alot of money its the place to be but if you value your lfe it is not the place to be i hope and pray that. They change there ways
bad,After putting almost 15 years in with the company they will get rid of you just like that. I think it is their new retirement program. If you ever want to work there just keep in mind that with this company its just a job not a career.
bad,"para trabalhar na empresa a pessoa tem que esquecer que tem vida pessoal e focar apenas naquilo, ou não atingira meta tampouco alguma promoção."
bad,Do not  work here you will sit at customers for 2 hours And not get paid they say they care about you and your family but they don't you will work 70 hours a week never see your family you have all different Start times STAY AWAY
bad,"No one seemed to know what was going on. No life because of swing shift, no leader ship. Talked a big talk with out follow through everyone was afraid of loosing their job."
bad,you will be sorry dont wok here total ack of morals disregard for employees
bad,i worked for adm trucking in des moines iowa if you like to be treated with respect this is not the place to work. the manager is dangerous to work for equipment is dangerous people are treated like dirt. i was injured on the job due to negligence and was fired the next morning. a month later another employee was injured on the same job and is still there adm likes to work this way all the time and a phrase i heard alot was that you are expendable because there is always some one else to do the job. the trucks are borderline safe its just a roll of the dice and the management is not there. all in all it is good money if you live to spend it
bad,"bad work enviroment,dangerous people,poor hours,no family life"
bad,"I don't even know why ADM is hiring! They just laid off a ton of people in Southport, NC! I had a brand new child and a wife who was ill. I was called into the office and told I was being laid off, and given a severance. Was called to go back to work making a QUARTER of what I made at departure! No thank you! Now I find out they've done it again! My whole life and my health suffered bc of ADM! Lung issues, a coworker got sinus Cancer this place is a toxic environment"
bad,"Set hours (40 per week) no overtime pay, not the best work conditions at facility in lodi ca, irresponsible management make up fake rules on the spot, false time entry (cuts hours on check),"
bad,"My direct report would mock me, taunt me about my past work experience, belittle me in front of co-workers, intimidate me in private meetings (at one point I was afraid that she was going to hit me), and then tell me that she had her boss's approval to do these things, even when HQ was periodically sending out email links to web pages informing us these things were called harassment. I tried to find some way to contact Human Resources, but was never successful in doing so: everything HR-related was handled in another state, and there was no direct phone or email to use to contact them."
bad,"ADM advertised for a Class A CDL Driver. Hired on only to find out that I was a just a laborer that might move a truck in the yard. Also told that I would have to drive 65 miles to another ADM plant permanently. Because of a labor shortage. ADM didn't hold up to their word and agreement when I was hired on as a CDL driver. I was to park in my home town ADM plant, and drive semi truck locally. But they gave me the Bait and Switch Tactic to hire a body. Driving 65 miles one way for pay that was lower than my Current job in my hometown.  If they didn't Lie to me, I would have retired from ADM.  Check the reviews. There is a reason why ADM is always hiring.   P.S. make sure you hold on to your old job like I did.  You might need to go back."
bad,Very stressful. You’ll have no outside contact once your on the clock. No cell phones allowed. Your being bird dogged on by management every work order you perform which makes it hard to do your job.
bad,I received almost no training and was let go for doing something that management approved of. I lived in the country and they were within the city. We got a large amount of snow and because i did not make it to work i was let go even though the manager told me it would be excused due to the weather.
bad,"worked in the warehouse, new manager came in and got rid of everybody, I left because I wasn't getting full time status but working full time hours..."
bad,"Expect forced overtime 75-80 hour weeks from April through December."
bad,"12 hour rotating shifts, management has everybody at each others throats, very harsh attendance policy, maintenance superintendent belittles his employees and does whatever he wants with no consequence, plant manager has no people or management skills."
bad,"Instruction giving by trainer are told to you as this is the the way I do it, no guide lines are told as the right way. Being taken away from training to do a utility job for maintenance personal."
bad,"one of the worsted places I have ever worked. Schedules were unreal. hours were horrable, Manamnet was unenvlved. was not a team envoriment  and was very unproffeinal"
bad,This place is an absolute joke of a job. They reel you in with a raise at 6 months then youll never see a dime from them. Couldnt use the bathroom unless you were on break and they didnt buy you ppe like welding jackets or chaps. Micro managed so bad that if you had an idea to help with something you got wrote up.
bad,"Do not work here. You have been warned. Even though the pay is a bit above average, it is not worth it. There is nothing positive to say. Only negative so I wont keep going on and on."
bad,Worked here twice. Came back after being laid off. Nothing has changed it's all about the profit and not the people.
bad,"Management does not care at all about any employee At Red Wing MN plant do not work here. Bad hours, bad management"
bad,"Though it seems to be a well established company worldwide, ADM Port Colborne is a very stressful and demanding place to work.  Management does not care about your life outside of work as they feel they can force you into work any weekend they want, even after working 40 hours Monday to Friday.  If you do not work the overtime when they tell you to, they can suspend you for not showing up. ."
bad,"Worse company every worked for they don't care about their employees, manager is terrible, all they care about is the mill and getting loads no matter what cost"
bad,"Generally poor management,  lack of communication, Extremely low morale, Poor work/life balance, Poor safety program, Plant manager has difficulty communicating with union/employees, total absence of HR."
bad,This place is the worst place to work. It’s about who you can buddy up to & suck up to them the job you do. The people who miss work get treated better then the ones who show up all the time. 1 raise a year & it’s based off of the sick up rule. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anybody
bad,"If you like working 50 hours a week for straight time, 12 hours a day 7 days a week with one weekend off a month (it is a 4 day weekend) and having them tell you in the last 10 minutes if your shift you are working 12 and then back in early then you will love it. You have one week where you get one day off and then work 7 more. Most are 12 hour days. If someone is on vacationhave to work half of there shift."
bad,It sucks horrible place to work. Its cold and your 150 feet in the air. No family life only work and sleep as a life. Do not work here if you want a life.
bad,"The management at ADM is concerned with one thing and one thing only: Wall Street. Maybe that is as it should be, but it makes for a horrid working environment. They also talk a big game on safety, but as I personally found out, when it comes right down to it, it's all just talk."
bad,"No teamwork what so ever. Small 4 person office, the girls are catty, rude, ignorant and childish. Hardly any communication between depts. Horrible and unfriendly office to work in. The hardest part of the job was being ignored on a daily basis. I did enjoy the paperwork aspect, but that was the only plus to the job."
bad,ADM is changing there footprint in the US and expanding overseas this is causing them to layoff/terminate the employees in the us to free up capital for these new ventures. The plant I was out didn't replace there safety department or environmental department when the people in those departments left. This is concerning to say the least.
bad,"If your here for a salary/office position, ignore this review. You guys got it good.   OK with that out of the way, let's get to what you really came here for.    This company has such great potential to be an amazing company to work for, unfortunately most hourly employees can't stand it.  First off, get ready to work 6-7 days every single week. If someone calls in sick, someone has to stay and cover,  possibly up to the full 8 hours over if they can't find anyone to come in.  If someone quits/get fired, get ready for 3-4 months before they hire someone. If you call in they will find a way to punish your for it.  Management wants to be certain people's friends and totally screw over everyone else.  Every week, we have 'down day' where we have 12 hour shifts. It's normally on Tuesday.  But they will change it to Thursday from time to time, without letting people know. We will know it was canceled Tuesday, but have no idea they are doing it Thursday.  If your on third shift, this is ridiculous because you could find out Wednesday night that your 8 hours turned into 12 and your not prepared for it or already have something outside scheduled, which they will punish you for. "
bad,You never know when you will go home. They keep such a short staff that if someone calls in sick someone has to stay until someone else can come in. Most of the time you are working 7 days per week. The pay is better than most manufacturing jobs though and would be a decent place to work if they could ever get their management in order. There is opportunity for advancement up to becoming a miller/supervisor. That is where you top out until one of the supervisors leaves. All of the operators are required to rotate between all 3 shifts every 3 weeks which can get old real quick.
bad,"Terrible company to work for, no work life balance, every weekend and bank holiday in work, after a short time you will realise why this company had such a high turnover of drivers."
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years. Only decent thing was the benefits. The workers aren't appreciated at all. The plant managers are just worried about their bonuses at the end of the year. We worked our butts off and they show nothing to appreciate. The management is a joke. Your told to follow the rules, and when you report something to the Management, they do nothing about unless it will effect their jobs."
bad,"This was by far the most unsatifying warehouse management position I have had in my whole career.  The upper management were extremely unhelpful, there was no training provided and there was no support from the hire ups... you either ""sink or swim"".  The general attitude was that the employees did not work hard enough and were there to be pushed around, but let's keep in mind they would wait months for serious safety violations to be corrected and are not paid well and are generally talked down to by the upper management.  The hours were ridiculously long, with unexpected shifts often thrown in the mix and you are on call 24-7, most nights you do not sleep.  Always responsible and held accountable for departments and problems that not only were you not trained on, but also may know nothing about, but be prepared to answer for these in an educated manner or have your job threatened by the plant manager."
bad,"Lacked ethical boundaries"
bad,"If you like working in dysfunction, with no processes, with complacent and angry people that do not like their jobs, this company is for you. Leadership does not care and everyone is related to everyone except you so get ready to feel like an outsider."
bad,"The wages and benefits at ADM are ok.   The work is hard but sometimes rewarding.   Be prepared to be FORCED in to overtime and extra shifts without any notice, if you say no you will be in big trouble.  The management is run by family and has been for 2 generations. The family puts family first and makes sure friends and family are favoured.  Often this is noticeable to all employees and quite appalling.  The union are good people who are under constant attack from the smug little man who runs the plant.  Amongst hourly employees relationships are strong and teamwork is usually great."
bad,"Adm Springfield mo has the worst managment ever they turned all the employees against each other and stress,over worked,under paid and working weekends... there is employees constantly snitching on other employees just for a leg up....at their job....management is micro managing pay to the point where your only thankful  for having a job even then at the end of the day  your back is full of knives  from employees...."
bad,Not worth it. To much favoritism and lazyness.. you well work your butt off and at the same time you well be bored. ...................................
bad,good pay for being belittled and degraded everyday and make you feel like you the biggest pile of feces. If you care about money only then here you go! Beware you will not be appreciated and they will be sure to let you know everyday that your expendable to the company and they don't care about you at all they can hire somebody if you don't tape the lid on the Gatorade jug correctly. Just an example.
bad,"My overall experience was negative. No work/life balance what so ever. Expect 12 hrs overtime or more each week. Management are unprofessional when dealing with employees. "
bad,"I was in salary position. I left because it was very unorganized, dirty, and they never actually fixed anything. Machines were always down and they would band aide it instead of fixing it the correct way. They treat hourly employees awful. There is no work life balance. We worked 55-70hrs a week. When I was hired in they said some overtime. You may make 70,000 a year but you will work 9-14 hrs six days a week. You never know what day you are going to be off. By far the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"It used to be a good place to work. Skeleton crew, little knowledge. Cant say too much , company likes to retaliate."
bad,"The  employees that are knowledgeable and hard-working seem to be treated the worst. Turnover is high because the more you do the more management piles on. Rewards given to friends, not those who've earned it. If you go to church or happy hour with bosses you're promoted faster regardless of performance. They've also gotten into a habit of letting go of people closing in on retirement before they have to fully compensate, in place of younger, cheaper staff."
bad,"I was employed here for 3 years. Will never have a set schedule you could be coming in at 10am, 2pm,4pm,6pm,or whenever they feel like having you come in. Management is a JOKE!!! They lie to your face, will stick up for supervisor's even if they are in the wrong, dont follow the Union guide lines, there is much more to this place than I can say. ADM has set rules that are in all locations for some reason if you work Company you can break them because upper management will stick up for you, but if hourly employee if you break a rule kiss your job good bye... I thought was a good company to work for until they pulled the things they did on me"
bad,"I worked in a Quality Control Lab at ADM for 18 months. From day 1, the training I received was more or less a ""figure it out"" approach. The lab manager was not able to perform the tests that the lab techs were expected to perform."
bad,"Very understaffed, which causes more hours weekly. Can be called in or forced over on any shift with no warning. Management has no appreciation for their staff, and company as whole is mismanaged."
bad,The first two years were great if you could have a family life but all you did was work and then management was horrible and treated you like you were a slave very micromanaged and also I would get in trouble for going above and beyond and accused of things that I did not do which caused my release of my duties.
bad,Good ole boys club. They like to hire mostly/ majority male. And pay more to males to do the same job. I’d say pass this job up. ..............................
bad,Insecure high school students pretending to be professional adults. Very clicky environment full of backstabbers. Definite racial undertone. No one engages each other. Team leader picks and chooses which people she wants to engage with and if you're not in the click it isn't you. I wouldn't dream of retiring from here. Planning my exit strategy now. The most evil environment I've ever workedin
bad,"Your desires and needs will be continuously ignored. You can work a 16 hour shift, have 8 hours off then come back for another 12 hour shift. Management will not step in and help you. Only work here if you are desperate."
bad,ADM continually goes thru RIFs about every 5 years... just did another and no loyalty at all.  People with over 20 years at the company were let go while contractors and new directors kept their positions.  Very nepotistic at the top.
bad,Too many people like me left due to the hostile work environment ADM perpetuates. Safety is a smokescreen. People get hurt or die and ADM denies any and all liability making the victim into the perpetrator. If you get hurt plan on being interrogated as in the Spanish Inquisitions.
bad,The pay is good but it's like being in high school there is a lot of drama. Poor management they don't care about the employees unless your a favorite
bad,"num dia de muito trbalho era muito corrido nao tinha tempo nem de ir ao banheiro as vezes."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend Decatur Bio Products as a place of employment to anyone, as far as the other plants I can't speak for. The company does offer good benefits!"
bad,Management is very racist I'd never go back to a place like that ever.... Place measures up to nothing!!! Don't make the mistake if your not stupid. But some will not learn
bad,like every trucking company I driven for little to no time off & make a check or sit at home & starve worked 12 to 16 hrs a day 6 days a week no time for family
bad,Worked there through a temp agency in the oil area. First I would like to say they are severely understaffed for the area they expect one person to cover. I imagine it’s to save money. A few people were cool to be around but the majority weren’t. I guess being a temp leaves you open to be treated poorly. They have you work 12 hour shifts which I don’t mind but they had people alternating between nights and days which sucks and expect you to climb silos at night with limited lighting. The final straw was I had a family funeral out of state and had to stay a day longer than I told them and they cancelled the contract cause they said I gave them little warning. Who the heck plans when people pass away I’m not psychic and funeral plans were out of my control and I was out of town.
bad,"40 hours a week, under paid hourly rate.  First day at work, department had no clue what the position was really about. Went through 3 managers in 1 year.  Job was not hard when things were brought to the table and a great learning curve too.  The most enjoyable part of job was learning about the accounting department, people at other locations, and learning of new systems.  Hardest part of job is that the company decided to eliminate the position and no offers brought within the company."
bad,I learned the rudiments of Photoshop. Management was horrible in every way. Every day was an arbitrary purgatory of random snafus.
bad,"I learn to cope under pressure"
bad,if you dont kiss todd or juans butt you will have it hard there better to just pass on this place.its a big joke at this place trent and the workers are cool though and will actually help you..
bad,Learned a lot from the company. Was waiting on a hire freeze over a year. Never received benifits or days off. There is no balance from Work and life. Very hard rotating schedule.
bad,"If you're a white man, you've got it made. If you're anything other than that, expect to be overlooked for multiple opportunities and told to shut up."
bad,"the plant i worked, it seemed management would go over eachothers heads to get something done. if someone was injured in anyway, an investigation followed, attempting to find fault on the victim. most of the fellow employees were and are fun people to work with, but just knowing, that they would replace you in a heartbeat really makes you dread going there everyday ""as if the fun and happy is sucked out of you the moment you step foot on the property"""
bad,"Performed data entry, customer service, and search of trucking and rail cars. I learned the many different trucking aspects."
bad,"I do not disparage the company at all. I enjoyed the people I worked with, however, the environment was not for me and I suffered. I wanted to be better valued for the work that I did, especially when balancing a heavier project load than others while I was there, however, this was not seen, nor ever credited by management. "
bad,"Management will do anything to throw you under the bus, everybody is treated like they are replaceable, do not recommend working for ADM Redwing, other locations are better."
bad,"Almost everyone I worked with was getting yelled at by management and had plans of leaving. They do not care about the people that are working and just want you to do the job. They encourage going to work sick at the cost of getting other people sick. I do not recommend working here. Seriously, no one I knew for over a year wanted to be there but the pay kept them there."
bad,Waggaman office.  Horrible company culture.  Lies. HR WOMAN is a snake.   Dispatch manager is two face liar.  Very racist and sexist working environment. Recentfired most management because of noose threat video that caused major lawsuit.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. STAY AWAY.
bad,never know why time or gift you were working. Not a good place to work if you have a family to take care of. They didn’t give raises like they saidnor benefits.
bad,"While I appreciate the job that ADM provided to me and the skills and lessons I learned while in the job, the company did not provide an opportunity for me to develop or grow professionally, after many promises made. I am a firm believer of working hard and believe that your employer should also work hard for you."
bad,"Working for the New Braunfels location is like being in prison. Management works you 7 days a week , low hourly rate. No one lasts because of the way management treats them, we get talked down to, told to work with broke tools and equipment, they talk safety all the time, but tell you to do your job, even if there is a chance of getting hurt. If you do get hurt you will be on light duty and then thrown out the door as soon ASAP, by Management. Why does a company need a sign that about 20' by 20' in front of their building all the time. Answer: Because they cannot keep employees, why , because people are human and need to be treat with some respect. Temps , work one day and never return.  Work is dusty and you go home smelling like sewer, from the wet flour."
bad,"As long as you sit and do your job, participate in their social events, don't involve HR in any concern you may have with your supervisor no matter how bad it is. It's a great place to work. The people that work there have no morals, do not know the meaning of ""marriage"" and will stab each other in the back every chance they get. "
bad,"they care only about product.  good workers get treated like garbage while lazy workers are great, they put good workers with bad workers and make the good workers do a 2 man job on there own."
bad,Horrible management they have no idea what goes on. May be different now that some people have left. The place has a huge turn over and they treat you like garbage.
bad,"I started up with ADM being brought on with a couple of buddies that were looking for jobs at the time, they have some good management skills and were trying to make the mill work. The only problem was they were constantly cycling through workers that weren't from a temp agency. They kept on hiring people on and letting them go right before their probation was over. The crew of 4 guys that I was working with we were all let go right before our probation was up. They did not look into the safety of the building when one of their steps fell through and left it as a hazard for several days. They might have changed since I have been there, but my days there are not ones that I was fond of."
bad,"Biodiesel has made this soybean plant for ADM a very busy and profitable location. Unfortunately the culture and morale are at an all time low for the hourly employees. Although benefits for working here are better than average, office politics makes some days extremely stressful. Lean manufacturing is a common term heard over the last few years here. Less employees doing more and more of the work for the least amount of salary the company will pay. If you are not an engineer or merchandising intern you will not thrive at this company."
bad,Poor management and organization. Safety was only addressed when an injury occurred. Lack of communication in every aspect. Old beat up property and equipment. Hazardous and dangerous. Co workers lack training responsibility.  Never showed or told how to perform job on a daily basis
bad,"Since the new CEO took over, the entire company has gone downhill."
bad,"The group I worked for was completely against working remotely, flex time, and other non-traditional working arrangements. Dress code had only recently removed the requirement for men to wear ties in the office. Very rigid, conformist office environment."
bad,"This place is an absolute scourge on the earth. Management wavers between completely incompetent to ineffective. The workplace culture is toxic and disgusting, especially if you're a woman. The only good thing about this place is the pay is high for the cost of living."
bad,"As a contractor, you are obviously treated differently than actual internal employees. I feel that the high expectations that management  puts on external employees was near unobtainable. People got too wound up on meeting the unreasonable goals of management when it was management that put them there by not keeping up with technology and the times. Management aggravations were all to often trickled down"
bad,"Used to be THE company to strive to work for. Life is cyclical and so are business operations. Operations, safety, culture, and moral are currently in a downward spiral. Loyal, experienced employees mean nothing to the e-suite any longer. If you are a long-time employee, you are too expensive to retain and now a target. Only the executives are protected. Do not plan to stay here long. Get in, update your resume, and get out in a few years."
bad,"Upper management is getting weird, making lots of short sighted decisions, used to be the best to work for but anymore I really dont know. Constantly restructuring and downsizing, firing people so their earnings report doesnt look bad. The had a round of firing older people which companies do, but then to be fair they had a round of firing young people as well, operations people are constantly treated not unfairly but badly, working 13, 12 hour days in a row, weekends nights and holidays without any consistency and as management literally no compensation for extra time or effort, not to mention merit increases have been reduced as well."
bad,It was a fun workplace. I did learn a lot but there were to many meetings and they cut people twice since I've been there. People were scared for their jobs
bad,Lot of changes.  You hired for a job and they move you very fast even if you don’t want to.  It doesn’t matter.  You accept it or you are out.  City of Decatur very small. Not many options
bad,"The office must have been erected atop a native burial ground.  The people were nice, the facilities were nice, adequate equipment and training, there was just this culture of trepidation, like a suspenseful movie just before the plot goes sideways.  "
bad,"Generally ok workplace, absentee management. Not much room for learning. Culture is very dependent and expectant. Meeting customer needs is forefront. Employees are understanding and supportive."
bad,There is absolutely no loyalty to their employees you are viewed as a cost to the company instead of an asset! Might be a good place to work if you are looking for some work experience right out of college. If you looking for a long term position (more than 5 years) this will not be the place that you will want to work.
bad,"Not the best ran place. Losing millions of dollars and I don't expect them to be open much longer. You can't be human and work there, they do not tolerate mistakes. You will be fired."
bad,"I repaired mechanical equipment in the field. I learned how to repair complex systems. The hardest part of the job was the shift changes every two weeks, and the horrible bosses. They treated us like we were second class citizens. I would rather starve than go back to the Galveston facility. If there is a netherworld for of fire and brimstone, a few of the bosses deserve to go there. They treated everyone at the plant the same: like slaves."
bad,"Great Co-Workers, the hours are not very good for a home life if you have a family. Working rotating shifts is ok if you are single and have not kids at home."
bad,"A very dirty place to work, a old building. The elevators get stuck, just not a place for me. I do not like working there, the schedule is not for me."
bad,Just another factory job with management with udder distaste for its employees. With management doesn't see reason and their could be a better way to do things
bad,"Huge amount of turnover. In the year I was there, we lost over 15 Operator and only had a staff of around 20-24 Operators. We lost around the same amount of Lab Techs and there are only around 8-12 of them. Half of the front office employees left as well. They write Operators up for Supervisors and Managements mistakes just so they have a paper trail so they can get rid of you when they feel like it. They don't value their employees at all and know they can find others easily to replace them since Decatur has such high unemployment. The people that are in charge of the plant really have no idea how the process even runs and won't listen to the Operators and end up screwing things up. STAY AWAY FROM GLYCOLS!!!"
bad,Poor management and lack of any future long term vision makes the working environment very frustrating and difficult. In recent years the job security has become quite low. This has contributed to a lot of high potential/talent looking and eventually leaving elsewhere.
bad,"Hours: 10:30 p.m. until anywhere from 9 a.m. to noon the next day, six and seven days every week. Overtime (Fri/Sat) was put on the board Thursday morning at 7 a.m. just as most other from my shift were clocking out, or taking a break. Do not make any plans!"
bad,Overwhelming expectations of employees
bad,Days start at 7 am and sometimes go past 7 pm
bad,"Laid off after several years of service, it was a total shock. There was no rhyme or reason for the ones they choose to let go. Management was never had open line of communication."
bad,The atmosphere was stressful working 10 hour shifts up to 7 days a week. No family time. Management did not care about you just cared if the spot was filled so they did not have to work it. No appreciation and tried to control you by making you clean shave daily or be sent home
bad,"Basically, an engineer at ADM does what their boss tells them to do. There is very little in the way of training for young engineers and you are thrown into work and expected to either sink or swim. I had to get a job elsewhere to fully learn to be a process engineer. This is not a good company to work for if you are a woman or a minority."
bad,This is literally a sweat shop paying below average wages and working enormous amount of hours.  24/7 on-call with an average of 3-5 calls per week due to system instabilities.
bad,"Hosting company -they are slow to start with information and not sure of task feasibility.(Normal day.) ** Some. **  Nervous.** A lot of slobs.** When completion time is  already set. They ask, are you done yet and then move up the time frame  by 2. Walking through the turn style at the end of the day. A tough day for a COMPANY UNDER THIS  HOST UMBRELLA."
bad,"Management belittle, demean and spiteful.  Non-degreed people as supervisors.  Sexism, no advancement or limited advancement for women.  A companies culture is defined by the worst behavior that it is willing to tolerate and ADM will tolerate a lot!"
bad,"Low wages, lots of weekends, expected to be on call with no on call pay,very little room for advancement as far as hourly employees. Management doesn't value employees"
bad,"Stay away this place is a dead in for a job, unless your in the click"
bad,"Learned about the trading board. Fun and exciting atmosphere."
bad,"The workload is typical of any corporate environments... slow on some days, super busy on others.  Management really leans on capable individuals to get the real work done while the large majority of people who work there are average (at best)."
bad,"ADM is similair to Middle school.  One of the female high up supervisors in my department had her favorites , usually men.  She showed extra favortism towards them and went above and beyond work with them. The division controller was worthless.  He sat in his office passing all his work off and taking credit for it.  He thought he was pretty special with his nose always pointed to the sky.  I was part of the big lay off and at the time was devistated.  Now I thank my luck stars.  I love my new job!  Everyone is treated as an equal and thing are fair.  The pay, raises, benefits and people of my new company get 5 out of 5 stars.  Nothing about ADM is 5 out of 5 stars."
bad,"This company is a carrier killer.There is a very high turn over.Mostly from people getting fired.Very long hours,a thank less job .If you like working with management trying to get you.At stops they hide in the bushes .Waiting to see if they can catch you doing something wrong .If you get hurt on the job forget it .They will find a way to make it your fault .Because they want a perfect safety record.Ohh and they just laid off and have in the past .Points for being sick .points for being !two minutes late .The union is a joke .Company is in there pocket."
bad,"they have you doing a 2 man job people just didn't care about company.did my work and aslso  work of other employees.i take my job to heart and made sure everything was to the best of my capacity.people were lazy and did as little as possible.always did more than needed too.would look for any reason for what you may have done wrong but never seen the part of how much you go out of your we"
bad,"I've worked for ADM at two times in my life.  Both times I was entering the work field with no relevant experience.  First in high school and then right after I'd finished my undergraduate degree.  I was thankful each time that I could find employment with little experience.  This is a huge company and my experience with them have been different based on where I was working within the company.  The corporate employees are treated with much more respect and appreciation than plant workers.  I work in the quality control lab in the corn plant now since I've gotten a degree.  The culture there is toxic and a swing shift schedule takes a toll on physical, mental, and emotional health.  I'm thankful to have a job and thankful they took me on with little experience, but it's not a position to stay in for a long career."
bad,"ADM has a very strong safety culture and a good group of individuals working for them proud to work here, it has great benefit package and decent health care"
bad,It is hard to work for a company that has a management staff unable to work together. The infighting between departments and offices has created a toxic atmosphere that makes an already overworked crew of employees find it difficult to find reasons to continue working there.
bad,"The pay and benefits are the reason that workers stay at ADM.  Is a operator you are require to work the swing shift and there are time I did not see my wife for 4 or 5 days in a row.  They write worker up often for little mistakes, but management can make multimillion dollar mistakes.  They do have a very safe workplace and safety is not just talk. Safety is considered first even if it adds to the system being down for an additional amount of time."
bad,Pays well and you learn a lot.  A great place to make lifelong friends.  Many career paths available.  Work/life balance is difficult to maintain.  Learn many transferrable skills.
bad,People are angry at this workplace.  I think that maybe it would have been better to work directly for the company.  There was strange rules about coworker interactions.
bad,"14 months of mixed feelings,  the job is good but the salary and travelling times are bad, My manager is rally good and flexible but my thoughts on health and safety are not that good. Morale on site is generally poor with several persons looking too leave"
bad,Persons with degrees are looked down upon by those who are directly above them who don't have a degree.  This creates a tense environment when discussing matters of change in policy or procedure.
bad,You will work a 7-day rotating swing shift with an average of 12 hours of overtime a week. That sounds great until you realize that it is mandatory. There is almost no free time in your schedule to do much other than sleep and eat. The job is very fast paced and could be tolerable on a different schedule.
bad,"The pay was OK. The benefits were probably very good for the area.  Had to work seven days a week, 8 - 12 hours a day.  Didn't get any holidays off and it seemed that management didn't really care for the hourly employees that much except when it came to safety concerns that could hurt the company.  Has room for some growth but I don't see why when you don't get any time off for anything family or otherwise."
bad,"You are expected to put business first, family 2nd. They run 7 days a week on a small crew."
bad,"While the pay is great and there is room to grow in the company, the management plays favorites and the company is terrible about nepotism. They hire family members and treat them better than other employees even when they do not do their job properly. The job itself is very easy, however the hours are the worst. The plants are open 24 hours all year round, so working an off shift is inevitable."
bad,"The general work day is easy enough but the people will destroy your every hope for having a good day. The job is outside in the weather, or inside very loud building which require you to have ear protection."
bad,"The benefits, employees and schedule is great. Provides a safe environment to work in. Good vacation package and great match on 401k plan. Also weekly pay is nice."
bad,it's cut throat and managers are less than willing to help a new trainee advance and move onto more stringent opportunities within the role of ops manager
bad,"co worker very lovely and generosity  , i worked i adm independently "
bad,"Great job as far as money,beneifits and hours go but poor management is what keeps this place short staffed. The equipment is very old unexperienced maintence so nothing gets fixed properly."
bad,"I worked here for 1.6 years.  Very click culture and small town feel and gossip.  Management is not transparent at all, and layoffs happen at anytime.  Great work life and personal balance available.  Benefits are great too, however culture is un willing to change due to numerous old-time ADMers that work there.  Bare minimum effort is expeceted."
bad,from what i have heard and experience while doing maintenance here it seems is a good ol boy culture and you truly have to be in the in crowd to get on here or have a very good way to get in. Truthfully disappointing that the atmosphere has gotten bad there and their human resources doesn't seem to have a clue.
bad,They are so desperate for help that they are now filling Maintenance Technician positions with Production Operators who have no technical skills and/or technical training. A job once reserved for skilled tradesmen is now being given to anyone who applies. Standards are lowered by the hour and no one is held responsible for their actions. The atmosphere here is toxic and fake.
bad,"I enjoy my colleagues, but the constant restructuring has left the department shell shocked. The uncertainty of job safety greatly limits the ability to succeed. It seems to be more about ""who you know"" rather than ""what you can do"" here. Oftentimes company fails to promote from within and develop current employees' skills and abilities in favor of contractors"
bad,"I enjoy my colleagues, but the constant restructuring has left the culture in constant turmoil. The uncertainty of job safety hinders the ability to excel, and I often feel overlooked even though I bring more to the table than many of my colleagues. It seems to be more about ""who you know"" rather than ""what you can do"" here. Oftentimes company fails to promote from within and develop current employees' skills and abilities in favor of contracting out and hiring externally at a lower rate of pay."
bad,"Typical work day - fire fighting issues 75% of the time"
bad,"The work is relatively easy, but management likes to give the runaround on new people. Hard to plan anything since the schedule changes every week and sometimes sooner. Trains are a priority to get done and if you have a good day, it'll only take 14 hours minimum. Coworkers can be cool, but lots of gossip and backstabbing. If you like to work and learn, chances are that asking all the questions you want may save you, but I wouldn't guarantee it."
bad,Internal problems with Management in Mankato Location that continues to be unresolved for years.
bad,Management is poorly trained to develop direct reports. A very technologically backward company with disjointed and outdated tech systems. Advancement is slow and politically driven.
bad,"The work itself wasn't that hard, but trying to deal with the politics within and between departments was stressful."
bad,"Got promoted from sweeper to Miller in only one month. However with a Miller shortage I was stuck working 7 days a week for over a year and a half with always the promise of ""soon"" whenever we asked for a relief Miller or time off. Vacation time isn't earned until one full year of employment and since I was new I was SOL if I needed time off."
bad,Adjusted mills and maintained equipment. JSA's where helpful. Addressed safety concerns. Attended various training programs. Fast work pace. Mostly negative but well rounded plant work ethic. Trained to run 3 unique mills. Mechanical failures where very common. Interacted with coworkers and the experience I gained.
bad,Great atmosphere to work good opportunity to move up I'm the company they basically deal with flour for Pillsbury  great benefits they also have sick days in personal leave if needed
bad,"The co-workers are cliquish."
bad,"Massive turnover after the"" reduction in workforce"" of 2012 has led to an undesirable working environment.  Many fringe benefits and virtually all training programs were cut from the budget during the huge cost savings initiative of the past year."
bad,"Handled payroll, accounts payable.  Would have preferred to stay here."
good,O gerente da expedição de farelo é um péssimo administradores.
good,In my time with ADM I was promised that if I worked hard I would make it to Supervisor within two or three years. So I worked and gave 150%. I'm not speaking as to the company as a whole but there was a plant manager who was a tyrant. The funny thing is he never really messed with me because I worked so hard and he new I could get the job done. After almost two years of hard work I applied for a Supervisor position and was not even interviewed.  I am not saying this because all of ADM is bad. This is just a warning in general of all companies. Be careful who you kill yourself and as a matter of fact because of the letdown its really hard form me to find that energy when I go to my new job.  It's unfortunate that there are people that would do or say anything just to get what they want out of you and then when they are done just toss you in the trash.
good,"bully's everywhere..cut throat, mean and rude.  if you ask questions, they make you look stupid.  be careful being along or in the pit with ANY one of those guys."
good,"Great pay, however the management could use a lot of improvement. there is a ton of favoritism played in the downtown building so if the supervisor doesn't like you know matter many hard of a worker you are you're going nowhere."
good,Poor management very toxic atmosphere. Not a good place to work. Would not recommend this company to anyone at this current time. There is no concern for employees well being.
good,I cant speak for the other plants of ADM but the East Plant likes to make people supervisors who have no idea how the machinery works. In turn they let people go ALL the time because proper maintenance was not performed on machines because it was not as high on priority as it should have been. In return you get a lot of good workers being let go because of write ups for machine that is completely out of your control. Very unfair place to work. It was this way in the TVP department. I cannot speak for the others.
good,Not a good place to work if you have any children or commitments outside of work. Any position not salaried will require a lot of overtime with little to no regard to your obligations outside of work. Guaranteed to work weekends and holidays. Poor management and not a good culture all around to work.
good,Never a chance for advancement on call six months of the year. Only positive thing they ave never laid off and always have overtime available. It’s hot and nasty.
good,"If you like working more than spending time with your family this is the place for you, overtime is mandatory especially if you're on the bottom of the totem pole.  Management is usually spotty and most of the time don't really know how to lead a group of workers. Most of the men I work with are very rude and make the job a lot worse than what it is."
good,"The management Team, in Red Wing is a power struggle. Everyone trying to go over each other's heads, the union is worthless here and everyone is out for themselves here. Work/life balance. Work is the most important thing, no sick time is offered, vacation is minimum. I was in the NATIONAL GUARD, and had to fight for time off for Drill, every month, my federal contract was still less important to them."
good,hard work hot 110 degrees no repect. cant wait to get out of this place for a new job non non non non non non hot place to work every day dirty for a food pro duct place
good,Horrible training efforts.  They expect you to learn new things without given you hands on experience.
good,"Majority of current employees lack work ethic, constantly break company rules with no consequences as well as rely on seasoned employees to carry out majority of duties."
good,If you were to seeking employment within ADM I would highly recommend applying for a salary / company position. You will have a better schedule and treatment.
good,The pay is good benifits good hours are bad. 3 2 3 12 shift rotation and a 2 week day night switch leaves most people in a daze. I am maintenance and we switch from days to nights every 3 months and that is hard enough.
good,"I worked at Fremont,NE ADM soybean extraction plant for 5.5 years. During this time, you get hired out as a laborer, train in different area's in the plant and then fill in for operators and or hourly employee personnel. The management changes there every so many years, so you never really get that grandfathered plant manager that has seen it all. The company uses managers at all different areas within the company. The hourly crew at the Fremont plant is or was pretty good, some employee's are very disgruntle due to the fact they have been working 40 plus hours and are running low on amounts of sleep. Weekly pay is great. Having the union is also good (50g). Must be willing to work weekends, holidays, any shift for any period of hours during un-planned shutdowns. You can learn a great deal of mechanical equipment during your duration at this plant if you put your mind to it. Most operators like to train new employees in there departments because they are and will be counting on the new hires to fill in and or help out when needed. If the plant has a strong manager and a good super intended this place can really make some money due to the crude oil business."
good,"It started busy, opening the computer getting started on the daily training, and getting task required for the day on a timely manner, work smart and efficiently, getting organized and learning and knowing what is going on for the day and what the manager has planned for me to do, and expected it done."
good,"I only work at this job because it pays me. My supervisor would spend all day watching videos while I work. In fact, I prefer his absence since it allows me to get the job done much more expediently. I do the majority of the work while my supervisor reaps the benefits, which is about 1.5x more dollars per than I do. I have worked at ADM for almost a year and not once have I sat down with a manager to talk about work. The occupation itself is not too bad, but it's supposed to be a team effort. However, since only I do all the work while and my supervisor watches youtube, it makes the job not worth it. Also, just to note, since I started this job, I have NOT once taken a break."
good,"I was hired into a sales trainee role however I was stuck in order processing.  I spoke with my manager 3 times in 8 months and what to expect and how the training process was.  They never had a structure plan and did not want to show many and thing sales wise.  All the coworkers where close minded, cut throat, and click."
good,"Fun and productive work environment until ADM bought the company. After ADM bought us they took away our bonus, took responsibilities away and everything took a lot longer."
good,"não ha estabilidade, demitem com muita facilidade."
good,"Exigi muito dos funcionarios"
good,"They demand too much from supervisors and do not back them up when there are issues with employees."
good,I started out with an interview for pellet mill operator. I was told after an hour drive and a two hour wait in the office that the position had already been filled. They offered a much lower paying job with the promise of the operator position when it became available. I happily cleaned for months waiting. When an availability occurred they quickly filled it with a family friend of the plant manager. I was extremely let down by the integrity issue. I was a good worker and my attention to detail caught notice from numerous corporate managers. They would compliment on how much cleaner our plant was kept at than other plants they had been to. I strived to let the quality of work I performed daily be the basis of how I was viewed. The only ones recognized by our plant management were the ones socializing in the office. My duties were to clean and occasionally help out where I was needed. More often than not I was farmed out to help the packing crew. They had ran off every person hired to help and bragged about it. The culture shunned new people. They spent all free time gossiping about new people. They openly made homophobic and racist remarks with management. Management was forgetful and rarely took care of benefit related issues. I never received many things the company offered due to this negligence. ADM corporate needs to reign in this culture.
good,You better have some patience with lack of communication. Benefits are great and you get flexible work hrs. Management is a bit relaxed when it comes to holding certain people accountable.
good,"You will work as many hours as you want, and likely more. Don't expect to have weekends off. It is not unusual to work 60+ hour weeks. You will have excellent paychecks and put lots of money into  your 401K, but you will not have much of a home life."
good,Needed a wholesale overhaul of the corporate culture.  Management was out of touch with workers and reality. This was the 1980's but I doubt much has changed.
good,Swing shift job that is a good start but definitely underpays people with bachelor's degree. Advancement is unnecessarily hard to obtain. Long hours and unable to leave for lunch.
good,The ability to rely on employees to solve problems when it is the employer or supervisor to correct is not how well a company can run and unresponsive tactics are absurd
good,Needs a safer environmental atmosphere. It is a very organized atmosphere. Management at the top needs to be more in tune with the workers need and future endeavors.
good,if you dont have other oppurtunities the job is union and pays well but you will work a lot and i mean a lot so dont plan to have much of a life outside of that job
good,"Gostava de trabalhar nela ,empresa muito boa de se trabalhar."
good,"Uma boa experiencia, pois a dificuldades apresentadas pela empresa, fez com que o profissional adquirisse maturidade em certas situações etc..."
good,ADM has changed over the years and management does not value their employees like they used to. A typical day consists of many meetings and very little time to do actual work.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with.  ADM has some great people.
good,Very great place to work if you only worried about pay. Besides that its the worst atmosphere I ever worked in. The company is great but the plant I worked in was horrible with horrible people.
good,Pay was great. Hours were horrible. Switch shifts every week. Management just wants plant to stay afloat until 4pm on Friday. A lot of drama. High amounts of overtime. Not a safe place to work.
good,Always Changing.  Sometime direction is changed midstream.  Pay seems to be under market value. Many good people have left over the last several years take a great deal of experience with them.
good,"Uma empresa que esta sempre atingindo grandes lucros, com uma grande preocupação em preservar a integridade dos seus funcionários. "
good,"a typical day at AMPCO:  was a job to fill in the time.  it closed too soon, now it's a parking lot."
good,"Through 18 Years Workede All Departments Plant Wide. Learned All The Operations. After A 2 Year Expansion Managment Went To The Opposite Way Of Operating Plant. Several People Have Found Other Work. I""aqm also Looking. The Only Hard Part Of The Job Was Managments Changes In Procedure After Expansion And THe Plant Went From In House Ran To Corporate. Which Was Fine But The Plant Manager Became Intolerable. Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was THe Fellow Employees."
good,"No geral a empresa apresenta um ambiente de trabalho agradável, com pessoas de fácil relacionamento. A gestão de equipes nem sempre é eficiente apresentando ainda muitas falhas de comunicação, alinhamento estratégico e feedback aos subordinados. A empresa apresenta ainda um quadro de funcionários enxuto, muitas vezes sobrecarregando alguns funcionários. Quanto aos salários e benefícios, a empresa apresenta os benefícios de praxe de uma empresa multinacional e compatíveis com o mercado. Em relação aos valores, a empresa preza por funcionários honestos, negociações livres de corrupção e conflitos de interesse e a segurança do trabalho, sendo estes pontos positivos para a empresa."
good,"Man kann dort einiges nützliches Lernen. Ansonsten würde ich sagen, dass die Bezahlung nicht sehr gut ist."
good,"great pay and benefits, good people, but poor management. Work swing shifts 7 days a week. one weekend off per month. I learned plenty of skills but did not enjoy my life. 8 hour work days but you work 12 hours if someone calls in or takes vacation, or if the plant is running bad. The hardest part was never being with my family and never getting used to swing shift, also no lunch break. The most enjoyable part was driving the train and moving rail cars."
good,I think the company is a reputable company to work for. I did think a few of their policies needed to be reviewed however I felt that just because I was over qualified for the job.
good,"A stable, forward thinking organization with a great future.   Solid leadership and vision.   Provides employees with great opportunity.  Company has a world wide reach so opportunities exist in multiple locations and in a wide variety of fields."
good,"No communication and management doesn't care about workers."
good,"There were plenty of hardworking, good natured people at the plant I worked at. Unfortunately the 2 main plant managers were incredibly difficult to work for and made blatant attempts to hinder their employees working experience."
good,"As plant manager, I handle all employee relations, HR duties, control spending to adhere to budget, write proposals for projects, and follow through with execution of projects to completion.  I have learned from some great mentors over the years and been very fortunate to work with a lot of great people."
good,"Quality control records are written in pencil...."
good,"Money good, hot working environment,lots of fast moving machinery,"
good,The compensation is great but the hours are awful. The company could care less about you or your family.
good,"When I started working at ADM. I loved working for them. Great hours, great opportunity and growth in the company. I loved what I did. I'm just ready to get out of the corporate world. I'm looking for something new."
good,Working with my colleagues.  I'm only as good as the colleagues that work with me directly.  I'm a firm believer that it is a team effort and management support that drives success.
good,"A typical day had a schedule to it, with defines tasks and operations at designated times. Team communication was key to the smooth running of the place, touch-base with factory operators and management kept most disturbances minimal. The hardest part came when there was an emergency or when swamped by secondary parts of operations. Sometimes certain operations would have overlapping timetables."
good,"Management sucks at this place. Supervisors and lead person have little to know knowledge of productions machines, high turn over rate, take workers for granted. Machines are old and keep production rate down due to break down and maintenance dept non eagerness to fix problem. They rather put a bandaide on instead of fixing the problem. This placed is a real piece of work."
good,Position is feasible for a entry level technicians. Senior technicians don’t stay long. Employees helped each other to get product in spec and out the door. Management is not fair. No advancement. No discussion about raises or incentives on performance. Always drama in this department. Manager doesn’t manage department for the best interest for the department.
good,"Always amazes me how something as simple as a personal change can ruin a good job and a good place to work. Only once have I seen such a high level of dis-regard for a co-worker. Such a blatant demonstration off brown nosing and back stabbing intentionally trying to make someone look bad in order for you to possibly advance. And this coming from ""the new guy."" If you get hired into the maintenance department, all I can say is watch your back. Especially on second shift."
good,"Empresa paga bons salarios, possui bons beneficios, relativa estabilidade. Promoções são raras. Gerentes muito operacionais, praticam micro gerenciamento. Profissionais de alta performance tem dificuldade de aceitar."
good,"ADM is a solid company providing opportunities for growth, but the human eliminate can be lost at times.  The company overall trains its employees and gives them opportunity to fail or succeed."
good,"Gestores necessitam estar mais próximos dos colaboradores da ponta, com planos de fato de gestão através de acompanhamento de indicadores e feedback construtivos e não ficarem focados no processo comercial."
good,"De todas as empresas que trabalhei, esta possui uma politica muito autônoma. Não tem interesse em crescimento de funcionário. Muito fechada para crescimento pessoal."
good,"Thankful to be part of this organization. "
good,I work split shift of six on and six off for fourteen days and then off for seven days. nice people to work with and the hardest part about the job was being away from your family
good,"I've worked for Archer Daniels Midland for over a decade.  I've held a few different jobs with the company.  During this time, I've worked with many great people.  However, I've also see the decline in employee morale over the years due to poor choices/communication from upper management.  In just a five year span, the company has undergone two major layoffs.  Following the layoffs, filling positions, including voluntarily vacated positions were slow to be approved.  This resulted in high stress, skeletal groups.  Furthermore, management continued to increase demands and workload.  Even when many cuts in costs seemed somewhat unnecessary, the company would spend money in other areas that didn't entirely make sense given the cost cutting environment.  All the while, employee morale has suffered and not much has been done to change this."
good,"You are either swamped or dead in the water. My job was very much centered around the harvest...when harvest wasn't going on...there wasn't much else to do."
good,"I worked for this company for almost 5 years. It was great until I transferred to a different facility. Within 4 months of transferring, I was laid off by a company I thought I could retire from."
good,"No room to grow.  Flexibility is limited.  Dress code is relaxed. Provide free beverages. Some growth in learning on your own."
good,Company is very dynamic in that they allow you to work independently however they also give you a lot of different opportunities to excel.  They do pile on the work.
good,Very interesting and always something new going on. Had a great bunch  of operators. As a supervisor you were the got to person good or bad. I learned how to supervise in a union enviroment and also learned how a lot of equipment works.
good,"Work with passion, focus on safety, team work, food safe quality and productivity. Learned a lot on Safety, Team Work, Corporate Aspects the company, Company Core Values,  Modern Milling Techniques."
good,"Worked night shift, never got a weekend off, safety culture took a back seat to production. Need to upgrade equipment and train employees better."
good,"Stressful place to work. Management was very inconsistent and had little appreciation for the hard work employees/supervisors put in on a daily basis. However, I learned something new each and every day that continued to make me successful and more efficient."
good,"no dia a dia dou entrada em notas ficais faço o faturamento de tudo o que esta saindo de da unidade, faço parte do recebimento de icms, tenho colegas os quais sempre buscam aprender e a ensinar, a parte mais agradável são as pessoas que conhecemos as amizades tanto interna como externas"
good,"Would recommend company. Good benefits. Valdosta Locaton very safe Plant, Plant manager very professional. Too much mandatory overtime. job work/life balance bad. Good job for single person without kids."
good,"the people you work with are nice, but managment dont care if you have any thing going on in your life and need to go home for family. they only care about numbers, you could be the hardest worker there and you will not get aknowledged for your hard work. no advancement unless you move out of state.  environment is no controled gets to be about 130 degrees inside the plant during the summer and gets cold in the winter."
good,Work 60+ hours a week due to understaffing. ten hours workdays 6 days a week. not much vacation time. pay lower than average in my area of work. management treats you fair.
good,It's not the same place to work as it was 20 years ago.  It was less stressful years ago.  Management has changed & they've started to outsource too many jobs & leaving the employees that have been there for years to wonder how long it will be before their jobs are cut.  I've made a lot of wonderful friends & contacts while my tenure at ADM.
good,"It is in ok job, but there is some opportunity to learn different areas of the plant. If you like shift work and working by yourself, it is a good option."
good,"Empresa com grande estrutura, excelente foco em segurança patrimonial e dos funcionários e prestadores de serviços, grande foco em meio ambiente."
good,"Worked on-site for 9 months, then remotely for the rest of my time. I was actually one of a few contract staff, so can not give a clear insight into the company's policies."
good,"on the job training"
good,Not a very rewarding job. 1 mistake is always remembered.  And anything good above and beyond that is done is easily forgotten.  Raises are not transparent even though they have a fairly good quarterly review program. Due to the constant switching between days and nights and stress and worry about making a mistake fellow coworkers are on edge and feel they have to look out for themselves constantly.  Instead of being able to truly being able to be a team.
good,long hours good pay job security advancement options. lots of knowledge to gain. fast pace friendly co workers lots of overtime overal decent job if you can handle the schedule
good,Good paying job. Hours are long and its fast paced dirty on the weekends while cleaning. Work alot of overtime. The pay is good for how close to home it is. And checks are every week
good,"Management at the time made it a very stressful job. Timely work was required with bare assistance. Company needs to update systems as well, it was a battle between trade and logistics"
good,Great Benefits.  Great environment  for college graduates to learn in a fast paced environment.  This Company offers tremendous versatility and learning opportunities.
good,"If you need some money, then ADM Cedar Rapids is a great place to be. If you want to do foolish things like have a social life, advance your career, or maintain general sanity, I'd recommend going somewhere else."
good,Overall the work isn't all that difficult it's just the supervision and management that could use a class or two in personal skills. You will get father there if you just agree with whatever they tell you to do no matter if you agree with it or not.
good,"It was a great experience learning the systems at each location. All three locations are very different, ran differently and are very challenging. I was very fortunate to be able to move around like i did to gain the experience,"
good,I worked at ADM for many years and with changes in leadership comes obvious changes in how people are treated and situations are handled.  Work environment needs improvement as morale is low.
good,"A typical day at work was a whole lot of muti-tasking. answering phones, checking e-mails, taking orders, customer service, giving out barge orders, follow ups."
good,"Some but not all management show poor professionalism to their employees. Poor maintenance when it comes to getting something fixed right, more patching than actually fixing a piece of equipment"
good,"Great benefits is the best thing about working for ADM. There are also many locations one could work at, if you were interested in traveling to work in another country."
good,"Less than ideal work conditions. But this should be expected from a large grain processing facility. 7 day rotating swing shift. When I worked there, there was basically no promotion from within, management was hired from outside."
good,"Équipe agréable et dynamique. Projets intéressants et novateurs. Quelques fois sclérosée par la bureaucratie interne et le manque de prise de décisions. Croissance nettement préférée par M&A. Très bons avantages sociaux. Les chances de promotion,sont à  Decatur, IL."
good,"No geral aprendi muito com colegas de trabalho e alguns superiores. O trabalho é em grande volume, mas satisfatório. A parte mais Agradável era relacionamento com colegas e clientes. A mais difícil era relacionamento com superiores devido ao fato de ser multinacional e não estarem presentes muitas vezes. A parte de benefícios era muito bom."
good,"I was working swing shifts, 1st, 2nd and 3rd shifts monthly.  I've learned a great deal in the lab about safety and also the importance of getting product out to customers in a timely fashion.  The hardest part about this job was the time away from my family and working swing shifts took a tool on my body."
good,"Nesta empresa aprendi que ""a cada escolha que fazemos, existe também uma renuncia""."
good,"I was an accountant. Had a great supervisor then they moved away. After that, all communication was lost with me and management staff. I went without a ""true"" supervisor until the time I left (over a year!). Management in the Oilseeds department was very poor and that is putting it nicely. No team building took place and was a very negative work environment (even before the layoffs took place). Loved the cafeteria and wellness center but other than that if you are not buddy buddy with your supervisor or management, kiss advancement good bye. I know after layoffs occurred in Feb. 2012 until now, there has been numerous people that have left ADM."
good,"12 hour shifts, good and professional co workers. hardest part hours. enjoyable co-workers"
good,"Overall, ADM had a relaxed atmosphere.  I learned what it  takes to produce a good product.  At the time I worked there, management was in a state of transition.  The hardest part of the job was doing alpha-amylase analysis.  The most enjoyable part of the job was doing research and development projects."
good,"Too focused on streamlining and saving money vs keeping experienced, knowledgeable employees.  The only positive thing I can say is they do offer great benefits"
good,"Where I am located there is a high turnaround of employees in the plant, management and office staff.  "
good,Good place to work however swing shift can be challenging. Workplace culture is good.  The hardest part of the job was the tank farm where temperatures were 133 degrees or more.
good,"Worked 12 hour night shifts in order to save money for college. Would not work as a permanent job. Was hired through a temp agency, so I did not receive benefits. If you stay for 9 months and actually know your job, you are likely to get hired on, in which case you would receive good benefits + increased pay."
good,Like any other business the position has its busy and slow times of the year. Depending on where you are located will determine how many hours a week you will work. If you are at a smaller country elevator you may only work 45 hours per week versus a terminal where management works 60+ routinely.
good,"A empresa possui um alto potencial de crescimento, mas processos antiquados e lideranças jurássicas atrasam inovações que poderiam ampliar a velocidade dos processos e tornar o trabalho mais agradável."
good,"learned how explosive and hazardous corn is when it is ground down into flower, specially in a confined space. jobs wasn't too difficulty, it was a little hot and we had to wearing PPE, but the worst part was probably the stairs. people were moderately friendly."
good,"not a bad company, just certain management stuck in their ways, did not get to show the skills I had because management didn't allow it. If you actually want to learn a bunch I suggest another company to intern with."
good,The only good thing about adm.  The money.  Rotating 12 hour swings are horrible. Not family orientated.  Favoritism is horrible.  You are a warm body that's it.  100% replaceable
good,"It was never boring, with different types of demands on quality and quantity of soy products being made and machine break downs happening often.  We had our safety challenges with work outside in all kinds of weather and lots of spilled product to clean up and to keep from slipping in."
good,"The plant was a nice environment to work in. There were many different learning opportunities, and always something to do. The schedule and projects were very flexible, which gives you time to work in the office and in the field."
good,"The company traditionally promoted upper management from within and had had a more ""paternalistic"" culture in which upper management looked after workers.  With changes, management has been optimizing its ROI for the past 4-5 yrs."
good,There are really good people that worked out there. Everyone is so willing to help you when you need it. We were all like family. Sadly the company just had a huge lay off.
good,"Calm or thrust into a whirlwind of activity. "
good,"*Typical work day could include cleaning, loading of trucks and rail cars to small repairs."
good,well what to say let me think I guess u can say the money was good the work suck the people suck and just everything suck so you can kiss my you know what
good,Shift work was ok but took awhile to get use to that schedule. Rescue training and exercises were fun to set up and play out. Very safety oriented for the whole company.
good,"The management will try and swindle their way into anything and take the quickest route for things to get done, even if they aren't compliant with government rules and regulations. They have very bad ethical judgments."
good,Adm is a profit driven company that has a good safety record.  The pay is within range of what is expected.  The benefits are good and the RRSP contribution is definitely above average.  I would say the job security is about standard in the Niagara region.  They are spending Capital money on projects to help efficiency and structure.
good,Busy place of keeping the machine clean of wheat and flour from pouring over a lot of shoveling and dumping cans. Very productive place. a lot of climbing keeps you busy.
good,"great opportunity, solid company, good benefits, "
good,Archer Daniels Midland is a great place to have a career as an Industrial Maintenance/ Electrical Technician. I gained great hands on experience with Archer Daniels Midland.
good,"I worked there on the maintenance crew, whatever broke In the plant we'd go out and fix it. "
good,Une entreprise dynamique qui laisse une grande autonomie à ses filiales dans la conduite de ces opérations industrielles si les objectifs financiers sont tenus.
good,This is a good job but pay isn't in line with my experience and there is no career path.  I have been there 4 years with no promotion and been told there is no where for me to go
good,Not a hard place to work at but the people in charge are very incompetent. Swing shifts on weekly basis can't make plans for weekend due to being told as late as friday afternoon that you have to work.
good,I worked for ADM as a young engineer and learned a lot during my time there.  I was able to get both hands on experience and office experience that I still refer back to today.
good,locations worldwide allow the opportunity to advance rapidly. Management seems to make even the smallest decisions based on stock prices
good,Good stuff for all to view and take leadership opportunities at the greatest extent of commodity merchandising. Open floor plan makes it difficult to focus on work
good,Very high turnover rate. Short breaks. Poor pay for the job. It's a job though to get you by I prefer not to have to work their again.
good,"Typical work day would vary, many days the job that you are there to preform is not the job you actually do. Many of the coworkers are very likeable, but any kind of family life is very limited and sometimes frowned upon. Management was not supportive at times and had unrealistic views of what could be accomplished.  The job at times of the year did give you flexibility."
good,"Typical day monitoring processing equipment and keeping it in the specs for good GMP practices."
good,found the job satisfying with the demand it had but engineering changes over the past several years made the job more difficult to perform my job. Working a swing shift with seven days in a row was also difficult and hard on personal life as well as health. Most job training was done by the operators qualified on those positions even if qualified for brief periods which left gaps in total knowledge of how to handle all situations. Work schedules could change daily. Never knowing if the day would last eight hours or twelve.
good,Aprendi muito trabalhar em equipe estava no meu lugar aonde queria balança documentacao facil de se aprender no sistema mopp.
good,"Working at ADM only allows advancement if you ""know"" someone in upper management."
good,"I would wake up at five, go to work at around six, and finish the day in the afternoon. the job was very laborious and dirty but was a learning experience non the less"
good,"none•	Unigraphics NX 5.0	•	Microsoft Word"
good,The biggest issue I had with this company was the 7 day swing shift.  That's 7 days straight of day shift then a four day weekend.  Come back to work on second shift for seven days straight then get one day off.  Come back the following night on third shift and work seven days straight.  Have two days off then rotate back to third shift.
good,My employment with ADM was too long ago. I cannot comment on the current environment.
good,"Fast paced but repetitive. Becomes easier with time and experience. Work/life balance is okay when fully staffed, but when short handed OT is forced. 12 hour swings will make you feel tired all the time. You will have to work weekends and holidays. Honestly it is just a foot in the door type of job. Get your entry level exp. and move on."
good,The hardest part of this job was cleaning hot melted chocolate off the floor when the holding tanks overfilled. The easiest part was just packing the chocolate
good,"For working in the middle of rural Illinois, ADM offers a wealth of opportunity and growth. Pay and benefits are competitive for the rural Midwest. Expect to work more hours than other companies (minimum 45 to 50 hrs a week). Work-life balance need improvement. PTO is okay for starting out, but caps early on in your career. No bonuses/overtime for lower-level salaried employees. Must be senior manager to receive those benefits."
good,Management do not know how to communicate with the employees management is rude please show molarity to friends and family not for a hardworking person that they are to do their job
good,I grew professionally at this employment but toward the end of my employment I accumulated too many responsibilities for one person to handle excuse you
good,Ich finde das Arbeitsklima GUT und deshalb gehe ich auch gerne zur Arbeit
good,"ADM is a 3/5 star corporation.  You are a number to them and a disposable figure. There are performance based increases, but no company-wide or personal bonuses given."
good,i was working here a while back was a good job but it ended..im looking for staedy work to provide a better living for me and my family.if i could i would work for the copamny again.
good,Being a food grade facility it can be challenging.  A lot of new additions to prep for the future of ADM as a whole.  World wide company with opportunities to grow or move which ever you may choose.
good,"Good place to work overall, only one electrician on the off shifts do you keep busy. pay could be better but the benefits are very good. Management does not look out for there employees"
good,"Although I enjoy the work I do, the management is not consistent with keeping promises or suggestions and blames others for their lack of consistency."
good,Many hours of overtime aggressive big tempo work environment union based wages and union fees to support daily operational support advancement individually based.
good,"Immediate supervisors and team are all wonderful to work with. Pay is fairly good and benefits are good. Health care is very good. However, the decision-making at higher levels seems to be very disconnected with the realities of how the business operates. Very thin staffing, and also not keeping up technologically."
good,"need to change from a 7 day swing shift it makes it a very long week when your there for 7 days, really like the people i worked with. some of the righ up proceedures and point system i feel need some work."
good,Very friendly coworkers management was ok the plant in my area closed down. Most enjoyable part of job was getting to know my coworkers
good,Good job but the management could use some work. Not the best pay but decent. The benefits are good enough to keep you around
good,"The hours of work could be varied at short notice on a day to day basis with additional runs been added onto your day with as little as 10 minutes notice. This made it hard to work round work/family committments, appointments. We worked well as a team and as individuals."
good,"A empresa tem uma preocupação rígida com a segurança do funcionário. A cobrança por uma rotina de trabalho segura chega a ser excessiva. Não possui um capital intelectual implantando, a forma de aprendizado depende muito do que o funcionário quer aprender, mas será cobrado pelo que sabe. A nível de engenheiro, a fábrica exigia uma carga horária de trabalho pesada, praticamente se passava 10/12 horas do dia dentro da unidade, sendo em contrato mensalista, ou seja, não se recebiam horas extras."
good,"Foi uma companhia boa para trabalhar, infelizmente o meu salário de gerente ficou fora do padrão para a posição devido ao tempo de serviço."
good,"learned managment skills, and further improved on job skills, hardest part of the job is not having a set work schdeule from week to week. Most enjoyable aspect of the job was the friends that i have made while at the company."
good,"Company has a large focus on production. Work-life balance can be tough sometimes. Compensation is above average, but salaried employees can be abused sometimes."
good,"Loved my job and the people I worked with.   However, no longer have security and loyalty from the company.      Treated as number not a valued employee."
good,"ADM is a good company to work for, and the pay is great, but you will be working 60-80 hours a week. That does not leave much free time for your family."
good,"Lots of management/cultural problems.  Very little room to disagree with anyone or make decisions on your own.  Management values consultant opinions over employees."
good,"Pay is not the best compared to the other mills due to Union people. Other mills do not have Union. I haven't received a raise in over a year. Can work overtime, and then you can't."
good,"ADM's massive organization means potential for opportunities that can span an entire career.  Education and experience matter, as does the strength of your professional network.  As long as you are willing to be flexible and to accept new challenges, ADM presents endless chances to reinvent your career."
good,"Working for ADM corn was a great job with its own issues."
good,"Has good benefits"
good,"Empresa de pequena porte, bastante aprendizado mas de pouca chances de crescimento."
good,"A typical day at work is laiden with meetings. My responsibility is to manage my team and their projects. I reveiw contracts and invoicing. My team is responsible for all Telecom and RF designs, quotes and implementation on a global foot print. My employees are sharp individuals and I only offer technical expertise when they struggle with a project. I manage daily projects as well as my team's needs, training, expense report approvals, personal time off, performance reviews and mentoring."
good,My typical day at work is spent time scheduling and planning shutdowns and outages. Purchasing material for jobs. Time spend in the field with maintenance crews. Meetings with maintenance contractors/supervisors and plant management to review next day activities.
good,"I worked as an intern at the Frankfort, IN, soybean processing plant as a merchandising intern. While the managers at the individual elevators are pretty great, the corporate culture hinders true autonomy due to approving/declining time off. Time off requests are regardless of manager's prior approval."
good,Avis favorable une bonne expérience cadre agréable.
good,"Work that keeps you busy but not grueling, not much of a work life balance because of the schedule of rotating shifts. Now that it has converted to a 12 hour shift, it may be better."
good,"Adm is a great place to work if you know somebody and are in management. As an hourly employee they say they care but fail to show it anymore, and tend to not take our opinions into deep consideration"
good,You go in and dont know for sure if you are gonna work 8hrs or 12. Not for someone who doesnt want to miss family moments and doesnt mind not seeing their children.
good,Ive been working at ADM for 3 years now. It is has been a great place to work and you learn a lot in a production environment. You are however to put it a lot of hours and work weekends.
good,"Great place to work, but want to pursue my career as a Heavy Duty Mechanic."
good,"This job started off as a great place to be, great benefits and compensation. I was part of a laboring crew that cleaned the soybean plant. I would work my way around the entire plant with a push broom and shovel looking for messes, spills, or anything out of place. Management handled things professionally by attending to problems immediately, attacking it, and called laborers to clean up. Handling problems between employees was not a strong suit. Co-workers were easy to get along with but even easier to tick off. Some were not very friendly and would like you to stay out of their way. The hardest part of the job was the stench, and the best parts of the job were the breaks. But all in all, I learned to be patient, swift, precise, and learned better decision making skills."
good,ADM has been a good company to work for. overall the most stable company in our area. has good benefits. always growing and improving all the time.  fair to most employees
good,"Fair pay for the amount of work done.  Challenging job to learn, less challenging once learned.  Not much for employee development opportunities.  Great benefits."
good,"The hardest part of the operator job I had was lack of being educated about the job itself."
good,"this company depending in the department it was busy, noisy, or very quiet.  The opportunity to learn and deal with customers across the world was really fun and interesting.  Learn a lot about various commodities as well.  The hardest part was attempting to move up in a department."
good,"A typical day as a Senior Global Security Operator would include, but not limited to one or a combination of the following that we were responsible to respond to; medical emergencies, other emergencies, and security issues."
good,"great people to work with, great place, in town, always able to move up to a better position, great management, and supervisors"
good,"It's a great place to work,you learn different things and if you don't know always ask and someone will show you . "
good,Very demanding job under staffed very hot dirty enviroment vey stressful managment not supportive of employees no time off for family company not very family orianted
good,I never had time for my family. Worked 7 days a week most weeks. Manager couldn’t do the job of the employees. Poor leadership from top to bottom. I’m happy I don’t work there anymore
good,No job security in position held. Management speaks about career development however there are not positions to move to unless you leave the department you are in. 18 month waiting period holds people back from working on their career.
good,"Very political with lots of nepotism. The division I was in was ran by people from outside the division that did not have passion or expertise for the job."
good,"Main focus of the work shift is to perform large number of analyses as quickly as possible to support manufacturing. Short breaks possible once comfortable with the work flow. Limitations put onto communication between coworkers and where you may have breaks."
good,"It could be a great company to work for, if the manager had some clue! About how to inter act with his drivers!"
good,Very unorganized. Management does not communicate very well if at all with the employees. Chain of command is not followed at a local level. If you are not an engineer your ideas are not taken into consideration.
good,"It's hard nobody cares if you're dying nobody cares about you, you work till you die and it's not fun. Alot of the job is decent except they are constantly short handed and the hours suck"
good,Good pay but no family or personal time. Fast pace work environment. Lot of opportunities for advancement. But the management team could use some interpersonal skills training.
good,"Some people were not great to work with and even treated you badly.  Others that were awesome made up for it.  If you are in the right spot with the right people, it can be awesome.  If not, it can be the opposite."
good,"The job overall is not bad, the pay makes up somewhat for the terrible work schedule.  Never have time off and constantly working because of swing shift."
good,"I liked working there, but it could be a dangerous place to work for someone with no experience. The employee that trained me did a wonderful job in making sure I was ready to safely and effectively do my job."
good,"I thought I found the right fit for me and my family for years to come, but the company decide to out source the entire department to over seas and now I am looking for job again.  I loved working with my co workers, made great friends."
good,"My job at ADM was very challenging, stressful, and rewarding all at the same time. I've always loved a good challenge to overcome whether alone or with a group of people."
good,More management than necessary to many people want my attention at once and hard to do what 3 bosses want you to do when there is not enough time in the day..But can be a good place to work and earn a living.
good,"Great job if you do not mind hard work and a LOT of hours.  Mandatory overtime every week, no holidays off but awesome pay with average benefits.  Hard to advance."
good,"ADM Milling has an all around good environment with great coworkers. I really enjoyed the physical labour but the hardest part of the job was dealing with rotting, moldy wheat."
good,"A empresa é muito boa, porém a coordenação é totalmente fora de qualquer questão. Supervisor da área desrespeitoso, mal-educado, sem qualquer limite de convivência, paciência e conversa."
good,"operate machine"
good,"Atuava com apuração de Impostos, entrega de obrigações acessórias referente a area Tributaria Fiscal."
good,"open up doors for semi's to enter. start elevators belts and drags .unload semi trailers. grade corn or beans for differant values. load grain in certain bins per weight, moisture, FM. bin sweeps. maintence of property. i was taught how to operater a grain elevator and some heavy equipment. managment is a being transfered around so you will never have the same manager for over a year or two. co-worker seemed to be all great guys and girls.the hardest part was always getting a new manager.the best part of it was being able to work inside or outside"
good,Good pay. But just normal things you have to deal with management. Gets really boring sometimes. But again it is really good pay and awesome benefits.
good,"A good job to have around these parts, nice people good insurance steady work for the most part a place you can advance in with good work ethic......."
good,ADM is a pretty decent place to work as long as you are on the salary side of the business. Pretty relaxed place with some good leaders. There are high expectations for the workers but as long as you get the job done there is nothing to worry about.
good,"Very nice. A typical day at ADM was enjoyable, People were easy to work with and cared about the safety of their workmates and the overall morale was good"
good,"Multinacional do Agronegócio, excelente empresa para trabalhar, oferece muitos benefícios, ótima empresa para adquirir muito conhecimento pela complexidade de suas operações."
good,ADM is a fortune 40 Company and our smaller facility felt more like a family than one would think for a Company of that size. Great overall experence. People are productive and clear goals established. People work together as a Team throughout all departments.
good,Great atmosphere and great employees and managers. Flexible hours were really nice. They will work with any personal issues you have and believe that family comes first.
good,California locations are a new venture by ADM that are struggling to get off of the ground but have the potential to do very well in the future. I would recommend that the simplify their products and get good at a few things first before trying to overcomplicate things.
good,Fast paced environment where no two days were the same. Great pay and great team to work with. Uniforms provided. Safety contious. Located centrally in the city.
good,This job was my first time working in a plant and it was a great experience. I learned about the day to day responsibilities of process engineers and implemented projects.
good,"Very fast paced job, I was laid off due to lack of sales but I look forward in growing with another company closer to home I really do not know what else to write about for this company."
good,"Good place to work, I am relocating due to my wife's job.  I have spent many years at ADM and would stay there until retirement if we were not relocating."
good,Good pay.  Good benefits. Overall not a bad place to work.  Administration are descent to the 'underlings'.  I would recommend for a career.  This is only for the IT department.
good,"Great place to work, to succeed and learn. Global company."
good,"It is alright to work at ADM. The insurance is absolutely great, the wages are all right but lower than all other factories around. Hours are not good."
good,"Company is multinational, yet able to move fairly quickly to take advantage of opportunities. Emphasis on employee development. Current CEO is out of touch with company history and culture, and has made decisions that are detrimental."
good,"Rotating day/night 12 hour shifts for Operators. Lots of different jobs to take within the company. Very good benefits including dental, medical and 401k."
good,I advanced pretty fast but management isn't fair some days some rules apply some days they don't but it's a good job to have and pay is pretty nice
good,"A typical day at work consists of routine daily reports and data entry.  I have learned a lot about organization and about industry period.  I have been very fortunate to have great supervisors/managers, and I have made very good friends with all my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is having to adjust to sudden last minute changes that need corrected.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working at my own pace & having a sense of independence in my position & working with my co-workers."
good,A job that can give you knowledge on what its like to see what goes into making bread. It is a job that is similar to that of a factory workers.
good,"I would recommend ADM to anyone. Overtime is offered, pay is good. ADM has high regards to promoting a safety and ensuring that all has environmental awareness training."
good,"Benefits are terrific "
good,"Great coworkers, management is always helpful, great experience from the years worked here, I would recommend this company to anyone coming out of college"
good,"Great job and great place to work. I operated a robot that stacked flour on a pallet. After the pallet was filled, I would take the pallet wrap it and load it on a truck. The hours were great and so was the pay. Management ran the company very efficient."
good,always learning something new from my fellow co-workers. The hardest part of my job was getting frustrated when I wan not able to locate a client. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was able to track down a client.
good,"Dirty place, managers are ok to work with. "
good,"Uma empresa ética, com excelentes normas de segurança, e de oportunidades."
good,"A day at ADM is hard to describe. Each day would be a little different than the day before. It offered new challenges every day. At the end of the day I felt a sense of accomplishment, like I had/have achieved something, reached a goal."
good,tested raw material and finished product.  pulled samples for evaluation. simulated the conditions that would be used at the customers place of business.  tested products for contaminate.  adjusted formulas for production.
good,was a refined oils production plant.  worked in the lab where we tested edible oils throughout all aspects and steps of the refining process.
good,"My day to day job included supporting existing applications, customer support, creating new applications, and communicating with managers. I learned how to effectively communicate, process, and handle working with in a fortune 50 company. The immediate manage was very helpful in dealing with customers and upper level management. The hardest part of the job was learning how to properly communicate with management. The most enjoyable part of my job was my work. I take pride in everything that I touch and work on to ensure that the end user is completely satisfied with the product that I produced for their needs."
good,"the people were good, it was a good place to work. this job has a very friendly environment. the  supervisors were kind and helpful. its in a pretty remote area"
good,Ok to work for the company expected more and more from individuals as the years went by.  Colleagues were friendly and a mixed bunch of people.........
good,Swing shift was hard on the family. Lots of trainings for all different stuff we worked on . If you could get straight days it would be a good place to work or if you could do swings
good,"During the day shift there’s plenty of help available, less stressful, at night shift different story, can be extremely stressful. You are often by yourself trying to do several jobs at once in order to optimize production."
good,Nice place to work.  ADM offers a variety of careers which gives you options to work in a multitude of roles without leaving the company.  Many employees stay for their whole careers.
good,This is a good place to work and they offer good work-life balance. Have few excellent managers who care for team members. Have excellent team members. Offers good benefits.
good,"Empresa multinacional, com um enorme potencial, vem crescendo sempre, porém precisa dar mais atenção a área de operação."
good,"Working 2nd shift is not for everyone.  If all shifts were treated equally it would be a great place.  Managers are good, but supervisor has no people skills."
good,ADM is a great company to work for and has a great benefits package. If you are willing to relocate you can continue to advance in this company as far as your qualifications will allow.
good,"I love my job! I climbed the ladder fast and by fast i mean within a year i went from making $15 an hour to $23 an hour. The people who work there, mainly those within the maintenance department, are underhanded, sneaky and will throw anyone under the bus if they feel they may benefit from it in any way. Most other employees have been there for a while and regardless of your capabilities, they are quick to condescend and degrade. Which makes the work environment very hostile at times. Management was always willing to work with employees on time off as well as overtime. If you can separate yourself from the constant drama, ADM is an amazing place to work. I enjoyed it."
good,Adm is really great place to work.The rotating shifts are hard but manageble. Typically the days go by fast The process of dehulling and cracking the bean to flake it sounds simple but requires multiple machines to reach a end goal.
good,"standard work hours for 1st shift 7-3;8-4,9-5 pm"

good,"Rotating shift has ups/downs. Good benefits. Overtime opportunities. Would apply with company again, changing a few circumstances."
good,ADM is a good company to work for as far as pay and benefits. My only problem with them is once you work up so far they pressure you to leave other than coach and train for management. I learned a lot of skills from them if they would give me a chance to advance I would go back in a second.
good,"it is a physically demanding place to work in all types of weather. It pays well, has decent benefits from your very first day of orientation as well as, the ability to bid on a posted job on your first day of orientation as well. It is a stable place to work and, you do not have to worry about being laid off due to lack of work. it is an extremely safety oriented environment , as it should be. They provide boots , safety glasses , Helmets and any other ppe that may be required  for any job that has to be performed there."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar na ADM. É uma empresa com muitos desafios no dia a dia. Passei por vários setores da empresa, comecei a trabalhar na empresa na divisão de fertilizantes em Catalão, diferente do que eu vinha trabalhando a treze anos na Cargill, que é de processamento de grãos. Praticamente toda matéria-prima é importada e formulada para clientes. Apos dois anos e meio veio a transferência para Uberlândia e desta vez no ramos de processamento de grãos como na Cargill, trabalhei tanto na contabilidade da fabrica quanto na contabilidade da originação de grãos, a parte mais difícil foi quando as atividades foram transferidas para a Cidade de Ribeirão Preto, foi criado um centro de serviços e varias pessoas foram dispensadas, e com isso tivemos que ir até Ribeirão para treinar as pessoas a fazerem nossas atividades. Com isso aprendi varias coisas pois tivemos também que nos adaptar e trabalhar em equipe com as pessoas do Centro de serviços."
good,"I was on the swing shift so I was always adjusting my sleep.  It was also man for man substitution when employees take vacation, FMLA, or just call in sick.  Working overtime is common and having to stay late before a vacation day or a day off is common.  Being called in early on your day off or on a vacation day is also common.  Manager lack motivation skills but they were consistent and expectations were always the same for everybody.  The foreman were operators promoted to management so they had a great command of the process and how to make corrections.  They were always happy to train and teach knew skills to motivated employees.  The management above foreman was invisible till you did something wrong.  To find them I had to go to their desk.  The benefits were good and health insurance was really great.  I would say that it was a positive experience and I learn a lot."

good,"Amerikaanse Cultuur geen 9 tot 5 mentaliteit "
good,I worked loading and off loading barges from a rig. It took lots of working parts and people working on the same page.  This took place in the middle of the Mississippi river. At times this job was real dangerous.
good,This company is not bad they have some weird culture right now the training is really really horrible but if you want to really advance and learn what's in there you can put your own effort in and they will support you a little bit it's a lot over time it's a really small crew you could see yourself you know working 40 or 44 hours a week and you may end up in a situation where you find yourself working 50 and 60 hour work week so I working 7 days a week
good,Empresa bem estruturada. Bons salários e benefícios. Fui estagiário e meu maior problema foi a indisponibilidade dos funcionários do setor para ensinar o trabalho. Integração pobre.

good,Enjoyable work with a fast paced environment. Many different types of people working together. At times stressful.but always rewarding when the job is done.
good,"Supervised over four departments, maintained three department processes and lab results.  I watched production lines and what was stored in the shipping department.  It was stressful and unorganized at times, but I was able to be successful in the position.  We had to fulfill maintenance items with the equipment being off-line, which was a challenge but was able to complete.  The fifty people I supervised I was able to get along with and we had a good working relationship.  The respect was mutual on both ends."
good,Una buena empresa para aprender sobra la industria de trading de commodities.
good,"During the first 10 - 15 years of my employment, ADM had the feel of a family run business.  Employees were viewed and treated as valuable. The knowledge and experience was of great importance to ADM.  Once someone outside the company was hired to lead the company, the value of personnel began to decrease.  Leadership did not want to hear disagreeable opinions. As such, the family feel and appeal disappeared."
good,Safety first culture always. Good place to work. Management always think about the employees. Hardest part of the job is noise of rollers and sifters for 24 hours
good,I was working third shift and a lot of the time I would have to work 12 hour shifts. I enjoyed my time there and would still be washing trailers I given the chance.
good,"ADM has given me the opportunity to grow as a business analyst.  Continuous learning is encouraged.  Benefits are good.  It's not always the most exciting place to work, but they take care of their people."

good,Lots of quality checks and a focus on safety which taught me the value of performing tasks with purpose and care.  Promoting a culture of caring for a employees well-being is something that had not experienced up to this point.
good,I have held a comfortable position for several years but have feared being part of the leaving tide of lay offs twice in 5 years of that time.  With this harbinger of bad feelings for the future many long time employees are choosing to seek other employment at this time.
good,ADM offers a great benefit package. ADM gives to the community as well as its employees.  It is rewarding being part of a company that cares about their people and the environment.

good,"ADM is a good place to work if you can learn fast and be very careful as to what you are doing. There are a lot of different jobs that have to be done get to the finished product. For instance, moving/spotting rail cars in to designated areas which are very critical. Hooking up steam to get certain product to a certain temperature and if done incorrectly can be unsafe or ruin product. Attach product lines to the rail cars in a sanitary manner to get product inside to be loaded onto tanker trailers/bulk grain trailers. Washing/cleaning trailers. Paperwork following every step. I loved some of the people I worked with. Management is okay but definitely needs improvement. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the work load with the amount of people on the team. Some days it would be fine but that doesn't account on days that things go wrong and the systems would always fail due to the facility being new."
good,"Tive a experiencia de poder lidar melhor com tudo referente ao custo contábil de uma empresa, além de que pude conviver com pessoas com culturas e ideias diferentes."
good,Loading semis with corn product. Driving bobcat to move different corn products. Everything we did was simple so there wasn't much learning involved. Management was kind of poor in my opinion. All my coworkers were great. Working a swing shift really took from family time and being able to do normal activities. The easiest part was the job itself. Nothing about it was hard.
good,A typical day often times was spent managing inventory and rail/truck fleets.
good,"temos um ambiente de trabalho agradável com bons equipamentos que nos ajudam no melhor desenvolvimento de nossa obrigações, a Adm é uma grande escola, com bons diretores e companheiros de trabalhos inesquecíveis. a parte mais difícil do trabalho e lidar com a constante troca de turnos, e a mais agradável é o ambiente em si que nos permite desenvolver nosso trabalho."

I learned much about the logistics of grain hauling through truck, rail, and vessel. We were set up in small groups with a supervisor to lead us. There were managers and directors to communicate the business objectives through the groups. I appreciate my experiences at ADM and enjoyed being a part of their team."

good,"Muita demanda de trabalho. Trabalho com pressão e metas a atingir me fez crescer muito profissionalmente."
good,I loved the productivity of the place. Loved how it provided you structure and discipline. The management was great. Did hire some incompentent people who abused the system.

good,"Long hours during harvest . Great group of people to work with for my duration. Great time while it lasted, but not for anyone that doesn’t want to work. You will be working rain, sun or snow."
good,"ADM is a good company to work for if you don't mind a more unstable work schedule. Most weeks it was unknown until Friday if you had to come in on Saturday. Although you are compensated greatly for this, it begins to seriously effect your personal life."
good,"Good place to work, but very hectic work schedules.  The best thing is the high wages because you can write your own check. The overtime is there if your willing to work"
good,"ADM provided me with very helpful and useful skills over the years and made me feel like I was contributing to something greater than myself."
good,The pay and benefits are excellent.  My advice is to pay close attention to your surroundings and learn as much as you can.  ADM offers many opportunities.

good,I really enjoyed my time at ADM.  The rotating schedule was difficult but you were highly compensated for your time.  I learned a lot about working in a factory laboratory setting and safety in this type of an environment was an main focus.  Budget cuts caused my position to be eliminated and these cuts came annually this this was a sstressful part of the job.  The team environment and ever changing work load was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Hard work to do, family and work life is not well balanced, and never know when you may have a day off. They run 2 shifts, 7-3 and 3-11. In peak and busy times they run 7a-7p and 7p-7a."

good,"Oferece condições de trabalho aos funcionários"
good,"Work culture varies largely between plants and departments.  Some departments are very relaxed and well organized, while others are a struggle.  Management likes to move engineers around frequently to try to get jack-of-all-trades types.  Very safety conscious as a company.  The hours can be long and the pay isn't amazing but the people are great and the actual work not that stressful.  Management listens to its employees and makes noticeable efforts to improve continuously."

good,For the most part I enjoyed working there. I learned a wide variety of jobs that I might not gave had the opportunity to elsewhere. Such as end loaders and telehandler.
good,"job was fairly easy, yet stressful, cleaning up thousands of pounds of flour or corn one day, to only turn around & clean up another pile of even more the same or next day. but it was job security. management, my boss was real cool. the most enjoyable part, was seeing the place clean & the hours plus you got a hour long lunch"

good,"Great hands on experience in facility and grain management. Co-workers were mostly friendly and willing to help others. Management at the location changed numerous times over the past 10 years, especially for the Superintendent position. I worked with 2 different Superintendents. Open communication was encouraged.

good,"ADM was a company that allowed you freedom to pursue almost any type of project that was justifiable. Most management and hourly were able to take on projects in safety or optimization if they chose to put in the time. There were opportunities for overtime and fairly relaxed spending limits at the plant level. I key for any big projects was justification. The culture is primarily focused on Safety and they really make sure that everyone is involved in Safety to some extent. Most of management spends close to 25% - 35% of their time on Safety items such as committees, reports, lessons or training. In Peoria itself we had a Union environment with a little bit of division between management and hourly, but for the most part those walls were deteriorating when I left. The only reason I left was I felt I was being heavily underutilized and could achieve an opportunity to grow more quickly elsewhere."

It has a place for advancement.  Working in a place like this enables you to go forward. For this reason alone, I would recommend working at ADM."
good,"ADM was a great job. The experience was awsome. I enjoy the people, as well as the pay. This is a job for people willing to actually come to work to work."

good,Worked a swing shift schedule which was the hardest part. Everyday was different. Worked with the same group everyday. Learned how to perform all tasks and duties required to work safely and efficiently. Learn to drive a forklift.
good,I loved the company and my staff. I would still be there if it were not for my family obligations that made me relocate. My director and the plant manager were always understanding to my needs. My staff was incredible.
good,"Constant work, 40-48 hours weekly. Competitive wages and great benefits coverage. Union for all mill workers and non unionized for lab staff. Great paid vacation! Rotating shift work and mainly 6 days a week, a big commitment."
good,The role was great. HR made sure we had the resources we needed to be successful. Get opportunities to travel and visit other branches. Don't really get a say in where your location will be in the future.
good,My typical work day was fast paced and spontaneous.  I was given the opportunity to showcase my skill and advance my knowledge in the maintenance and calibrations of laboratory equipment.  I was able to learn the importance of documentation and how it can become a tool in making a lab run efficiently.  The people I worked with were phenomenal.  We were able to work cohesively together to ensure the most accurate results.  The majority of my work experience at ADM was performed with very little to no supervision.
good,I enjoyed working at ADM. The people that I worked with were great. I learned a lot while employed there. The problem the knowledge learned was pretty independent and could have used more formal training. Benefits were good. Flexibility was also good.
good,Great if you are ok with working nights and weekends. It's swing shift 12 hours. People are mostly good people. Jobs are tough but time goes fast. If i didn't have kids I would still work there.
good,"Uma empresa ótima para trabalhar, onde os profissionais são valorizados e reconhecidos."
good,ADM is great place to work. Typical day is busy with loading semi trucks and rail cars. I learned how many different products and uses can be made from corn. Supervisors and lower management were cool. Plant manager was outstanding. There were a few managers that were in a position they didn't need to be in and have as much power as they did. Workplace culture is based on safety. Hardest part of the day was when a person was getting overloaded and no help was given. Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I had done everything possible for the next shift and to leave in the best spot possible and talking with crew mates close to the end of the day.
good,Ótima empresa com oportunidades de crescimento e um bom ambiente de trabalho. Local com qualidade e bons funcionários.
good,"A typical day involves reviewing paper work for final products, generating COAS for final products, managing 12 lab technicians, maintaining labs HPLC and GC systems, maintaining other lab instruments, performing laboratory testing, assisting QC manager, and various other tasks."
good,"nothing bad to say about ADM.  treated me well, paid me well for being a college kid, part time.  flexible hours around my school.  gave me projects and allowed me to complete them at my pace and independently, with not too many deadlines."
good,"Global company with great leadership, vision, and staff. Challenging work environment with proper work life balance. Definitely one of the best places I have worked,"
good,It was an all around good place to work and I had an easy going manager who was easy to work for. I would still be there if not for something in my personal life.
good,"Great fun and learning environment. I had an opportunity to work with the company for close to 4 years. During that period, I got a chance to work with a great group of people who were genuinely interested in my career growth. I had hands on learning experience about agricultural business concepts and ideologies."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar, agradável,com amplo espaço de aprendizado e exige responsabilidade e comprometimento."
good,"Entrei na ADM com pouca experiência e tive grandes oportunidades de aprender."
good,I completely enjoyed working for ADM Milling division. My manager and team were very good about teaching/communicating. They believe in the abilities of their staff and utilized our skills.
good,Archer Daniels Midland is a agriculture leader who believes in the safety of there employees and customers. They also offer great benefits and 401k options.
good,I loved working for ADM.  They are a close knit family oriented company that truly cares about employees.  If they saw me working too many hours they made sure I had help so I could get everything done and not spend too many hours at work.  I was a salaried employee so they would not have had to pay me more to work more hours.
good,Productive very nice place to work.People were good supervisors.
good,I loved working for this company but I did not get the recognition that I truly deserved for all my 13 years of hard work.
good,its a good place to work if you can get in!! benfits and pay are good they are very safe and have a good active safety program
good,Helped in everyday tasked in the elevator
good,"This is one of the best companies I have worked for, until they decided to do an entire IT restructure. They got rid of hundreds of IT employees to hire on TCS contractors. Otherwise, good benefits, steady hours. Poor business decisions by terminating good seasoned employees for contractors."
good,I worked for roughly 3 years at the Fremont ADM location and if you can ignore the shift swings it is a solid place to make a large amount of money with little wear on the body. You have to work 8 a.m to 4 p.m for 1 week. then you work 12 am to 8 am for 1 week then 4 pm to 12 am 1 week then you get 5 days off. it sounds harsh but you get paid a good amount and it has some of the best managers I've ever worked for. Would recommend highly as you can easily become a supervisor with enough time and make a life out of this job.
good,"ADM is a nice place to work, the management is respectful and take care about employees. ADM has good benefits and advanced Human Resources Polity. Thank you."
good,Great place to work. Always had people who would help out. we were a team and loved to get things done. They would coach and train you how to do things better.
good,"Enjoyable work, good set of co-workers, ability to take lunch when desired. Relaxed environment. In-house lunches and cafeteria, good training (at least for the department)."
good,"For the most part, the operations side of ADM is very competitive."
good,"The hourly employees were great, the pay was fantastic for the work done, and the benefits were good too. Management was poor, they like to fire right before you get into the union"
good,"ADM provides several opportunities for its employees. Benefits are good, hard to find a job that can compete with salary. You can change groups with ease and get a change to see different parts of the company."
good,"Great work environment, always something new to learn, management is always more than willing to help, great coworkers"
good,"I love going to work ,I like to drive and I like people I work with. Thay push safety first,and dot regulations. To me this is the only way to operate successful company."
good,This is a company with a large global footprint.  There are issues that you become involved in that few other corporations would have.
good,"ADM is a good company to work for, they care about their employees, they allow a good work/life balance (I've had two babies while being employed and have had no issues with time off, etc). They hand new engineers a lot of responsibility right out of college but provide guidance to help them succeed. You get your hands dirty right away and gain a load of experience and knowledge in a short time. The only complaint I have is that the company lacks a career path for engineers. If you don't want to go into plant management there is little advancement for you."
good,ADM Corporate Office is a great place to work if you like a fast fast environment with great coworkers. Hopefully ADM does not decide to relocate out of Decatur.
good,Experiencia de trabalho em equipe e processos industriais.
good,"Ótima recepção, bem dinâmica com os funcionários, sempre aparecia uma médica/personal nos setores e promovia um ""treino/alongamento"", sempre se preocupando com a saúde do funcionário."
good,"Good, the job was nice and hands on and gave me an opportunity to develop my creative skills, along with critical thinking and turning ideas or inspirations into reality."
good,"Overall it is a great place to work from my perspective. While jobs were not replaced after people retired due to the economy, the business itself is stable. So you have job security."
good,Productive work environment.  The work place and culture at the facility was very good.  I highly recommend this company for anyone seeking work in the agribusiness sector.
good,"ADM was an excellent experience for me. The job taught me machinery such as working conveyor, loading trucks using controllable bins. It also taught me how to turn wheat into flour. I love working with my hands and that job was hands on."
good,"ADM is a very solid, successful forward looking company. The management team has a strong commitment to safety , quality and environment in all aspects of business with a vested interest in the progress and development of employees."
good,"Adm Barcarena hoje é uma das melhores empresas para se trabalhar no Brasil,e é uma das melhores ou a melhor da  região norte.isso posso afirmar por que com todos que já conversei estão felizes por fazer parte desta família que é a ADM do Brasil."
good,Leadership in previous role was a micro manager.  Did not communicate down to provide key business updates.  Open communication and ideas were not appreciated but instead viewed as combative.
good,"Before I left I was wearing 3-4 hats and very much enjoyed what I was doing and accomplishing, however the pay rate/rank does not change easily.  Two sides to plant work, the office and the plant workers.  Office staff was not recognized as much as equals to the plant workers.  More so the office ""Staff"" were not recognized accordingly as ""Sales/Merchandisers""."
good,"Learned everything I know from ADM, would suggest this place for anyone looking for. A day at work consisted of maintaining production goals and making sure of a safe work environment. Making decisions on process operations. The hardest part of the job was getting pulled in multiple directions by upper management. The most enjoyable part of my job was some of the people I worked with. I worked there going on 31 years and enjoyed it all until the end when micro managing was introduced."
good,Ótima empresa onde pude aprender bastante e que atribui uma ótima relação interpessoal e trabalho em equipe.
good,"Executa serviço na Área Fiscal e tendo uma auxiliar, executava serviços de apuração de impostos e controle de Licenças e Obrigações"

good,Working as a Lab Tech at ADM's research center was the first job related to my career field and it was an excellent start. I made my intentions to progress in my career and with the company well known and was rewarded with many opportunities. They are very encouraging of self-development.
good,"I was always happy with my employment at Archer Daniels Midland.  I was a remote employee, one of the first in the research group.  It allowed me to work more flexibly and meet urgent deadlines more easily."
good,"Profissionais competentes e qualificados, equipe extremamente unida nas tomadas de decisões"

good,Quality analyst was a good experience that made me learn about LC and GC instrumentation that helped me alot in my later education that is in my master.
good,"Multinacional que no Tocantins está direcionada com a captação de grãos ( originação) onde tive  a grata oportunidade de conhecer na prática alguns conceitos da administração e sugerir e colocar em ação algumas situações aprendidas em minha graduação.

good,"From the moment you walk in the door you are running till the moment you leave. Which makes the work day go by much faster which is a definite plus. I learned a ton every aspect right from the delivery to the milling and the testing of the wheat. It is an amazing job and an awesome place to work. Management has your back 100% of the way and helps you with any questions they have an outstanding support structure. My co-workers were knowledgable and helpful answering any questions and offering support every step of the way. It was a fast paced, High stress job which makes you feel a sense of accomplishment at the en of the day. tis just an awesome place to work"
good,"A empresa é liderada por um excelente gerente, no qual da espaço um ótimo espaço para o crescimento e desenvolvimento profissional, e até mesmo em ensinarmos uns aos outros. Os colegas de trabalho eram uns educados com os outros, não havia muito desentendimento uns aos outros."
good,Not alot of guidance and support to grow and do well. Some bosses are in their own world. Sector was even quite boring and mundane. Lean team operations primarily.
good,I would recommend it. Best pay around Decatur. Great hours. Excellent benefits that are not high priced or costly. Gives great job experience you can take with you no problems.

good,This was a very friendly work environment. I really liked the people I worked with. They were always willing to assist and help in any way. I learned many things working with this company. This was a trucking company that tranported liquid materials. This was a temp assignment and I only worked with them for 3 months. The company relocated out of NJ to PA. My assignment was ended.
good,"Archer Daniel Midland (ADM) was a temp job i worked at. A trucking company that moved liquid materials. I worked in the office part of this business.

good,"Trabalhei 13 anos na matriz em São Paulo e mais 2 anos no Centro de Serviços Administrativos em Ribeirão Preto. Foi uma trajetória de muito aprendizado e dedicação e o reconhecimento foi minha transferência para o interior de São Paulo, passando de Secretária Executiva da Diretoria para Supervisora Administrativa com gestão de 12 funcionários. Neste último trabalho gerenciei a área de viagens e supervisionei a área de Travel & Expense. Supervisionei ainda os times de call center e customer service. Também fui Office Manager. Trabalhei nas duas cidades em um ambiente de trabalho saudável, com código de ética e políticas bem definidas.

good,The most valuable part of this job was managing the level of responsibilities and being able to manage the work load with satisfaction.

good,"A typical work day includes the mixing and weighing of grain to certain specifications to be loaded on a ship. I've learned a great deal about time, labor, and resource management in order to achieve maximum production. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with the high amount of stress that comes with achieving the production goals set by management. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction between the co-workers and never having an identical work day."
good,"Empresa proporcionava aprendizado com cursos on line."
good,"Até o momento tem sido uma experiência agradável trabalhar lá, salário / benefícios bons e oportunidades de aprendizado e crescimento também!"
good,Trabalhei lá empresa maravilhosa foi uma satisfação imensa.

good,"I paid bills, worked in customer service and did balance sheets monthly. "

good,"Good place to learn and brush up your basic engineering, long hours if you like and explore the old and new technology combination."
good,"Friendly people, great benefits. When a problem arises, there is a lot a work to be done but when things are running smooth then it pretty much runs itself. The company values safety and provides employees with top of the line PPE to include rain and cold weather gear."
good,"Management was great, they were always respectful and I always knew what tasks I had to do that particular day. The work was hard at times, but there was always help if I needed it."
good,ADM was an excellent company to work for.  There was tremendous opportunity to grow.  I loved working at the Baltimore grain elevator.  This is where I learned to become a great supervisor.  Our work staff including upper management were some of the greatest most respectful people I have ever worked with.  I miss it very much and remember all the long nights exporting grain onto the ships.  It could be stressful at times but truly memorable.  The experience I have gained working for ADM has been priceless.  They could of paid me a little more because I was a hard worker and a valuable asset to the company but I never complained about it.
good,"Workplace culture (safety) is wonderful. The people at ADM are wonderful and they look after your best interest. All of the employees, whether they are in management or not, look after each other to make sure that we go home safe every day."
good,"While my job was very busy and hard to keep up with, the encouragement to keep work/life balance was priority in my supervisors.  The co-workers I encountered from day one were awesome.  Very welcoming and encouraging over all.  I would go back in a heartbeat if given the chance."

good,"Milling Machine Operater, unloading and"
good,Would start off by getting a cap of what took place on the shift before me.Then usually would get everything set up so I could multi task with ease. My co workers were a great group of men and women. The hardest part about the job was learning when to sleep sometimes you didn't know if you were coming or going. The best part of the week was payday.
good,"Management is excellent always behind you in every way and very encouraging of success"
good,Start of the day with Toolbox meeting to get the crafts started on a safe workday. Workload discussions and visual inspection.
good,"I had an excellent boss. He was considerate, and flexible when I needed time off for children's activities. If offered the chance to go back, I would in a heartbeat!"
good,Overall a great company to work for. I would love to go for for Archer Daniel's Midland again. Hardly ever had problems with any of the equipment. Everyone did their jobs and management was great
good,Great workplace with experts in the field and information sharing.  Management helps move careers and there are many competitive benefits to enjoy at ADM.

Empresa forte, boa de trabalhar, oferece boas condições aos funcionários."
good,"Solid company, good people, excellent products.  ADM has a long and strong history as a food and energy global company.  ADM has a lot of assets and strong people on their team."
good,"I was always learning something new with this company. The benefits were the best out of any company I've ever worked for. Had great support from colleagues, and management."
good,Great company. Very dusty and hot work environment. On call and overtime plentiful. Not a good place if you have any allergies or breathing problems. Good people.
good,It can get a little hot on the barges in the summer but overall a great place to work and vice versa in the winter.  everyone gets along and do their job
good,"Trabalhei na ADM por quase 7 anos, onde eu tinha uma rotina de trabalho bastante dinâmica.Lidava com tarefas rotineiras e com prazos. Mas também com atividades sem rotina onde eu aplicava a minha capacidade de lidar com pessoas e solução de problemas.Meu trabalho sempre foi diretamente ligado com a gerência.Dentro da ADM eu era conhecida como a secretária executiva bilingue do gerente. Tive a oportunidade de trabalhar com vários gerentes. A empresa possui uma política e valores sólidos, porém cada gerente tem os seus procedimentos de trabalho, e tive bons feedbacks. A parte mais difícil foi ter passado por duas grandes reestruturações globais e ver excelentes profissionais perderem seus empregos quando outros não bons permaneciam. Na rotina do trabalho, enfrentei tarefas difíceis, mas sempre encarei como desafios, e gosto de desafios."
