bad,"Fire at will, absolutely no overtime or they adjusted your hours back to what you were supposed to work. No breaks. Made you feel VERY under appreciated as not just a worked, but a human. It was stressful cause my manager slept all the time, my higher ups only stepped in if things got very extreme. My coworkers all worker against each other. It was awful and almost drove me off a ledge.. Literally."
bad,"A very poorly managed and unappreciated work place for employees, no respect and concern from management, constant harassment and ridicule! I have made continuous attempts to report hostility of ongoing problems from daily work in a 40 hour scheduled week only to be treated very poorly and unprofessionally by manager I reported to at this store in palmer!"
bad,I dont have anything nice to say about my experience working at Tesoro in Girdwood. It was almost impossible to achieve your daily chores while helping customers with their needs.
bad,"Worst company in Paradise to work for. District Manager made fun of me for being deaf, because she was mumbling like a red neck and I asked her to repeat herself. She didn't know I was actually deaf, then laughed at me when I told her I really was and have been for ten years. Team members will steal from your drawer and the blame will go on you. Assistant manager will tell you something is ok, then you will get fired for doing it by the manager. 5 thumbs down."
bad,"The atmosphere is like a high school concentration camp. All gossip. Even managers you cannot respect because they will go behind your back gossiping. Assistant managers get one more dollar for tons more work than CSAs. CSA you get 50 cents during your 6 months then in one whole year you get one whole dollar so on and so forth. Managers are lazy and tend to just come in to close and open the day and make schedules while gossiping with Regional Area Managers who they all often get taken out to lunch.  and put most work on assistant managers and CSAs. Assistant managers is just the position that the manager can put all the real work on and get blamed for everything. Three write ups and you're fired even if they didn't teach you everything and just expect you to know it? Safety Audits every single day boring paperwork. Customers have the most ridiculous problems not being able to simply just PUMP gas, they'll yell, they'll steal. You'll have to deal with homeless people think that gas station is the place to beg people for money. You deal with drunk people, women who will squat and number 1 right outside the door. You deal with homeless people who take a number 2 right outside and you have to clean it up. Spills and possible fires. Oh and they have cameras which they use to monitor employees and one little slip up will cost you your minimum wage job."
bad,I would not work for them ever again and I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,It is a job but would not recommend as they do not offer any benefits aside from getting paid. Its not really a bad choice but if you want to commit yourself to a company and put in an effort Tesoro is not the choice for you
bad,Horribleplace to work. Managment micro manage everything. Very stressful. Benifit is worse. Will make u work on your day off. Rude bias and racist retail derector. Dont cooperate  and treat every employee differently.  Overall it was a nightmare . Think twice before you apply.
bad,"Not at all a good company to work for!!!!"
bad,I worked a lot but was not paid enough for the work I did. I was the assistant manager and when the time came for me to go I was treated unfairly. My unit treated employees like doormats.
bad,"Work comes before family.  Your laptop will come home, you will have your work emails on your phone, and your personnel will contact you at all times with a wide variety of questions.  The trade off is the compensation for those with no degree at all in the Operation's world is very good."
bad,Very poor place to work. You really do quit bosses instead of jobs. I was treated very unfairly by this company. I would not recommend employment with this company to anyone.
bad,"working at a gas station and convenience store has its ups and downs the ups of the job are that your constantly busy and that can be both good and bad theirs always something to do i it be stocking product , ordering product and then the bad part  is that someone is always coming in when you are doing something and you have to take care of the customer then go back to what you were doing if you dont like being interrupted then i wouldn't work here"
bad,"as stated, great temporary job. However the management is wanting and there are no real benefits packages or promotion oppertunities. If you enjoy customer service I would rate the job fairly well for short term employment."
bad,"If you work at any site, you'll experience a high level of expectations without a high level of training to match. They don't care about their employees they just expect a lot for little pay."
bad,My store manager was good but upper management didn't follow through with complaints and didn't fix things in the store that needed it they were always changing things and not informing employees
bad,"Trained to do the job of assistant manager, without the benefit of compensation for it.  "
bad,"This was the most political place I have ever worked with constant intrigues and favoritism. Long-term, established employees were thrown overboard in periodic layoffs while new hires -- usually some friend's son/daughter -- flew up the ladder."
bad,Not much to do at all. Very strict on things you can do to keep busy in little fishbowl building. Make you clean the same things repeatedly to pass time
bad,lange uren slecht betaald slecht behandeld en niet waard om er te werken
bad,"What can I tell you? It was a gas station. Not an ideal job but it payed some of the bills. Management was incompetent, coworkers apathetic, customers impatient."
bad,"Company overworks there employees and there grossly underpaid. High volume customer interaction, cleaning, and fuel clean up. You will be expected to complete many tasks while helping customers with the understanding you will never meet upper managements goals."
bad,"Management and Union always fighting, neither one cares about the other.would not recommend anyone to go there. Very stressful place not knowing from day to day what is going on."

good,"my day at work is great when busy. I've learned to deal with all kinds of people. my co-workers always have a since of humor."
good,"keeps busy"
good,"This location is small part of over all portfolio of company, needs more attention. Would suggest that local company be more involved in local community."
good,Little regard and freedom is given to experienced professional. The decisions are made at the top and they you do as they say.If you're a new college grad looking to cut your teeth this is a good start but not someplace to stay for the long term.
good,"Typical day was getting off from my other job and then going to the gas station and working the night shift. I learned what it took to run a gas station. My manager was my friend and she was a fun lady to work with. My coworkers were fun to work with, Hardest part was working after already doing a full day of work , most enjoyable part was getting another paycheck to help me support my son."
good,"Its not awful but with all the changes in company left the position very unstable. Decent pay, but no growing room. District manager was always on vacation but when the store struggled or did bad he left all the heat on us"
good,"I loved the people that I worked with except the manager. Gave people day off that didn't request it but a few days before when others requested months in advance, I quit because the manager."
good,"I worked for Tesoro for 10.5 years, and had many accomplishments while I was there. I loved working with the people that I worked with, and I will miss the atmosphere there."
good,"Or if you need semi-steady work. Can be very fast-paced and customers can be extra-grumpy, but the regulars are always good for a little chat. Cleaning duties can sometimes be unpleasant. Good managers who look out for you, but depends on who the supervisor is on shift that day. You can sometimes listen to your choice of appropriate music if the manager okays it."
good,"Work loads vary daily."
good,"Lots of cleaning, really busy days. Pricing and stocking."
good,"Taxes you on company paid housing ,30,000.00 annually ."
good,"Tesoro has been a good place to work, its has many good benefits and good individuals to job with. The problem I have found is the lack of communication between departments. I has made my job hard to complete many projects."
good,Had to come in as a relief operator. Didn't know your schedule and some good supervisors but overall treatment wasn't good
good,"Being the brand and advertising manager for the ARCO fuels brand at Tesoro is not only a challenge, but it is also fun.  With limited personnel resources we develop 360 advertising campaigns, manage our third party vendors, and then do the research to see the impact of our efforts."
good,"Friendly staff and customers, they always try to accommodate your work schedule and any family issues that you have. They are always there to help and offer advice when you need it."
good,The management was not as good as it could have been there was no advancement opportunity it was also a lot of in your feet with no break there were no st break times
good,"There were no typical days as the store manager. Every day presented its own set of challenges. I learned to gather the information needed for reports due daily, weekly and monthly. I learned that some investigative time was required to prevent fuel theft overnight. The hardest part of the position was finding the willing to work employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different challenges each day presented."
good,"8-5pm"
good,"Being in the customer service/retail business, the was an opportunity to meet and greet various customers. There were regular customers, that encouraged stability, while majority of the time was dealing with new customers. Peer support was good, while management lacked true support."
good,"There is no typical day at work, almost every day is different considering the type of business that it is. "
good,"- Wonderful Benefits"
good,The set up for the center ws a nightmare the rool out did not go smooth and I was not able to hire my intial staff my self witch resulted in conflicts.
good,"There is a very high sense of independence. You are working alone majority of the time, which takes away any breaks you may be entitled to. This is good for those that dont mind woking individually."
good,The hardest part of the job was the lack of work/life balance. My days would start out very early and it was expected that I stay late or work more often to get the job done. Some members of upper management were stressful to work for. I got along with most of my co-workers and associates and have maintained friendships with them after leaving the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to travel and work with different people.
good,"A growing company with many opportunities.  I enjoy working with my co-workers on projects that facilitate standardization and successful, repeatable and sustainable processes.  The systems that are being developed represent a much smaller company that was in place just a few years ago."
good,Don't expect any advancement in career if you are an admin assistant
good,Be ready to do multiple jobs at once that will keep you busy pretty much all day Time goes by quick due to multiple projects that you will be working on daily.
good,"Worked there for over 6 years.  Plenty of opportunities intially, but changes in upper management saw these out-sourced and mismanagement  led to extreme wasted funds."
good,fast pace environment would recommend if still around worked graveyard hardest task was the cooler worst part was taking out the trash management always worked with you
good,"High amount of growth and total lack of focus on the state of the companies culture makes this place a gradual slide toward misery. Its not the worst place to be and with the right manager is not a bad place at all really. Sadly though, the company very much enables poor management and continuously advancing stress. Lastly, the corporate bonus has lowered by about 2 to 3% every year for the past 4 to 5 years."
good,"A typical day of work is, for the night crew, nothing but cleaning first, stocking second. Hardest part of the job is getting everything done. Most enjoyable part is the peace and quiet I get since few customers come there at that time of the day."
good,They don't give you raised and they still want you to come work even if your not feeling good or just discharge from the hospital..They still called you in to come cover the shift so manager can go home early or go driving around wasting time
good,"Before Tesoro's retail was purchased By Anabi Oils from California Tesoro was a great place to work with chance for career advancement. Now unless you desperately need a job I would high recommend not working for the current Tesoro locations in Alaska. New management, New owners and no more benefits. I Learned a lot about customer service though along with freight check in. Coworkers for the most part where awesome."
good,"A lot of hard work and not a lot of appreciation, a lot of expectation to put on some people but not others. great customers, fun times allowed. got to dress up for halloween."
good,"Like most other energy companies in California, Tesoro is transfering most of their employees to their HQ in San Antonio, TX."
good,Tesoro is a highly stressful company that leaves very little room for positive work morale.
good,accounts payable. office work. I want to work somewhere where I move around and am not sitting around all day. Thanks
good,The people I worked with were great. The company was good and they had a great safety culture.
good,"Great place to work if in management if you are a yes person and do not have an opinion.  Working as a cashier, you will probably not get a full workweek because overtime is strictly forbidden, so hours are cut to avoid any time over your 8 hours."
good,I loved working at Gulf Coast Ignitions and Controls.  I was laid off.
good,The co-workers were pleasant to work with and very easy to get along with. The GM was very helpful in my training and so was the Lease manager at teaching me about the Real Estate aspect of the industry.
good,This was my part-time job it was a job also you needed to catch on fast .I enjoyed helping my customers and how time went by you learn their names as well as they call you eaither by your name or aunty .Working with my co-workers was good we all got along and made our shift happy and fun.
good,I have been away for too long to comment. The company has changed since I left and its not fair for me to comment about an organization that I never worked in so I have to refrain.
good,12 hour shifts with no rush on performing tasks and maintenance. 4 on 4 off schedule averaging 42 hours per week. Fairly technical skilled labor job. Management always gives as much support as possible to get the job done.
good,"It's very diverse and the pay is competitive.  The company's main focus isn't employee related, but company driven"
good,"Great place to work, becoming more diverse. Depending on what dept. you are in the management styles will change."
good,Job provides great job security. I would recommend this company to most people. The gas smells can be strong at times. The compensation is pretty good. No college degrees required for some positions.
good,I opened the store and I operated the cash register. the work place was a good environment I loved my co workers. management need some help with managing. the best part of my day at work seeing different customers from different places.
good,"You have flexible hours, great pay, and great benefits. I started a summer internship this May and from the beginning have enjoyed working with the team, the HR staff, and have learned much from upper management. They care much about their culture, values, and even promote their core values and guiding principles very strongly. Their training, buddy/mentor, and new-comer programs are very well coordinated. Along with their new rotation program, internship program, and others. They even have goal setting exercises, assessments, reviews, and meetings to improve rapport. It may be hard work and a lot of work, but someone willing to work for the company would be a great fit. One hard worker who would be willing to spend their day with other great employees would enjoy even a single day there. They're always ready to help you grow as an individual as well as a part of the team and Tesoro Corporation as a whole. This is a great place to work, to grow, and to learn from great leadership."
good,i enjoyed much doing this job it is a good job . i learned so much from this experience . i like this job. i learned dealing with people.
good,"Good place to work if needing a temporary jobs, Pay is decent, but hardly any benefits. Great for summer time, but short hours in the fall and winter. Management is alright with some stores but is very lacking with others."
good,"My experience has a lot to do with my immediate supervisor and that has been strained.  I have a heart condition and auto-immune disorder and haven't been able to have a real break in the routine as we work in the office five days a week and on-call 24-7.   Unable to work from home accept the weekends.  Required flying to visit pipelines and customers doesn't work with a chronic illness."
good,I enjoyed working at Tesoro. It was a fun and great place to work. Management listened to employees opinion and concerns.
good,"Good place to work, full time hours every week, get to be outside working too. See all kinds of people, some friendly, some terrible. Always entertaining."
good,"The issue is with some management staff. Some hiring processes need to be revisited and get away from ""its not what you know but who you know"" such as hiring a director who doesn't have a degree."
good,"Worked as a contractor on a specific project.  Liked the culture and people I worked with.  This was during the recession, so there wasn't any jobs open at the time"
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"Tesoro was a decent place to work, but I am a single mother of two and managing it was difficult at times. The management was pretty fair. The pay was decent."
good,The customers are fun to serve and the management makes you feel important. The company hires some low-class people that cause drama and bring a gross feeling to the work environment.
good,Great place to work. Upper management was understanding always available. They since sold a lot of their retail sites and it all went down hill. New company wanted all experienced managers to take a huge pay cut and cut benefits. They lost a lot of great managers
good,"Tesoro has great career resources for your growth, a lot of classes and training offered and paid for by the company.  I enjoyed collaborating with other teams and working on projects."
good,"This job was a decent job if you want to drive and haul crude oil.  You will be out on remote sites most of the time, and will want to follow all safety protocol to insure you don't have a uncontrolled release of fluid."
good,"Very long day's but goes by very fast."
good,"Fun fast paced work place with supportive management."
good,"Assist in assigning helpdesk tickets to proper queue. Work on helpdesk tickets that are assigned to me. For any software renewal that is coming due, get the sites confirmation, follow through from getting a quote from the vendor to doing goods receipt in SAP. Let the management know of any deviation in cost vs. budget/forecast. Assist in monthly forecast. "
good,"I learned how to do and complete inventory including tobacco products, a typical day at work was mostly predictable, my co-workers including management were always careful and understanding, we all were very close to each other, the hardest part of the job was to tolerate homeless and/or drunk customers and have patience with them, the most enjoyable part of the job was running into regular customers on a daily basis"
good,I worked for this company for almost 5 years. I had to manage the store on my own with no help at times. I worked long hours and with no breaks at time. I had colleagues that were just amazing to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working here as cashier meeting new people every day. Some of the duties included book keeping, bank deposits, ordering and stocking supplies. I maintained healthy working relationships with my supervisor, co-workers, and customers. The hardest part of the job at the time was changing shifts from day to midnight shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people in all walks of life. "
good,I have worked for Tesoro/ Maristar for 5 yrs and enjoyed working for the company. I met a lot of people over the 5 yrs I was with the company.
good,"Tesoro has been taken over by Marathon, so not sure how applicable this will be in future.  A lot of management changes meant that not a lot of long-term planning, however plenty to do and good pay."
good,Helped build an internal project team. I would continuing working with Tesoro if the opportunity is available. Even though I am a contractor the work environment has felt inclusive.
good,The hardest part of the job was learning on the fly to get your job done. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the talented people that are willing to help you anytime.
good,"Overall an excellent place to work, pay was good for the type of work. Enjoyed my coworkers, we became family. Only complaint to be made was the manager. She was unfair and favored a few employees, making it difficult to work shift with those people. They would get constant breaks to smoke while those who didn't smoke wouldn't get one or any breaks throughout their whole shift. The manager was a poor worker, which made the assistant manager and certain employees on later shifts have to work harder, for less pay. The manager in general is pretty lazy and isn't efficient in the least."
good,"In operations a basic day includes the maintenance and operation of equipment pertaining to the process of converting crude oil into usable products such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene. This process involves a delicate balance of chemistry and equipment stability, and it is a process unit operators job to keep that balance intact at all times. While it presents daily challenge to the worker to always keep things 'fresh,' it really demands every ounce of your personal and work lives, leaving very little time and/or energy for much else."
good,Good experience working the public and lending  a helping hand out to the needy.
good,Travel to oil and gas locations also to company offices to provide oil field rental tool. I learned about the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. Enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers I developed relationships with over the years.
good,"Translate business requirements into system definitions and solutions. Defined user requirements and performing user acceptance testing. Analyzing business processes to identify problems and implementing solutions that improve the business process in line with Human Resources needs through the use of Oracle SQL, SAP 7.1 , Oracle APEX (Application Express), or MS Access 2007, and SSRS."
good,"it is a comfortable environment, I have learned much about automotive mechanics and in dealing with customers, The management is excellent and very understanding, the culture bis that of an automotive shop, hardest part of job is tire season which lasts approximately 3 weeks and are expected to work up to 16 hrs a day 7 days a week, the most enjoyable part is working with a crew that is positive, optimistic, and sense of humor."
good,Loved working for them as a temp job. Management was great. Really work with employees to make sure our schedules were suited to us. It was a good place to work.
good,I enjoyed working here.  It was one of the few places I've worked where I wouldn't have to look for a reason to call in sick because I didn't want to go to work.
good,Responsible for control room or various other sections of field operations. Monitor and control plant efficiency.Turn valves and make adjustments to plant equipment. Issue work permits and monitor progress of maintenance and contractor personnel. Learned new plant and operating practices not have previously encountered. Management at this location was not directly involved with operations. The culture at the company was to produce as much as possible at least cost. Hardest part of the job was working long hours with limited days off. Working with my fellow employees and getting to know all their unique personalities.
good,This company is very generous with the balance between work and home life.  Typical day is busy and there is a lot to learn about the industry so it is what you make it.
good,"I had a blast working there, of course I had the typical stress related to working at a conscience store but the staff is great and the customers are easy going to the most part. Never a dull moment!"
good,"Learned how to balance high volume of work with less stress."
good,"worked on operations and Emergency response for the refinery."
good,I really enjoyed working here until it got cold and some of the people that would come there were very rude and racist. Management was great and so were my co-workers.
good,"This company was a great training ground for me to learn SAP.  They use a lot of SAP modules and their technology for the most part was very up to date.  The SAP IT team was very strong.  We did several enhancements when I was there.  We purchased the Shell Refinery in Long Beach when I was there.  It was a lot of work, but I learned a ton about acquiring new business units."
good,"The job was a decent starter for me, and had great starting income. I learned how to stay productive throughout the day, and how to work with other employees. Yet there was plenty of hypocrisy in the job, and problems will arise that will affect you even if they shouldn't."
good,"i think that with work that would involve finances, tesoro gas station could be a great quality place to work at."
good,"Working at Tesoro has been a satisfying experience with opportunities for growth, encouragement of educational aspirations, and the opportunity to be ""close to the action"" of a major petrochemical refinery operation. Working at the FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) Unit is challenging as the nature of the operation is delicate and sensitive to changes in production variables. The operational team is top notch, with hefty amounts of experience in both the labor and management groups, and the training and mentorship for new operators is excellent."
good,"Challenging, fast pased, learn refining business as a whole and its drivers for optimization and safety."
good,"Employees act individually and collectively with the highest level of integrity and committed to safety, health and environment."
good,Opened store and worked until afternoon. Learned detailed information about customers needs and found their insight to be helpful and enlightening. Management offered a variety of learning tools and lessons that are still helpful in all aspects of future employment. I got to meet new and interesting people among the customers and co-workers and some are still my friends today. I found the hardest part of the job to be the end of the shift as there was still things I wanted to get done and have to wait until my next work day to do them. My most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the new people and knowing I had the knowledge and skills to assist them during their shopping experience.
good,"Great company to work for except, they do drive results and so the work to life balance is a little off, but they did treat their employees great. Now Tesoro has been bought by MPC (Marathon Petroleum Corporation); only time will tell how the new MPC culture will  be."
good,"My work at Tesoro was always challenging and I was able to move around into different jobs, so there was always something new and interesting to learn about, whether it be a new computer system, new program or completely new job task."
good,"Although, construction workers are paid well and very much appreciated, being in the heat for 12 hours a day, risking my overall health on a daily basis is a life-style that isn't designed for everyone.    I had an opportunity to work at the refinery for a summer job, but I was more-so interested on becoming a more rounded person in the regards to work experience.  I wanted to understand how tools work, and how been keen on the detail of instruction given by my managers."
good,Can get stressful at times. Customer service skills and attention to detail is a must. Room for advancement and no room for error. Have to be patient when it comes to advancement.
good,"Working here for 2 1/2 years i had a award for exellent customer service. I knew my manager from friends and family, and she saw i had excellent work ethics."
good,Challenging which paves way to making immense contribution to the team. Lots of opportunity for growth and a team oriented environment.
good,"Pros"
good,My manager was very knowledgable and proffesional. My job was extremely difficult sometimes because there were times when the store was so busy that one cashier was not sufficient. Often my manager would take over the second register in order to elleviate some of the long wait times for customers. I know from experience that this is not common practice and therefore I appreciated his help very much because it took a lot of pressure off of me.
good,"I would clean the kennels in the morning to get them ready for the day then I would have to find out what animals had to be euthanize for the day, I learned how to give injections to animals and learned many different office duties. My co-workers and I worked great together. Management was fair and worked as hard as we all did, the hardest part of my job was having to euthanize  the animals the most enjoyable part of my job was watching a animal get rescued and go to a good home"
good,"Administrative Asst for the Credit Department"
good,"A job is what you make it....that said, it really depends where you work at this company that will govern your experience. Some places are fantastic, some, not so great. Some of the units have people with  can do attitudes and a willingness to work and other units are not pleasant to walk in to. Some departments are cheerful, and others are plain morbid. The biggest issue, in my opinion, is that not all departments are expected to perform/act in the same manner. Its like 27 small companies inside one large one. All with different sets of regulations and rules of their own. Other than that, I believe the company does care about safety and the well being of their employees, they just don't know what is really going on out on the floor and middle management isn't telling them the truth. It has been slowly changing for the better over the years, so there is hope! They certainly pay very very well!"
good,"Managed both strategic and tactical service and material procurement activities including vendor sourcing, contract management and negotiations in order to yield the best customer solution with highest possible cost savings.  Optimized internal customer relationships by providing superior service and managed strategic sourcing supplier relationships."
good,"When I worked at tesoro I had a good experience. I got paid a decent wage, and I even got benifits. The management was very professional. The only negative part of my job was dealing with difficult customers."
good,One of the best places in San Antonio to work.  Good management and good pay.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for work in the San Antonio area.
good,"Tesoro is a great company to work for if you are looking for work/life balance. Incredible benefits, gym, cafeteria and a great CEO who cares about the employees. The Tesoro campus is beautiful that includes a park for anyone looking for exercise etc."
good,"I learned the benefits of being organized, I worked under a lot of pressure due to periodic inspections and visits from upper level management but it was rewarding to get good scores and encouraging feed backs from my boss, in general I enjoyed working for this company because I became a more knowledgeable manager."
good,"Travel to multiple job sites everyday to have projects done on time, within budget, safely, and according to blue prints, electrical schematics, DOT, NEC and all regulatory agencies"
good,"Stocked, customer complaints, paperwork, inventory. Work hard and not get rewarded. My manager was not the best influence on me, I was her assistant, did most of her job and mine, when I could get to mine.  Wasn't the best manager to learn from. Great employees, worked hard and listened to what you had to say and did what they were asked. Hardest part was working with a manager that had know drive.  Most enjoyable was the customers and employees."
good,I've been with Tesoro for over 5 years and I am very happy with my decision to hire on with them.  I have been treated very well and compensated fairly.  The atmosphere here is family.  We are all family and work together to achieve our goals!
good,I learned a lot about people in general and a lot about myself. I was able to maintain family life and enjoy time off when needed. Management was very involved from top to bottom of the chain and knew me by my first name. They had great training programs.
good,I love my job & working with the public on a daily basis.
good,"Service is speedy, friendly, and always with a smile, courteous and helpful people, knowledgeable about all things mechanical, electrical, and involving tires"
good,"Great place to work.  went through two relocations while there and the transitions were smooth.  Good management.  Unfortunately CEO retired and new CEO cut a lot of departments including mine.  I had fully intended to work out the remainder of my career there.  Can't speak for the company since 2010, but my understanding is there's been a couple of mergers."
good,Loved working at Tesoro with challenges to push my limits higher. Flexible work environment. Loved the friendly and helpful team. Help desk would jump to action and resolve issues instantly
good,I like working for Tesoro corporation and they were helpful when u needed answer to a question. I like working with the people at there. to bad I could only work part time there.. I would have stayed
good,"you have to get at least 3 loads even there are days stuff happens as a truck driver you have to take more safety precautions, like chaining up and if you dont get your loads you performance goes down, and they start disciplining you until you are eventually out the door, it is a big company and its only getting bigger"
good,"Overall good place to work, although some can get stagnant in their job. A lot of separation between departments and even within departments. A lot depends on your group."

My co workers worked well as a team, especially when it came for me to make up the schedule.

I still talk to all of the people who helped me there."
good,"For the first years at Tesoro before they sold company to ARS. I loved working there. It was a family orientated company with great benefits for all employees not just management, and raises depending on evaluation. Then Tesoro sold all stores to ARS Fresno LLC. Not a very good company to work for."
good,"Besides the store being small, fuel and sale volumes are low, there was a lot of maintenance work to be done and the storeâ€™s image had to be brought up to an acceptable standard. In order to maintain a clean and uncluttered working environment, the first three months were hectic - the garage was repainted to make it more presentable, outside curbs and cement outside of the store were also painted, and organizing stacks of paper work in the office. Now that I have been established at my store for nine months and the store image has had a 360 degree turnaround, I have been able to run the store by myself without an Assistant for the past 7 months, with the help of my employees. I have trained new employees, hired by myself in panel interviews, and have trained one of my top CSAâ€™s on paperwork and other duties of an ASM."
