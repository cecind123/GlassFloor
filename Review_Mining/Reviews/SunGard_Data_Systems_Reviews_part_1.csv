rating,review
bad,"You do not want to work here. Trust me. I was employed this company for about six months and my time there included some of the worst work experiences of my life, including laughable Christian management. Just say no!"
bad,the hours and work were not flexible at Sungard. It was required to work the first Saturday a full 8 hours during quarter close even if your tasks were complete. Also it was required to work on January 1.
bad,"After working hard for months for a promised in writing position, management decided last minute there were no longer spots open and cut my salary in half and forced me into a position I was not trained for at all. The benefits are poor, they have a high deductible expensive health care plan, and unlimited pto just means that they never approve your time off. They constantly threaten to fire you, walk people out with no explanation, and are very condescending. Everyone is afraid of being fired. I was never late and came each day but was demoted in favor of someone who no called no showed multiple times. I was told the demotion was because of my hard work and good qualities, which was insulting."
bad,"Continuous Urgent Deadlines, the position lacks training but come with harsh penalty if and issue arises the management never gets the blame. It is a great Job if you need a job. "
bad,"I was hired under the premise that I would be a Business Consultant. I was to evaluate how clients used the [Employer] product and then help the client and [Employer] work together to mutually improve efficient use and development of the software.  "
bad,"They pack their workers into a call-center like environment, harass you when you are late due to horrible traffic getting there, and my manager (offshore) was a heartless guttersnipe."
bad,"Unless you are kissing up to managements you can't do anything within the company. Not to mention the team leads they have over you can't even do their own jobs. They don't even know procedures and they expect you to learn forms they don't even know. Management is never around when you need them. Co-workers are always up walking around being loud. The team leads show favorites. If they like you, they let you get away with not doing work. Team leads will have you do their work training others. There is more drama compared to high school. HR does not care about any complaints. You can not move up within this company. You do not get raises. The procedures they expect you to follow by don't even make sense.You are made to fail and get errors. When you start within the company you have to sit for 6 months not doing anything. People fall asleep everyday. The job is very boring and you rarely learn new things. The company does nothing for you. They use to help with lunches or had more exciting things to do...nothing now!"
bad,it was a kpo so the culture was different with that of indian company the company is good and the atmosphere is also fine which is more related to the job we do
bad,My only advice to anyone applying for jobs at the Philadelphia Shared Service Center is this- SunGard is so scared of the truth that they removed ratings from their job searches here. I am not kidding when I say that more than 15 people have left this office over the last 6 months. The management in the SSC is terrible!!! Employees are considered nothing more than pieces of junk...if you value any kind of work life balance...Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!!
bad,"I am happy current and former employees are coming here to warn potential candidates about the failures of the finance team in Philadelphia. I wouldn't recommend jobs in this office to my worst enemy. There is no work/life balance. Senior management says ""lean is here to stay""..in other words ""we don't care how many hours you have to work, we wont hire – more... the right amount of people to do the job"". There are NO advancement opportunities."
bad,The CEO cares nothing about the employees or who made the company successful in the past.  All he cares about is the bottom line.  He has no concept about software companies or how to keep the current clients and has to replace most if not all of the helpdesk and developers because he attempted to have everyone relocate.
bad,Sungard Data Systems was  a great working environment. The technical  experience that I have obtain for my history came from Sungard. I rate this company at a high right 100%
bad,"1. Management guards the microwave in the morning. They treat their employees like they are children. They do not give raises instead they give us food or a treat like we are dogs.or better yet, we have to bring our own food or pay for our own or treat we are being rewarded for."
bad,"No proper planning, Chaotic environment, Office politics to the highest level I have ever seen. Does not promote learning and development. Managers are insecure of subordinates qualifications. Do NOT join this organization if you want a happy career."
bad,I would not reccomend this job for anyone whose looking for advancement. Very disorganized.
bad,"Unfortunately SG has the mentality that they can treat their staff poorly as they have nowhere else to go as we are in a recession, very short sighted as everyone will leave when the economy starts picking up. They'll then just be left with poor performers that can't actually get another job, this then creates stress on what good staff are left as they need to pick up the slack - and the cycle continues."
bad,"Sungard is the worst company I have ever work for. The whole company stinks. Management has their picks and chooses.  No advancement,  no consistency,  and no increase in pay."
bad,On a typical day at work I mostly handled all of the clerical duties and was a Data Entry Specialist. I loved the position I worked I just struggled with the manager I had because she was unprofessional and done anything that she could to make work life hard on me. It made it where I dreaded going to work everyday. I had a hard time with my coworkers because they would join in with her on picking on me to fit in with her. When I was not being tormented I was able to get tons of work done and loved what I done. I really kept hoping that another manager would come in but I was unable to hold out that long.
bad,"Poor management, no direction, false sense of security and no raises in 3 years. no room for advancement. looks to be re sold again in 2 years or less"
bad,"leadership is horrific, lacking in vision, mission and direction. lots of talk, no action. make ignorant uneducated decisions, only for momentary situations, never long term commitment. work/life balance is a joke, they run on a thin thread and band aid. consistent severity 1 situations, staff & companies up all night and day, rest is non existent, no desire to stabilize environment, non billible to customer, forget about it, run by seat of pants. unhappy customers, GRADE SCHOOL OFFICE POLITICS. Best advice, stay away. rough place to visit, keep driving, no advancement, no culture, much prejudice based on personal opinions not facts or truth. Wonder how they stay in business or why customers stay with them. Except it is very difficult to remove the financial dependency built over years. Company and its leadership continue to get worse. It doesn't matter new / old, all the same. most co workers are nice, others you have to watch your back, especially management, watch out."
bad,"Working Here started off good. But then came lies from management about promotion. the people they put in charge don't do anything all day but play on there cell phone,eat all day an complain about stupid stuff such as staplers in work, Sorry team leads they want the other workers to do there work. Pay suck!!!! keep up mess!! so call friends talk about each other behind there back. Management have there picks and chooses. bring in people off the street rather then hire in house they hire friends of friends sad how management work I would not even call that management because it's unfair and they don't care about the people that work there butt off. Fire people cause one of the managers/leads don't like them. not all departments some departments are awful."
bad,This was a good place to work when the original owners were in place.  It has been going steadily downhill since.  All they care about now is the money.
bad,I miss my manager. His name is GUY. Very nice personality. We had a opportunity to celebrate his birthday with a very exensibe cake
bad,The manager is not very supportive nor responsible but the job is fine. The pay is not good but its better than being unemployed
bad,Support of Investran Implementations. Heavy technology focus with a  lot of travel. I learned the solutions and product offerings.
bad,Superion bought out company I was working for. Ppl quit and they never hired to replace. They were planning to close buss. but didnt inform employees.
bad,"Since FIS acquired SunGard they are laying off many people over 50 and calling it a work force reduction, but then you see the same if not similar job posted on their company website."
bad,Morale is very low. Management doesn't care or listen to any work issues. No set work instructions. You're always trying to hit a moving target. Management is horrible and actually rude to employees. I actually was witness to a screaming match between 2 managers that was heard all the way from the conference room to the staff floor. HR is useless if you have an issue. Backs management and does nothing to help. No chance for advancement. Most of the office personnel is from India.It's just a miserable place to work. Company reputation is so bad they've changed the name to FIS. Layoffs are almost quarterly.
bad,This company is poorly managed and the work/life balance is non-existed. The communication between divisions is horrible and the turnover is extremely high.
bad,Company is growing in good ways but is a bad place for personal development.  Performance reviews are supposed to occur annually but they have not been given in many years.  
bad,"Superion, now CentralSquare Technologies is a great place to start and advance your career but should not be a long term workplace. They prefer to promote internally, but their expectations for work life balance the second you become salary is that you will always sacrifice the life part of the equations. Especially when they set unrealistic goals that are well above what previous trends show in productivity. All in all if you are a college grad I would recommend this workplace, but anyone with experience should beware and move on."
bad,"Recently bought out by Vista Equity Partners and renamed Superion, this group only wants the lowest paid employees. All staff must work in an office (no remote) and therefore anyone who knew anything about their software is now gone."
bad,"Poor work/life balance, expected to work long hours with little recognition."
bad,"Difficult environment to work in.  Management does not consider efforts of employees, hostile working environment and constant harassment from managers. Constant intermittent layoffs. Extremely political. Little to no advancement opportunities."
bad,"The organization has really organized its goals and operations."
bad,"employee facilities are good, management shows partiality to local people, others its tough to see the growth, flexible timings, no dress code, no onshore"
bad,"Rigid Environment, Work culture is good but can go ahead to look something Fast Forward. opportunities are based on luck. ;-( "
bad,"you can enjoy the life if you get good project and management."
bad,"I've worked for Sungard for over 14 years, primarily as a contract designer/programmer who was asked back to the company 5 times since 1991. I finally decided to go full time in a different department, and after several years, decided I had enough of the excessive work hours, poor work/life balance and out of touch management. I used to love working at SunGard, but the culture has changed with a revolving door of upper management and inconsistency in management styles, and with a lack of knowledge (and lack of desire to know) about the skillets and experience of staff members."
bad,"Level of detail required for deliverables and reporting has grown to an almost impossible level over the years. Inordinate amount of manual systems for a software company. Few formal training opportunities, learning mostly occurs by finding solutions online or asking co-workers. Senior management at local level is chronically overworked and has no power to make major decisions - those are made at the corporate level, and are solely focused on cutting costs with little or no concern for employees' concerns. A lot of overtime is expected, especially during month ends even more on quarter ends. However, most employees get along with each other and are pleasant to work with, not much backstabbing or competition going on."
bad,Good amount of work to do a day. People work well together within teams but there are many communication issues between teams and management. Management didn't really pay much attention to individual employees and is quick to replace people if they feel out of place rather than take the time to help them adjust/figure out the underlying issues and make them feel comfortable. Miscommunications does result in a faulty product.
bad,Be yourself . The work is average . You need to continually brush your skill sets . Keep in touch with new technology . There are few forks worth working with .
bad,"Typical day at work was generally putting out fires on a daily basis with people that everything was an emergency which is something I loved - never a dull moment."
bad,Sungard is unable to keep up with the pack due to an inability to be forward thining and proactive. Management changes quarterly and there is no clear vision for the future.
bad,"Work was good, but repetitive. Typical 'whats in the pipeline' kind of work. Nevertheless, the actual intellectual challenge wasn't really there. It was the reason why I am currently looking for something else."
bad,Company is good but lacks overall process compare to other Big Industries in the similar line of business.  My personal opinion is the Management need to focus more on career development and provide more internal opportunities for the employees.
bad,Superion is a forward thinking company dedicated to its resources and clients.  Currently we are striving to satisfy client expectations while mitigating internal risk associated with change
bad,"This is not a job for students. I started working here because it paid well, but the hours were only full-time, and the level of security didn't allow me much study time. Management was not that great, either."
bad,"poor management, severe lack of communications structure, poor service management records.  On top of a terrible place to commute to this place is not worth your time."
bad,Experience working at SunGard is good for furture job search.
bad,"Direct management and coworkers are the best you will ever find. We work together smoothly as a team and there is a desire to share knowledge and lessons learned. Sadly we are all puppets to the greedy, no good, thieves that now own us. For senior leadership the word Customers has become a dirty ""C"" word, never to be mentioned or considered. At times I think our leaders are secretly working for our competitor."
bad,"Company is very good for freshers , They hired me for Service management but ended up working as MIS executive . Biased management"
bad,"Not great salary "
good,"When I relocated for this position to Texas I never thought my career with SunGard would be ending after only two short years yet as the well has gone dry, I now need to look outside of this company for my next opportunity."
good,The residents are the sweetest and kindest. Coworkers are hard working honest individuals
good,Upper management only cares about profit. Will slash and burn veteran programmers to hire recent college grads for a pittance. Remaining developers spent too much time teaching to recent hires but are still expected to get an increasing workload completed on time.
good,Company culture is based purely upon sales volume. One is required to follow pre-arranged (selling) guidelines and is not encouraged to think outside the box.
good,A good Company to start with. Good facilities with excellent work infrastructure. Mostly average work culture. Learned a lot new technologies and software development processes.
good,"I gained a lot of job experience as a BA but my manager constantly changed. The policies, environment and sectors changed yearly. Hopefully, in the near future they will become more global and diverse."
good,All they care about is meeting their numbers since Black Stone took over. Send it to India is their development theme now. More managers than doers in the US now.
good,"Overall, the company is a good place to work.  Individual managers might affect day-to-day morale, but remote work is allowed/encouraged, so definitely a plus there."
good,"Environnement animé et motivant."
good,"Good people, constantly changing to better meet customer demands. Direction changes weekly, and reorganizations happen every 6 months."
good,My typical work day was good. I was always busy. But not much for training it's employees or advancement.
good,Great People. You get exposure to a lot of different clients and organizations. You can see alot when you travel.
good,Bar was set low and people were angry with their lives.  Most management and leadership had worked at the organization since college and were unprepared to succeed in today's environment.
good,"SunGard offered me a chance to learn multiple jobs and meet many great professional colleagues. However, it lacks any type of work life balance."
good,Job training poor.  Advancement opportunities limited and not made public.
good,"•	Expanded Product into new emerging growth markets and client bases such as governmental agencies in Africa and clients in Asia and Europe"
good,"This company has good benefits and is growing, however, there is too much micromanagement.  In my business unit, there have been a serious of bad decisions that have led to a number of lay-off's over the past few years."
good,Company is going through period of cutting costs in preparation for a possible sell  off.  
good,"I loved the environment atmosphere Sungard provided for their employees. My main concern was the pay. I was one of the ones from the 2nd group to come in to enrollments and we were paid the lowest, and no one cared to correct it. We were all doing the same work. I could understand if education was involved but for some that were paid higher, they either had the same education as I did or less."
good,worked in a small office in aurora. the place was run like a prison. the manager for my team was an ex marine - so she had no idea how to work with regular people unless they liked being micro managed. took us out to lunch at least once a week.
good,"The company has been sold several times over the past 4 years and with each time, there have been many changes to management, benefits, policies, etc."
good,Tenure and career path was rewarding. Hardest part of job was constant change in job description. Corporate Culture is Under New Management; top heavy. Shifting away from customer focus.
good,"Good company for freshers or junior people who like to start career in financial domain. Not good for experienced technologist as it's mostly domain and proprietary knowledge driven company. Most of the people working here for 10+ years and they don't let new comers flourish , specially if you are  non-Marathi . Work life balance depends on projects. Promotion policy is heavily biased and favouritism rules the roost , starting from senior vice president level down to SSE level. Be prepared to work under second grade managers with little technical knowledge ."
good,"It is a good place to work and in many ways, I wish I had stayed with the University.  However, I was looking to expand my knowledge and thought that a consulting job would be interesting.  Unfortunately, the travel which was reported as 25% turned out to be 50%."
good,"SunGard was an interesting place to work that gave me many opportunities to grow and expand my talents."
good,"My typical day at work as Helios Timekeeping Administrator/Revenue Accountant is as follows:"
good,"The project revolves around standardizing the line items of Company's Financial Statements filed by them with SEC (Securities & Exchange Commission of USA).Standardization is based on the US-GAAP. Prepare, review and analyses the Quarterly and Annually Financial Reports (10-Q, 10K, 8K) filed by listed companies of USA and (20 F) Foreign Filers."
good,"The job required you to learn alot of information regarding, 401k, and retirement benefits and tons of other benfit information. We developed the software per the employer specifications. Enjoyed learning the ins & outs of the benefit information, was provided with the proper reference information and consultants on hand to be able answer any questions customers may have."
good,"Typical day at work is clock in and begin keying forms with accuracy. The job itself is very easy and self explanatory. The most enjoyable part was that my work schedule was somewhat flexible. There was no hard part in the job whatsoever, besides the constant walking of management and looking over your shoulder and lack of training by employees and management. I didn't learn much from the company besides the different type of loans that customers took out. Co-workers were just like any other co workers at  any other job, you have some good ones and you have some bad ones. Overall, SunGard is a good company to work for just do not go in looking for advancement opportunities."
good,"Training doesn't really exist and often thrown into situations with no support from management. Working 2-3 hours after shift is common. Some may enjoy it, but most will venture to clients for better pay."
good,"The IT organizations were being re-organized into a central supporting staff instead of being a part of the individual business units. Although it is an admirable attempt to reduce overall staff, not enough staff is available to cover multiple divisions doing different work on diverse platforms."
good,Was a great place to work until they were sold to private buyers. Benefits were cut. Employee staffing was also cut. Job description changed.
good,"Overall it is a good company to start your career but one should not stick around for too long period as its gets monotonous for him to do a particular task on a daily basis."
good,"I spent my days working with my clients to find the best candidates to fill openings in a timely manner. With an average of 35 to 40 open reqs I had to spend my time wisely. My objective was to proactively source for the best candidates for each role."
good,Not the best judge here. I was mainly staffed on consulting projects and cannot speak for the company as a whole
good,"At typical day for a software engineer is maintenance work on the existing codebase. In the year and a half I was there, there was almost no talk of new development in the office. Given the nature of our product, a legacy accounting system for county governments, there was not much need for development beyond the core functionality and making sure it worked."
good,"This was good company when we were acquired but in the latter years, most of the development work was outsourced to their locations in India and China."
good,Constant change to aquired companies. Friendly environment.
good,Credit control
good,"Great co-workers and general environment, but the workload seemed too heavy for existing personnel combined with limited clarity on long-term goals from management"
good,"Joined as Fresher in Sungard."
good,Alli know aboutfinancial appliction software I learned from this job. I had the opportunity to work in many digpfferent roles in which I learned much but it was very stressful.
good,Good technical advancement opportunities and employee friendly policies. Not too many advancement in career and it can be stalled after certain time in company.
good,My remote position was required to move to Florida but I did like my job duties. We had a good team and worked in a scrum setting and had loyal clients
good,Enjoyed the closeness with the co-workers. The working environment was awesome. The flexibility was great. Managers were willing to work with youo in every way involving your personal life.
good,"Work with clients to resolve their issues.  Some are software related, but most are user related.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have good coworkers and there is a relaxed environment.  The most difficult part of the job is that there is a lack of training and there have been layoffs leaving our area extremely understaffed.  I've learned a lot of command line commands for AS400 for queries and data correcting."
good,"Overall good experience.Good Work life balance.Not for professional growth.Managers not so good.No adoption of new technologies."
good,Good place to work for experienced professionals. Also need to give promotion to right individuals irrespective of tenure based promotion. Please give promotion to inside employee
good,"I spent 5 very productive and enjoyable years, until our company has been bought it. Then the last two years were the twilight of what has been brilliant before. The new owners made miserable the life the old clients in order to kick them out and be able to close the shack with no remorse."
good,It is an okay company not that too bad also. You have to keep pressurising the manager in order to get a Promotion. Good Work life Balance compared to other Companies.
good,"Good people to work with"
good,"As a Data Entry Assoc. my job was to key financial forms, which was steady but very boring. I liked the job until I found it more difficult than anticipated to move up the ladder."
good,"Positive:  Learn a lot, working environment is good"
good,"Great work environment, good people. Worked with customers application support. Application and database support, training and maintaining the customer site."
good,A company which believes in diversity but is not very good in benefits/perks. They have hectic work culture and is not very considerate when it should be.
good,I joined Sherwood International which was bought by SunGard about a year after I joined. I spent much of my time travelling to implement the Life and Pensions Amarta software. Very enjoyable time and learnt a lot
good,"Busy always Mon-Friday.Learnt your input always weighs your output. Management easy to deal with .Friendly and co -operative co workers  . Enjoyable part always busy , hardest part none."
good,First place I worked out of college.  They give a chance to recent college graduates to gain valuable experience.  Travel and work hour demands can be strenuous at times.
good,"I worked as Software Developer using latest technologies like Core Java, J2EE, Spring, REST,  AngularJS, Swing, Hibernate, Agile. It had been a great learning experience there."
good,First real job and it was fun. They sent me around the world and gave me a lot of training on real world problems. The organization gave me the first taste of managing groups and the pitfalls that come with the responsibility.
good,"Food company for financial domain. One can become expert here but if management allows him to. "
good,I learned a lot and gain experience. It was good working here. And its taken over by FIS now. Work culture is also good. I came across few challenges in my work but working hard to achieve my goals.
good,"- Effettuare operazioni di acquisto in SAP: "
good,Sungard had a lot of opportunities and is a great place to work.  Sungard is dedicated to ensuring its customers are taken care of.
good,Always had a lot to do but always learning the latest available technology.
good,"Sungard was a great place to work. Very friendly. I had plenty of time to read the manuals, build the infrastructure and troubleshoot problems often weeks before our customers tested."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Good team and good workplace but co-ordination between US and indian company is not good.
good,"A good company to work for, seeking a position with better wages."
good,"Will remember it as a company who had given me a break"
good,"What makes Sungarden Terrace enjoyable are the good apples in the bunch. The employees who come to work too WORK.Because when people with a common goal and productive personality can work towards said goal, work becomes enjoyable."
good,Quality Work but hectic with amount of work where employee find hard to maintain work life balance
good,As a intern i got to learn a lot in the area of coding and softwares
good,Great Place to work
good,"company is good along with people, however system are slow and its a MS.dot kind of application being used, wherein there is no control on postings done in the system. Lack of control on the process,"
good,"Rien à signaler, une grande société et un acteur majeur dans l'industrie de logicielles financières"
good,"Nice , nice collegues"
good,Sporting activities are not encouraged. Limited training provided. Slow career progression. Bad atmosphere.
good,i have learned there a lot and now want to shift in my home town so going to leave this job.
good,"Good company to start with. Trending towards negativity. Worklife completely depends on the client that you're at, and they will not work with you to ensure that you get on a client that is right for you."
good,"SunGard Public Sector was acquired by a equity firm in February 17 and rebranded Superion LLC.  In late August 2017 a massive layoff of 25+ people occurred, one being me.  The people who were cut were all senior people with 10 or more years experience with the company.  It appears they got rid of most of the FoxPro people or people who were FoxPro experienced.  They then began to bring in inexperienced college grads from the local trade school and university but there is no one left to train them.  I'm told by my former colleagues the character of the company has completely collapsed and everyone is looking for the exits."
good,This is a fast paced company that provides a lot of challenging and interesting projects but has become prone to habitual layoffs in recent years and so the job security is not great.
good,"Working from home was a huge plus. My immediate supervisor was very knowledgeable and fun to work with. Management was indecisive, and more concerned with how to avoid performing a task as opposed how to perform the task to satisfy the client."
good,"Enjoyed working at SunGard.  No two days were the same and faced exciting challenges from day to day. "
good,The company offer high package with no real value attached to it.
good,Not all departments get along and caused some disunity among co-workers. 
good,"SunGard has a good work/life balance.  The work is challenging and interesting.  The benefits and compensation are ok.  My co-workers are great.  Each of us is willing to help out each other and share ideas.  I have learned a great deal about drafting contracts, especially technology agreements.  "
good,I would daily check on my clients' accounts making minor changes when needed. Some times I would call them up to validate proprietary information & then get into very interesting dialog with them. That helped pass the time.
good,I started My career with SunGard and learn a lot from it.
good,"I'm worked as a QA Tester in different companies and routine work writing Test cases and identify the bugs and to review the defects and analyze the test plans, to attend the BA team and work with the development team if any questions arise to ask for lead and the team. working Agile and Scrum."
good,Hardest part of job was everyone was overworked with little allowance of overtime and managers inability of hiring new people. 
good,"Many products have legacy technology that is difficult to migrate to current standards. Generally, product investments are driven by the customers. Eliminated their research and development group and many under performing products which left significant gaps in solutions and minimal opportunity to become the market leading software vendor."
good,If sales culture is important to you and you like the Fintech space this could be a good fit.
good,The Employees are well trained on the subject matter and can handle pressure. There is a friendly work environment and anyone in the hierarchy is easily approachable. The company maintains its standard by giving its employees the best in the market.
good,Work with my current client on all new intiatives utilizing Sungard's software.
good,"Comunicativa, punctuala, spirit intreprinzator, dorinta de a cunoaste cat mai multe, flexibila"

good,"a typical day at work : Joining Date"
good,"-Manageable work load"
good,I have great co-workers and great customers.  I am challenged on a daily basis and have had exposure to almost every part of the software business.  I have been able to travel all around the world to help people solve problems.
good,"SunGard has been acquired by FIS out of Jacksonville, Fla. Prior, it was a good company to work for. Going forward, I can only imagine that the combined company will be even stronger."
good,"SunGard is a very large company with many small divisions, arranged in a confederacy of sorts - while we're all working for the same team, occasionally we were working at cross-purposes. "
good,"SunGard provided wide scope for employees to learn new things."
good,"typical service industry management"
good,"Critical thinking skills were used on a daily basis, Co-workers were normally very helpful and it was a close knit small office environment."
good,The company is always in a restructuring mood. Lot of Management changes. Positions are cut and changed. Salary increase and bonus structure is awful .
good,"I enjoy my work.  My direct supervisor and his manager are the best.  And the people with whom I directly work are great people with high intellect and a passion for client satisfaction.  But over the years the corporation that purchased us has gutted our staffing through dozens of layoffs, stifled our creativity by spiking new innovations, and has given a sense of insecurity and disloyalty."
good,"I stayed for 16 years, that says enough. But 50 characters are required in this field."
good,"I worked remotely most of the time I was there, so I am not fully aware of the goings on at the home office. They do have a very extensive training library for employees and have learning days where all employees can take courses they are interested in."
good,"As to be expected, working for a consulting company do give you exposure to varying technologies and environment. Good organization and company. If you like travelling, this type of environment will suite you."
good,"I was charged with delivering complex technical infrastructure Implementation services; including Business Continuance/Disaster Recovery, Storage, Backup/Recovery, Archiving, and Network services."

good,"relaxed atmosphere. everyone is friendly and do their part. benefits such as medical, vision, and student reimbursement are good. there is room for growth as well."
good,"Enjoyed working with a lot of good people. The firm largely grew through acquisition, so that made establishing a consistent corporate culture a bit tricky."
good,"Daily routine verification"
good,Anyone would love to work there it's Monday through Friday and no weekends you couldn't ask for a better job are better people it might start off slow when you fist start working there but it is so worth it in the long running
good,I provided Operational Support for our customers in the Securities Finance Industry. I coordinated and set up procedures to receive and transmit files and reports for our clients using various methods of transmission and encryption. Assisted customers queries via phone and email in a timely accurate manner. Utilized schedulers to run programs at specific dates and times. Providing excellent customer service in a timely manner was always my priority. We grew from 30 clients to over 300 in the time I spent with this company.

good,"In recent years, the SunGard culture has changed, primarily because of the repetitive turnover of upper management who are out of touch with the work done by SunGard employees and the skill level/experience of individual employees. Back when I worked in the SunGard Omni Development area, all layers of the local management had been with SunGard for decades and knew and appreciated vital employees. That has drastically changed in recent years and the culture is now unstable with seasoned employees now concerned about job security."
good,"The day start with reading the emails and do some follow up calls , cold calling and planning for the week trips. We will have our sales weekly meeting with the management to summarize the deals progress and discuss any challenges where we need the senior management help. We had a team building activities once a month and one day a week we used to have breakfast together. Travelling twice a week and sometimes day trips by plane was the hardest part of the job . Closing deals and negotiating the contracts is the funniest part of the job."

good,"In questa azienda ho avuto modo di intraprendere attività diverse. Provenendo da una realtà di dimensioni ridotte, poter essere inserita in una grande azienda (gruppo Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera), mi ha dato tantissime possibilità di crescita. Far parte di questa nuova azienda, confrontandomi con tante persone con le quali ho lavorato veramente bene e dalle quali ho imparato molto, è stato stimolante e gratificante sia dal punto di vista professionale sia da quello economico.. Ho iniziato come segretaria commerciale e marketing, sono stata trasferita all'ufficio tecnico ed infine mi è stato assegnato il compito di assistere l'Amministratore Delegato."

good,"1. Career opportunities"
good,"Great place to work!"
good,"Working at SunGard Trust Systems was, without question, the best job experience I have ever had!  Everyone there was more than helpful and understood that it was better to elevate everyone else by openly sharing knowledge as opposed to what is sadly the norm in this field, that being the outdated misconception that if you keep everything you know to yourself that will somehow have “job security”, which is quickly becoming an oxymoron in today’s climate.  Had the economy not taken such a downturn several years ago, I could easily see myself continuing to work at SunGard Trust Systems until I reached retirement age.  Even though I had 8 years experience and had reached the point in my career in which I considered myself to be more of an asset than someone in need of training – that point at which employees become more valuable to the company – I still had the least amount of experience in my department.  When I was laid off, so were nearly two dozen other people in each department, some with the title of Assistant Vice President and more than 20 years with the company.  Since leaving, I have kept in touch with friends who have told me, unfortunately, that more and more former coworkers have been let go, most notably a woman with over 25 years experience.  I have no bad feelings or ill will toward SunGard or anyone there.  I am eligible for rehire and would gladly return if they requested it of me before I find another position."

good,"I worked here for 18 years as a developer and analyst.  This included support work.  I was involved supporting and developing applications for courts, probation, accounts receivable, jails, public defender, district attorney, return of service, evidence tracking, and more. This was an integrated system.  The hardest part of this job was not meeting people outside our small group.  What I enjoyed most about this job was being creative with the software I wrote."
good,"The management and staff are always friends, the service is quick and everyone enjoys their job."
good,"Wonderful position! All you had to do was simple... DO YOUR JOB! The benefits were amazing, coworkers were wonderful. Management was tough on those who did not do what they were told, but aren't they supposed to be?"
