rating,review
bad,The acquisition od JosABank literally destroyed a great company. Theu were employee and customer service focussed and now onpy care about their bottom line. Work for literally anyone else.
bad,The company is a sinking ship unfortunately. Managers are hired based on how much they can sell vs having leadership qualities. In turn employees and customers are treated poorly. Toxic management all the way to the top.
bad,"All this company and it employees care about is the money!!! They will fight each other to get a customer, because it's a commissions based job. The more experienced employees won't help to train a new employee. (A new employee may cost them money.) Some days there are no customers and people stand around doing nothing or on their cell phones. Employees don't talk to one another. It's worse if you have to travel to your store (30 plus minutes) because of the cost of gas and you may not sell anything because of no customers. And I was lied to by DM about hourly salary. He said, ""$9 per hour"" and all I got was $6."
bad,"Never been in such a bad environment like MW."
bad,Poor management throughout the company at every level. They mislead you on the amount of money you will make to get you interested in the position.  If you’re the only one responsible for your bills DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY!!!
bad,"This place is a joke from top to bottom. Upper management will often say one thing and do another, so it is impossible trust anyone. They will lie to your face about anything as long as it benefits the company.  Run as fast and hard as you can. Dont waste your time here, you will make more money recycling aluminum cans. You were warned!"
bad,Manger is very ignorant... she doesn't know anything about mangment  everyone is talking behind every one'back even thr reginal   Manger and the employee's
bad,Since acquiring Jos. A. Bank the culture of the company changed for the worse and they treat their employees poorly. It used to be a great company to work for but over the years that changed.
bad,The job itself is fairly easy. The hours are horrible. No time for family life when you work every weekend. They tell you that you'll make more than they actually pay you. Sales floor employees can make the money up by selling something. The customer service associates do not get paid what they're worth.
bad,"Working at the Men’s Wearhouse has been by far the worst job I have ever had."
bad,This company is very unprofessional and offers zero training.The pay is low and the management is lacking.The employees care more about watching Netflix and just sit around and gossip and complain.Zero opportunity for growth even before we were told that we sre closing the doors.
bad,"Management was horrible, lazy, depends on everyone else to do his job, and upper management did not care. Nothing was ever followed. You had no life, you practically lived there."
bad,Dont waste your time they dont care out their tailors the people who work the hardest. They treat there employees like third class bottom of the boat garbage. The women that work there dress like they are on a street corner very inappropriate. Store manager in one location smells. Very very bad experience. Shouldn't have let George go company now sucks.
bad,"Not a Healthy Work Enviormrment. Pay scale is not good. No Holidays off. Over All, Not a good place to work."
bad,"So many people leaving that store! manager will never train you he’s on his phone all day! Or sitting at his desk eating, employees never get to take a lunch unless you eat on the clock. This is the a nightmare retail place to work,from day one your on your own,no training involved what so ever: The store manager hires friends and let’s them borrow money from the cash registers! So sad I had to escape...Goodluck to anywho applies here .store manager Mike and his partner in crime Joe"
bad,Company condones illegal behavior from the store managers. No work ethic.  They only want young peopled in these stores. Ignores complaints. Regional manager condoned the bullying. I was the only one who had to follow procedure. Tickets were always an issue of not being filled out right.  They don't have the capacity to understand time management. I was told that they didn't like me. And no one wanted to work with me. Was told to stop complaining. I offer to quit. They said no. I tried to make it work.  They allowed a customer to corner me and yell at me over something that is not my job. I felt nothing but anger for this treatment. Oh!  And they kept my vacation pay that i earned.  So.....no.  Don't work for this company. You'll regret it.
bad,Expect to work well past your scheduled shift even if you don’t want to. Wouldn’t work here even if they offered the job back with twice the base pay.
bad,"Management is horrible, they will cut hours back, the most you can work is 15 hours a week, no raises, you start at 8.00 a hour and no raises ever...."
bad,I applied there as a part time Customer Service Associate but instead the manager lied and put me on full time there. There was absolutely zero work-life balance to even manage my time working on other stuff. The job culture there was the worst I have been through yet. Manager and assistant managers were rude as they are like elitists. I did not learn anything from there in experience and I'm glad I left to find better offers elsewhere.
bad,"They require too much from the tailors and not everybody else, have to take all the tags off a suit and shorten the hem and press for 5min."
bad,"Extremely underpaid. Very toxic environment, cut throat competition and fights for sales. More responsibilities then in regular retail store. Very demanding unprofessional management."
bad,"Terrible schedule."
bad,My experience with this company was a great learning experience with this company i would never go back to work for there franchise ever again.management was always late never on time the place was unorganized.
bad,the management likes to gossip and spred lies to have a laugh and make you look poorly. anything they say reaches corporate and makes you look bad. nobody does their job and will scolled you for not doing their tasks for them.
bad,i did a great job working for this company management doesnt handle complaints or even take you serioius.  management ignores problems they dont fix them
bad,I was discriminated against here-and expected to buy the clothes with very little discount. They just wanted me to turn around and spend my measly paycheck there on clothes to wear to work.
bad,"Warehouse,  picking and pulling items . Men clothing and jewelry.  Stacking the item on shells and scanning them in as well.  Progressing orders as well"
bad,leadership is clueless and have no idea on how to motivate and lead a team clothes are cheap and overpriced paying for alterations for clothes that they tell u is a good fit was an absolute joke and then selling clothes that to big so they can tailor them down to you how much sense does that make
bad,I enjoyed the work I did but did not enjoy the management. I was over worked and underpaid. Shifts were not enjoyable because the boss was over bearing and a tyrant at times.
bad,"It's a sales job. That's the best I can describe it, some like it some don't. Your required to meet sales goals and mazimize sales. At time I felt the overall atmosphere was a little to ""sharky""."
bad,"Out of 36 years experience in the job market, working at this store was a nightmare.  I actually was treated better at Walmart.  Not all of the stores are like this, but stay away from the Mesa location.  Their turn over rate speaks for itself.  The management will hold a grudge forever and Heaven forbid you refuse to kiss butt.  Hard work goes unappreciated.  Be prepared to work every weekend and have your days off in the middle of the week and your days off are usually spljt.  It is a cutthroat sales environment and the only thing they care about is making their sales quota."
bad,"Men's Wearhouse is poorly operated, poorly maintained, and is only interested in their final sale number. They do not care about their clients or their employees, and will do anything to pad their pockets. They also pay their men unequally from their women, giving the men anywhere from 25 cents to a dollar more per hour than women in the same position with the same experience."
bad,"Horrible job! No room for growth. You have to be part of the in crowd, The only people that get promoted are people that suck at doing their job. This is the worst job ever. The pay in horrible. They don't value hard work or employees who go the extra mile."
bad,Management is terrible here. Very power hungry and the sales floor is a shark tank environment despite them telling you it's a team effort. Rules are often applies to some rather than all and favorites are often chose. Poor professionalism overall.
bad,"Very rude management, incompetent staff and awful work environment. I would've never work here if I had known how terrible it was. Avoid working here like the plague."
bad,They fired me for coming in at the wrong shift instead of the opening shift and it was a mistake. I've never called out of work excessively. most of my absences were from 4 cancer deaths in my family that happened in 2 weeks.
bad,Managers and associates all talked about taking drugs and cussing in the work place. very childish and poorly managed.
bad,"If you love having no life outside work and being slave driven for 50 plus hours a week then this is the job for you! You are a disposable number to the company. Be prepared to work ten or more hours a day doing useless stockwork for five dollars an hour while the manager goes behind your back after closing time and switches all your commissioned sales to himself.  Everyone is out for themselves. A cutthroat, shady working environment to say the least."
bad,temp job worked here for about a year they had all types of incentives for us provided lunch and snacks and drinks for us never a dull moment i really hate that it ended
bad,This position was ok. When the company changed from men's wearhouse a lot of changes took place. A lot of managers and consultants as myself were laid off/ fired.
bad,Management sucked manager was obsessed and always tried to make out with me in the upper level that was abandoned. I had to quit by not showing up because I couldnt dare tell anyone about how I was basically being molested
bad,"Management showed favoritism, I was harassed by management everyday I walked into work. Hours were cut to 5 hours a week because of an emergent hospital stay. My manager was ""punishing"" me for being in the hospital after a car accident I suffered."
bad,"Have worked for MW on several occasions as a ""Wardrobe Consultant"", the sales are a gimmick and the product is lackluster now.  The company has steered away from being employee oriented to a cookie cutter, discount shop,  I would imagine the commission structure will continue to shrink.   It's a pretty bad place to work."
bad,Horribly managed store with misleading information last mintue schedule change with no warning 3 hour shifts five days a week
bad,I wouldn't work for this company if they paid me 80k a year.  Horrible working conditions.  They treat their employees terrible.  They only match 401 k up to $200.00  a year.
bad,baggier the customer from walking in the door till they buy or leave
bad,A typical day at the mens wearhouse is just working and going home.
bad,You're not part of the agenda they only worry about the bottom line profit you're expendable I worked for 4 years and was moving up but there are people who don't t like it when you progress in the company faster than them
bad,My only experience is with the Willowbrook location in Houston TX. The manager puts out the schedule the day before the workweek starts. If she gets the opportunity to take sales away from employees she will. Horrible work environment.
bad,I was happy to advance my career and leave this company.  Employees were not valued and certain work locations were dangerous.  No support from upper management.
bad,"They always came up with bs reasons of why your idea wasn't possible, played favorites, demanded you work when they want you to work, even if their opinion on it had been proven wrong time and time again."
bad,"Company is not what it once was."
bad,"Very stressful, pressure work environment for a tailor. SEW, SEW,SEW, FIT, keep working...400 minutes plus of work to be finished each day. get all rush jobs done too, and press all work."
bad,"My entire experience with this company was unsavory from the beginning. I initially applied for their Assistant Operations Manager position. I was going to receive the position, but at the last minute they withdrew that offer. The Store Manager told me that if I re-applied for their entry-level CSA position he would then promote me in two months when their sales position opened up. So, in good faith I said yes."
bad,Well I was a delivery driver. I drove all Mens Wearhouse tuxedos and apparel to the stores in the northern region. Different days different stores. The employees who works in them stores to receive the goods most are rude and treat (us) the truck drivers as nothing. As a truck driver for them there is no advancement in the company. I was there almost a year and my salary went from $17.00 to 17.25and any giving day you’re delivering to atleast 6stores  driving as far as Redding and back. They tell you take your time don’t rush. Then say can you speed up because it’s costing the company.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work in the MN market. "
bad,"Area manager was from hunger, wife worked for the store, and had no ethics either."
bad,"Co-workers were very unprofessional, and constantly foul speaking just loud enough for customers to hear. It was by far the worst part time job I've ever held when it came down to co-workers."
bad,"upper management is rude,disrepectful and wont promote people of color."
bad,"Life balance and work balance was not the best, long hours and little recognition of a job well done"
bad,"If you are looking in the Jacksonville, FL area beware.  Stay away from the Orange Park location if you do not like to be micro managed and/or belittled.  The culture announced during training was that ""we don't drug test because we all like to smoke pot."" Wow.  If looking in this direction you'd be better off at Jos. A. Bank, better clothing and management."
bad,Being ill with a doctors note will still be counted as bad attendance even if it is the first time.
bad,"As a wardrobe consultant your paycheck varies constantly. Base pay is $5.25 an hour, then you make commission off of your sales. The issue with this is during the slow season when you don't really have very many sales or any at all you are REALLY struggling to make ends meet. Also management and corporate need to stick to their return policy to protect their employees and not let customers abuse it because the only one who suffers is the Wardrobe consultant who takes the hit for the return."
bad,"Not a long term career, but good for part time career. Staff is fun, caring, customers not so much at times. Hours aren't as flexible but it is retail."
bad,"Customers are rude and entitled the moment they walk in the doors, thinking they can say and do anything they wish, and the ones that are not rude. They are clueless of what they want and ask for our opinion, with no intentions of  considering them, and  replies by saying, “that’s not what I want.” Also get customers who are mad at us, because of a suit they had  purchased three years ago, dose not fit anymore. It’s not our fault that you changed."
bad,The culture and management team needs to be changed as well as the work load and expectation that are created for the lack of pay that is provided.There shouls be more opportunity to grow and not held back.
bad,Absolute high school games and talking behind people's backs ruined this experience. The hardest part of the job was fighting for customers as it was a cutthroat environment with no order. Management was absolutely the worst ive ever dealt with in my life. and the HR rep seemed to completely be in cahoots with the store manager.
bad,one of my very first jobs very bad experience poor management no place to move up supervisors show favoritism towards certain workers very shady place to work
bad,"A bad manager or management can take a good staff and destroy it,causing the best employess to flee and the remainder to lose all movtivation.........."
bad,"Fun place to work!"
bad,No room for advancement. No help from upper management. Was told that after 6mos I'd have my own store and did not.
bad,I wasted 14 years of my life on a company that doesn’t value loyalty and dedication.  They also don’t pay fairly for your position and expect you to go abouve and beyond without proper compensation.
bad,"typically you have to be able to sell and learn the techniques to maximize the store sales so you get a paycheck. my store manager was not a nice person, good trainer though. the commission based pay is not enough for a single boy. your paycheck is not guaranteed every week. co-workers were ok. the hardest part about the job was to convince the customers to buy more and more and more! the enjoyable part was the flexibility in working hours."
bad,It is a job that time to learn the different products and how they fit on someone body.  Training is key to success so taking those windows of time can benefit you on your journey there.
bad,At the top management level the communication is very poor. The regional Director only communicate to the vice president of stores what is to his convenience. Only people that he likes get promoted regarldless if the person is qualified for the position. People are set for failure.
bad,"When i was a CSA at Mens Wearhouse, there was no community amongst the staff. It was so intensely focused on sales, that it made a very high competition amongst staff to get the sale, because income is based on commission."
bad,"intense sales atmosphere you were providing little valeu, the quality and cost of the clothing wasn't even competitive witch meant you had to sell harder."
bad,I cant say i would recommend working here the pay is low along with it being commission work i hated meeting deadlines with selling something that the buyer didnt need
bad,"A typically day at work is helping customers, ringing sales, booking tuxedo rental reservations and maintaining the store appearance."
bad,"I started with the company thinking it’d be better than what it is. Can’t say I’m enthused to still be here so I’m trying to find my way out. The pay is horrible, and the way the employees are treated is even worse. All of these rules are mandated by corporate and corporate doesn’t even know the dynamics of the stores because they sit at a desk all day and make assumptions based on numbers. Can’t wait to leave."
bad,This company does NOT care about QUALITY people who have been there forever. They'd much rather hire newbies and pay them less. That is why I LEFT!!!!
bad,"While TMW is a fun place to work and fairly easy, it is not a place where you get many (if any) promotions. You have to know the people up at the top on a friendly basis if you want any sort of raise. This is not a place where hard work pays off or gets you any sort of promotion, and most of the people who have been working there for a long time and want to retire are fired so that the company doesnt have to pay them benefits. The employees are hired at the lowest possible hourly wages and are not promised any kind of raise ever, it is very rare to get any kind of promotion at this company unless you are chummy with the regional management."
bad,Company that was once great but has gotten to big for their own good. Has lost direction and sense of voice. Company is full of hard working employees with 10+ years experience and instead of thanking them for their service they keep taking things away.
bad,the people here are horrible. I would never work here again. Pay isn't that good. Mandatory overtime was is good for people who don't have kids and well a life...
bad,"Almost every customer has an angry, aggressive attitude and will take their frustrations out on you for things that aren't your fault, like pricing set by corporate and the length of the rental periods. I've been working for 22 years and never had to deal with customers so disrespectful."
bad,The company was divided between commission and hourly employees so being taught within the company was a minimal as each employee had there own focus and no teamwork.
bad,"Men's Warehouse is good job depending on your needs. It can be fun at times, and encouraging as well.  We sometimes play games.  There has been many free meals and very supportive management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I serve the coffee breaks and say good morning and hears those that appreciate the coffee that I make. To me that is best part.  Our boss sometimes buys donuts and even lunch for the whole company. However, the hardest part of my job is picking up the water jugs and changing them.  My coworkers are very supportive of me and sometimes express that to me how I do a good job.  I learned that there is a limited relationship between coworker and yourself.  My overall rating is 5 stars.  I feel that management did not want me to exercise my rights as a human being so I decided to move on.  In addition, I feel that I was done wrong concerning my salary and I feel that I do a excellent job but there was glitches concerning my pay."
bad,"Manager brings in for interview then doesn't call back and when you finally are able to get him on the phone after telling you he was hiring you ""oh we moved someone else in"". Rude Disrespectful and a waste of time. Plus can not even get orders right for customer. Had a wedding party go through there and had to return and exchange till day before...... pathetic and awful customer service"
bad,Being an employee at Mens Warehouse was at times very stressful. Fitting and Selling Suits is not as easy at it sounds.  For fitting a man for a suit requires the correct measurements and making sure everything in perfect condition for any event.  
bad,It wasn't the setting I perfer. Measuring men all day. More for women in my opinion.
bad,Loved the people I worked with. Hours were ok and I learned a lot from the manager I had who has since sadly passed away. I felt I was a valued part of the team and had fun every day!
bad,Company is a great company to work for if you have a criminal back ground or if you use any drugs. The yearly reviews are from 10 cents to 35 cents regardless if you met or exceeded expectations.
bad,. I learned new things but that’s about all . The customer are nice . And taylors are great people. They do great work . They get your clothes back to you when u need them
bad,in general it is an easy place to work.work is not hard . you do need a quota on the job you are doing.in witch the quota is way to much to get.if you don't get it they send you home early and or lay you off.they hire through company but it seems only the Immagrant are the one they hire.very very few being hire are Americans.the non Americans are very rude.there is a public bus that can take you there and pick you up.the warehouse and bathrooms are clean.they have a smoking section outside.you are on your feet for the whole shift.the bathrooms and break room are far from you work so you do need to walk a distance.
bad,"Managers don't do anything, everyone else is slaving and watch them, you'll never get raises either without begging. They expect so much from you but pay you so little, the amount of money you make them doesn't equal out or even come close to your pay!"
bad,"Constant changes in pay, commission, scheduling, and work duties. Regional Managers run the stores that the Store Managers ""babysit"". Store Managers are self involved and care more about their own egos. Schedules are tough and some workdays are very long, even with reduced hours. Lot's of recent lay offs."
bad,This is a company with a great culture. I just find the sporadic scheduling to be very hard to deal with as far as work life balance. This is definitely a company that will give people a chance to show their mettle but is definitely not for every one. If you can handle the stress and demands of the business environment you will be fine. This company has a very strong work hard play hard mentality. Very little growth opportunity beyond your position and horrible work schedule.
bad,"The company has a lot of potential, but the lack of diversity in management at the corporate office is shocking."
bad,"good job for college age people, not worth the headaches for career. If your looking for quality of life this is not the place. Long hours, unstable pay. High expectations, low consideration."
bad,Typical retail job with no career future. Learn from the errors you make due to lack of training. A lot of down time where you work for the company with very little pay and no commission.
bad,fun to work there but if they want you out they make you miserable until you resign.
bad,"Employers treat employees like criminals and children, no real respect, and all they care about are the numbers"
bad,"Promises, promises, promises, none were kept. Promised to give a promotion and never did. Hired a random dude from outside the store that had no experience in retail(and didn't even want a management position) when I had been there for almost 4 years and had been promised that position for at least 1.5 years."
bad,"There is very little advancement in the company. Very unorganized and last minute company. Training is never done right, depending on what store you are hired at."
bad,"You need to keep track of your clients and sales each day.  Commissions were constantly being stolen from sales associates and it is difficult to prove it was your client.  Management would not change them back and as soon as other sales associates heard that a client wanted to spend a lot of money, they would come over and pretend they knew them and they were their client.  This is just another way commissions can be stolen from you. It is a stressful environment where management encourages associates to compete, which creates animosity amongst co-workers."
bad,"I really enjoyed working here with the roles that I was involved in. Although my stores ASM was not to friendly towards myself or customers, which was not okay. I was looking for a job that I will be able to move up the ladder and this wasn't the place."
bad,"Years ago, MW was a great place to work. They were one of the only corporations that truly cared about its employees and customers. Every day was great! Coming to work was exciting and rewarding. "
bad,Typical Day you are pushed and worked on you feet 8-12 hours a day. Little things such as breaks were to short and to far. To big of a warehouse to not possibly give extended breaks. NO benefits. NO Insurance. EVERYTHING at the job was hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is when they gave Holiday parties and gave lunch for over working there employees.
bad,Upper management pressures local management and threatens their jobs so that inferior position are then pressured and threatened with their jobs. An overall counterproductive environment for anybody seeking to work at a positive team-building work environment. CSAs are not paid enough for having to carry everybody else's positions all day and all the responsibility they need to adopt on their end.
bad,"Upper management doesn't care about employees, just making numbers.  It doesn't matter how long you have been with the company or how many times you have moved your family to take on new positions, if they want to put a new inexperienced person in your place they will make up a reason to do so. Store level is a fun environment to work in and love meeting new customers."
bad,The managment is very lazy and the work that is expected from you is not comparable to the compensation you receive. In my experience the managment is only out to protect them self and would not try to recognize the actions of the other employees
bad,"Hard for advancement. Leadership only cares about the numbers, and the pay is low with only a 25 cent a year raise. Only thing that makes it fun is your co-workers. Corporate cut out the yearly Christmas parties to save money."
bad,The store manager was good. The regional managers in the southeast are horrible. Nepotistic. Not the best place to work if youre trying to make a career.
bad,Management was very hypocritical and sometimes acted superior to others. No real opportunities to grow in company. Gained a lot of knowledge about Mens fashion and the wedding process.
bad,"consistent day to day job, nice customers to deal with, and easy work environment.   Nice merchandise and good product.  Learned how to better cater to customer needs."
bad,"A normal day consist of open the store at 9am. After the computers are up and ready to go, the press is turned on and the tailor shop is set for the day. Once everything is clean in the store, the deposits are taken to the bank and change is made for the cash register. Once all the banking is done, the store is ready to be opened at 10am. The day will continue with customers coming in for retail and rental items. Managers solve problems that arise throughout the day as well as maximize sales and help others do the same. Schedules are written for all employees. Some days there are conference calls and training classes that must be put on by management. Following the day of sales and management, the store is closing of the day. The money is counted and the store is cleaned up."
bad,"I took a part time position because I was told I would be hired quicker than a full time sales consultant. I worked over 50 hours a week during prom season, I was never late, customers loved the service I gave as well as how accurate I made measurements and orders. After prom season, I went from working close to 50 hours a week to just 4 hours. I was told since I was the last one to be hired, I got less hours."
bad,Sat in the back and completed homework. Also watched netflix during down time as the location was not very busy and eventually ended up closing. Employs were not very welcoming or open to teaching you standard operating procedures.
bad,"Great company if you are fashion forward individual. Since its mostly commissioned base, there is lots of competition. Great associate discounts and benefits."
bad,The manager is required to maintain a personal sales book while maintaining all management responsibilities. Employee turn over is high and made more difficult by constant transfers of seasoned employees to other units.New advertising policies confuse customers making sales more difficult.
bad,"company culture is accepting of abusive, nasty manager, trying to work with in the structure is difficult, being a hard worker is not worth anything!"
bad,"The Men's Wearhouse was a fun place to work.  I learned a great deal about fashion and the proper way for men to wear their clothes.  The benefits they offered were not that great.  For example, their 401k plan was one of the worst I have ever seen.  They would only contribute up to 250 dollars while many others are at atleast three or four percent.  Another issue I had was with my management team.  It appeared to me that they had no idea how to run a store effectively and to insure that the work place was happy with high morale."
bad,"how to stock suits by size and color  and length "
bad,Not family friendly at all. Pay is not good. Management is very much a clique. They only listen to other managers. Employees mean nothing to upper management
bad,Worked for the company for three years. Led three different regions in the rental department and hit my cap with pay after two years. The last year I had improved my stats dramatically and then was told there wasn’t any where to go up unless I went to the sales side to make commission plus $5/h base pay. That carrot was dangled in front of my face for over a year but I was told I was too good to replace on the rental side so I was basically forgotten about.
bad,"A workplace that is focused on driving sales, but limits its salesman with little incentive and forced sales tactics that dont work . You are placed in a box, but told to think outside of one."
bad,"I have work for the company over 5 years, and since then many changes have happened. I have gained many skills from my time here, management, communication, customer service, logistics, problem solving, etc. Where I am grateful for what I have gained in experience, I would not recommend this company as a career. If you are looking for part-time work or income to get you Though school, this is a rather comfortable retailer. However for long term it is aweful. The company is struggling and as such are nickle and diming thier employees. Loading on more work, expectations, and duties on to their current employees, while cutting work hours and have not raised the starting pay for employees for over 5 years.  They have changed bonus structures and required statistics that make achieving bonuses nearly impossible. Employees are getting over worked, denied overtime and payrole to properly staff thier locations. Management is constantly under threat and stress from corporate. Many wonderful management members have left the company and as such locations Are being filled with untrained or underqulified managers. This makes working conditions  aweful and stress full. The company used to make their employees first priority as we are the foundation for the company's success but not anymore. We are a expense, our payroll, bonus, commission rates, daily supplies, donation programs, are all expenses that corporate is cutting to save themselves.  The world of retail is changing and the world of formal and business dress attire is becoming more and more casual. This company is struggling to keep"
bad,I worked there for more about a year and the management team always mentioned to me that they were going to promote me but nothing ever happened. I wish I would've left sooner.
bad,great place to work fast pace time went quickly the hardest part of the job is when the manger would blame all the wrong on a group or single person all was okay
bad,"If you are not a wardrobe consultant and even if you are, you just don’t get paid what you should for the work you do . It’s pretty sad how greedy corporate is."
bad,"Typical work day consist of coming in checking emails & sales goals while following up with potential sales. Receiving in new merchandise, organizing suit wall while making sure store is neat & clean also  consulting with customers with retail & rental. Very laid back enviroment sometimes a little too laid back."
bad,Good first job. Takes forever to move up in the company and the management is very unprofessional. A lot of favoritism and lazy coworkers. Wouldn't work for it again
bad,Mens warehouse was good for a first job experience definitely beat working fast food. The people were friendly and the job was easy and fun at the same tine.
bad,Can be super stressful during busy seasons. Working with people around their wedding is ridiculous. I have more nightmare stories to share than good ones.
bad,"-commission based"
bad,"The hardest part of the job was measuring the men for tuxedos. The measurements had to be just right before their event, if not then I would have to reorder another one and hope that it was in the store on time."
bad,"Sales People are very nice and knowledgable. "
bad,"need more hours nothing is guarenteed, need better pay need better workers, non experience people runs the whole show this would be a good part time for someone in school."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. The hours and pay is a joke for the work that is desired. Best position is in sales, you can make an ok income...but everything else is not worth the pay. They demand more then what they are willing to compensate their employees with."
bad,job isnt hard to do its the company itself that i do not like no oppurtunity to advance and it should be.i learned not to be content and settle for whatever
bad,"When I first started at Men's Wearhouse, it was a great place to work. Corporate really cared about their employees. Pay, and benefits were great for the work required. Over the past couple of years the company changed into something I do not wish to be a part of anymore."
bad,"it a big warehouse but the manager is very rude and not dont know how to treat people. "
bad,I am not interested in writing a review for this business everything I learned at this establishment I plan to use in my future.
bad,working at the menwarehuse was alright if you don't look a certain race or clique up with the right people you will not make it very long there  it has it's up's and down's but and pay is not all that for the hours
bad,"book weddings, greet customers,"
bad,"assist customer with making choices"
bad,Can be a good job depending on location How busy store is and managment in place. Laid back environment in most stores. Customer are good to deal with.
bad,"Ever since the company became publicly traded, the benefits vs work are no longer balanced.  I was there 13 years and saw the drastic changes that happen between the last eight years or so.  The managers don't get paid enough(especially the Assistant Managers and Assistant Manager II) Wish I didn't feel like 13 years of my life is wasted and now I have to find something else"
bad,"when I began in 2007 this was the greatest place to work. loved everyday. after 2013 the culture changed and they slowly took all the perks away.Stopped promoting from with in. managers brought their friends in and despite how unqualified they were compared to current employees, gave them management positions. (side note) if you are not a friend of a management person or white you will never get promoted in the DC.(20+ managment team NO diversity.). I was employeed there 12.yrs. I quit because i finally came to terms with the fact that the glass celling was real, and it was very low!"
bad,It was not a fun job. Would not recommend working there at all. My manager was a great guy but not a good manager in the least. Always stressed out and could never get a break.
bad,It is possible to work at Men's Wearhouse as just a seasonal employee but you are still pushing for the sale and just giving it to one of the actual commission workers. There is also an insane amount of traffic in the region for Mardi Gras tuxedos and everyone has an opinion. I improved my social skills and the knowledge I gained about coordinating outfits helped in other jobs but retail is retail.
bad,Job  is too stressful. The company lacks organization and authority is not on point. The upside is u have a work day and work out included in your everyday tasks.
bad,Men's warehouse is not a bad place to work it just isn't something I would make into a career at any point. It doesn't have the opportunity within the company to move up.
bad,"In my experience, the job is sold to you as a fun, team-oriented, and  fruitful endeavor.  In reality, once you get past the remedial training required, you quickly realize that the 'old guard' is essentially morally and ethically bankrupt in terms of running a business of this nature and that many of the higher-ups are out of touch with the company's true culture. "
bad,I felt that the company does not fully care for their associates at all. It’s all a power trip and no one cares if you’re there or not. Also the balance between personal time and business is nearly impossible
bad,The company celebrated the different holidays and events. This was a good way to take the edge off the work day when they were planned. The day usually consisted of me taking inbound calls all day some long and some short.
bad,"Very stressful job that requires a lot of product and procedural knowledge for little pay, especially as a CSA. Underlings get overworked in comparison to higher ups. Regional management is dishonest. Little room to move up. Stressful and demanding clientele with high stakes need and unrealistic accountability. Shady business dealings internally. Unethical business ethic as far as sales techniques. Strict dress code especially for men."
bad,Easy store to run.  Wedding industry is very customer service intensive.  Always buy what you can't beat that should be the company moto
bad,It was a temporary job. On a regular day of work i would go in and start right away. I learned how to make customers happy and how to deal with crowded work place. Even though i didn't really revive training i still learned how to manage.  The co-workers have negative attitude with each other but lucky i stayed out of that did my job and was really friendly with everyone.
bad,"A typical day at work was talking with customers face to face concerning current or recent orders, credit card transactions,"
bad,"Although I have worked there for the past seven years, I have learned that only the strongest survive. When you come to work, do you best and be productive at all times."
bad,"As a (Customer Service Associate) CSA, the management there are easy going. If a CSA employee is on time for their shift and is doing what they are supposed to, they are nice and there will be no problems. Any mistakes made by a CSA can be fixed with no hard feelings. If the employee is to do well with their job, they can be promoted with enough experience. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for any employer above a CSA. Wardrobe Consultants and Management are treated worse by corporate and any small and fixable mistake do not go over well. Although this does not happen too often, if you are working with wonderful people (which you most likely will), you will enjoy your time with your co-workers, when times at the store are slow."
bad,"Overall, this company is good for getting started, but what they expect of you is excessive for how they compensate. The rental side of the store is a nightmare, and you're constantly cleaning up issues as a member of management. Margins for pricing are really wide and promotions are inconsistent."
bad,Store structure is VERY HEAVILY FRONT LOADED for MANAGEMENT only. Assistant Managers call the shots overall and since they are salary plus commission paid they do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE to MAX out their sales commission at the expense of non management sales staff. When brought up to upper management you just get a - work it out with them response - which equates to NOTHING BEING DONE  TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM so the same injustices simply continue. This certainly does not align with the companies code of conduct which in my opinion is simply ALL TALK and NO ACTION on managements part. Some days you get NO BREAKS due to lack of staff in the tuxedo area and or people calling in and not showing up. Overall the worst company and experience I have ever had in my working career. I have learned how NOT TO TREAT another employee by working here.
bad,"Men's Wearhouse as a whole has so many problems. Are there good people in the company? Yes there are definitely those that are just good people if they weren't working at the company. BUT, as a whole and for upper management, it has to be one of the worst companies that I have worked. They are very good at marketing that the company cares about it's customers or employees; this couldn't be further from the truth. Upper management has done ""surveys"" to get the input on how to better serve customers and employees. Which was nothing more than a waste of time since no major changes were done to compensate entry level employees and managers better. It's sad when no one in the company has received a raise but the company's CEO and upper management still take/receive a bonus for clearly make poor financial decisions running the company. Another major violation and poor management practices is getting paid as least as possible while basically running all aspects of the company with little to no training. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you are working for a discount on your wedding or if you work in a field that you have to wear a lot of suits."
bad,"Management wasn’t the best, some days it’s boring until prom season starts. I hated working there, retail isn’t for me. You don’t get long enough breaks during prom season."
bad,"There are some good days, and some of the people that work they can sometimes be nice, but for the most part they aren't. They rely on others to do most of the work, and theres barely any communication between staff. Plus, it's not fun working with people who are constantly in a bad mood."
bad,Over the past few years a lot of tenured employees have left the company because of negative decisions have been made by corporate that directly effects the employees at the store level.
bad,"The job itself was wonderful of serving customers what they needed for their occasion, just within the company few individuals lack any drive or focus."
bad,"Room for advancement is little to none and the management considers their own schedule before scheduling their employees. It is not uncommon to be scheduled an open to close shift for more than one day a week and they tend to up and leave whenever it gets slow they will leave the employees alone. You can forget about getting breaks, they do not give them unless you are under 18 and it is required by law. They are famous for hiring their friends first and have a party mentality. If you are not in with the ""party"" you are the one left to do all the work. The work is not difficult but it can get to you after a while when they are always getting paid to do nothing."
bad,"terrible company, my aunt died and said it does not matter because it is not my mom or dad, and threatened to fire me if i did not show up the day of her funeral so i quit."
bad,fun place to work as a first job but that's about it. move up opportunity is slow. pay does not match the type work done for job position.
bad,"The company is good for someone who wants to ""get their foot in the door"" or simply wants to get some experience. In regards to the environment it used to be GREAT. Now, it's just blah. The pay has always been on the lower end of the scale as admitted by management. Advancement all depends on where you start from and who you can suck up to. If you come from the warehouse or call center, there is some room for advancement. If you're already in the office, you have to wait for someone to quit, retire or do a lot of but kissing and even then you may not be able to advance, as they frequently do not fill positions and have quite a bit of politics going on. Most of your co-workers are GREAT. I don't know how they pick them, but they do a GREAT job at that. Management is another story...."
bad,"A typical day for me would be booking tuxedos for wedding and special events/occassions such as prom. When I wasn't busy booking tuxedos, I would be on the sales floor helping the wardrobe consultants put together outfits for customer viewings. Most of my co-workers were very helpful and friendly"
bad,There are at least two managers in the store at all times and I hated both of them. They acted as if I was a horrible choice and I heard of them talking about me behind my back negatively. The only good part about this job is the 55-65% off. That discount is the only reason I stayed as long as I did.
bad,"Mens wearhouse is not a place to make a living at, the amount you are paid for the things you do don't add up. One of the only good things working here would be the experience. I would say that men's wearhouse is a starter job unless you are going for store manager."
bad,need more leadership skill and have more respect for the SCA in the store they pretty much do everything without commission. they don't know how to train properly.
bad,Nice place to start after high school but not to stay forever. Managers are focused on money and they don’t care about the employees. They rather give the position to somebody from outside that old associates.
bad,I enjoyed most of my time at the mens  wearhouse. It got worst overtime as more got added to my list of duties. Overall it was a great experience working for the company it was great learning everything I did and  I'm grateful for the opportunity I was given to advance in life.
bad,Pay is average at best but they hold you to pretty high expectations. Management was great and training is on point. Good place to learn the basics of sales but not much beyond that.
bad,It was a good place to work at though many times things got hectic.  The store was closing down and there were sales left and right making it difficult to keep the store cleaned and help customers.
bad,stock shelves unloaded the truck customer services  manually markdowns change item location put up new material sweep floors kept a safe environment.
bad,"Believe it or not the hardest part is making a decision and figuring out the perfect colors for a wedding or even for prom. However, it is the most enjoyable part of the job because you are helping your customers and that's all that they want, your support. Seeing the smiles on their faces lets you know you're doing a phenomenal job. My manager is ALWAYS there to support everyone and also there to teach us as well. I learned how to be humble and understanding when it came to taking care of customer service issues even when it wasn't my fault. It helped me to grow as a person and it also teaches me how to handle something like that in case it were to happen again."
bad,"An interesting work environment but everyday is a gamble, but what is consistent is the moral...and it is low.  This place has helped me establish a organic customer service.  I measure men and children for tuxedos and I am sure they are not a fan it. In this job i have honed in on my skills in conversation and make people comfortable while they are being fitted. I also help couples design a tux group which entails picking out styles and processing the codes in the software.  I have worked with amazing people and some of the worst around Reading, PA. This growth I am thankful for from this company."
bad,"Great place to work for college students or high schoolers. "
bad,"continuosly on the go, company emplemented rate per hour policy injoyed working on double pallet rider: could move more product with this equipment."
bad,"Working at Men's Wearhouse was constantly stressful. Management is always breathing down you neck and pushing you to sell to customers to an uncomfortable level. There were a lot of good things about working there, but overall. I don't recommend it."
bad,not that good if your looking for a full time job. aLWAYS CHANGING rates.
bad,I enjoy this job and the interaction with customers.  It is definitely a nice change to dress up every day and my personal wardrobe has improved dramatically. I wish the pay was better and there was more room for advancement.
bad,"company was ok, but hours suck. any retail position can be awful due to the customers you have to service. Being someones personal shopper is pretty annoying"
bad,Very slow paced place to work.  There is a lot of excess time on the schedule when no one is coming in.  Gets very boring at times just waiting for customers to come in.
bad,"Retrieved alternate items and sizes on request. Met incoming customers and provided immediate assistance. Completed purchases with cash, credit and debit payment methods. Listened to customer needs and preferences to provide accurate advice. Increased purchase totals by recommending additional items. Organized items in visually appealing manner. Answered incoming telephone calls with professional and knowledgeable responses."
bad,"Corporate does not think about store level employees. The only good thing is the benefits, they are great. The job however, is a challange."
bad,Great job for college but it is not a career. The schedule could be flexible depending on manager. Do other peoples piety work for a small hourly.
bad,"This company is a good place to work, with great benefits but terrible pay.  The commission and pay structure has not evolved with the rise of living cost."
bad,"I was 16 when I first had this job so I do not know all the ins and outs of Carsons, but during seasonal time you were very well compensated for your time."
bad,A decent job for anyone looking for work right out of high school.
bad,"If you are an adult over thirty, this may not be the ideal job on an entry level, however there are some decent management positions.  It does not pay up to the standard cost of living for an adult with responsibilities and bills."
bad,"no place for you to go higher "
bad,"Fast pace place, with the enjoyment of preparing customers for there wedding, prom or any special event."
bad,"Assist customers with formal wear. from work suits to tuxedos."
bad,A typical day at work is providing support to Grooms (and Brides) by assisting them ensemble their wedding tuxedo colors and tux wear. The day includes answering a significant number of phone calls and resolving issues/concerns over the phone.
bad,"In my time working at my store. All I have seen is a lazy assistant manager & top seller of the wardrobe consultants just hang out together, make the CSA's so their work for them, & just use everyone there. One of the worst work environments to go into. I work 25-35 hour weeks on top of my school work I have to take care of. The only view here for working as a high school student or college is your job is the only thing that matters not your future or grades in school."
bad,Fluctuations days of extreme business to nothing at all. Inconsistent hours that you don't know until the day of work as well as low pay. Management was fantastic and understanding. Would often hear your concerns and listen to feedback often.
bad,Great company culture and thats about it. I dont know what else to say i have never been asked to review a previous employer. I just dont see the logical value in this.
bad,50/50 I would recommend. Of course like any job it has its good and bad days overall I feel they need to improve the commission percent plus hourly pay could be better
bad,"Since buying jos a banks, Men’s Wearhouse made a lot of cuts that directly affected the morale of employees. No more holiday parties, pay was cut, prices were inflated, and they cut tailoring hours"
bad,"Horrible company! I worked for the company for almost two years. I had blast and Prom Season was really intense; yet fun! Everything was fine until they threw everyone who worked so hard for them under the bus. I never got my remaining vacation hours once I left the company! I tried calling and all my answered were ignored. They closed so many stores throughout the nation. Some stores were told a month ahead of time while the rest were less than a week. I was promised I will be able to transferred to a different store; but, a few days before the store was going to close, they lied to me the whole time. Most managers try not to get involve and ignores the whole problem. The regional manager for Central Florida avoided everyone instead of being a true manager and tell everyone the truth. some employers don't have a job because they didn't know they were losing their job."
bad,"Lots of opportunity, very challenging, lot to learn."
bad,Good place to work. There is a lot that goes on at store level that corporate doesn't hear about or probably wouldn't  agree with. Favoritism a lot of it.
good,"Great place to learn quality retail customer service, while also learning how to work as a team in a competitive work environment, but I must say it isn’t for everyone"
good,Looking for full-time employment beyond seasonal work. Great team work facility with resepectible managers.
good,"Culture doesn't reflect television image. Poor multi-unit management, training and support of its leaders. Poor pay. Until the leadership changes. I wouldn't recommend working here longterm."
good,Men's Wearhouse has gotten away from what made them the once great company they were. They no longer care about their employees or their clients. They have not only cut benefits for their employees but they have not readjusted the compensation package to reflect their more high end products. They have gone away from the products that made them so successful and are trying to force different (more expensive) attire down their clients throat.
good,wardrobe consultant assisting customers with choices for their professional and personal attire. Great experience to learn the fashion end and construction of different styles of suits and their fits on different body types.
good,"OK  Job, but does not pay nearly enough, for the amount of work and hours you put in. Work and hours are the equivalent to working for UPS or FEDex. lots of driving and lots of deliveries."
good,The people are rude that works there. We got pizza every Saturday which was nice. The hardest part is the tuxedos are really heavy. Management is horrible. I learned how to measure people.
good,its was ight i enjoyed it most days never really had any issues directly just a lot of shady things that went on in my time here overall good place to work if you love working 6 days a week
good,I don't remember working here much as it was long ago. But it was not a good work experience as my supervisor was very unprofessional. Work was not hard but I was pregnant and not allowed to change positions until proof a pregnancy but by the time I got that I had a miscarriage.
good,constant shuffling of locations.  Shifts for sales staff are always 9 hours & typically without a lunch.  Not much support from any upper management and consistent company wide sales affect sales staff's paychecks heavily.
good,"The job I interviewed for did not turn our to be accurate as the company pay plan was changed immediately due to the economy.  I  never had a realistic chance to earn what was projected."
good,Could have a better HR department as well as a better Tuxedo management team
good,"A typical day at Men's Wearhouse included the following: greeting customers in and out of the store; setting up wedding and prom events, measuring men for clothing, maintanence of the store, inventory and shipment and assisting wardrobe consultants."
good,The company is making too many bad changes. Our commission structure is changing for the worse. No longer have great training for tailors. Company culture is disappointing.
good,On an average day we could be really busy or there could be no customers that come in all day. The management was all over the place from store to store but the other employees were all really good to work with. There really isn't much room to grow in the stores they play favorites a lot with the employees.
good,"Working at MW can be a fun place to work but at other times it is extremely stressful. If you're in management you are expected to work a minimum of 45 hours a week if not more and expected to each and every Saturday. During prom season expect to work 6 days a week. Multi-unit managers as no help in supporting stores. And don't expect support from them if you have under performing employees. However, if your store is under performing they will be all over you."
good,"Mangers were ok, it was fast paced job had to be ready for whatever was given to you working with RFgun, I was train here using a RF gun it was a good experience."
good,"It’s an ok job to work at if you wanna make 5 bucks an hour and commission. You will not have a family life, your job becomes your family. Gossipers, even in management. Don’t ask for a bonus they will just tell you to sell harder."
good,Great way to network with other people with different background from different industries. Its a great company for a stepping stone in getting customer service experience.
good,"Management (in store & higher up) cared more about themselves rather than staff. Moving higher up in company didn't bring more money either, mostly just stress. It''s generally slow at work, but at the busy times of the year, it's constant movement; Helping customers and making sure they leave happy is top priority."
good,If you are looking at a job to get you through college and not make a career out of it then Men's Wearhouse is right for you.  The management does not care.  They focus more on the shareholder than the employee.  The management could use more training and help others move up in the company not keep them limited to their current positions.  I was always taught to train the person below you to take your position.  If they aren't trained correctly then they will fail when they get there.
good,I enjoyed working for the company after the change in district manager things went downhill the DM would not return calls emails. Absolutely no good communication.
good,Fast past environment great staffing great tailoring service great customer service excellent rental department great team work regional manager are awesome
good,good place to work if you are single and have no children managers have no clue of what they are doing need better leadership people can get away with anything
good,Fun place to work horrible place if you have children and you love your outside life. I felt like my team was my family never spent time with my son. I only had time to work and when I got home was time to sleep and go to work again. My manager was all about looks and never did any training.
good,"Every single day was different, and not in the good way, very poor management at my prior location. Coworkers were the best part of the job, very cutthroat environment however."
good,"Had a great time with the company but I feel after 12 years I just need a change, in those 12 years I feel like I've learned to talk and work with people in a professional manner, how to deal with customer service issues."
good,"I worked for this company off and on for 7 years. I started there in high school and left when I went to college. Then I came back after the birth of my son and it was great until I went for a promotion that I clearly deserved and the gave to someone outside the company. Then I came back after leaving a job, and they gave me a great promotion but then cancelled the position after only six months. They break promises over and over again."
good,"Employees below you are not treated well, subsequently, they are not loyal to the job. which piles everything on the store manager. Top management has made errors acquiring competitors, as a result leaving company very vulnerable."
good,I had been in school and doing two sports and I did not have the time to work as much as I was scheduled. I asked for less shifts and no adjustments were made to the schedule for weeks after asking.
good,"It's a time consuming job, alot to learn and a lot of hours . Must make numbers, must write people up if not hitting goals. Retail is changing and the company is slow adjusting to the present time"
good,Ok. Born-again management makes working there problematic.
good,This job was extremely convenient while I was in school. The hours were flexible and it was a great working environment.
good,It was my first job. I had it for a few years and then I move out of my parents house and to Colorado
good,"Unload stock put it away, Help customers with any possible need, fold clothes, put them away."
good,"I am a problem solver.  Co-workers quickly turn to me to ask questions, or to share problems they are having with their lives.  I have built a good relationship with the other employees, including the tailors (foreign) in the alteration shop. "
good,good job for highschool and maybe a little after but its not a career path for sure.. its almost impossible to advance and everyone are backstabbers.
good,"It's a fourtune 100 company. It's a great place to work if you like hands on and one on one, face to face interaction with customer. The best part about the job is being a wardrobe consaltant. They also have a great training program, the only downside to the training is. You have to be there at least a year before they send you."
good,"Weddings, Parties, Proms, Homecomings - You get to be a part of the most exciting events in peoples lives. Choosing colors, styles, accessories and who gets to wear what provide daily job satisfaction."
good,"This place always short staffed, employee turnover due to poor management and bad compensation. Always have to train new people that will leave in few months. Sales people are commission based. Rental customers are mad because consultants have to make their living. On top of that, you have to fight tricky consultants that do everything for extra up."
good,Sometimes it seems they make up the rules as they go. Management is not opposed to inconviencing the employee when it’s beneficial to them as in reducing or limiting breaks while extending or adding to the work shift.
good,"Good started job for someone straight out of high school. It is not very stressful, but it can be very annoying with picky customers. It could be fun, but not a desirable job."
good,"Working at Men's Wearhouse was just ok. If you need a job to have a job, I would recommend, The company does not pay their employees fairly, but makes up for it in extra curricular compensations (ie: work parties/functions, ""spirit weeks,"" dress down days, pot lucks, etc). The management culture was almost always full of turmoil and the culture between employees was not always professional and had a lot of drama and immaturity. "
good,"Decent job to start off in but they don't give raises. After an  entire year working there I only got a 10 cent raise, while managers got over 2 dollars raise. Very bad with life/job balance. I was working over 40 hours every week being a part Time worker, and I would get no benefits"
good,"I have been at Men's Wearhouse for two years and it definitely has its perks. The benefits are great, and you have the opportunity to learn a lot about sales and general operational activities. The problem is, they pay low wages and expect you to do a lot without going over hours. The work is not difficult but it is a lot of work for little pay. Recently they fired a bunch of tailors who had been with the company for around 10 years to try some new outside source to complete their alterations because it's apparently cheaper and they also cut all of the store manger's salaries by a decent amount. These are two of many factors that I found to be pretty disheartening because, if they can cut off hardworking people who had been there so long, nobody's job is safe regardless of whether you're doing very well at your job. On top of that, there are a lot of HR issues that in any other normal company would be resolved but here, things that should not be going on in a professional environment continue. There are retail jobs out there with a much better work environment. I recommend to stay away from this place."
good,My store was constantly switching managers. Once my store closed they were unable to relocate the employees. I enjoyed the product and the interactions with wedding customers.
good,"Typical retail schedule, lot of hours but you never have set days off. Expect to be running around looking for things because of unorganization. Co Worker are nice, the hardest part of the job is getting pulled away to do customer service issues. Most enjoyable is getting to know awesome and willing customers."
good,Management is poor. Everyone does what they wants. There is no room for advancement. This job is suitable for a college student looking for a little bit of income. The pay isn't great although my co-workers are nice people.
good,do not want to comment on a typical day at work or what I learned management and my coworkers not going to talk about this employer
good,"No fun place to be. Each week they would cut my hours and made me use vacation time or sick time, just to have my 40 hours. I would stay away from them."
good,"Typical day at work is assisting customers with picking out Tuxedos and assisting in sales for the Wardrobe consultants, There are many managers in the store, whom of most work on commission. The hardest part of the job is when we have no customers in the store, the co workers are hard working and each bring an important aspect to the team. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers pick out a tuxedo for the men who are excited about their formal event."
good,The people I work with are great but the management is not. They are very secretive about things that effect everyone. They give raises but it is once a year and only about 10 cents. They definitely under pay everyone that works there and are unappreciative. It may only be the regional manager that makes working here a pain in the butt so I can not speaking for all Men's Wearhouses.
good,selling suits great place to learn about different types of suits
good,Weekly Pay and flexible schedule.
good,Good health care beneifts. overworked employees that are under paid. management doesn't appreciate stores
good,"not hard, very busy at times, always doing something, fairly easy job. the management was nice and my coworkers were extremely easy and nice to work with"
good,"Workplace culture used to be great... it has declined tremendously in recent years. It didn't matter in the beginning that pay wasn't a lot, because it was such a fun place to work. Then the workload got worse, staffing issues became more frequent, and compensation seemed to go down, raises all but disappeared. The people who work at the stores are wonderful individuals but the overall management of the company has decreased to the point of embarrassment. Once, they took pride in this company, now it is just another average retail joint."
good,"I worked here for a little over a year i started out at being the lowest paid and left being the lowest paid, they even hired people after me with less flexible hours and made higher pay, the big boss picked favorites I wasnt one of them. The work was easy all I did at the end of my shift was either vaccum take trash out or clean mirrors, I also enjoyed fitting people and pick styles out for the rental weddings and proms which is the most stressful season at this job only last a couple of months."
good,"I only work part-time as a customer service representative and was paid by the hour just before prom season.  I was required to do sales and train on all mens suits and clothing but was not allowed to receive commission as the salespeople did. Their computer system was very outdated, complex and confusing.  I had to learn right during a busy season and associates had little patience for training. I was accused of things I didn't do and was not treated with respect by the sales team.  Everyone was fighting for power in management and two employees could do no wrong because their parents worked for the company in upper management.  One was very rude to me and would not stand by my.  I received very little encouragement and was treated like an expendable temp with no value."
good,"Overall, since I have worked at the company, I have seen and heard about the company values falling. Salespeople would just stand around and not help if it's not their sale. Not the best customer experience."
good,Various changes being made within the company that seems transparent and consistent and in the best interest of the employee. Company offers great benefits and fantastic start in the world of retail sales
good,"I was first scouted in 2016 from my old manager ,and regional manager while working for forecer 21  . Men's warehouse has been a good company through out they years as far as it's reputation goes , but like some places higher up management decisions have definitely upseted various amounts of employees,"
good,"The company does not hold people accountable. You literally have to be caught stealing from this company to be fired. As many changes that this company has made to be relevant, they are still a full functioning frat house. This company still needs to make adjustments and make a strong focus on redefining it's culture as it is sorely lacking."
good,Suppose to take turns with customers coming in but some workers didn't do this which meant loss of commission.  The more hours work the better chance of building relationships with customers and have repeat sales.
good,"A typical day at work..... It's a lot of work and very detail-oriented"
good,"This was a great place to work at when I first started. I was growing quickly and I felt I was moving in the right direction. However, the company had  shift and the workplace culture quickly changed."
good,"Typical workday includes answering phones,  solving customer problems, measuring,  restocking, sending and receiving shipments, training...in 10 hours"
good,I worked at Men's Wearhouse for a few months. I did not get training when I started during prom season and was expected to know everything right away.  I taught myself for the most part and learned quickly but not with help from the unprofessional management.
good,"Mens Wearhouse has a very good offering for the customer.  Being a tough fit myself, I have made it my mission to concentrate on not only value but also to a great fit for each and every customer i work with. As a manager, keeping the environment upbeat and friendly has also been very successful"
good,A typical work day included ongoing probles resolution over the phone for store employees and customers. Management was never available to assist with manners in which needed escalation.
good,"No training, no development and no leadership and you needed to make sure you didn't make any waves. They also don't understand the companies they bought they just try to make everything the same and TMW when other companies are not that."
good,"Pick any other region but this one! This market it dry and they have an isolationist approach. Pick California, Seattle, or Nevada. You will thrive in these markets at TMW."
good,"Sadly, Men's Wearhouse promises a lot of things in recruiting and does not keep those promises. Since the ousting of George Zimmer, raises have been non-existent and hours have been cut for each store to the point that hourly employees are constantly anxious about making ends meet. Even if you are an excellent employee with a low rate of absenteeism, you are constantly haunted by having your hours cut down. "
good,"Retail Field: unfortunately there is no raises given I work on a small base with a commission supplement.  It is an easy job and the co-workers are in the same boat, management is pretty standard, and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients fulfill their needs (my personal satisfaction). Free lunch once a month and the most stressful part of the job is enough income.  Great healthcare benefits and I will rate the job 3 out 5!"
good,I liked this job because it was always fun and I enjoyed working with people.
good,"Okay place to work, the financial structure of the company has changed in the past few years and the pay rate has been compromised. The tuxedo rental part of the company is overtaking the retail part and the commission based salary employees are not be compensated for a much bigger work load. I"
good,the company its okay even though alot of people quit almost by the 2 day
good,"My day on this job is every morning my supervisor tells us the daily production and how we are doing. we stretch every morning,after that the day is starting.The people there are ok, some hate to see other co-workers do better than others, but an a way its helps other co-workers work hard thats my mission.The management is ok and i say that because things sometimes to me are not properly handle on the job when it comes to a conflict between two co-workers. my co-workers are ok we dont work as team at times because the conflict of somebody doing better then the other or worst.The hardest part about my job is the heat its very hot where i work but i've learned to keep my self hydrated at work and keep that brisk pace going.the most enjoyable part of my job is the three break I get because they are well needed.I've learned never to trust anybody on the job,I've learned to come to work do my job and leave."
good,pretty easy job and easy going. Sometimes it gets really boring.
good,Great place to make money and network when selling suits. This is where the deal can happen or not if your looking to branch out.
good,"A typical day at work for me is going between inbound and outbound calls as need and I've learned how to manage my time and gotten more familiar with the oracle system, people soft, and outlook , The management is nice there just isn't much room for growth that I can see. The hardest part of my job is when calls come back to back and the most enjoyable is when I can hear the relief in the person's voice because I've solved their problem."
good,It’s good job but getting harder to make a living due to the company pushing online sales. I spend to much time filling online orders with no Commission which is mostly how we get paid.
good,My particular store was the only one in the area so it was very fast paced and busy all the time. Was a nice work environment and the job requirements we’re  not very difficult. If your in school or are looking for a second gig this place is something to keep in mind.
good,Working at this establishment was by no means a bad thing. However it is much more stressful than advertised and corporate will always be corporate. If one can handle customer service and strives in a stress filled environment than this is for you.
good,Could be a good place to work if the manger didn't hate her Job. Over all I think it's the level disrespect they treat there employee with that I hated .. but the co workers were great and pay was ok when there were people there to sell to but most of there buisness comes from rentals not sales
good,Men's Wearhouse has a fun atmosphere as long as your with the right co workers i worked several weekends in a row without a chance of getting a single weekend day off while other workers who did the same job got weekends off consistently which is my reason for leaving it is a great job if you dont mind that part.
good,"In a Typical day I fit people for weddings, help people decide what they are going to wear, book weddings, handle hundreds of dollars in transactions and clean various places inside the building."
good,It has become a place that no longer seems to have it's employees and their well being in mind. The expectations don't match the resources given to accomplish those goals. The incentives and pay do not match the effort that is put in to the daily grind that it requires to accomplish their objectives.
good,"With the ""customer obsessed"" mindset the management forces upon you, prepare to hold the hand of every customer who walks in the door. Sales maximization taken to a whole other level, so if you can sell, you'll do well, but I've seen many mediocre sellers fall behind. It is a very professional work environment, but there is still a lot of room for customer connection and relationship. Overall, as an employee, expect an extreme level of detail to every transaction."
good,"Pay was very erratic due to commission. very cut throat towards sales. They tell you not to ""slam"" the customers, but the only ones who succeed are the ones who are slamming the customers."
good,"The training is sub-par. Unfortunately I did not get the training I needed and was, for lack of better words, thrown under the bus. I was hired on as the Formalwear Manager and I was basically a filler for someone who was a manager at another store. It was a hostile environment and unfortunately I just couldn't take it anymore. Outside of work, everyone was awesome and I was happy to be their friends but inside of work, it was almost like a battle field. I pride myself on being a hard worker and I was told, almost every single day, that I wasn't good at my job, that I was lazy, or that I didn't work as hard as other people. I love the people that I had the opportunity of meeting but I just couldn't stay at a place that was so abusive."
good,"Although my store manager was absolutely wonderful, the ones above her and the regional,  not so much. Too many corporate politics, micromanaging, etc. if it had been for a different company, I would have loved to continue working for my manager"
good,"its a fun field day of customers and meeting dead lines with alteration"
good,A typical retail store. Hours are flexible. As a Customer Service Associate they expect you to do most. You are require to learned the tuxedo rental. Prom season can be overwhelm.
good,"The management at The Men's Warehouse is very geared towards  having ""favorites"". The local area manager had family at different stores located in his area of responsibility, driving sales only for them."
good,"I learned how to multi-task, great customer service, and how to become a great salesman"
good,"Men's wearhouse employs generally fun enjoyable people to work with. They take the time to get to know you as a person and make you feel welcome. However their management style is sloppy and inconsistent. This does not just go for one store, but most of them. The managers are never on the same page even while working in the same location. No one communicates and as a result, it takes on a faulty workplace structure. As a student, I told them before I was hired that there would be specific hours that I would be in class and could not work. I also asked to be a part time employee, so I could still have time to study and do homework even when I'm not in class or work. Both of these statements were ignored. I am constantly scheduled to work hours that I specifically asked not to be scheduled on because I would be at school. Once or twice is forgivable but this has happened too many times."
good,"A typicial day for a CSA was either opening or closing duties, cleaning the store, and helping the sales people with checking out. If it was busy, you would have to sell as well. My manager was very nice and would help you if you had trouble with something, but I am told that's not the case in all Men's Wearhouses. I learned better sells techniques, and how to interact with costmers"
good,"I worked there during the G Zimmer era which was a blast.  Fun work environment.  Middle and Upper Corporate management, at least in the area I worked in was a bit difficult to work with but overall okay."
good,"My work day consisted of making sure alterations were completed on time, opening and closing of the store, balancing the register and sales. Ordering supplies and making sure hours were submitted for payroll."
good,"If youre an CSA , you will be under paid for the work you perform. Any other position are great for the paid.Great discounts for rental and purchasing."
good,"Recently the company has made some poor financial decisions and the staff have had to bear the brunt of that. the insurance benefits that used to be really good have increased in cost and decreased in coverage.Time off has been reduced, and stock options have decreased."
good,"It was a great job for the time I needed it, but over time has proved that it should not be a place to stay for a long time career. The stress becomes overwhelming and even the employees tend to stay at each others throat. There are some great things about the job but  wouldn't recommend working their for more than a year or two."
good,"You meet interesting people, most bosses are reasonable and friendly, but the company is very big on quotas. Cycle-Counting was the best position I had there."
good,"Menswearhouse was a pretty good retailer.Last year the Companie cut people and benefits, that's why working overloaded and tired people are not happy there."
good,"this is a great place to work if oyu have nothing else going on in life, i worked 60-70 hours a week. which i didnt mind cuz the paycheck was nice but i have a family i like to see as well."
good,"Typically you'll find that communication between upper managements and the different stores is terrible. Recently they've been making terrible changes, such as reducing employee benefits, switching to bi-weekly pay, changing the commission structure, without consulting the employees. "
good,Working here was whatever. The manager of my store was a little toxic and corrupt. I'm not about to go on and on to just complain(for lack of an explicit word) about the manager. Fellow employees specifically the other CSAs and Wardrobe Consultants were fun to work with because we were all young men. I felt highly underpaid working here for all that I did.
good,"It has always been a good place to work regarding my school schedule and a good work life balance. There is room for advancement but in my opinion, managers are often underpaid."
good,Mens Wearhouse has slowly become the typical company that seems to look out for their executives financially while we worker bees get the squeeze.
good,"I did enjoy this job; however, it is based on how likable you are and not the effort you put forth. The job did not offer security for my family, but it was nice getting paid weekly."
good,"Great people and a great environment, no matter what career choice outside of the company you decide to do, Men's Wearhouse experience definitely helps out."
good,"The men's wearhouse will always be a great place to work, Your relationship with the customer is out standing I've found my self loved by the customers and Employee's."
good,"good company to work for once you are high up in the company, for people who are on the bottom, its heard to get to the top. managers come and go, you really never know who to report to. they offer good benefit time for employees"
good,"selling mens clothing"
good,I've had lots of fun working at Men's Wearhouse. The job would be amazing if they paid the employees better. I would recommend this to anyone looking to enter in the corporate environment.
good,"An individuals experience working at MW will depend on the management, the store's traffic/volume, and the members of the team. Advancement comes with high sales and statistics."
good,"Demonstrate the ability to drive sales by educating customers about the versatility of a professional image."
good,"As a salesman for Men's Wearhouse I would do everything within my personal ability to dress a man for his best potential to land a job. My skills were meant to help another man land a job he would be best suited for. Explaining the benefits of being properly dressed for the job he was attempting, Even planning out a day to day outfit for a truly professional tasking."
good,"A typical day at this job is greeting customers, assist customers in style choices, informing knowledge to the customer, and organizing.  I learned a lot about the retail business at this job.  The management staff was great and very helpful and took charge when I was working there.  The co-workers work together very well and help one another reach their goals.  The hardest part of this job was trying to fit the right style with a customer who never wore the type of clothing, but then again it was also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work involved constant multi-tasking and re-prioritizing based off of a rapidly changing business climate and shifting needs. The experience helped shape and challenge me personally to be a creator of many things that were absent before my employment. The creation of programs, tools, training, team building, etc. within a fast paced, high stress environment resulted in a demand for timely and decisive decisions and continuous learning from the results of those decisions."
good,"A typical day at my work would be never the same as the last everyday I would be in diffrent work areas full of orders to be done  and cool co-workers a fun day everyday, I learned that working together in a team is learning to depend on your team to accomplish daily goals."
good,"i've been with the company for 3.5 years and i have been in the same position for years. i have been rewarded and gone above and beyond the needs of customers and the mangers. i've asked to for an opportunity to move up i was responded with i need to prove myself first, I ask for a raise i was given 20 cents more, there have been many instances where i seen people steal, lie and sometimes disrespect upper management and move up while i and other people remain at the bottom that is a trend across the company and not in one localized area. i would only recommend this job if you want to get your feet wet into men fashion, in high school, and need a casual job to cure your boredom. otherwise, look elsewhere"
good,A typical day would consist of employee meetings followed by exercising. I learned the procedure of dry cleaning and preparing tuxedos. Management always kept a positive attitude throughout my entire experience.
good,The Men's Wearhouse was a rewarding job with a focus on sales and tuxedo rentals. The schedules are flexible and they offer tuition reimbursement to help employees be able to go to school.
good,Basically lacked a cohesive structure linking all aspects of its operations together during my tenure. That is being devleoped now to various degrees and with questionable results.
good,"A typical day at work consists of a mix of aiding and guiding customers to diverse and unique outfits and clothing to either a specific event, or to complete/update an individuals wardrobe."
good,Men’s Wearhouse has its own mindset for sales. The company provides very greatly product with the help of always having different promotions on items every week.
good,"I worked in The South Windsor location, the people who worked there were nice, management needed some help dealing with the employees though. Not a bad company to work for, have to be sales driven, can be competitive and a bit stressful. But overall not a bad environment."
good,"While with the company I was promoted from sales to management, and had opportunity for growth.  Company went through a transition halfway through my time there, and it was very noticeable, the company shifted dramatically as far as recognition and benefits. For retail overall it was an ok experience"
good,Fun at times but can be stressful. Lot of hours particularly during peak seasons. Commissions can vary greatly based on season. Very open minded company with focus on changing with times and trends.
good,"Overall, working with Men's Wearhouse was a enlightening experience. It involves managing consultants, selling on the floor, doing administrative duties such as payroll, inventory, HR paperwork, etc. I did enjoy but the traveling distance and work hours were not ideal."
good,"Like every job there is good and bad, 4 years i had a lot of both. my time just came, i wasnt  making enough money anymore after graduating college i knew i had better opportunities"
good,Typical day at work is helping customer and putting stock away. I learned better community skill and how to work in a team and sometimes be a team leader. The management is great on some day and then some it is not. You may have to work a double and get no break because management did not schedule someone to work with you. The hardest part of this job is not getting the hour and pay you want and work for. The most enjoyable part of this job is that you meet great people and create a bond with your coworkers that they are like a family to you.
good,Job was good but had a regular employee turned manager who did not know how to manage employees. Company had a lot of activity for employees. Company had no opportunity for higher levels of advancment
good,Good place to learn about retail sales/tailoring in an environment that is both easygoing at times and fast paced at other times.  Only problem is the compensation could be much better.
good,"As a director, you have the latitude to make your department a nurturing environment.  The work comes first but there are occasional  fun gatherings and he agendas are well planned."
good,"Men's Wearhouse is definitely a workplace where you can grow and develop excellent sales methods and tactics, unfortunately for me personally however it was something I just never felt passionate about and therefore couldn't really get behind their mission statement.  I love assisting people and knowing I've had a positive impact, I just wish I could get more out of it.  The work environment wasn't horrible, but at the end of the day it was definitely apparent that for me and everyone else it was just a job.  Working off commission, it can be very stressful.  Outside of work, the people are pretty fun, but during work hours there's definitely drama and tension to make sales."
good,"My job at the Men's Wearhouse was mind numbingly boring. I loved my coworkers, but there is never much business at my store, so a good portion of time is spent twiddling fingers and doing busy work. My management team was understanding and flexible to a young student, but my department supervisor could be a bit passive aggressive when things did not go her way. The hardest part of the job was biting my tongue when a customer was rude, which was often."
good,"As management position our commission brackets are broken down separately "
good,"Can be fun at times. Not enough staff to do what the company requires. Wedding business is stressful. Wages are competitive. Sometimes there is forced overtime. Too much staff turnover including store managers, asst managers and customer service associates."
good,"Men's Wearhouse was a great place to work when I started there, now however the times have changed but the management has not. The clients and products are good but the support from upper management is lacking and they seem to only be focused on how things use to be. They are continually downsizing staffs and adding more tasks for the skeleton crews they leave in the stores."
good,"Workplace culture was good because the company was run like a smaller company where your concerns were heard and addressed."
good,Pay isn't great but environment is. Very busy and often have disgruntled customers. Interesting company and it is easy to climb the ladder. Reasonable hours good for highschoolers.
good,Unless you are a wardrobe consultant this is more of an job than a career. The employees were a pleasure to get to know and connections were made that could be taken outside of MW.
good,"Very nice place, I learned a lot about men's fashion and I developed the skill of selling products. This job also taught me how to speak to customers and develop charismatic traits."
good,"Good place to have a decent pay in a sales environment. Allows for flexibility, but must be as flexible in all range of days. Day can vary from 8-12 hours."
good,"It is only good if your in a prime location, other than that you will be facing off against a very competitive workplace with minimal foot traffic and little opportunity to advance."
good,typical day  taking calls from customers . assisting with any and all issues that they had at the stores. we also assisted the stores with any and all issues they had . your day was very varied and i enjoyed it.my co workers were the best.
good,The thing about Mens Wearhouse that i truely enjoyed was hepling out the customer. Making them feel comfortable and trusting use with the knowledge about what to wear to certain occations.
good,Most things about this company are great. However the management in the superstition springs location in Mesa Arizona is the worst management team I've ever worked with.
good,Great co-workers and employers. Overall a very fun work environment. Had a strong team and solved problems always creating win - win outcomes. High volume store and worked on constant deadlines.
good,As teenager just graduating from highschool I worked at Mens Wearhouse and it was a fun place to work. I got to meet a lot of diffent people and primarily working with opposite gender was interesting.
good,This was a good job to have through school but some stories were poorly managed. It was hard because they were stubborn about working with my school schedule and the turn around for managers was high.
good,"Once the company was basically stolen from the original owner, the culture went down quickly.  Many firings happened. Work was piled on those that worked hard and for those that didn't, they accepted it and made requirements for the hard workers to do enough to cover both. "
good,It was a fun place to work. Management lacks experience. High turnover environment. Great Culture but there has been a downturn since the ousting of Founder and Chairman George Zimmer.
good,"Fun workplace with the co-workers, management depended on where you worked my location was good. I learned how to work in the system oracle, booked weddings, help pick out styles customers would enjoy and color coordination. I also would work with money daily and help with end of day productions. Truthfully the hardest part of the job was using proper verbiage, overcoming objections, and staying within some budgets. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and building a rapport and seeing them every step through their wedding, prom, job interview, etcetera knowing that you helped them along the way."
good,Only about one or two people of your shift are going to be successful that night because there aren't enough customers in the day to make sure everybody is bringing home the money.
good,"Started as a CSA and worked up to Assistant Manager II. The job teaches you very good sales techniques and has everything planned out for you you just have to follow their instructions and you will make money. The amount of work they ask of you just isn't worth the money. You have to be in a busy location. The company has changed a lot since new management and the acquisition of Jos. A. Banks seems to have been a bad idea, but only time will tell. Like I said it is just a lot of responsibility for not as much money as it should be. Holiday party used to be awesome but they have really cut back on out of the store activities."
good,Calm job you dont have to over work your self. You clock in get to your station the people i work with were very easy an hard working people we all came together as a team to get things done
good,Laid back atmosphere and friendly work nature with supporting hands of the company managers one can learn and grow with company.  I highly recommend job seekers who are sincere and serious about thier career to join The Men's Wearhouse
good,Very laid back atmosphere. Not as professional as I would have expected. But enjoyed most associates and the customers.
good,"you would come and start walking around make sure the clothes are not on the floor. I have learned that to don't trust co-workers because they would smile with you give you compliments but we'll talk negative behind you for you not get promoted. The management was decent, the managers were pretty fair. The hardest part was the fact that i would walk in and clocked but I'll get chosen to throw garbage out when the other guys are on their phone. I would look good in a suit everyday."
good,A typical work day consists of checking reports and presenting them to co-workers both written and orally. Checking in stock for the day to watch for loss prevention. Selling product to clients with educational information and assessing the clients need beyond the initial request. Follow up on previous clients is highly important to avoid any customer service issues should they arise later on. Co-workers and management are to co-sell the clients to make sure all needs are fulfilled. The hardest part about the job is calming the upset customer and coming to a happy fixed solution. The most enjoyable part is when you exceed the clients expectations and make him a returning excited client.
good,"The Men's Wearhouse has been an interesting place to work.  I recommend it for anyone in college as they are flexible with the work schedule; however, I do not suggest The Men's Wearhouse as a career choice.  The opportunities for advancement are slim to none."
good,"District managers are needed so that they can lead in return the managers become leaders. hiring from within when you have qualified people should be first. more time to train new hire and current employees, recognizing your superstars often and rewarded them.  regional should come to the store more often my personal review is 3 out of 5"
good,"While working with The Men's Wearhouse, I became a Senior Customer Service Associate primarily performing as a shift supervisor and assistant manager. During a typical day at work, I would manage a team of 1-2 other employees whose primary focus was to assist with customer questions and concerns, as well as sales. While I sincerely approved of the working environment and opportunity for advancement, I was thoroughly appalled with the lack of attention from regional management. Despite widespread sales success and precedented schedule agreements, management failed to honor agreements of assistance in a timely manner. After being offerred promotion within two weeks, it became apparent three months later that no such follow-through was planned. This was despite numerous attempts to contact management, most of which resulted in a false promise to discuss the issue at a later time. Furthermore, my agreed-upon availabilty was consistently violated as I was often required to work during my pre-disclosed class schedule."
good,"*Typical day- Booked weddings, and got ready for prom season."
good,i got a lot of experience dealing with sales a costumers working in retail.
good,"Good place to work and great coworkers. Great benefits. Overall is a good company too work at.  However, management put too much pressure on the employee, making an uncomfortable environment."
good,"Register, measuring customer's for tuxedo's. My favorite part was arrange different shirts and ties for the customer suits. Great work environment. Encourage the customer service associate to grow within the company. A lot of cleaning and rearranging the products."
good,"Concept and multiple unit selling manager. Review paperwork pertaining to receiving, transfers, debit/damages."
good,"Fun work environment, great co workers.Great values and pride in work place. Learned a lot and continue to learn everyday. Hardest part of job is tough customers and trying to accommodate all needs. Also, not a lot of room for growth opportunities. Enjoyed working with great co-workers."
good,"The typical day at work was to organize, audit measurements, help store manager run store, organize store, talk to clients who are thinking renting or buying suit for weddings, call schools for prepping prom, etc. . What I have learned from this job was how to a manager and to develop customer service skills. There were times where some of my co-workers did not understand the meaning of help while many others were very kind and helpful when it came to work overloads. The hardest part about this job was when it came to our clients and trying to calm them down. In addition, making sure we meet our numbers for the months in the tux department since so very few came threw our doors.Through there maybe more difficult things to say about this job, the most enjoyable part about this job was having fun with the clients that wanted to make prepping their wedding an enjoyable experience."
good,"Learning about the different tuxedos and the differents styles of vest, also learning different ways to get to know the customers by watching my mangement team some of the best sales associates i've ever met. Getting the customer to open up to me about the different things and themes that they wanting going on in their wedding gave me a better understanding of which styles should be chose for their wedding tuxedos. The hardesr part was becoming a people person and wanting to get to know the different things going on in the customers wedding."
good,I worked at two different locations and a lot of the work experience depends on the people you work with.  It's retail salses and not for everyone.
good,"Helping customers, team meetings, help with inventory. Don't remember to much but helping customers with their weddings"
good,Very busy workplace.
good,"Didn't really see myself moving up in the company, career path was next to none, and based on seniority. Was a nice job for clothes, definitely got you in tune with the latest business fashion trends."
good,This job is laid back and easy going as long as you know what you are doing. It is a great place to work and the people you work with will provide you life with diversity. I enjoyed the customer relations aspect of the job more than anything. Enteracting with various people throughout the day really provided for an interesting day at work.
good,It was fun an challenging always something new. Fat wire CMS support. Unix admin
good,"Michigan Ave location was awesome and customer traffic was consistent Tuesday-Sunday. Teammates lacked integrity and accountability was a big issue."
good,It's been a while since I have worked for the mens wearhouse the most I can say is at the time staff was great over time it could of been better if the took into what the employee wanted as well
good,"Always new learning experiences. Work place culture can be fun if you do the work that is described and learn to manage your responsibilities and time. Management can be helpful, but they prioritize the store needs. Hours are usually late. Weekends and Evenings are majority of the hours needed, so not family friendly."
good,Men's Wearhouse will challenge you to be a better sales associate focusing on process selling.  A candidate will develop new skills and utilize training to drive their personal business.
good,I liked my co-workers but they were not professional. The manager didn't seem to care about helping me. It isn't just at the store i worked at. There are a lot of Mens Wearhouse stores with bad management.
good,Starting pay is better than some but raises don't even cover cost of living.  15 cent is not a reasonable raise for the amount of work and risk drivers take and insult better off not offering a raise
good,"Low pay, but good perks. Don't plan to stay there long if you can help it. meet good people everyday. able to learn a lot about men fashion. perfect for a stylist"
good,"Work long hours in peak season, I worked as temp so the pay wasn’t that good, there were a lot of times when work was slow so you would get sent home early"
good,I really like working at Men's Wearhouse for the fact that my co-workers and the Store Manager are amazing! I like the environment that they provide and them taking care of me while I am pregnant.
good,It's a demanding retail job. They struggle to staff and be flexible with hard working employees. It's used to be a family environment but not it seems like nothing of the sort. High demand retail jobs are stressful and tiring.
good,Advancement is rare. Management of Store Managers and beyond could be greatly improved. Positional expectations are oddly balanced between positions. Benefits are fantastic. Mens Wearhouse offers Dental plans and other benefits. Computers and system could be extensively improved. Compensation for amount of work done could be improved as well.
good,"As long as they are busy you can have a nice check. You really don't have a set time to come in and I love that. Every year that goes by, work gets slower."
good,They care more about sales then the conduct at work. They would rather have great salesmen than the best manager. Easiest part of the job is just doing the overall work. Training is simple and easy to understand. Promotions and demotions happen fast due to number oriented job. Meet your goals you get promoted don't meet your goals get demoted. No further training. Dog eat dog type of job.
good,"Ability to sit and work at a computer keyboard for extended periods of time"
good,Working in men's Warehouse was challenging bacause it's seasonal so it gets very busy but that gave me the chance to build skills with time management.
good,There is a lot of engagement from management on down the line or chain of command. Lots of involvement. You are acknowledged (MOST times) for your hard work and accomplishments.
good,"Summer time is slow, and it is difficult to make sales when only a handful of customers come in.  The initial training was thorough, and there appears to be sufficient potential when business picks up."
good,The workplace culture has went down tremendously. The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. I have learned alot about Men Clothing and customs suits.
good,come to work clock in start picking items loading items on pallets wrapping them to be sent off sorting products scanning products as well break was 30 minutes
good,"Fast paced, and competitive at times. Friendly and flexible, slow during winter months. Great culture for selling and networking. Great discounts. Enjoy the clothing"
good,"Good place to be but advancement beyond store management is limited. It  gives you the fundamentals of leadership ad accountability, and professionalism."
good,Absolutely team work  good staffing  and very nice products  for customers who order off they website  I really enjoy working with this company I would most definitely recommend others to filled off for a position for Men's Warehouse and give them a good rate and complement
good,"I enjoyed working there. Its clean and the team treat you well.no complaints ..."
good,"Always busy stocking and selling inventory. not the best management , but there is room to advance. team lunches ever week. fun co workers and a good time. Strict schedule not very flexible."
good,"The day usually begins with with us receiving more stock. Every team member participates in scanning the merchandise in and putting it away. The environment is fair when selling. We have selling rotation that allows everyone a fair chance to sell. During down times we all help organize and clean the store. This makes everyone job easier. Many people have been with the company for many years. It is easy to make friends with colleages. Men's Warhorse has a selling process that is different from any other clothing company I have worked for and it works well. Men's Warhorse can also experience some harsh down times where the opportunity to make money is minimal. However, when traffic is high, Men's Wearhouse's commission tier allows for you to make more money depending on what items you sell."
good,it was a good job. very easy. Boss just didn't schedule me the hours i told him i was available. other than that he was a very nice man. everyone was pretty friendly.
good,On a typical day The mens warehouse is slow. I learned that measuring customers for tuxedos and suits are very important and can make or break your clientele.
good,"I enjoyed working at men's warehouse because the staff were always so helpful , They trained me and i learned so fast . The supervisors were the best ."
good,"I learned a lot about sales working for Men's Wearhouse, which was nice because it helped me with my future of sales. I also got some beautiful suits out of the deal!"
good,"Was a good place to work, especially for a first job. Helped me to develop personal skills and learn how to sell product to others. Retail is not for me, but would recommend to anyone specifically seeking employment in that industry."
good,"I was just so happy to have a job I allowed this company to abuse me, make me commute very long distances, not pay me enough for living standards, and I just stayed there because I was comfortable with a paycheck every week, even though it was very small."
good,I've learned a lot about professional clothing. Gives a good understanding of tuxedo rentals and suit measurements. work hours was pretty flexible and the over all job was really easy going with a great atmosphere
good,Good work/ life balance; friendly coworkers; lot of opportunities to grow; Get to wear multiple hats a lot of times which helped me grow; decent benefits but can be better.
good,"used to be a lot better than it is now.  wouldn't recommend as a great place to work at anymore, not like it used to be, learned a lot and would recommend the training."
good,Excellent Company but has change due new ownership does not provide the same service it did in years past. Men's Wearhouse was a employee and customer service base company in the past now it only cares about sales and numbers
good,I felt that I was not given proper training at this position. The management was very relaxed and often not present but my overall experience was very slow paced but hectic on few days when I was required to perform tasks I was not familiar with.
good,"New experience, learned a lot during my time. I was currently still in high school at the time and wanted to enjoy my senior year of high school and I could not do it while working. I did not want to miss any of my senior year events."
good,"Helping out organize and setup store. Along with helping customers find what they are looking for."
good,Been here for several years but for my position just fell as though I am doing more work than a store manager or assistant manager but not getting paid anywhere near what they are.
good,"Typical retail job, management quality varies, decent benefits but not very good pay. You will measure men of varying ages from their neck to their outseam to fit them for suits, tuxedos, dress shirts, slacks, casual clothes, etc. as well as packing and shipping out online orders, shipping and receiving inventory, and keeping the store clean."
good,Lots of resources were taken away from employees because upper management  made poor business decisions. They also push their managers way too hard. Our manager barely had time to sell because he was to busy with whatever meeting or training corporate had for him. He often expressed his frustration with this. When your manager isn't given a chance to manage his store we all suffer.
good,cool place to work. easy to clean up. the managers were really nice. tuxedo rentals sucked to take care of. i hated the seamstress. i hate you.............
good,"a typical day was a day of luck, sometimes you get get clients other days no business . which meant no checks. management was cut throat because they also was on comission"
good,Competitive pay and benefits package offered. Excellent place to build your skills and use as stepping stone to the next level. Great advancement opportunities.
good,"Very high standards as far as attendance and stats for calls, they are always listening to calls and have strict scripts for you to follow. You have coaching sessions every week and your scores reflect on your coach,I guess they get heat from upper management so if your scores arent up to par they will throw you under the bus and say you just arent listening to critiques and leave you out to dry. When any call can take a turn if you have an unstable, indecisive or angry customer. They have a habit of micromanaging, Calling you to the back conference room in front of everyone for every little thing. I truly believe its an embarrassment ritual.Once there was an email sent to all coaches about me eating a doughnut at my desk for breakfast which stated that it was discussed and if I did it again would be written up. Which was very unnecessary to me. Dress code is enforced on some but not all. All coaches do is talk about the agents and avoid escalations ( situations where a customer demands to talk to upper management). Was called in office and questioned like a child about why I had to call off last minute. What shift you get depends on your scores.They throw you in call ques that you weren't trained for then reprimand you when the call is not executed to their liking. Now dont get me wrong the benefits were great, they buy lunch for the office occasionally and have appreciation week and give out ice cream and things like that, but some of that appreciation should be showed when employees have certain situations where they cant come to work or just dealing with a very difficult"
good,I didn't pike my experience there. The people where not doing there assignment.. I was mostly doing all of the work by myself.. but I hung in there... I probably wouldn't go back
good,Awesome way to build people skills. If you enjoy classic fashion and social environments the The Men's Wearhouse is definitely a great place to work. Sales is always a tough environment but with hard work and continued growth it can be very rewarding.
good,have to be competitive or else sales will be taken away from you and you will not get paid a decent amount in your paycheck is you do not sales. the hourly salary ain't that good because of the commission they usually give which isn't that greta either
good,"A fun pace to work, fast pace and competitive.  With better management the place would do better business.  Good benefits and great discounts. fashionable and trendy."
good,overall a good company to work for. can be stressful at times when there is not enough help on the floor. i would take my husband to shop there again.
good,"Learning men's fashion was interesting"
good,"Men's Wearhouse is a decent company to work for, but lacks the opportunity for advancement and the pay is less than desirable.The best thing about the company is the employee discount, but even that can be overshadowed when you feel you aren't appreciated."
good,"Mangament is friendly "
good,"Expect to be underpaid. The job however is easy, very easy. You can get away with a lot in a very relaxed environment. Upper management only cares about dollars."
good,"Working there I learned a lot about mens clothing and enjoyed interacting with all types of costumers to book their weddings , add them t wedding parties and book sweet sixteens . The work balance was perfect and I was allowed to go to school and they were able to work with my scheduel . However, the employees  were very unprofessional , they would talk about you behind your back and they were very clicky ."
good,i loved the environment and my mangers . its a fun place to work there but they don't pay well and long hours . i love spending Christmas time with this company they do good parties.
good,I enjoyed working at Mens Wearhouse because we had a very productive team and a relaxed environment where we could joke and talk.I recieved an award while employed there for Excellent Customer Service and was promoted to SR.Customer Service Associate.
good,"Good job overall, very good environment and great co workers. The benefits were not that great for health but for vision and dental they were superb. Plenty of opportunity to move up in the company."
good,The job was fun and busy always so time went my quickly the manager was very friendly and nice it was a good after school job but it didn't end up fitting my schedule
good,"Great company to work for, Fast to slow paced work depending on days, decent management,work culture is stressful, most enjoyable part is customer service, Hardest is work more for a pay cut."
good,"Each day that I was scheduled was full with duties and responsibilities. I enjoyed the staff and the management that I worked with. What I learned was, how to effectively showcase products to consumers and manage my time wisely when balancing home and work life."
good,The upper management staff is who you have to worry about with this company. Inside to stores the staff is great. As long as the right people are in place you will love coming to work.
good,sell suits and other clothing merchandise to customer. create a fun place for employees and customers. increase styles for potential customers
good,This company cares for their employees and makes the work environment fun and enjoyable. The manager was very helpful and was always encouraging you to learn more. The hardest part was trying to figure out what each individual was looking for when they came into the store.
good,"Having watched the company drastically change some of it's core beliefs over the last few years, once consistently on the Forbes top 100 companies to work. Those days are leaving us behind for. Shifting away from a rich corporate culture of the past, we are now just becoming expendable assets. Only as good as our previous months sales numbers and stats."
good,Men's Wearhouse is constantly evolving to keep pace with retail trends. They want to deliver a good value to their customers.
good,"For a start, you will be  groom to work better, prepared someone for good exposure both social and adding value to life experience"
good,They provide a lot of training. They are very good at communicating through emails. They are constantly looking at ways to make the company more profitable.
good,"It's alright, not my cup of tea because suits don't interest me. But for someone that does, this is the job for them. I will admit it's a bit fun helping match up suits."
good,Love them free and the activities and things this company has to offer great manager meeting once a year big gala longevity people been there in 20 years
good,So long ago as this was a stepping stone to my future endeavors. Things have drastically changed in my lie when I left the Mens Wearhouse.
good,The Men's Wearhouse is a goal oriented company that focuses mostly on sales goals and customer service. Upbeat sales staff and fun loving corporate culture.
good,"Responsibilities include: Measuring and fitting for rentals/sale, customer service, store cleanliness, knowledge of product and customer service issue resolution."
good,"Men's Wearhouse is a great company to work for. My last position with them was an Assistant Formalwear Manager in our Auburn, WA location. The staff there was great, highly knowledgeable, very personable, and willing to work with any sort of scheduling issues. Our management, both store-level and upper-level, in that area were excellent. The best part of my job there was seeing proud parents and happy couples show me pictures of the outfits that we selected for their events."
good,"I've been at MW for 6 years, and I've never forgotten the words I was told my first day by one of the best salesmen: ""If this job teaches you anything, it's to stay in school."" The company has a knack for sucking people away from school by offering a decent pay jump for people with the slightest amount of drive by making them salesmen. Sure, there have been guys who earn $50,000/year doing it, but they're usually the guys who are at the best stores and have been in sales for 20 years. You can make a decent buck working here, but ultimately, unless you want a career in selling men's clothing, get out as quickly as you can. The corporate culture has definitely gone downhill, everyone except Store and Regional managers are underpaid, and it's (usually) a fairly sexist environment."
good,"This job came with good training on how to sell. Overall was generally a fun job, great for networking. There were often lulls depending on the season which made it hard on commission. Co-workers are awesome, Management was ok."
good,"My supervisors are friendly and helpful. However, the company is not exactly reliable as they do not offer permanent positions right away. The pay do not match with other companies because similar companies pay their employees more than minimum wage."
good,Students get flexible hours however during peak times like prom and wedding season it can get pretty hectic. Nice place to start.
good,Management could've been more understanding and flexible with employees. Store manager couldn't relate to life events. backbiting and strife were a problem. He was not forthcoming with intentions and ruined possible advancement for personal gain.
good,It is a great job for college kids. Opportunity to make serious money is there if you work in a busy location. If not find another job.
good,"Great people to work with, upper management wasn't as involved and helpful as they should be.  For the first 6 years with the company it was an amazing place to work, after the CEO change the culture suffered tremendously."
good,"good job for starting out have to be a people person, just be prepared to give up your life. NO WEEKENDS OFF.  I had typed more and more in detail however after spending about ten minutes typing and submitting this site erased all my progress"
good,Lack of management makes this place an average working place. Work environment was little unprofessional. Growth opportunities in this company were almost none.
good,Not very willing to accommodate my hours while I was in school. Worked as a cashier and coordinated wedding party dress.
good,"Fun, energetic co-workers, easy going compassionate managers, everyone does everything. Must be able to work flexible schedule."
good,"Most of the workers that worked there are apart of the same family or friends of that family. This lead to favoritism and things being unfair. The 'outsiders' worked hard and the family members took advantage of them. If there was an issue, one could not simply go to the manager because you did not want to offend him/her and/or you didn't feel comfortable discussing because you knew it would get out (gossip) No one works as a team so the store is never on the same page."
good,"I feel as though there is special treatment for certain people.  Not all people are treated the same.  I was used to hours where I went in early, spent too many nights working and away from my family.  The balance between work and personal was not the best."
good,"- Assisting Customers"
good,"Working at The Men's Wearhouse for over three years has given me unparalleled experience not only in customer service, but in time management, employee management, file and data maintenance, and also a great knowledge of men's clothing and the industry. While the level of camaraderie between everyone in the company and different stores is a major perk to the position, my goal is to take my experience gained at TMW and apply it to a new position and work environment. As an Operations Manager, my daily duties range, everything from file maintenance of our already booked weddings and rental customers, to calling leads of new weddings that haven't booked with us yet, to maintaining employee relations and team training. While this is a retail position and I do walk around quite a bit on busy days, as the Ops I spend a good chunk of my time behind my desk, on the phone with customers, on the computer doing things like making GAP analysis reports and monitoring stats of the rentals we book and increasing company sales and volume. One con to working at TMW is the irregular, long hours each day because we're a retail store, and I'm also trying to lean away from the customer service field a little. I'm almost finished with my Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts (from NHTI in Concord, I graduate in August) and I'm excited to continue my education to become and educator as well, but I need a job that's easier to maintain whilst in school."
good,As wardrobe consultant you responsible for making sure the customer have wonderful experience while shopping with you peak interests for customers what's their style
good,"During my shift I would have to sort through clothing,shoes, and inspect them. I learned how to work under pressure due to the demands of quotas. Professionalism was kept between myself and management along with employers. The hardest part of the job was waking up extremely early to get overtime hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different co-workers."
good,"I've learned a lot about sales and the psychology behind it.  The hardest part about the job is working for a corporation, being only a seed in operations.  The best thing about working here was the amazing clients you get to meet and know."
good,"As an employee, shopping is great!  The hours are long. I enjoyed my employees because they had excellent personalities."
good,My typical work day is a 10 to 12 hour day to accomplish the daily management duties.  I have learned to serve customer and help them  with personal retail needs at any given time on short term or future events. My co-workers are all team players and very much enjoy working with me. The hardest part of my job is when I am unable to meet all my customers and employee needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is to give World Class Customer Service to every customer that comes into my store and making sure all my employees are happy and enjoying being a team player  when they come to work.
good,Other depts. put outfits together and ship them over to the shipping dept. In the shipping dept we stock them on the floor and wait to ship them out. When time comes to ship the out to the stores we load them on box trucks and send them to the proper stores
good,"I've been with the company for over 3 years now, and its a great job to have while you're in college. Flexible hours, and works with your school schedule, but thats about it. It used to be better, ever since they fired George things are getting bad. They care less about employees and wages are dropping by the year. Management is horrible. Most of those in management have little to no education, and very little knowledge about laws and regulations."
good,"independent job, get to meet new people, great work environment, scenery always changing"
good,"Good place to work. Good people, good benefits, pay could be a little better. Enjoy working with new people & dressing them up nice for a special event."
good,Good company with great corporate culture. Fun employees and great customers most of the time.
good,"Went from hourly to commission based, with no advanced warning and no other options. It's a take it or leave it kind of place."
good,"fun christmas parties, great employee plans for employee purchases."
good,I helped consult and dress customers who were looking for suits and other fashionable professonial attire.  I also measured people for suit purchases and tuxedu rentals.
good,"I enjoy what I do in many facets, however the only real drawback is working many nights and weekends."
good,Good people.I learned a lot. I worked with a great group of people.
good,"Schedule was very hard and rough "
good,"A typical day consists of running reports, dealing with samples, communicating with vendors, etc."
good,"Most of my co-workers were pleasant to work with.  Dealt with many issues (tailor shop, customer dissatisfaction, schedule, employee complaints) on a daily basis. Upper management only looked at sales results to evaluate employees and rarely took other strengths into consideration.  Which led to a breeding ground for a stat driven, cheating, unhappy work environment.  For someone who takes customer service and creating a positive work atmosphere very seriously, this was not a good match."
good,The best part of the job is the employees without them work would have been very redundant. I learned a lot working for this company the training they give you is second to none.
good,Mens Wearhouse is a good company to work for.  They believe in enjoying your job and looking forward to coming to work.  Their customer service is unmatched in the market.  They do what it takes to please their customers and their employees.
good,"Helping customers with tuxedos rentals or suit selections"
good,"I think the summary says it all. I love the company and almost everyone I have worked with. Just the upper management are, to put it nicely, kind of dumb. You inform them of problems that are happening within a store and that at end of year there could be problems because of them. They get ignored and nothing done about them, then at end of year the entire management team gets demoted because of the problems to tried to let them know about for 6 months."
good,Worked in an assembly line with co- workers. Shinning shoes and deodorizing them.
good,You have to stand in one spot for 8 hours constantly doing overhead work. The managers expect you to work at an insane pace.
good,"The Men's Wearhouse is a good company to launch career. Company Founder laid the foundation for the culture which dictates it business operations throughout all facets from stores, to back office to distribution centers."
good,"Open store, work with customers."
good,I work very difficult hrs
good,it was awhile ago I worked there ...but from what I remember it was cool
good,I learned alot working at that store and had a pretty good work environment that helped me grow as an employee and person.
good,"Just under two years work experience as a part time Customer Sales Associate. A typical day of work included, cleaning and maintaining the tuxedo rental station, opening and putting up retail stock, Helping clients pick out tuxedos for their wedding parties/events, getting clients sized and fitted for tuxedo rentals, assisting Wardrobe Consultants on suit and retail sales. I learned a lot about building and managing clientele specifically in the tuxedo rental division of the store. In addition I was further trained in customer service and managing and solving customer issues. The Management seemed divided at many times, with many differing opinions about the direction and upkeep of the store. Over the course of my employment, there seemed to be many differing opinions between management. Resulting in a sometimes divided work team. That being said, the general moral between the sales people and management was usually good. It was very easy to maintain friendly and professional relationships with the other sales people in the store. The team oriented philosophy at the Men's Wearhouse made operating with all coworkers very stress free. Good communication between coworkers allowed for a very cooperative and organized work environment, where everyone is trained to help one another on all aspects of the job. The hardest parts of the job occurred around late April, and May when the tuxedo rentals boomed for prom and wedding season. In addition to taking and entering tuxedo measurements, Customer Sales Associates are also designated to help the Wardrobe Consultants make sales. This"
good,It was very rewarding to help organize events for couples' special days. At times the work load was heavy depending on the season. Management was great and so were my co workers.
good,"My typical day at work is not challenging and it's very relaxed. My co-workers are all very nice and easy going. I've learned all the aspects of reports, orders and opertaions and I've realized there is no room for advancement with this company. I enjoy working here but would enjoy working better at a place where I can develop my management skills and advance within the company."
good,"A typical day at work would involve processing shipment, general house keeping, customer service and sales."
good,You get busy at work only by seasons. Shifts for people who is not in the management team are only nights.
good,benefits are good. fast paced environment with irregular hours.
good,You'll learn a lot about how retail sales work. The staff is supportive and they are required to assist with sales. During most holidays the store will be in operation. Unless you have vacation.. Don't plan to be off for the holidays.
good,Working with the public is something I enjoy very much and working retail massage me feel useful to others. So hopefully in the next career path I will work with the public again
good,"The job is not hard at all you just have to be prepared to work, you will have to work all areas of the store from rental to selling floor. Depending on your manager it can be very enjoyable depending on your job title it can be very demanding."
good,"Every Tuesday, I arrive to the store before it opens to take in and send out the store products for the week. Working a day a week allows me to stay in the company and increase my hours in the summer if I choose to. The District Manager is a flexible and hard working man but the company and industry has changed drastically over the last four years. Consumers are making more purchases online, thus taking away the need for employees in the stores. This has also led to multiple company cutbacks within the store level. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers and gaining their trust for important events in their lives. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the daily changes the industry and the company have."
good,"My past coworkers were amazing, but that’s about as far as I would go. I am not a fan of a ever-changing schedule and not having steady days off. I would like to work each and every week the same times, so I can make plans. Don’t expect that here."
good,The people who work at the stores are great people. Just the higher ups just don't care about the people at the lower end and just drag us through the dirt and hope we stay.
good,Working at men’s warehouse is actually a very nice environment. Comfortable to work for students or parents due to the off days you’re allowed. It is challenging to learn all the new types of work but very easy to catch on to.
good,"It was a good job to start off with, but the hours weren't flexible at one point and they do not fairly compensate for doing a good job. I learned a lot about customer service at this job."
good,"I worked for Men's Wearhouse under both George Zimmer and Tailored Brands, and I am disappointed in the direction the company has gone without the company's founder.  I would have rated them higher overall previously rather than recently."
good,"I loved so many things about my experience with this company, Mostly it was my direct manger the store manager who impacted me the most at this company. She was caring, open to new ideas and not a micro manager. There were also so many negatives, but I will always remember my positive experiences."
good,Some days were better than most. Dependent on how the numbers were going with the company. The worst part of the job was being able to get part time hours regularly. Tuxedo department was under staffed.
good,Customers come in with the intent buy or rent. Rentals are the fun part.  Work environment could be much more positive and the team should really become that...a team.
good,I started on the phone they went into online chats.  My job was to take 3 chats at a time ranging from fixing a wedding a group to help the average person to pick out the best tie to go with there shirt.
good,"A typical day at work, i would come in and assist anybody that needed assisting. If the store was slow then we would work on shipment and organizing the store."
good,"Fast-paced, good learning experience, overall good atmosphere."
good,"Go in and are expected to work."
good,Mens wearhouse is a great start to any career in menswear. The custom suit program and the suit knowledge is a great way for anybody wanting a novice start in the mens fashion world. There training program for there employees is fantastic!
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customer acknowledges how you went the extra mile to satisfy them.  I enjoy how much appreciation you receive for taking care of them.
good,"Un ambiente de trabajo divertido, entusiasmante.  Contenia un equipo fuerte y ambicioso."
good,"I started my day my counting my register and making daily cash deposits. Then I had to count inventory everyday before the store was open. Once the store was open, it was then time to wait for the customers to come in about their exciting news. Most people were getting married and needed to rent or buy tuxedos or suits. This was the exciting part. I was able to help customers complete their ideal look for a very special day in their lives. The complicated part was making sure everything went smooth for the customers."
good,Our company use to be so wonderful about raises and rewarding hard work. Now you could give your life away for this company and they will never give you a proper raise they act like a .35$ raise is a big deal
good,"The work days vary depending on the volume of calls from our store's and what issues may come up. In this new department, I've learned to a lot more about time management in order to make sure I get back to everyone as quickly as possible. "
good,One of the company's focuses on is making sure you know how to sell. Whether you are part of a sales team or just a customer service associate. Everyone should contribute to the company's bottom line. The management however gets so caught up on selling that sometimes they forget how to contribute to their team.
good,Good place to work. Currently undergoing changes that make it difficult to stick around. Retail is changing and they are trying to catch up. Management can be frustrating to deal with but otherwise fun to work there
good,the suit business is pretty laid back since it's not a necessity. The tuxedo rental operations are flawed and disappointing. Management can either car too much or not enough.
good,"Currently I find myself in a situation where it is hard for my ideas to be found and I find few situations where I am given a job I feel is improving the company when business is slow. I do not see very many opportunities to move very far even for the employees that have been there longer than any others I know. The store manager tends to have a very ""X"" style management. The most enjoyable part of this job would be helping and interacting with the customers. I personally enjoy helping customers resolve problems no matter their attitude after being in this position. What I found to be the hardest part of this job was doing the same things over and over again while waiting for business, organizing the merchandise and etc. I believe that in order to have business you have to obtain it, and go create it, which I do not see happening on a store-wide level as we make the area clean while potential customers are around."
good,"I started on as a full time CSA; loved the people I worked  with and my manager, for the time being.  The manager at the time had relocated from Oregon and come to find out he hated being in Alaska so therefore he wasn't that great to work with or for.  He was horrible at communication, he would change the schedule after it had already been posted and not tell anyone, constantly taking sales from Wardrobe Consultants.  I'm back now, part time and absolutely love it.  The Men's Wearhouse is an awesome laid back place if you have the right management and co-workers."
good,It was a relaxing place to work with good people. The pace was a little slow for me but I learned a great deal about retail business including inventory and the hierarchy of larger companies. Hardest part of the job was doing the bridal shows because there are 600+ brides and not much time so I had to learn to condense my pitch. The best part of the job was their willingness to work with my schedule when I was dealing with medical issues that prevented me from driving.
good,"The company doesn't care for their employees customer's receive better treatment  and discounts than the employees. "
good,"Upper management is intimately involved with store level employees. There is constant motivation to always improve on ourselves and be the best we can be. We are provided multiple tools to help us be successful and to build outlasting relationships with our customers. We are not salesmen, we are consultants who can provide professional advice for all Men's formal or dress wear for any occasion."
good,"Nice staff. Wonderful customers. Great place to learn new things and apply it on a daily basis. Not too much to say about this job but all in all, a great place to work."
good,Job is very easy and sometimes fun. Helping people with their weddings and other parties is rewarding. Only down side is the company does not give raises or move people up. You can stay a CSA for years and still get paid $9/hr.
good,All about numbers and sales. We all did everything when it came to the tasks of the store. We all did sales and tuxedo rental. With tuxedo rentals that included discussing all options with customer. measuring customer for tuxedo as well as entering all of their information into the system.
good,"Fun place to work as long as you have fun coworkers. you do inventory everyday, and get at least one customer per day. Managers are usually cool. Always something to do so time goes by fast."
good,Over all it was an ok job. If you are ok making not a lot of  money never seeing your family working every holiday and only having a revolving door of school aged part timers who don't care. I would not suggest working their unless you have no other option.
good,Great place to work. but they are retail hours. Management was overall considerate of you as person. I would def recommend Men's Wearhouse for others.
good,"Worked my way up from a customer service associate within three years. Gained many skills, especially customer service skills that will help me in the future. Good job for students in college. Very flexible with schedule."
good,"Co-Workers form very close bonds, though often cliques form as well. Fun job with a lot of down time in the slow season. Tuxedo customers extremely demanding. Management overall shows lack of control. Operations Managers basically run the store, while store managers reap the benefits. Serious lack of training for new hires and promotions. Was a wonderful company to work for with a great atmosphere when George was still the CEO; Current CEO Doug is disconnected from his workforce. Would recommend this job for any entry level sales associates; You can only make a decent living with this company as a sustainable career as upper management or a wardrobe consultant in  a high volume store."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Fairly low pay compared to other retail jobs I have had but overall, this is a nice place to go every day."
good,The job was fun but as far as pay and advancement it was like pulling teeth
good,"The thing I love most about my job is building a trusting relationship with my clients and knowing that I helped with one of the most special days in their new lives together. "
good,"Mens Wearhouse is a good company to work for. The company is really good to the employees and try to make the work place fun and professional. Retail is for certain people, either you love it or you hate it. I loved it, I've been there for 8 years. I know am starting a family and want to move onto a job that does not require me to work nights and weekends."
good,I liked the job for the most part. If you are a people person i would not recommend but if you like staying to yourself and getting your work done by numbers its for you.
good,"Men's Wearhouse has a great community to work for however, there is very little to no training. My boss told me I was doing too good and then scolded me."
good,They was ok they breaks was to short and the pay check was ok and injustbhatebwhen people use to starl out my lunch  box and nothing was doing about  need more effort  in the rules
good,"Repetitive boring work. I have been in laundry for 6 months really didn't expect to be ironing suit jackets all day. Some scrub shoes all day. I have also bagged 2,000 dress shirts a day. A job like this really has you in your mind all day, not to many folks speak English so unless you speak Spanish or Hindu good luck having a conversation with anyone."
good,It used to be a great place to work when I first started with the company. It went south pretty quick. They tend to ask too much of their employees for their time in any given work day. Its a failing company that's trying to keep its head above water. if you look at their stock from 2015 to 2019 there is a reason as to why it has decreased at the rate that it has. They claim to care about their employees but in all reality it is their last concern in 2019. things have taken a negative turn and have affected employees salaries and have gone so far to the point where the company is running a test on particular stores and is decreasing pricing by almost half on all products. they plan to roll this out within the next year or so. a company doesn't do that unless its getting ready to walk the plank. its one last hail mary to see if they can make the company last.
good,"Working at Men's Wearhouse was great in the sense that I was making good money as a 19 year old, however the management at both of the stores I worked at gave me 39 hours a week when I specifically told them from the beginning that I wanted part time 3 - 4 days a week."
good,"Men’s wearhouse is overall a good company to work for, if you can hustle and make sales you’ll do just fine. Management is underpaid, I made more as a salesmen than as a manager."
good,"This is the most laid back job I've had, but the customers can be very rude. Management at the store level is great, but corporate changes rules frequently and aren't as friendly."
good,"My day typically included servicing customers and performing daily store tasks. Customers may need help with finding  suit for  job interview, or I may have a couple that needs to set up a suit rental reservation for a wedding party."
good,Work was easy and management was always available to help and answer questions. Easy work environment to be in along with all the coworkers. Days off were easy to come by.
good,Higher management requires you to do work outside your pay grade and not compensated fairly. Employees in the stores were great. Everyone was friendly. The main issue is with regional management and above.
good,a typical day at work consists of selling to customers who walk through the door. in down time we are doing training. I would usually show up around 9 am to have the store ready to open by 10 am. I would usually work until 6 pm or 9 pm. the environment is family like and fun at times. the funnest part is the interactions between staff members. the hardest part of the job is the work/life balance. i learned how to manage in the moment and do constant training.
good,it was a learning experience work with a fun group of people who loved what they do and where ready to teach me prom season is a crazy one but our managers find great ways to make everything move smoothly
good,"The pay is not worth it especially if you have bills, they don’t like to give anyone raises. During prom season is the worst especially the prom moms."
good,"There seemed to be an glass ceiling once you get to a certain point. Accolades were just words and never any actions. Then even when you were the best in a area, you would not get any recognition."
good,Working clerical was a great experience while I was still in high school. Taught me for my future work history for any future employments. Managment were great role models and took me under their wings to train me to be the best employee for any future employments.
good,"The fast pace of retail sales was exciting and challenging. Keeping true to the team selling process and getting others to commit to the process was always the best way to achieve consistent quality results."
good,"I enjoyed working at Men's Wearhouse and was saddened when I had to relocate due to high rent prices. If I could have stayed longer, I would have. They offer decent benefits, particularly for a company with over 1,000 locations. The management listens to any concerns an employee may have, and you always feel welcomed and included."
good,"Good fun flexible company with good benefits. Good management, fun working environment,  Good understanding with employees about needing schedule adjustments and working to fix schedules as needed."
good,People always arguing for sales and talking behind people's backs management cutting hours no benefits and low pay discounts dropping lower and lower not enough workers
good,Its hard to do as well as one would like to unless you are at a flagship store. The management took a long time to properly train but threw you to the wolves before you know half of what you know what you are doing
good,"As a Customer Sales Associate, your main job is to book tuxedo rentals and aid sales personnel. There is a lot to learn about styles, sizes, presenting to people, and selling."
good,"A typical day at Mens Wearhouse included opening the store, leaning, fixing fixtures, and preparing the dressing rooms for customer. I learned at Mens Wearhouse that most customers just want someone to understand their needs and try to accomodate them as much as possible. Co-workers are either friends or enemies because of the competitive drive everyone has for clients. The hard part about this job is being female in a ale dominated environment. It"
good,Our store is run like garbage. Men's Wearhouse is cool though. U would recommend the GRAND Rapids store. The pay is good. Free Saturday lunches.
good,"This was a fun company to work for. The environment was suitable and very comfortable for the co-workers. There is also room to grow, however there is job security within the company."
good,made sure all deliveries and pickups were done on time. Unloaded trucks on Sundays and separated all order for each store for Monday morning.
good,working as a relief driver you experience new things every week! The  people you work with are aren't afraid to help and also the costumers are very patient when it comes to new drivers. This is a great stepping stone.
good,"The workplace morale was fun, however the compensation was relatively low like most retail jobs.  There is little room for advancement, because unfortunately there is a ""good ol boy"" vibe in middle to upper management."
good,"We work together as a team to get the job done. We introduce our customers to the products and services we offer and make sure we meet their needs. I have learned how to overcome problems at the work place and how to train others. The hardest part of working at Men's Wearhouse is dealing with some of the lazy coworkers, this makes you do double the work."
good,This is a company that you can get very comfortable in. It has it's stressful moments but it is overall an easy company to work for.
good,"Before we start making our outbound calls, my supervisor would let us know what lead we would be working with and which audience is our target.  I learned how to provide A1 customer service to all of my customers- it was a MUST. My supervisors were ok.  If they felt like it was something you could work on, they wouldn't tell you (as you would imagine they would) they would just expect you to figure it out on your own (that- I didn't like). The most difficult part of the job was...honestly the job was perfect.  I can't find anything difficult about the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking with my customers and helping them out with their wedding attire.  I would speak to customers who would be having very unique weddings.  I enjoyed it a lot."
good,"My position was responsible for assisting customers by completing data entry for tuxedo rentals for wedding parties, business parties, etc. Also, I provided assistance to the sales personnel by demonstrating support accessories and smaller ticket items to customers."
good,"Working as a consultant at Men's Wearhouse has its good and bad days. While it is a fairly secure and easy-going job, it can be stressful in terms of making sure every customer's needs are met. ""World class customer service"" is key at Men's Wearhouse, and we work every day (including discounts, sales, ordering in specific inventory, etc.) to make sure that if the company sells it that it is available for every client that walks in the door."
good,its okay. its a normal job you go to work and get paid i really dont have much to say about it the people i worked with where cool i just live to far from the one i worked at so i had to leave
good,"typical day is on average productive and there is always something to do to pass the time, you will learn patience and how to deal with all kinds of customers. the hardest time of the year will be during prom season when the stores get really busy. the most enjoyable part is that it's work time could be flexible at times and there are always good benefits."
good,"It really depend on who was running the store. When I first started, I had the best Managers. The District Manager was ok. He cared way too much on ""Concept"" or Sales per ticket, then the overall Associates sales week. My Managers looked for me to excel in sales and teaching me how to properly sale."
good,I worked in the small tux store so it was only busy during prom but I had time to do my homework while I was in school. But my co-workers and managers disrespected me.
good,"Fun place to work, staff is nice, management pretty good. Renting tuxes is a fun job but can get busy during prom season. sales is very fun if you work hard and get good at it."
good,The working environment at Men's Wearhouse is fun and enjoyable. The employees that work there are relaxed but at the same time push you to work hard. This provides new employees with a comfortable working environment.
good,"Truly enjoyed working for this company, I was not good at sales but I enjoyed working in the tuxedo department. I got a chance to be apart of someone's special's day."
good,A good company that provides quality products. The chance for advancement is always there. They do prefer to promote from within and train to succeed.
good,"not a bad place to work, good managers, and the company has decent room for upward movement. however as a sales consultant your pay is very limited regardless of how hard you work."
good,"Good place to work. I worked with a great staff, managers was supportive and helpful when needed. I met nice couples and families who was wanted Men's Wearhouse services. I learned a lot about the differences between suits and tuxedos. Overall great experience!"
good,Overall a good company to work for. Had a good company culture when I was there. Annual Christmas party. Retail hours can be hard on life/work balance.
good,A nice place to work. I really enjoyed helping couple get dressed for their wedding or prom. Matching suits and dresses was a blast as well. Did not enjoy the days I had to work at the big store for commission.
good,i would refer people to work there is a  great environment to grow and learn about fashion design and style also how to sale merchandise
good,This job is perfect for someone who is willing to learn new things. Its a good first job. You have to be willing to move up and apply yourself or they wont notice.
good,"A typical day at work is helping out various customers and preparing them for their special occasion. In the past five years, I have learned how to create loyal customers by upholding Men's Warhorse's ""world-class customer service"" and manage internally within different  stores. My co-workers are very fair and helpful. Having them is like having a second family who will support your ideas and goals. The hardest part of the job is NOT doing your job! I believe that completing any task is the most rewarding yet enjoyable part of the job that gets me through the day."
good,"Men's Warehouse was a job that was sufficient at a particular point in my life. It was part-time, it allowed me to be social and work on customer service and communication. It was my job while I was in college so I was able to be very flexible with my hours."
good,The culture is amazing. the most enjoyable part of the day is collaborating with my co workers. At mens wearhouse they stress that its ok to have fun and stress that being creative is the way to go.
good,Business could be slow at times its the only reason considering leaving. because my pay is based on people shopping
good,"I love working for this company. A typical day for me is helping customers with tuxedo fittings, scanning in inventory-putting away inventory, fitting customers for suits,sport coats, slacks, and shirts, and also putting different looks together for all outfits of life (funeral, weddings, etc).  I will also process returns and exchanges throughout the day, as well as opening and closing the store (counting the cash drawer, cleaning closing duties, etc.) The Men's Wearhouse has great values and amazing teaching techniques. The hardest part of my job is working on commission.  It's not consistent and hard to anticipate.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of being able to help customers with some of their most important events in life, whether it be their wedding, funeral, graduation, interviews, etc.  I love knowing I helped them with a major part of their life.  My co-workers are great, it just can sometimes get too relaxed in the store since we have a very friendly atmosphere.  "
good,Great place to learn how to sell. Perfect for most collage students. Flexible schedule. Can be fast paced and competitive. Many opportunities for advancement.
good,"Wanted to be a cashier and they started me in fitting tuxedos on men, it was a pretty uncomfortable position. Management was great but that's about the only good thing."
good,"This place can get very boring to work at as at times it may be very slow. Since it is a suit/tuxedo store, you will get newly engaged couples and the brides to be can be very impatient and rude with you. But it is not hard stuff to learn. In time everything gets repetitive. Another thing is you may have to help the people who work on commission and at times do the whole work yourself but they still end up getting credit for it instead of you and I find that very unfair."
good,to be honest i worked in the company for three years and took care of so many different types of people and worked with the same amount management will walk all over you and do you dirty if you do as they please
good,This is a great way to gain people skills and an eye for fashion. The commission pushes you and the customers challenge you to give them the greatest customer service.
good,"My typical day at work was tough. I was never really trained so I honestly never knew what I was actually supposed to be doing. I did learn a lot about men's clothing though, I didn't know a single thing before. The management was horrible there. Our manager would make a huge mess out of everything and expect us to clean it up. And then when there was a problem that he created, we got yelled at for his doing. The hardest part of the job was not being trained and not knowing what to do and working for a manager that I wasn't happy with. But the best part of my job was my co-workers and especially the customers."
good,"Loved it "
good,"A typical day is very busy with prom/weddings, and my co-workers were great to work with,also it's a great company to work for if you want to advance in the work place."
good,"Greet customers and provide helpful services. From working at Men's Wearhouse I gained the experience that I need to work in retail and be able sell.  The workplace was a professional and friendly setting. The hardest part of my job was having to multitask with customers, but it made my skills much better. The most enjoyable part of my job were my coworkers, they made me feel welcomed and appreciated everyday that I went to work."
good,"A typical day? I would go in and set up my work area renew all items that neesed a touch up shoes etc. what I leaned just being behind the scenes of retail, My co-wokers some slacked of mainly playing but when they would get serious it was a job well done. the hardest part? smelling the polishes and the cleaning supplies everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job? just doing somthing diffrent."
good,Ok work environment. Great benefits but no so good management. Work and life balance is great
good,"I like the staff and the managers. Job was fun but repetitive. Not very challenging. No sick pay for part time, no vacation time for part time, hard to advance in the company"
good,"managers train you if you ask for the help "
good,"Men’s wearhouse is a fantastic place to work! Prefect for your first job. Dress code and everything about this place is business. The pace definitely picks up during prom and wedding season, but if you’re trained correctly you have nothing to worry about!"
good,Men’s wearhouse isn’t al it’s cracked up to be the pay is horrible and the management sucks it’s only fun when planning weddings proms or other special occasions the work isn’t hard fairly easy but again the pay is horrible
good,None its ok but not for me dont pay enough but a ok place to work they not on yo back warehouse work is ok just need a better job and im worth more than what im being paid
good,This company was good to work for but when offered more money that's when I left. The company over all had a good work ethic. I spoke with Human Resources before I left and they agreed they could not compensate what I was being offered
good,a good first job but not a career move by any means. did teach me alot about men's fashion and how an adult should dress.
good,"The nature of the industry generates also the need to keep afloat the overwhelming marketing activities to infinitally improve the odds of generating revenue."
good,The training was not that thorough but the store has good benefits reasonably scheduling flexibility and is a great way to get into the world of fashion.
good,"I started working here while in my undergrad and thanks to management working with my school schedule, I even worked through Grad School. Retail just isn't for me. Customer service is draining and hard on the feet so it just isn't an ideal career for me. Each store's culture and atmosphere is different. The company does so much for the customer to ensure a quality shopping experience but does little for the employee other than the awesome discounts for men, so as far as women are concerned there isn't much they do for female employees."
good,It was fun to work I loved everyone for the most part my manager didn't have much experience and that for sure showed. After prom season ended so many people lost way to may hours I went from 30 hours to 15 hours a week
good,just wish i made more and had more hours but overall loving and caring company.fast paced mangemet is easy to talk to flexible sch
good,Men's Wearhouse is a fun enviorment to work for but is really hard to grow within the company and like all retail your social life is on pause because weekends are required.
good,"if you don't belong to the right click you are expendable.  you must put up with horrible working conditions.  They lie, cheat and will run you out if they need to."
good,"Assisting tuxedo manager with appointments and fittings for weddings, proms and other special occasions.  Assisting CSA's with matching outfits, shirts, ties etc. Learned a lot about measuring for accurate fit for men's clothing.  Job became stressful at times due to a lot of drama with management.  It could be a fun place to work and sharing enjoyable time with customers planing weddings and prom,"
good,Co-workers were always nice management team not so much. Loved the variety of clothing they provided to the customers every week and also the sales.
good,"working with this company was great,"
good,"on a typical day, it is quite busy and the management is okay but the co-worker were great. the hardest part of the job is that you do so much but one is now compensated for it. and there is no growth for employees or any type of a congradulations. the most enjoyable part of the job job is that one always learn sometime from where ever one finds himself working"
good,Working for Men’s WearHouse wasn’t really bad. Really nice co-workers and very good business. The pay rate wasn’t really aligned with the amount of work that needed to be done.
good,A good workplace it was a case where my bills were falling behind and I had to leave. Wasn't really getting a bunch of hours so I was forced to get a new job.
good,The discount on the clothing is a great perk. The quality of the merchandise is top notch and its overall not physically demanding. That being said the income and work life balance is not ideal.
good,Don’t be afraid to be outgoing and taking responsibility for things that aren’t your job title. Showing that you care and proving that you can handle things are a good thing that can lead to more opportunities.
good,I enjoyed my time working for this company. I loved the atmosphere but management is lacking. Company can be too laid back which causes people to slack on their job. Still one of my favorite places to work but pay was not adequate for the stress of the job.
good,The job had its good times and bad times but they gave me the skills that i need to land  a good job in the state. Most of job requirements want you to have at least one year of customer service skills and that is just what Mens warehouse gave me
good,"We assist others as well as doing our own job. Can get tedious sometimes especially when busy or already tasked with multiple things. If you can't multi task this isn't the job for you."
good,The job overall is a pretty good job but my problem is with two of the managers who have a big impact on the employees in the store. I have a problem with the one manager trying to pass off their managerial duties to the people below them and the other manager above that manager yells at the employees beneath them for doing certain things but the manager doesn't get yelled at for doing the same thing or worse.
good,"The pace of the job is slow most days."
good,"I like this job as a whole and everyone in my store is fantastic, but the upper management is shady. I was promised a pay raise over 6 months ago and despite my best efforts, and the efforts of my store manager, the regional manager keeps making excuses and delaying. So even though I've been with the company for almost a year and a half, with 2 years of tuxedo sales and management experience before that, I am making less money than a new employee who has been written up for tardiness and calling in on multiple occasions. Seems pretty shady to me."
good,The product was fun to sell. It was also nice having a discount on clothes. I did not get along with the GM. He was arrogant and did not listen to his employees.
good,This job is good exposure to the requirements of customer service in any retail establishment. It involves everything from getting that tie as a gift for your boss to creating a working wardrobe for the man who has just changed jobs to outfitting an entire wedding party in the tuxedo rental department. Multitasking is a must with this company as you need to be able to run your own sales as well as watch your salespeople and do returns while answering questions and phones and maintaining control of the tailor shop. Maintaing relationships with customers over the years and hearing their recommendations is very rewarding.
good,"It can be a fun company to work for. However, they have changed the pay structure for a few locations that will eventually go into effect nationwide soon that really lowered paychecks."
good,"Job was very enjoyable during the slow times, but when it got busy management began to stress and take it out on employees. Have also seen promotions be given with no increased pay to go with it."
good,"For retail sales you can make decent money if you work a lot of hours. However, it is still retail and the hour demands are less than desirable. Overall though it has been a pleasant experience and job advancement is easily attainable if you can sell well"
good,"I enjoy working there because I'm interacting with people everyday, and I enjoy helping others. I'm doing different thing, not just the same things everyday.The manager will give anyone more hours if they desire a week."
good,"I genuinely enjoyed my time employed here, it was somewhat laid back, my co-workers were hard-working and great people, store management was poor, regional management was wonderful"
good,it would be very slow during the week unless it was prom season where it would be extremely busy and stressful. but overall it is a good place to work and the workers are very helpful.
good,Day to day it was and all out challenge. Soon as the shift begins its a race to see how much production they can get out of you from station to station. Fortunately i was up to par with the speed so i didn't find this as an issue. The mangers not all over you back riding you just really allowed you to come to work zone out and do your thing. As a second job this was a great way to start to wind my work day down.
good,Typical day at the Men's Wearhouse is one of 2 things; either its not busy at all and you wait all day just to see someone walk in just before closing or; its nonstop people all day and everyone is complaining because they're not being helped in the time they want to be helped.
good,"Assuming you get into a location who's staff enjoys the arrival of new employees, Men's Warehouse is an excellent place to work. The work you do can put a smile on people's faces, and provide beautiful memories for years to come."
good,Fun and friendly place to work. Management team worked well together and the customers were fun to help. Unfortunately they are no longer in business.
good,Gave me the experience to develope my Management skills. Great Customer Service experience as well with co-workers.
good,"I worked for the Mens Wearhouse for 7 years, in not sure how it is now to work there but when I was employed it was enjoyable. The training provided is some of the best that I have experianced for sales and customer service, the only downfall is the companies lack of moral guidlines, employees frequently gossip and cause problems around the sales district. I dont think I would work there as a adult with a family the hours can be long and there is Drama."
good,"Over worked"
good,"Typical day at mens wearhouse: I would wait on customers, ship and receive products, contact future business, fit and sell tuxedo rentals and suits to customers. clean, count merchandise that we have on hand, file, audit tuxedo rentals. handle the cash draw, returns, customer complaints, etc..."
good,Positive work environment with a great team.  Work culture is very positive and motivating.  Team helps each other and stays productive while having fun.
good,It was a good first job and was very flexible with my hours at the time but was a very competetive work place and discrimination happened frequently in the work place.
good,I Started in the unpacking department & ended up finishing in the same department. The job was seasonal but still was well worth the 3 months I spent there!
good,"No Drama employees will do very well.   Store is slow in late fall and winter,   If you like fashion you will do well.   Clientele is mostly for funerals."
good,"I would recommend working there, but only if you have a thick skin, because sometimes work there can be very stressful and customers can get annoying, but as a CSA you always have to keep your cool"
good,"Working in retail isn't always a smooth transition, when coming from working in food. Helping customers find the items they need, putting them in suits/tuxedos/causal clothes, helps me get ready to dress people for any occasion hat they are getting ready for in the near future. managing things from returns, locating items, and giving customers the respect and care that they deserve when they come into the store. what i like most about mens wearhouse is the fact that i can be myself with customer but in a still professional manner. It keeps me in high energy and positive most of the work day."
good,"The managers are basic old white men, as were majority of the customers whom come in. Prom being nearly the only exception, overall it is simple customer service work."
good,One of Fortune 500's top companies to work for is what initially attracted me to this company. Developed many relationships from clients and employees through the years.
good,Very laid back. Customers can be a handful but good for teaching others people skills. Coworkers ate usually very helpful and managers are very understanding of personal situations.
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company for the most part. They have a strong corporate culture that emphasizes giving employees the resources they need."
good,"My job consisted of working in the tuxedo rental department. Daily activities usually included discussing styles for a wedding party with the bride and groom, measuring the party members for the rentals, and imputing data into the system."
good,"Worked as a CSA, assisted with the tuxedo rental process and setting up wedding parties.  Also sold clothing to customers and assisted the salespeople."
good,"My fellow employees were great to work with. On a good day, working at Men's Wearhouse was enjoyable. I would work there again. The hardest part would be during sales."
good,"Customer service was top priority "
good,"Pay is good if you know how to sell clothing. Upper management favor people who has great sales negotiations skills. if your sales number are great on paper, you will never get fired even if you don't follow company policy, discriminate against other employee. but Very chill place but sometimes but sometimes it gets crazy busy. Corporate manager, regional manager don't care what you have to say even if there is discrimination going on between store manager and sales associates."
good,i think alot of the issue with retail stores is not the company but the managment chosen to run the company. I feel i may have missed out  because the manager we were dealing with at the time had a lot of personal issues that were brought to work.
good,"Men's Wearhouse affords one the opportunity to dress well and to dress others.  The hours are retail, so you will work lots.  Great for a young person learning the craft and the art of selling.  There is a competitive atmosphere within the walls of the Wearhouse.  If you hit your goals and come to work hungry, you can survive and make a decent salary.  As a seller, your job is much more vast than just selling merchandise.  You must stock it, present it, then sell it.  Many things are required of you in any role.  Overall, it's a great place to start off a career in sells and learn to basics to take you to bigger and better things!"
good,It’s is a very good company it has so many good workers and good managers. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a job they will like it. They make it feel like home.
good,I learned that mean come in all different shapes.I also learned about what colors looked good together. One of the most important things i learned was its important to listen to what your customer needs are
good,Assist customer with their selections. Inform them of current sales and promotions. Assist with the check out of the purchases. Stocked merchandise and it came into the store. Ensured store was presentable at all times.
good,"I started here and they have taken care of me through the years,  it there is a lot more drama and not enough support from the higher ups for managers to do what needs to be done"
good,"I would book weddings, I would help color wise the guys we dressed. I helped with item questions, everyone I worked with here was so very nice and helpful"
good,Working here often was boring. Slow and easy money but wheres the excitement in that. sometimes the dull atmosphere would rub off onto the customers once they came in.
good,"Staff was friendly, customers are spoiled and rude. treat you like slaves at times. and pay was very low not even college students can live off of that pay"
good,"Good work environment, friendly atmosphere, steady employment. Flexible hours that you can work around, reasonable income. Job offers good health benefits and incentives."
good,"Management was relaxed enough to make the work environment very hospitable. the work was fun, easy, and you created a relationship with every customer."
good,Pay was competitive but management switched often. Advancement opportunities were very limited. New role was added to my position which should have been handled by a different department.
good,"A typical day at work consist of coming in, making coffee, counting cash drawers and checking in and out stock. Also assisting salesmen with their sales and ringing up the customers merchandise. I learned something new everyday, for instance how to measure a gentlemen for a tuxedo. I had one of the best managers I could ask for. The workplace was so fun and enjoyable. The hardest part was trying to match a tie to a button down shirt! Most enjoyable part was being able to have fun and work at the same time!"
good,"Cool environment to learn about men's fashion and sales. Not too much room for advancement or promotions. "
good,"Typical day at work consists of fitting customers for rental products and or building wardrobes for students, CEOs, businessmen, lawyers for everyday work life/occasions. I learned many things regarding customer service and the effective communication skills that go in to selling and persuading clients of your rationale. Workplace culture was very diverse but overall a friendly environment. Hardest part of the job consisted of multi tasking during busy days where I would be working with 2-3 customers simultaneously, making effective sales less possible."
good,It can be a hit or miss. Either your store manager is good or isnt. Hours depend on how store performs. Pay is way below for what the company expects you to do. Promotions are miniscual. Pay is decent for starter. Nothing to make a living of.
good,"Great staff, pizza parties, Christmas parties.Great team work with  "
good,"some days are slow, some days you need to multitask, communicating efficiently with co-workers as well as customers is important. must have mild computer skills"
good,"Great place with huleful managers that do everything they can to help ."
good,"Company itself was pleasant to work for, great benefits for full time employees and lots of room to grow. Unfortunately the store I had worked for was not the most successful due to it's location and management. In my personal instance, the workplace environment turned toxic with several instances of blame shifting and unprofessional emphasis on trivialities. All negatives aside, i'd advise you to inquire about a job at The Men's Wearhouse.. working with people to achieve their desired ""style"" or ""look"" is often exciting and will make you forget that you are working. Making a person feel confident in their appearance felt quite rewarding to me.. not to mention the commision! (:"
good,I received and documented all shipments I processed purchase orders and daily receipts. I'd also notify department of deliveries and process outbound shipments for FedEx
good,"The clothes in Mens wearhouse make the man to be like a businessman , and There is something about Mens wearhouse that you people like a lot is their costume made tuxedo for wedding or any sort of celebration ."
good,its a great start point for a sales job.they put you on a structure program to master sales which i was very thankful for because it sharpened my skills.i learned the many methods of sales from opening to closing and the mid game.great over all culture.
good,"nice clean environment"
good,Good environment to work in co workers are a great team to work with. Days can be long  but easy and laid back. Everybody works together. Management tries to meet workers needs
good,"Haven't worked there in many years but when I did it was a good company to work for, they have since got a new CEO and remodeled all their stores to create a better customer experience. Last time I visited it seemed like a good place to work for based of what I experienced."
good,It is a great retail job but it is still retail. Hours are not steady. Management varies between the stores. Politics are still alive in the company. Not always happy working here but pay is decent. Benefits are pretty well and incentives to go to school are there.
good,Working hard for this company but they were not appreciate the employee as much as sapois to . I learned  so many way to repair and altered clothes as faster ways and also give the customers good firing and good service .
good,good job to start out if your into the fashion game. provides oppurtunity in growth if you last long enough and show good work ethic and good customer service.
good,"In a typical day at work I assist wardrobe consultants with sales, ring up customers, and create group and individual tuxedo rentals. That being said my job has its challenges but it is also relatively easy once I got used to our P.O.S. and tuxedo reservation system. I have learned how to properly dress men as well as what to suggest for different weddings depending on roles, season, and wedding colors. Most of my coworkers are very nice and I get along well with them, with the exception of one. The hardest part of the job is getting Brides and Grooms to make decisions especially if we don't have exactly what they want available for rent. The most enjoyable part is meeting people and helping them get the wedding or look they want and watching them leave happy."
good,I enjoyed working there with the team we had but I wanted to have a home life with my family and working nights and weekends made it impossible.
good,"Men's Wearhouse was a very relaxed, and a productive workplace where I learned how to operate as a manager by learning how to open and close a store, controlling inventory, and how to make certain decisions that were best for the store."
good,Good work environment with very friendly co-workers and management. The corporate culture is excellent as well. I learned concepts such as world class customer service as well as facts about men's fashion.
good,Multi task while providing great customer service. Educate youth about formal wear for their school events. knowledgeable about tailoring guarontees
good,Overall it was a good job for me to gain experience. Helping customers purchase their ideal outfit seeing them smile was well worth the time.
good,"a typical day of work is to be productive at your job."
good,"The working environment, management, and employees are second to none. A wonderful place to work. Internal growth and advancement is prized."
good,As an associate at Reed's jewelers a quality experience for both customer and employee are first and foremost. Leading the industry in fine jewelry we commit to serve.
good,"Interacting with customers for the purpose of becoming a part of not only their experience with our brand, but playing a minor or a major role in their lives and memories is rewarding.  One meets with great internal and external customers, while learning and acquiring new skills to serve the brand best and developing ones own experiential and character development.  Men's Wearhouse is a great place to build a foundation for ones future success!"
good,I started this job during the busiest time of the year (prom season) and all of my coworkers worked with me very well to teach me how to do everything that was required of me. They answered any questions that I had and were patient until I learned how to do everything on my own.
good,A typical day at the Mens Wearhouse would consist of assisting customers with retail decisions. Setting up wedding parties and reservations.
good,A typical day consisted of setting up grooms with their wedding attire. Fitting and best matching suit options for customers. Troubleshooting and customer service. The hardest part of the job was the lack of upper leadership beyond the store or the ability to advance in the company.
good,"Men's Wear house is a fun but yet challenging place of work. A typical day at work would be first to help out any customer that walks into our store to the best of my ability and doing what is best for them and our company. There were also other tasks at hand for the job such as cleaning, cash sales, etc. I have been with the company for over seven years and I am still learning everyday something new. I learn more about our tuxedo department and what can be done to help better our customers. The management is very helpful and fun to work with. They are always there to lend a helping hand. My co-workers are one of the joys when I go into work, they are great to be around and are willing to help when I need some extra assistance. The hardest part is when we are short staffed and the store is busy with customers, I feel bad when this happens because when we are short staffed it is hard to deal with more than three customers at a time, so some do tend to wait longer than others for service but I always am willing to go the extra mile for a customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know I did something for a customer that makes them smile, this is the best feeling I get from my job and my co-workers can agree with me."
good,A flexible company willing to work around your schedule. Great quality of clothing for reasonable prices. Customer orientated company with great professionalism.
good,"*Help customers with suits and tie combinations."
good,"*A typical day at work would start with a good breakfast that all the drivers would enjoy together."
good,"Nice place to work. Sales staff can take advantage of people below them if you let them. Monthly bonuses, which are really nice. Really hectic during prom season!"
good,"Enjoyed my time there, and learned a lot of skills that I use to this day.  Men's Wearhouse offers great benefits with stock options."
good,"Men's Wearhouse is either a place where you can get as far as you can get without a degree in the retail industry, or will burn you out to the point you never want to enter the store again.  Each day has very little variation from the previous day in  that there are many reports to be done, as well as many small tasks that the CSA's usually get done under direction from the operations manager.  However, given how retail is a very high turnover industry, Men''s Wearhouse is relatively good as far as company culture."
good,"Each day I would work with somebody different, assisting with tuxedo rentals and sales when needed. I learned tons about men's fashion and the importance of ease for those getting married. The whole store worked as a team including managers. The hardest part of the job was quickly and efficiently helping prom customers, but we eventually got our own system down. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everybody worked as a team and got along."
good,"The Men's Wearhouse offers a fun, team oriented work environment while making sure their members provide world class customer service."
good,"Great environment, great customers and great coworkers."
good,very laidback atmosphere and easy to do. alot of room to advance as well the only busy times are during prom season.
good,"Store managers have a multi-faceted role in stores. Managing, scheduling, budgeting, customer service and marketing responsibilities. Managing the tailoring for pick-up was a vital part of the overall success of the operation."
good,"An average day consists of stocking the inventory, renting out tuxedos, helping wardrobe consultants with the selling of merchandise, cashier duties, straightening inventory."
good,"Mange employees, create and input store schedules, handle customer concerns, responsible for large sums of , and bank deposits. Responsible for store setup. Hardest part of my current job would be dealing unpleasant customers, customers demands, and employees showing up scheduled shifts. Most enjoyable part would be the smiles on customers faces when they have enjoyed their experience."
good,"Co workers were great, prom season gets very busy which is the hardest part of the job.  Had a great assistant manager."
good,"As a sales training manager, I would have daily person and team sales goals to achieve. I would set our comps, make my team aware of them and coach them and team sell with this to achieve goals. I have learned how to lead teams and learn from one another. I have learned that to properly manage, one must always lead by example and show behaviors that build success. I love working with different sorts of people and learning to relate to them and maximize opportunities. The hardest part of my job are the hours. I would like someone with more of a regular schedule. I have an amazing multi unit team who always encourage and push me to the next level."
good,"Overall the Men's Wearhouse is a great company, working there was a great experience and the people there are hardworking, fun individuals. The only downside was that it became quite stressful at times and my co-workers all handled it in different ways which only led to more stress and mistakes."
good,"I enjoyed working at TMW... it was much more fun when George was running the company, but the new regime isn't so bad."
good,"Fun job (except during prom season)"
good,The stores gave me the opportunity to grow in my career.  The Company currently lacks effective leadership.
good,The company is a great place to work fast pace environment  and also has it's slow periods..
good,It was a fun place to work due to the fact that I got to learn a lot about retail and how to help customers with their wardrobe.
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers and assisting other employees with customer needs  "
good,"greet customers, help with tuxedo selection, expand party number with additional members, answer phones, schedule appointments, mark alterations."
good,I enjoy helping people look their best for any occasion. My co-workers were also great and very supportive.
good,good company to work for . after a year they transfer u to a different location.
good,"This business is a fast paced, customer service based environment and i enjoy every part of it. I love the fact everyday i meet at least five new people."
good,"Working here has allowed me to hone my communication skills. From the moment that I arrive at work to the moment I leave, there is constant communication whether it is between customers and myself, or my superiors, or my coworkers."
good,There was no typical work day for me here. You never knew what the day was going to be like. As to be expected we were all expected to come in on time and be ready to do our instructed jobs. I was hired in to be a Customer Service Associate which means cashier. I love the people here because were like a family. I was employed with this company for 8 years. They hired me in during a rough time when the economy was down and for that I am forever grateful. What I learned here was about Mens dress wear. This store is a mens clothing store. Management here is great depending on who you have the pleasure of working under. They push you to be freat so that in the future if your looking for advancement you will be ready. The crew here is a mixture of characters that I love. their hard working individuals. The hardest part of this job are the customers because you can try your hardest to provide the best customer service but if the customer doesnt see anything that they like then they walk. The most enjoyable part of this job is being around people that I enjoy working with. If given the oppurtunity I would go back.
good,Great company to work for! It's enjoyable to learn about customers' personalities and professions and consult them on suitable attire to accommodate their daily uses.
good,"You learn sales 101 here, where sales and customer service are top priority. It becomes first hand knowledge to decorate clothing with accesories and other clothing items to boost sales. The toughest but most rewarding is making the client look his best for his specific occasion, and all others as well."
good,"The best parts about Men's Wearhouse are the environment, the perks, and the pay. As a Wardrobe Consultant, I made a very good salary on part base pay and part commission. On slow days, I still got paid $5/hour, but on busy days, I made a killing. On the downside, this made my paycheck go up and down randomly from week to week. Make sure to save up on your good weeks."
good,"A typical day for me would be booking tuxedos for wedding and special events/occassions such as prom. When I wasn't busy booking tuxedos, I would be on the sales floor helping the wardrobe consultants put together outfits for customer viewings. Most of my co-workers were very helpful and friendly."
good,I have done work as a contractor in the creative department.
good,The job was Fun. I had to sell suits and rent tuxedos for men. It was a fairly relaxed job.
good,"Great place to work. The pay is much lower than it should be and, because of that, they can not keep the best salesman. Randomness of deals made it hard to convey value to return customers."
good,I loved working here. Great place to learn and advance. Very laid back environment for the most part. My management team was very easy going. I would love to work here again.
good,"Once you get a good location is when your job is fun and a learning aspect. I was in Arlington with the best managers, but as I was switched to the Hulen and I20 location, working with the managers have been a roller coaster."
good,"I feel the base pay needs to increase in order to bring in more seasoned employees   "
good,"Depends on who the manager of what location in terms of hours provided. Some stores will provide a good work and personal life balance while some will require long hours,"
good,"-A typical day at Mens Wearhouse is helping measure for a rental or suit. Setting up a wedding or just putting out stock. "
good,"Daily tasks include: Sales focused, team work, servant leadership, balancing budgets.  Camaraderie amongst store based personal is high.  Highly tenured workforce."
good,At the mens warehouse you sell clothes to individuals who need them. My location has an excellent management team that is willing to work with its employees.
good,"I love working for the Men's Wearhouse. The experience of being able to help someone get ready for a job interview, or funeral, or just upgrade their wardrobe is fun. I love fashion and all that comes with it. There are days that can be fast paced and some that are very slow. But it is a fun job. I would say the hardest part of the job is overcoming a return. As a commission based employee, if someone brings a return, that comes out of my pocket so it can be frustrating trying to overcome a return, when as an employee I did my job. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping those who come in look their best for whatever occasion they are needing to look good for."
good,"Men's Wearhouse, in a word, is inconsistent. There is an extraordinarily high amount of autonomy left to stores, and the result is an incredibly polarized customer experience. On top of this, there is very low accountability- it is extremely difficult to actually be reprimanded within the company, much less fired. There are many employees who have been with the company for 10+ years, who are resistant to change, and are the biggest barrier to a company who is trying to change its image."
good,"The Men's Wearhouse is a fantastic place to work for two reasons: It is your first job, you're very passionate about formal wear."
good,"I work at store 2707 and the only bad thing about working there is the lack of hours for part time and mis communitcation with management on occasion other than that I like working there my coworkers are very helpful people and you learn a lot about clothing, this helps me because I am a theatre student so I know how to prepare a costume properly."
good,A typical work day begins with knowing the sales rotation. Then its inventory/stocking. There's daily shipments and all items are to unpacked and displayed. Once that is taken care of you would go to your assigned section and make sure all items are in the appropriate location. This is all done on any down time you may have. The customers are the priority. All customers are attended to according to a rotation. It's important that you give excellent customers service at all times.
good,Co workers are amazing. Great atmosphere (for the most part). Free lunches twice a month on Saturday's. Poor management until very recently. Now things are looking up. Pay is ok but could be much better. Management picks favorites.
good,"Good place to work if you are young and looking for a paycheck. Definitely not career, unless you're a store manager. Also depends on the area you are working in."
good,"Every store is different, my store in Auburn, MA had great management that worked with your schedule and they genuinely cared for my well being. There is also alot on downtime that as a student can me used do schoolwork."
good,My favorite part of the job was that it was fun and required a lot of creative thought in that I had to infuse my own personality in the styles that I recommended to customers.
good,"We open the store the same time the mall is open. When the mall hours are extended during holidays. Once you clock in, you pull up on sca's and once you finish those, you are waiting for potential clients to comein"
good,"The culture is evolving as of 2017.  Great place to work alternation locations/hours previously.  Benefits are wonderful encompassing medical, dental, vision, 401k etc.  Great discounts at Christmas as well."
good,While being a fine place to work recent philosophical differences with management has made the position impossible to deliver results.With that being said I feel it is time to take my experience and talents to the next level elsewhere. My time here has helped me fully develop my procurement skills and understand the importance of open fully encompassing communication
good,"The Men's Wearhouse was a good place to work with regard to benefits and compensation, but it feels as if the corporate structure is in decline. I'm not sure how long this company will be around if they can't change their business strategies."
good,It is a great work environment and everyone who works with the company is awesome. It is a very family oriented business. Upper management is willing to help to the best of their capability.
good,"Have found my supervisors very supportive, good life/work balance, enjoy customer interactions. Pace can be a little uneven due to store traffic, heavy in May & June, light in July & August"
good,Store Managers are hi dered by Area micro Manager. The disconnect between corporate policies  and as implemented by Area micro Manager was palpable. His neptism was insurmountable and created a sense  of limited growth options. The store I worked in had a great team and was very friendly as well as competitive.
good,"Overall a great learning experience and professional environment, great co-workers and management. A good first job after college but I knew it was not my passion so I had to move on from Men's Wearhouse in Peoria IL."
good,"Very customer service oriented. Company lets store make decisions on how to handle customer needs. The Regional Manager was tough, but extremely fair."
good,"my day on a Saturday morning .first we have a store meeting about the last week of sales in the store and talk about what stradages to come up with to help make more sales in the store. my job requires  understand leadership skills motivating my team by assisting the wardrobe consultant  with sales on retail by promoting the stores sales and other deals witch helps with customer service also sale tux rental formal wear setting up weddings and taking different peoples measurements. my co-workers are full of fun, life and motivating  i enjoy working there.the hardest part id say would be going back and forth from retail to rental. what i enjoy about this job is that everyone is friendly and by the end of the day id have to make sure the store is clean sweep, mop, take trash out , dust."
good,Great place to work at with ok benefits but trying to move up in the chain of command...takes forever epically if your not buddy buddy with the manager or their friends lol.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with; did not like my pay. Work day was pretty slow; I learned how to measure men for tuxedos for different events. The managers were nice; and gave you slack. Hardest part was measuring certain men.
good,"I loved mens wearhouse, very sewn together attitude in which way you needed your shoes laced and your eyes up because customers come flying in there and you never know what i gunna be thrown at you."
good,I enjoyed my time there.  The management was always open and approachable.  It was always a fun time putting together wardrobes for people.
good,"Working with Men's Wearhouse has broadened my knowledge in management and sales experience. It's a lot of fast paced work depending on the season but has it's slow times as well."
good,"Pretty decent retail job overall, but employees make 100% commission, which is great if you happen to work at one of the busier stores in the state. But if you happen to work in a store with less customer traffic, your paychecks are either feast or famine."
good,Was one of best workers in the call center and did that help..... no was laid off while people who did not perform as well as I did kept their jobs
good,"Part of sales team, Sold all types of attire"
good,"Drive from West Chester, PA to Connecticut delivering tuxedos to all the Men's Warehouses in my district.  "
good,"A typical day at work was receiving new merchandise from the warehouse. I spent my time selling merchandise to customers and setting up tuxedo rentals for wedding parties. Most of my time was spent setting up tuxedo rentals and making sure merchandise was neat and presentable for customers. Management and employees were helpful and friendly and created a fun and productive work environment. I was a part time worker and student, because of that there was no possibility of a promotion. I was in the same position for many years and needed a chance in my environment which is why I left. The hardest part of the job was coordinating wedding parties. Some wedding groups were very large with multiple looks for each individual in the party. It became difficult when the outfits would  be changed multiple times. Making sure everything was changed correctly and had the right fit could become difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the bride and groom happy when everyone looked perfect in their tuxedos."
good,"To me, it was a perfect job with a rewarding career. It took a little training when I initially started with Afterhours formalwear in Michigan. I learned to successfully customize and accessorize each customer for their historic event. It was hard work but the outcome was well worth it. I was very content with the company, Mens Wearhouse and Tuxedo, and looked forward to going to work each day. I had met someone with whom I was happy with and I decided to leave home and move-in with my future wife at the time. It was all set, I was ready to grow old and be a lifelong member of Mens Wearhouse as a tuxedo specialist. Then one day, in fact, the last day as a Mens Wearhouse employee, I fell from having a Cranial Aneurysm and life has changed drastically for me. Yikes! Recovery was extensive.(2 years)  My experience as a tuxedo specialist is still with me but the job and the store itself is gone. I wanted to go back to the company but even they FIRED the owner,... I know, i don't believe it myself but its true. So, here I am, out of work and looking for a job again but at least I am happy to be alive again. I had great co-workers! The job, itself was a great job and I do miss it but I am ready to continue my work a be a productive member in the American society."
good,This was definitely a great place to work considering all of the older people that came in everyday. Talking to people that are 10 years your senior really helps you to learn more about the clothes that you are selling and the life that you are living.
good,The company is changing but still a great place to work for. Advancement is hard its not what you know but who you get connected with.
good,"A typical day at the Men's Wearhouse involves keeping  the store clean and organized as well as helping the customers both retail and rental. I've learned organizational skills, teamwork, benchmark selling, I've always had great experiences with all the managers I've worked with. They are very flexible with school schedules. I've met a lot of people and have made some life long friends while working here. There really isn't a ""hard part of the job"" it can definitely be exhausting during the busy times. Meeting a lot of interesting people both co workers and customers."
good,"It was always different which was a good factor. It could be a slow day or it would a steady flow through out the whole day. "
good,"Employee Centric Culture - regularly meetings are held in honor of employees.  As a manager you are encouraged to have ""spirit"" events."
good,"maintaining to keep yourself busy is key! I have learned that not everyone can be happy with the products you offer because the price but there is always something you can offer to help. Manage time wisely! the workers are very helpful especially with tuxedo rentals, sometimes your measurements aren't always exact but always have a back up just in case! the hardest part of the job is to always keep the customer happy. Its not easy sometimes when your colors don't always match what the wedding party is asking for but knowing your colors and being able to improvise is a good thing with this job. I also learned my interpersonal skills and how to improvise very well from this job."
good,"The day starts by running tuxedo rental reports, then phone calls to brides and grooms regarding the progress of their group fittings. Handle customers as they come in, measure and fit for tux rental. Transfer stock in and out of store. Keep store organized and supplies stocked. Process purchases. Lots of computer input."
good,"arranging wedding atire for groomsman, measurments required. Displaying different styles of suits different fashion options. Hardest part dealing is coming across a disapointed customer"
good,"if you love retail and making someone look good this is the job. Working with men is easy, learning about the apparel, fittings, booking weddings and other special events, selling, its all fun. The most enjoyable part is working with my current staff. The hard part is working with rude customers and maybe some alterations. The benefits are good but advancement is not so great. I was promoted to a key holder and still got paid my first rate."
good,There are a lot of benefits to working for the Men's wearhouse. It is a good company that treats it's employees very well.
good,It has become more and more difficult to recommend working at MW. The culture of the business has been lost and without younger and newer employees feeling invested and trying to grow with the company you are left with veterans who feel the weight of an entire business on their shoulders. It can be a great job and you get to work with some wonderful people but that is no longer enough.
good,As a wardrobe consultant we are trained to maximize every sale by interviewing each customer and creating the need for products we recommend for them so we may drive business and meet goals.
good,"Fun place to work in, you meet all types of people both customers and people you work with. Highly competitive environment but low pay for managers unless you've been there for years."
good,Men's Wearhouse was a fun place to work.  We had a lot of team outings.  They gave us bonuses for Christmas. We had luncheon & lots of fellowship with our team.
good,"Great company to work for and great benefits.   I've worked at six different stores and never really had much to complain about.  Every manager is different though, some will make it impossible to have a life outside of work because the only think they do is try to work a schedule for you whole store out a year in advance.  It's hectic, especially with the shifts you get.  Unless you have a serious need like having a child, some managers will give you know leeway to have a livable schedule."
good,"A quality workplace.  I enjoyed my time with the MW.  The people are the difference makers, Be it the employees/staff or the customers.  I established many outstanding relationships with the MW."
good,Very good benefits not bad company to work for just the job culture was pretty bad. Feels like i  was back in high school. Management was ok. Mens warehouse did take care of its employee.
good,"I enjoy working at the mens wearhouse.  For the last 5years the company has had a family feel while working.  prom season is a busy time of year for the store as well as wedding season,  things can get a little hectic but its over all a lot of fun working fo the company,  good store discount as well"
good,"I do enjoy working at Men's Wearhouse because it feels like you're working with family. Sadly, if you're >25, you will feel like the sales associates/general manager have something against millennials. Sometimes all they did was complain about how lazy young people are and how hard they had to struggle to get where they are... I don't think they understand that times are different, and we do still work hard. It's really rude, but there's not much you can do about it.   ""I say what I want because I'm older than you"" is their mentality."
good,Good company with relaxed atmosphere. They encourage fun and team atmosphere. West Coast mentality and policies are unique and more relaxed. Great employee disounts
good,Men's Wearhouse had a relaxed corporate culture.  I was paid 5 dollars an hour plus commission.  It was a fun place to work.  I left to pursue something in my field.
good,In a typical day in the wedding department you would make calls during the week to confirm or book an appointment for a couple.  The weekdays would be slower and the weekends would be pretty busy.
good,8-12 hour days. Nice staff. Good benefits.I would recommend working there if you don't mind varied hours. overall good experience. The service by leadership motto is nice.
good,"In general, Men's Wearhouse is a fairly easygoing company. As long as you do what is expected of you, you will do just fine. The staff is more than willing to help you through learning the ropes, which is fairly challenging if you haven't worked in the clothing industry before. The most difficult part of the job is accurately determining clients sizes for suits and tuxedos to ensure a perfect fit and a satisfied customer, but that comes fairly easily with time. Overall a fun place to work, with great people."
good,Most of the employees there are nice and do there job well which makes it easier for the managers. This job is very detailed so you have to pay attention with everything you do.
good,"Men's Wearhouse offers the same pros and cons you can expect from a retail environment. The people and friendly, accepting, and genuinely want to see you grow in or out of the company. The organizational skills learned here can be applied to any job, and you will know what to wear to any involved occasion."
good,very good workplace and easy job at the area good teamwork in every employee and good and friendly management because of relocation i do not work there any more
good,"Now, I was doing this in high school as a tux specialist but if I could take it back I would be out there on the sales floor, the job was very easy once you master what you are required to do."
good,I would try to be as productive and friendly as possible. I would be busy assisting customers or organizing the store. It was a place where I was able to further expand my service in customer service.
good,"I enjoyed this job mainly because of the people I worked with. Management was good but they focus heavily on the sales which is understandable but everyone needs to get involved. I don't think I was really cut out for the job because I enjoyed the rental side more and helping people with the wedding aspect. Overall when I started everyone was friendly; I couldn't manage both working for men's warehouse and going to school, so I did the not so smart thing and dropped school. Later I left to enjoy cooking in the mountains."
good,During peak season the store is always busy. Men's Wearhouse has great offers from moving up in the company at a fast pace to company outings and free lunches every month. Staff is friendly amongst one another and tries to maintain customers happy whether they are purchasing or renting items.
good,"Working at Men's Wearhouse was a rewarding experience in that you often built up a clientele of people who trusted your ideas, opinions, and expertise in the areas of fashion and professionalism. There was much to learn in the areas of color coordination, wedding planning, and what is professional. Everyone came to you for a variety of events, and it was your job to meet their needs."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Men's Wearhouse, but I wasn't going anywhere within the company and left to seek a new challenge."
good,"just not a job to make a career from, easy money but not room for advancement. hardest part is the management cutting back on hours. the customers are frequent shoppers of mens wearhouse so its always nice to see them"
good,"Traveling was fun and exciting because it gave me the opportunity to travel in places within the United States that I otherwise would have never done. I went to Minnesota, Florida, California, Tennessee, Chicago and many more. Enjoyed so much"
good,Good call center to work in. Promote from within. Easy to move around in positions. Had covered parking in the parking lot.
good,Typical day involves operations regarding accurately logging and filing customer items as well as processing online orders and transfers. Major duties include the booking of formal wear for specific events predominately weddings. Also the generation of leads via phone calls to customers who have received rewards points and inviting them to enter the store to redeem the points. Actively engaging customers on the sales floor through good rapport and listening skills in order to ascertain specific needs and desires in terms of available product.
good,I love working here. Its only been a couple months but i love the environment. However i am in school and my manager does not seem to care about my schedule an is hesitant about working with me so i can go to school two days out of the week. I also dont see any room for improvement or moving up.
good,"The company as a whole is ran great.  Benefits packages are good.  A typical day in the store is fun.  It is a very laid back atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is the down time.  During the slow season it is pretty dull sometimes but if you have a good crew, everything is cool."
good,"On an typical day I received all the returns and processed them back into the system, while assist 3 managers with daily duties. I worked with a small group of typically 3 people. The most enjoyable part of this job was the way the team and I worked together to get all of our task completed."
good,It was a good environment as far as the location for the benefit of the business. I build many networking relationship with some customers. Loved it because I am a peoples person.
good,help customer with accessories for there suit and help sale men with customer purchase and also help with tuxedo for prom and weddings
good,"The Men's Wearhouse is a great retail job. They provide excellent support and product. I have learned a great deal about the industry. The management is very supportive. My co-workers have been great met several outstanding people along the way. The most difficult part of the job is within the Job Work/ Life balance, as retail hours can be challenging for a family especially during holidays. I particularly enjoy educating customers on suits and providing the knowledge they need to make the right decisions."
good,"This was a good job that I wanted to keep.  it was fun, fast paced, and I was room mating with my supervisor.  I was about to advance but came 3 minutes late to work and got fired for it.  Alot of shady stuff was going on during that time.  My manager was over hiring a lot of people.(more people than we needed) There was work relations going on between different stores to top it off with the over hiring. we had some people transferring from another store just to work with the managers friend. (the one in the relationship) My hours got cut all the way down to 11 hours a week and I came in a couple minutes late and got the axe dropped on my job."
good,"A day at work was comprised of tuxedo orderings, fittings, set up and break down of product, stocking, cleaning, pressing and basic customer service. The management staff was fair and unbiased  and my coworkers were self serving. The job included a lot of heavy lifting and attention to detail. I learned the entire tuxedo ordering system for the position and managed it effectively. We received discounts on all that we bought as well and PTO. I learned a lot about people and customer service while under their employ."
good,"A typical Day can be stressful but highly rewarding with the sense of providing World Class customer serivce to the vendors, buyers, warehouse staff, co-workers, transporatation hub and OTR drivers."
good,Ensured customers overall satisfaction with the company’s products and services.
good,I learned so much that I didnt think would be possible to learn at a suit and tux rental company. I learned a lot about style and how to dress male customers. There was never a boring moment in the shop.
good,"We have Sports Center on, so the store can keep up with all the latest happenings, it's great to be able not to miss any big sporting events which may come up. The day starts with doing store counts, going to the bank for deposits, getting the registers set-up, getting the press ready for the tailors, opening the doors, reading e-mails, helping customers with a great shopping experience. We have down time so we laugh , joke around, we play ping-pong, watch a little T.V. Co-workers are cool, you have your ups and downs just like with family members. I have learned we can do more with several people helping in the sales process rather than one, it's more enjoyable for the customer, and it keeps things light. Hardest part of the job is keeping yourself energetic when it's been slow, or you have customers not buying big ticket items while other salespersons are. The most rewarding is when that customer who needed help spends a whole lot more then they intended and are EXTREMELY HAPPY about it, and they thank you for helping them out."
good,"A typical day at work is checking merchandise in to the warehouse, picking and packing merchandise to the stores. Very relaxed atmosphere, I learned the many departments, scanning procedures, and cycle counting. working a diverse group of people can be very difficult at times, but most days were smooth sailing."
good,"Having never worked retail before TMW, it was very informative. Retail is not something I would want to do for a career, however I think it taught me a lot of things about people and how the ""world"" works. I would and have recommended TMW to friends because it is a good work environment and I think everyone should have that experience."
good,"As a customer service associate, I was able to interact with customers and help them with decisions that they needed. I learned that the customer is always right and a typical day of work would be to rent out tuxedos, book wedding appointments, make complimentary phone calls, cashiering and etc.. My co workers are fun and energetic like I am."
good,"A typical day at work includes maintaining cleanliness of the store, assiting customers by ordering tuxedos in the appopriate style for varius occasions, and anything they may need from the Men's Warehouse, recording measurements for the perfect fit, and assit other co-workers and management. I have learned from this job that one should work hard everyday as if their job is on the line, and always provide world class cutomer srvice. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer returns and mentions how they got the job, or looked the best at the event they attended because the way they looked in our clothing that I or another employee put together."
good,The Mens Wearhouse is a good place to work. You meet many new people from all walks of life. I just wanted to advance my career a little more.
good,"Good employee and fun environment, Very focused on creating a welcoming store and presentation. Focused on employee welfare and satisfaction."
good,"Easily a go-to place for those looking to dress up. Working at Mens Wearhouse gives you the opportunity to learn fashion for men but it also gives those who really work hard at any task given to them,  a chance to progress in the company."
good,If you have the desire to learn and follow direction you will advance in this company. Good sturdy income and easy enjoyable work. They have a certain way they like you to sell which is pretty simple and will help make more income. You make hourly plus commission and can make a lot more money then people think.
good,Obviously depends what store you are in I have been in the same store for 3 years and is a great environment everyone is like family we all get along with each other and help each other all the time.
good,I worked for Men's Wearhouse on and off for 12 years at multiple locations. I always go back to help during prom season. I will always recommend this place for employment.
good,Building professional relationships is extremely fun and the thrill of getting a new client is exciting. Work environment was laid back and coworkers always make your day interesting
good,"location: W Belfort , Houston , Texas 77031"
good,"management is great helping you and guide you daily when needed."
good,"This was by far my favorite place to work! I learned a lot of sales techniques in a laid back kind of style in a clean, laid back work environment.  My co-workers were amazing!"
good,It was a very nice place to work at and a friendly team of workers. But don't expect advancement because it is very political. I have seen workers come and go regularly because of it. Great job for temporarily working but very hard to make a living off for life.
good,Its was a nice job for me to earn  retail  experience and money for the summer. They also let me keep my job after the I was working  at closed  they offered to relocate me.
good,When you work in the morning we had an meeting to start the day. Go over sales and where everyone should be. Scan in the products on days we had shipment. Attend to all customers and help each other.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Men's Wearhouse. If you are looking for a fun, laid back (but not too laid back) place to work, enjoy working with customers, and enjoy fashion, Men's Wearhouse is a great place to work. There are multiple benefit options, tuition reimbursement, adoption assistance, vacation and sick time, etc."
good,The Men's Wearhouse is not your typical retail environment.  Consultants really get to know our customers in order to provide meaningful suggestions regarding wardrobe purchases.
good,"Slow paced but business can pick up in an instant. In my experince most coworkers are kind and helpful when needed. Nice discount quality of clothing was worth cost, in my experince compaired to other places i have shopped for similar items."
good,great company with knowledgeable managers and regionals. like a family and helps you grow to great potential. you have room to grow and will always have someone who can answer any question.
good,Over all was a pleasant experience to work with fashion and learning the ropes of the suit business. learned how to make combinations to shirt to ties to suits.
good,"It was my pleasure working with great staff. The appreciation was always given. Staff was very friendly, and always coached me on my weakness at work. Made me feel as part of their team."
good,"Men's Wearhouse was a great place to work. The pay can be a hassle sometimes since it is commission based, might make great money one week and not so great the next. Management is mostly good, however there is an emphasis on selling, and if you sell well, you can do whatever you want. (and I do mean WHATEVER)"
good,Mens Wearhouse offers amazing benefits and is a great work environment. They offer amazing sales training and opportunities to move up if you are a hard worker.
good,Company is a good company.  The environment is good and fun.  Company could improve the vacation pay as you loose money when you take vacation or sick time.  Slow advancement past the AM sales manager role.
good,"Fast paced, and friendly environment. Enjoyed the people I worked with the time I was there. Enjoyed satisfying customers on their big day/ or events."
good,"just like most places, when it is busy it is really busy. However, when it is slow it is really slow. it can be very stressful at times and then other days laid back with only one or two customers all day."
good,"A great company to learn as a new person retail. Lots of opportunity to move up, self motivation is required in commission . Be able to adapt to change as there are many and many more to come."
good,This job would be for those still in high school or still in college since the job is pretty simple. Nothing is really challenging except certain times of the year. It gets pretty boring
good,Anywhere from setting wedding or rental tuxedo appointments to having to step out on the sales floor and sell a suit. Managed rentals but was comfortable and experienced enough to help out wherever help was needed.
good,"Throughout the year, sales are very balanced and it's a rather laid back environment. The biggest sales/rental periods come with christmas and prom seasons. All of the workers are very nice and understanding with anything that might come up in your personal life and are always engaging in fun conversation with each other and the customers. Overall a fun and friendly workplace."
good,A day for an employee at Mens Wearhouse is come into the store first thing in the morning. Take your deposit to the bank. Prepare any tailored goods that need to be shipped out. Run reports and assist guest for the day
good,"MW has one of the best working environments. The job was fun and varied from slow to fast paced. The pay is mostly commissioned based and as you build your clientele your pay will rise. My pay increased by about 2k a year just because I was growing my base, but you will only receive raises for promoting."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and lively even though it was very early in the morning."
good,great company to wokr for. all about teamwork. sales driven so you gotta have the drive to wanna make money if youw anna work for this company. but a great company tow ork for nonetheless/
good,"A typical day was making sure the store was all ways clean, greeting and selling customers. I learned how to talk to people I did not know and connect with them. I learned about people. The management was great, I had my own problems due to scheduling but a great management staff. The culture is very fun, but super competitive. The hardest part would be the cleaning and the days we had inventory. The most enjoyable part was the environment that is there,"
good,working here was a blast when i first started. I worked for this company for 7 years. loved the holidays parties every year you get free drinks and free food who wouldnt love that
good,"The only reason I left was because of the allure of big box retail money.  I wish I hadn't.  The pay is not great here, it's decent, but you can make much more elsewhere.  The intangibles are what makes it worth it.  I here there have been many changes, so it could be different than in my time, but it used to be a fantastic culture of people that genuinely cared about it's employees.  Was also a ton of fun, even during the crazy times of prom season.  Wish I never left."
good,"Best first job I could have asked for. I loved the job, had the best boss ever. Also had a blast going to outside work activities with other Mens warehouse employees and managers. Overall great first job, money wasn't good enough to stay longer."
good,"Great job if you are looking to meet interesting people, deal with retail customers in a more personal manner than most retailers, or just expand your knowledge of suits and formal wear. It can get little hectic at times but the management was approachable and the culture of the store is pretty laid back."
good,"It is a fast paced job most days.  I learned more about working with customers and altering men's clothing.  Can be tough handling multiple customers at the same time, but it is fun working with the customers during fittings."
good,"Work load varies depending on season, layoffs are frequent because of the layoffs. Second shift has continuous layoffs, first shift not so much. Work is easy, gets hot at times. Excellent people."
good,"i enjoyed this job almost the whole time i worked there. the goals are high but reachable, the job itself is fun, and corporate culture is pretty solid. that being said, just be wary of your direct managers, they will not hesitate to throw you under the bus to corporate."
good,"I worked as a tux rental specialist (CSA) and had a great time. Getting people looking good is a great feeling, and the people i worked with were great.  Whether or not you enjoy it will depend on your manager."
good,Love helping people to look their best by meeting their wardrobe requirements. Great co-workers. Love the environment.
good,really enjoyed the people i worked with. made me enjoy my work and going to work. felt like a family. the only hard part was when some customers would get angry and cause a scene in the middle of the store which wasn't very often.
good,This was a great job to learn how to talk to customers  in an effective way. Fun environment to work in as well as for the customers to shop in. Other employees are willing to train you to do new things.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at the TMW for the most part, but after the release of the founder, the culture of the company completely changed. I still miss it from time to time, but I know some of that some of the same issues that I left for are still present. Overall not a bad company to work for as long as you don't have your expectations set on the past."
good,It is a great retail job but it is still retail. Hours are not steady. Management varies between the stores. Politics are still alive in the company. Not always happy working here but pay is decent. Benefits are pretty well and incentives to go to school are there.
good,"company is great, Very easy to get help or a lending hand. long hours take away from personal family time  esp when you close at 9 at night"
good,"A friendly work place with with competitive spirit. Working for this company showed me how to deal with more then one costumer at a time, i handled and sold quite the amount of suits being sold. the manager was a great teacher and worked well with me under pressure."
good,"Awesome job, only downside was weekednd work.  Other than that great people and a great place to work.  Great training environment and a good culture."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was educating customers about the correct attire to wear for their situation, whether it was a wedding, graduation, or a funeral. "
good,A typical work day would start of by coming in greeting all your teammate as well as management. Then you would look for your first task with would be calling all your customer that you have sold previously because their products is in now from order. Then you would get on the sales floor and try to maximize every customer that comes through the door. And the hardest part of the job for a sales person is to be consistent.
good,"A typical day includes a fair share of inventory to put up, however management does know how to reward with play. Whether its allowing the employees to throw a football or just sit down and listen to music. It's a great composition of work and play."
good,"Working for The Men's wearhouse it's never the same thing day in"
good,"I would usually get to work, check a few emails, and start helping customers. My typical interaction with any one suiting customer would last between 45 minutes to an hour or more. "
good,"Men's Wearhouse has been a wonderful place to work over the past 9 years. I am a key holder and will either open or close on my shift. In a typical day I would assist customers from start to finish. I would greet them as they come in, and ask relevant questions as to their needs. I would then assist by bringing an assortment of clothing for them to view and try on.  I have already taken measurements to ensure a proper fit. I then up-sale when possible. Then finish sales by writing the order, inputting the order and taking their payment. I also do inventory of the store. Assist in ordering merchandise for the floor. I also do an occasional bank deposit. Closeout cash registers at the end of shifts."
good,"Working at Mens Wearhouse was definitely hard work, but over all it was a good experience working with the management team and other friendly, hardworking coworkers. The hardest part of the job there was standing all day during an eight hour shift. My most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying some of the birthday celebrations for the employees."
good,Very nice place to work. Very well ran. Team environment. Day to day production driven company.
good,"Great company culture - awesome Christmas party and annual management trip to California. Random pizza days and lunch bought for us on most Saturdays."
good,"Everyday my primary objective was to maximize sales volume. To achieve this I proactively managed inventory levels through our Stock Activity Reports and a direct relationship with our company's merchandise management. Additionally, I sought to generate additional store traffic by making outgoing calls to existing customers and provide various incentives to shop, and to create meaningful long-term relationships. "
good,Men's Wearhouse has great people who are a pleasure to work with.
good,Although short lived a great learning experience. After being promoted to Assistant Manager I learned many different aspects of running a business.  The company is very friendly with workers at all levels of the company and shows appreciation to employees in a more than adequate manner.
good,"Working in retail brings different challenges everyday. Overcoming those challenges is the reason I've stayed in retail my entire career."
good,"Managed a team of 6 in the day to day AR for 5 brands under the The Men's Wearhouse Corporate Umbrela.  Reviewed morning reports for descrepencies, managed team's hours, worked with the TwinHill Brand for collections and attended meetings on various issues.  I learned the software for each of the brands and helped the team with any difficulties of the day.  The hardest part of the job was taking on the responsibilities of any position that was vacant in addition to my responsibilities of my position. The team spirit events were the most enjoyable part of the job because it brought the team together in a positive way."
good,I enjoyed outfitting wedding parties. This was a fast paced work environment and I worked with young employees.
good,Everyday here is fun to work. Very good people ans the management is top of the line. I enjoy the happy hours on friday's :)
good,look good while you sale some suits socks slacks shoes shirts tie hankerchief shoe polish and while your trying things on your also getting a tux
good,Great company to work for. Working for The Mens Wearhouse gives you qualities for the future. You make friendships and gain clients everyday.
good,"Thereworking with the public is very rewaeding is a great sense of achievement working with professionals."
good,bad management unless you are working full time. some costumers can be challenging but through perseverance you can easily make a sell. the management staff isn't the best but other then that it's completely fine
good,They were a nice company to work with very nice people they kept us up on things with the meetings every morning and making sure we were good and ready with our daily stretches
good,"Even though I worked at a small store, we strived to be efficient and fast paced when it was necessary. We prided ourselves on customer service because we were able to create a different atmosphere for customers."
good,Before i started at mw i had some sales experience. But the salesmenship and tactic i picked up here have been a blessing to me. In that i now im very confident in how i approach selling.
good,I started in a Customer Associate role for this company and had a position created for me to relocate to become an Assistant Manager. I worked for this company for over 5 years and my hard work did not go unnoticed. The job was very demanding but the culture and the team made it more than worth it.
good,"Men's Wearhouse celebrates your birthday with lunch and cake. Sweet of the company to do that. Also depending on your store manager. Overall, a great company to work for"
good,"Stay on task,  always present a professional atmosphere for general public.  Each location is different and will focus on variances of the same thing,  just remember to keep knowledge is power in every industry."
good,Great place to learn the culture of professional dress and proper communication. Harmony between workers in this type of environment produces incredible results.
good,"A typical day at work is mostly filled with following up on previous customers and clients, meeting with new ones, and general store maintenance such as restocking, cleaning, and reorganizing the store. I learned far more in depth people skills in this job than I had in my previous one, which I am very grateful for. The workplace culture is very comminicable and friendly, in fact most of my best friends are my coworkers both former and current. The hardest part of the job is honestly the hours versus the salary until you make your way up the ladder which can take a while.The most enjoyable part is the customers, honestly. There are far more good ones than bad."
good,Enjoyed honing costumer service skills while providing logical purchasing decisions. Enjoyed developing client relationships and dedicated service to those clients.
good,"Overall the job itself was very fun and I looked forward to working with my store management to fix their problems within their store. The friendship and working relationship was something to look forward to. Management was management. Good and bad days based on how they felt that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing out repair jobs for your market and making store management happy upon completion of every job repair. The most hardest part of the job was parts delivery, ETA's, emergency floods, roof leaks and coming up with a quick solution for a temporary repair. The end result was always rewarding! Getting a store up and running to its full function."
good,I learned so much with my time at The Men's Wearhouse. I got to learn how to sell to customers and I also got to experience first-hand what goes in to the customer service role. I dealt with the rush of prom season which helped me grow and got me out of my comfort zone and also met great people.
good,"As a person that enjoys clothes, I found it very fun to work at Men's Wearhouse. Working there allowed me to improve my day to day interaction with customers, learn the ends and out of running a clothing store (auditing, learning how schedules are made etc). The only hard part of the job was being alone and having to use the restroom when there are many customers."
good,"A typical day at Men's Warehouse consists of checking in inventory, measuring and consulting customers based on particular need, placing and editing orders both in-store and online, assisting customers with both rental and purchase options for suits, tuxedos and general clothing artifacts including dress shirts and pants, formal shoes and personal products. My biggest takeaway is learning to be flexible at all times and being knowledgeable of daily company sales and deals, which make the employment experience a much more fulfilling journey. The culture can be laid back, only once majority of work is completed and taken care of."
good,"Pay was decent, work never got too crazy, the people I worked with were great...it's definitely a company that cares about its employees. Might not recommend if you're not into fashion/selling suits, but it was a decent job."
good,It is a really good job. I enjoy and appreciate my time there. This job has allowed for me to even relocate to a different state. I recommend this job to everyone.
good,"Men's Wearhouse is a good company to work for, I acquired a great deal of sales training and product knowledge. Store management and regional management were both very helpful and cared about their employees. As much as I like the company it can be hard to make a career in the retail side of Men's Wearhouse."
good,"I loved most of the staff, very friendly people, lots of different backgrounds. Very competitive in sales. Everyone wants the sale for the commission."
good,"Men’s Wearhouse was a great place to work. If I had a choice I would still be working there, but the store had to close at the location that I was working."
good,Generally good customers and fun people to work with. Have enjoyed my time working here.  There is the potential to grow within the company but there is limited direction from higher ups.
good,"I have been with Men's Wearhouse Corporate Office since 2012. The job provided plenty opportunity to grow with great pay, and an encouraging environment. The main goal with Men's Wearhouse is providing World Class Customer Service at every turn, and that is exactly what we do here."
good,"Love working at the Men's Wearhouse! Employee discounts are great, the people there are fun and professional. The skill set and education one receives as a result of employment such as sales techniques, customer service, formalwear etiquette, complementary colors and articles of clothing, and  insight into wedding industry, to name a few, are resourceful and everlasting."
good,Opportunities to learn everything from sales to merchandising to proper fitting of men's clothing. Great environment and good benefits for employees. Overall good job.
good,"Men dread shopping for clothes and Men's Wearhouse makes them feel right at home.  They help get an entire outfit put together so the customer always leaves knowing he is going to look great.  Tailors are on site to get the look just perfect.  Some down time during the week, but overall, fast-paced environment with amazing people"
good,"Very balanced job. The workload isn't too much, you get to engage customers and have conversations. There isn't much job mobility, so you sort of get stuck at your position."
good,It's a really easy job especially when it's not prom season. It sometimes got annoying when customers didn't want to understand the rules we had with their tuxedo rentals. The Manager is an amazing person.
good,"Men's Wearhouse was a great place for a someone new to the workforce. They were great at training, managers are laid back and help you reach your goals."
good,"I have worked at The Tailored Brand company for about 7 years now. I first worked in a Men's Wearhouse store, then a Men's Wearhouse and Tux, and now working under a licensed shop opened by Tailored Brand called The Tuxedo Shop @ Macys. Promotion winthin doesn't come quick in this company but they do come in time. I've been with the company for 7 years and has only been promoted once. Not because of my performance. You will only get promotions if a spot needs to be filled. If that makes any sense, but it is a little insulting to say the least."
good,"I've worked in a couple locations with this company. Out of all the jobs I've had they are beyond the most understanding of employers. They allow great flexibility for part-timers, if you are a student they will understand your school schedule and work around it. "
good,The company is like one big family. They make sure you have fun at work so you enjoy coming to work. The pay is great and makes you want to come and be a part of a great team.
good,"Daily basis I check the SCA orders and ship those online orders out, check my appointment book and prepare for any appointments I may have coming in. Set up a stack for the wardrobe consultants if they have a suit buyer to help sell more items to them. Cleaning and refolding the tables to keep it organized."
good,"Most days at Men's Wearhouse are about the customers coming in the door. There are quotas for commissions and rentals, but they are sensible and are presented in a way that motivates success. Before the CEO was let go, the annual Christmas party was a blast! You really get to know your coworkers here, and the knowledge gained about menswear is handy. I even learned to sew at this job. It's difficult to advance as the organizational chart seems to shift dramatically every year or so, and many people working here are ""lifers,"" but it's overall a great job."
good,At Men's Wearhouse each day we would help grooms decide on their wedding attire. Have fun and sell suits to people for job interviews or weddings. If we didn't have something in stock we could always order it in or even send them to the larger stores being that we are a tuxedo store.
good,This was the best job I've ever had the reason I left because the company closed my location. However I had the best Manager ever and staff as well. I loved working with all our customer's.
good,I loved the environment here.  its was hard work and could be extremely hot at times. But management made sure there was water on the floor so we had something to drink and high motivation most of the time.
good,"Great opportunity to learn the retail business...from the floor on up. From Sales skills, inventory, cashier, measurements, alteration"
good,"I would go to work and start my day off by talking to the shift that was leaving so I now were to start, I learned a lot about cleaning and drying clothe the right way."
good,Enjoyed my work and all the employees. Made it like we were all a family and enjoyed doing things outside from work together. Teamwork was a big plus to my job and everyone got along well together.
good,you come by an easy day at my store often. working with people you love makes busy times worth it. the job can take a lot out of you but it is rewarding to be able to make people happy with the way they look on their wedding/important day.
good,"Starting as a wardrobe consultant, Mens Wearhouse was easy for me because of the love of men's fashion.Within weeks I had many sales and help the store come in first place in our district.After six weeks I was flown out to corporate headquarters to join others in learning the Mens Wearhouse way of selling and showing product and the correct way in closing the deal,without buyers remorse.I soon became assistant manager in one of Mens Wearhouse stores"
good,It was a pretty stressful work environment with poor managing skills. It was very disorganized most days you did not know what you were doing. Managers had a hard time controlling employees. Couldn't even get employees to take out the trash. I think that it was more important for them to have fun than to get work done. Store was always dirty and at times they were rude customers.
good,"Great place to work, the team is great to work with, we have great events for the team. overall a good experience to being there I have learned how to  use MS excel and power point as well as getting CPR training."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of arriving in the morning or afternoon and completing finished alteration calls, so that customers could come get their clothing.  Throughout the day than a wardrobe consultant would consultant customers that walked in needing clothing such as a suit or even a tuxedo fitting.  From here, I would build a relationship with the customer, finding out his or her initial request, and then from there meeting initial requests. Building trust, and providing logical and rewarding reasoning as to what is going to be the best option in regards to dress, allowed me to put gentlemen in the proper attire I felt necessary, to truly look professional or appropriate in interviews, business venues, and other professional and fun events. In working at the Men's Wearhouse, I have learned that trust must be built with a customer before you can take the next step.  Without trust, it is very hard for a customer or client to open up, and without opening up it's even harder to close in the business world. My management team was great, as they provided me with the tools needed to be successful.  The hardest part of the job was the environment and ceiling to which I was under did not allow me to truly succeed and create the financially freedom I one day want with my career. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling that I received when a customer left completely happy, telling me that he would be back and that he really felt like he was important.  That's what I want in a career one day.  I want customers and clients to feel loved and wanted, and to know that they"
good,"This is an ideal place for someone without a degree or who has an imperfect past and is looking for a career-type job. They love to cultivate employees and get the best out of them. Things have changed since George Zimmer left the company, though."
good,Get to meet many diffrent people from all cultures. Really great coworkers. Store manager is super. He goes out of he's way to be fair to all staff members and try's his best to teach you all that he knows.
good,"This environment was different then Jos A. Bank in that it was more focused on customer needs and preferences. Not a top-scale suit venue, but passable for an average professional. "
good,"A typical day at work would include but would not be limited to data entry, customer service, employee administrative duties, and answering all incoming phone calls. I learned more about maintaining the company's integrity while in the public eye and upholding the company's core values. My employers were welcoming of all my input and my employees where receptive to my professionalism. My co-workers challenged me to search for alternative methods to become better in areas that I was not the best at, and I did the same for them. The toughest part of the job was during prom when visibility was lacking due to high volume of traffic. This was a concern since typically this is the ideal time for theft. The most enjoyable part of the job was the conference meetings that took place in various locations around the United States. These outings allowed for me and my peers from different stores in different areas to convey ideas and provide input as to how to become more efficient in our own stores."
good,"9-10 work days. great customers, fun co-workers incentives were greet."
good,Good management. Good learning opportunity about customer service. Good work atmosphere.
good,Mens Wearhouse is a great company to work for. The staff is great and very welcoming. Great customer service.
good,working here has been a wonderful experience so far as growing and learning and meeting new people. the benefits that are sponsored by the company are exemplary but the salaries are not reflective of the rich and inviting environment that the company projects.
good,"Fast Paced busy most of the day"
good,"Being a consultant/manager one is responsible interfacing with customer service issue, identifying and meeting customer needs, facilitating tailoring, managing special orders, and providing assistance to teammates."
good,"Typical day consists of priority management, what needs to be done first. Taking care of time sensitive issues first and then dealing with the issues that are less of a priority, all the while giving world class customer service and training team members."
good,Men's Wearhouse is a very good company to work for. They have been flexible with my schedule while I was going to school and allowed me to leave and come back. I spend my work day helping co-workers assist customers in sales and making sure the tuxedo reservations are on track for customer's weddings and other events. The management at the stores I have worked in have been great and treat employees fair.
good,I enjoy working with the people here.  This is a company that is good to their employees and creates a fun work atmosphere while still remaining focused on excellent customer service.
good,"The store that I was in was After Hours Formalwear for the first 2 years that I was there. When Men's Wearhouse bought them some things changed. This helped me to learn that it is good to know how to handle change in your working environment. Sometimes change can be a good thing and you just have to go with it. "
good,World Class customer service is the motto we strive for everyday to our customers and each other. Inventory is accounted for daily as well as helping each other with providing support to the management team. Exceeding customers expectations is very rewarding.
good,Wonderful place to work overall! Specialty retail is always fun. They are also very family oriented and were very flexable with me with any family needs.
good,I enjoy my time there good hours overtime offered regular. Workers very friendly. Also they are very willing too work with you on times and days you work.
good,i liked working with the customers and my coworkers it was clean and friendly environment which made me feel welcome in the workforce i was happy to work for the company
good,Managers were cool and helpful. Working there gave me a lot of experience working with customers and it has given me a lot of experience with the register
good,"Definitely one of the best jobs that I have had. Being a college student, Men's Wearhouse provided a great place to work while pursuing my degree. If you are willing to learn, managers will provide with every bit of knowledge that can and help you to move up in the company. The only knock on the company is the weekend scheduling. I came from a job that rotated weekends every two weeks and Men's Wearhouse demands that you work every weekend. Other than that, I highly recommend working there if you are looking for a fast-paced sales environment with plenty of opportunity to advance."
good,Worked at a steady pace placing men's clothing onto a conveyor for packaging. Assembled boxes for the shippers to pack and load onto trucks for delivery to customers.
good,Work is definitely sales driven and fast pace but benefits are fantastic and always has opportunities to grow and learn. Definitely a fun work environment as well.
good,The growth wasn't quite there for me and I felt that some people were hindering me there if there was growth. I also didn't feel connected to my superiors
good,"The store can get busy pretty fast. However, rushes never last long. Busy times are only during Prom, Wedding, and Homecoming Seasons. If there is no rush, mostly restock or shipping. Very slow-paced and relaxed most of the time"
good,"I  believe this is an awesome company, family oriented, and full of job security.  I would recommend this company to others.  It was a great experience."
good,I had a great experience working here. The days flow by quickly and the pay was good. Great co workers and better management. Prom season is tough but early managed by the staff.
good,"No complaints here. TMW is a Fortune's 100 Best companies to work for. They go above and beyond to train employees. If you're willing to be a team member and not just an employee, you'll love it here."
good,"The managers that i had and dealt with were professional and extremely fun to work with, but the pay to start and amount of time it takes to get to a certain level, to where you can actually support yourself, is too long, and not even guaranteed to anyone unless you have previous managment experience."
good,"This is a great job for learning new things also for building your social skills , you’ll talk to customers everyday get smarter learn more and more importantly you’ll work ."
good,The Men's Wearhouse is a fantastic place to work.  The sales structure allows for tremendous levels of success.  I would recommend any person interested in sales to jump at the opportunity to work for Men's Wearhouse.
good,"At Men's Wearhouse we meet a lot of different customers everyday. For me it was a great platform to developed my customer service skills that I learned from college. Our managers are very generous in imparting us knowledge and skills that they developed and acquired through their years of service the company. The hardest part of the job is that in customer service type of environment no matter how hard we strive for perfection, there is always complaints that would challenge our professionalism. Which lead us to strive harder and be creative in every possible way to accommodate new ideas in obtaining a satisfactory customer service. And for me that's the most enjoyable part of the job, new challenges, new ideas and learning as a team."
good,"Overall I love what I do and the people I work with. My issues are with corporate. They under appreciate their store level employees. After the founder left the company, corporate became more focused on the dollar signs than making sure the employees were taken care of. I don't like that only the store managers go on a trip for he yearly meeting. I think it should be offered to all managers including  formalwear managers."
good,A typical day at work was like any other day i would go there in the morning work for a few hourse get a break and work a few more hours then leave to go home.
good,i have helped friends get jobs here since i have left. One of my all time favorite jobs. i will recommend again and again. there is a sense of family there that you just dont get anywhere else.
good,"Always had the fear I could be let go because I could not make sales goal and the store was very slow. Also they had a ""Up System"" I was not use to. Just because a customer walked into the store, you could not wait on them, you had to wait your time. Customer's walking into the store were rotated among the sales clerk.  When your customer came up they may only want to buy one thing, your were expected talk them into buying something else.They had lots of sales rules and"
good,"a typical day of work involved sitting around and helping do simple things such as helping rent suits, and helping sell suits. At the end of the night we all have to help with cleaning duties."
good,Typical day requires selling a suit or tux to men for their special day . Very fun place to work at but not much to grow within the company yet managers are super great in the workplace.
good,customer service associate title included helping customers rent or purchase tuxedos/suits for weddings and proms and other formal events. Cashiering and answering phones for our sales reps.
good,"The board of directors completely messed up the company and the culture when the fired founder, George Zimmer. All the veteran employees knew George and had met him personally over the years. The new CEO never shows his face and doesn't know how to run the business.  George needs to be put in charge again!"
good,Wardrobe Consultant/ Personal Shopper for Men is different than shopping for a Woman. He has a practical but stylist need for his wardrobe to take him from the office to dinner an must be travel friendly. A typical day at work consisted of creating a wardrobe for the male shopper.
good,"Unfair management . Roy Cortez Ryan Henthorne (not treat people as a human been ) "
good,Busy business filled with setting up wedding parties as well as serving customers as needed. Very enjoyable environment and great people. It was very easy to please people.
good,Working at the Men's Warehouse was somewhat stressful. It was a fast paced environment and not always climate controlled. Although the employees were great to work with it was not always easy to speak with a supervisor.
good,Good company to work for. But the weekly pay I didn't like. Alot of people smokes and it's a good company for someone with no kids or family. I would recommend this job.
good,work day varied 
good,"Management is fair unlike a lot of retail stores, benefits were good and company was great when I had to leave on FMLA for emotional reasons. Discount was always a plus for building a wardrobe for future jobs"
good,It was a great place to work. Management looked out for their employees. I learned truthful selling techniques and building solid relationships with customers.
good,Training for employees are very straight forward and easy to follow. Bookings get easier every time you complete one. Working in a suit always boosts up your confidence when you sell.
good,Este lugar es un tremendo lugar para aprender a dar el mejor servicio al cliente.
good,"Great people, just not something I’m interested in doing long term. It can be relaxed at times when it’s slow but when it’s prom season it can get extremely busy."
good,"I worked as a wardrobe consultant. It was a competitive environment ,but fair with excellent support from the staff and management.I usually met goals assigned to me without much difficulty. Had great staff and colleagues."
good,"My only real problem with the company was one manager, but after talking to other assistant managers at the store, the problems were eventually resolved. Very willing to help their employees."
good,"good place to work, great environment. Good benefits, multicultural"
good,"A typical day at work would involve constantly interacting with customers, whether in person or over the phone, to ensure that their needs are met. The management is always there to provide support for subordinates. I learned how to more effectively communicate with customers based on fulfilling their needs and wants. The hardest part of the job was how fast-paced it could get at peak demand periods. The most enjoyable part of the job was the tight-knit associate team community working together to achieve store and company objectives."
good,"Typically spend most of the day measuring customers for rentals, or selling suits and trying to sell more than just the suit (no ""naked"" suit sales). Typically relaxed environment, unless it is prom/wedding season. There is a big push from management and upper management to increase sales and improve product knowledge. You make more money in non-pooled commission stores."
good,"This is a great place to work if you are a fashionista. You must understand the fashion industry and stay on top of the fashion trends."
good,"Always busy place, so time went by fast. I'm a great team player so work always got completed in a timely manner. Always have great co-workers working together which made it fun but at the same time, we're able to make it more of a team player to complete our tasks."
good,This job was very slow. It had it's busy days around fall and spring time due to homecoming and prom. I worked in two locations and filled in at another location as well. All were the same. If you aren't looking for a promotion then this is a good place where you can be content with your job and what you are doing. I noticed that i worked with a lot of married women who only wanted to make some type of income and have time to take care of their families. This is a good job for high school students as a first job.
good,"Great place to work, this was my first job so I loved dressing in suits and selling wardrobe accessories. Fun environment, laid back and amazing company to work for"
good,The responsibilities were lowkey and not hard to maintain at all. TH environment was fun natured between employees and the customers. I thoroughly enjoyed working for them until they immediately closed our store.
good,Learned alot about suits and sport jackets and different styles to put together. I enjoyed help couples with ideas for their weddings and making sure the groom party was looking their best.
good,"Men's Wearhouse is a great company to work for depending on the store you get and the management you are under. The actual job itself is easy, as long as you have an eye for fashion and good customer service you'll fit right in."
good,"While working at The Men's Wearhouse I learned many things. I met many great people, and enjoyed working there! In this environment, you learn to listen to what the customer needs and help them to your best abilities."
good,I enjoyed working for Mens Wearhouse.  Like every company they have their ups and downs but for the most part they are great.  Would not give up my job but for the travel.
good,"I enjoyed working at TMW. I became a better manager. I would have loved to have retired with them. Unfortunately, the company is struggling, and some cuts had to be made."
good,"Face pace"" lots of employees, lots of moving around on a daily basics, lots of running into each other, but the safety outlook is great"
good,"A typical day at work was. Checking in returned tuxedos as well as processing tuxedo pickup for customers and hub truck drivers. Putting up retail merchandise, checking emails etc. I learned that you apply yourself appropriately then you have opportunities for advancement. Management was good depending on what location you work. district, regional were great. the workplace culture was fun mot of the time but could be stressful at times dealing with a lack of staff  due to high turnover rate. The hardest part of the job was dealing with moody and demanding customer but it was to be expected   in the retail industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers and the friendly returning customer whom frequently gave me positive feedback."
good,"Great learning experience for a first full time job. The company is always expanding, so there is room to move up. It's ALL customer service. Very flexible with school schedules. The employees are very open and welcoming."
good,"I have worked for Men's Wearhouse for over eight years, been through a number of Store Manager's.  The Store Manager sets the tone for the store, so while I am working for a corporation you can definitely have a different experience from one Men's Wearhouse to another.  The corporate culture that started out as driven by customer service employee satisfaction has changed to a more typical retail environment.  Although there are opportunities to advance, I do not feel like talent is retained and developed as much as it used to be."
good,A typical work day was laid back because the business was slow at the time so i didn't pick up very many hours. Working at this company you can build a relationship with your customers because you have your own personal customers that come in.
good,"From working at men's warehouse I have learned how to handle customers better, dress more appropriately for business and formal events, and also to dress people and organize a small environment. I would recommend the job to anyone who would need a start into the workforce."
good,Customer Service ensure that customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment which included greeting and acknowledging every customer maintaining solid products knowledge and all other aspects of customer services
good,I have had the pleasure of working with many fun individuals while learning useful customer service skills. The store is a relaxed yet professional environment.
good,"Productive workplace. Good benefits and plenty of hours. I enjoyed my time with the company, and would consider returning. It was a good work environment."
good,"Typical Day AT Work: Busy"
good,"I really enjoy working for this company again, this company knew how to treat their people always showing them their appreciation to their staff. At the time a little under staff but other than that Great company."
good,"Learned a lot, found a lot of growth in my sales and customer service knowledge through watching the salesmen pitch our product and when solving problems with customers"
good,My time at Mens Wearhouse was always positive.  I met alot of people from all different backgrounds.  The work is repetitive and sometimes boring.  The people and management are friendly and always willing to lend a hand.
good,worked in the tuxedo department i liked it alot i helped people find prom tux and wedding parties it was a great positive work place pay is a little on the low side but i liked it
good,"I shadowed my sister who has been an employee for quite a few years and, although management has changed since then, it was a pleasant enough experience.  I volunteered one month of my summer and learned the computer systems well enough, helped plan weddings and even helped with bridal shows."
good,LEARN A LOT FROM ALL DIFFRENT DEPARTMENTS. I NEVER KNEW IT COULD BE THAT HARD TO ASSEMBLE A TUX form inspection to assembly it can become a very interesting task because everyone is not built the same.
good,"Management is very helpful.  They provide excellent training and review sessions.  The environment is very team and goal oriented which is a huge plus.  Every person feels like they are needed.  Retail hours, so weekend work is only downside."
good,Everyday at work would be a calm collective day. From working at Men's Wearhouse they taught me a lot based off of diligence and organization. The management was nice and wanted tasks to be completed on time which happened most often. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing who was on top for the most production being achieved everyday.
good,"I liked working there but, i didn't feel equal pay was considered."
good,"-A typical day at work included maximizing clothing sales, while providing top quality customer service."
good,"This company cares about its employees for the most part. They have gotten rid of sabbaticals and holiday parties, but stores and the corporate offices are closed Easter, 4th of July, Christmas, and Thanksgiving. Stores allow for shortened store hours on Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, and New Years Day. "
good,Good place to work and the company itself offers great resources for their employees. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be apart of the company and learned a great deal of new skills that i still use today.
good,"Everyday day at Men's Wearhouse you will personally attend to a multitude of high end cliental.  You quickly learn how to multi-task and how to be self sufficient. The Management team is very well learned and well experienced, and the other staff are always will to help. The hardest part of the job is teaching yourself most if not all of the information. However once you learn the job it is very rewarding to help the cliental."
good,I worked for the mens wearhouse for five years. It was some the the best work years. Fun place to work at. Just didn't pay enough for me to stay long term.
good,"While working at Men's Wearhouse, the pay was wonderful, along with all of the included perks and benefits for the first full year I worked at the location. During January 2016 a hostile take over of the company by several new share holders, created for a hostile work environment and the morale, quality, and job culture all began to decline after February 2016. It was an amazing place to work, that taught me a lot, however the climate of the company changed."
good,"Good Environment with potential to grow in company, very competitive work environment."
good,"A typical day at work would include interacting with customers and helping them pick out wardrobe for certain events, such as interviews or work, weddings, black tie events, cooperate events, church events. This was the most enjoyable part because I was able to use my knowledge to educate the customer. As an Operations Manager I was able to do things outside of my job site such as bridal show expos and visiting high schools to do Dress for success seminars to teach the students how to prepare for interviews, whether college or a job. In the process of doing these seminars, it also helped me prepare for interviews also, whats appropriate and not appropriate. "
good,"Good work environment where I have made many friends. Good pay as long as you can sell and have good networking skills. You will not get promoted if you aren't the top seller in your store or if you aren't in an ""inner circle"" with the regional managers as well as store managers. Company is cutting back on things and have lowered discounts for their employees, cut hours for upper management so therefore the Assistant Managers (who don't earn overtime) will have to work over fifty hours a week without overtime."
good,"Team oriented environment, management team very helpful and working with customers to help achieve their clothing needs."
good,"The management was awesome. You learn alot about the business man and his daily attire, as well as the current and new fashion trends. You have the ability to meet new and interesting people daily and possible change their lives for the better. The Men's Wearhouse encourages a fun work environment."
good,"Great place "
good,Men's warehouse was probably one of the best jobs I've had. My managers were great! My co-workers (except one) were great! My job was just overall great!
good,"Basic customer service; assisting customers with their wedding needs, listening and understanding customers needs and wants for their special day"
good,"Men's Wearhouse provided a great opportunity to serve others and improve myself."
good,"A typical day's work consists of assisting customers with their various needs, such as setting up and selecting colors and styles of tuxedos for their wedding party, following up with them up until their event, measuring and outfitting them to make sure their tuxedo fits properly, and troubleshooting and trying to put out any customer service issues we may have in a considerate and professional manner. Working at a high paced environment such as this, I have learned the art of multi-tasking, but at the same time making the customer feel comfortable and not like they are being rushed. I have also learned a wide range of different customer service needs and how to resolve them properly because of how  many different types of people I see on a daily basis. The management are well seasoned, well trained, and quick on their feet which is definitely something to admire in a managerial position. I would say the most difficult part of the job would have to  be not being able to please everyone that walks through the doors. Sometimes there are instances where a customer will come and not find what they are looking when they had high hopes and a certain vision for their big day, and it saddens me when we can not fulfill their requests. On the other hand, we have far more happy and thrilled customers that leave the store and to see them happy and excited about their wedding brings me so much joy!"
good,"The company is great to work for, the employees are very friendly, managers are always helpful and concerned about their employees."
good,Day to day operations of the retail store. the main goal is to increase the revenue of the store and region through account penetration and acquisition of new personal and business accounts. Going above and beyond to resolve customer service issues to resolve client satisfaction.
good,"Fun place to work, not your typical retail experience. Lots of opportunity for growth and development. Focus in retail, sales, human resources and training."
good,"My typical day at work will start off with my team we will rock paper scissors to see who will go to wegmans for sweets before the opening of the store."
good,Working at a MW is working with business and family. When its time to work its time to work but when its time to play they surely know how to have a good time. You spend so much time together you and your co workers grow a bond.
good,"It is hands on and the work environment was great. great benefits, and management was a huge help. Managers helped as much as they could, and kept us busy"
good,It has been a pleasure working for Men's wearhouse. I enjoyed working with team oriented fellow employees and supervisors. I had wonderful experience on doing fast paced inventory of tuxedos.

good,"managers dont do their jobs"
good,"A typical day at work can be busy or very relaxed; Great customers who receive great customer service. There is definitely room for advancement with this company and mostly everyone is cross trained. management has a lot on their plate which can deteriorate the passion for the job, but over all it has been a very good experience. Your coworkers are like family, and in many senses actually are!"

good,"A good place to start."
good,The 6 years of face to face interaction skills has helped me a lot.
good,the Men's Wearhouse taught me to work together as a team and lean more about what the customer wants or needs. I also learned how to use my time management skills for there were grooms men who would come in the store in bulks. the management and sales team all worked great together and made the customers feel like family.
good,"Booking Wedding parties, Quinceañera, and Black Tie Dinner parties on a daily basis."
good,"restocking displays ,enjoyed assisting in putting appearl together for customers when purchaes were made."
good,"I would help the Wardrobe consultants set up presentations to customers to up sell them into combinations of shirts, ties, and coats that would go good with the suit they picked out. I learned Top Down Sales and assumptive sales.  Management was very informative on how to do such sales practices. Hardest part was closing but learned a lot on that. I really enjoyed being apart of a sale that closed."
good,Fun place to work. Loved the people and the customers we had. Helping pick out the tuxes for someone's wedding is more fun than I thought it would be. Great benefits and perks.
good,It was a neat place and that company had good managers and co-workers . the hardest part of job was putting the boxes in the truck at the cold place but still was a good job . I learned packing restocking scanning and shipping .  the most enjoyable part of job was competition between co-workers to get reward for their job .

good,"Coordinate numerous in-store and off-site promotional events."
good,"Tailors work closely with store management, Wardrobe Consultants, and Sales Associates to provide a positive, unique, fun shopping experience for our customers.  The role of a tailor is primarily insuring the proper fit, marking, altering, and pressing of garments.  Tailors also contribute to the operation of a store by participating in the creation of a high-quality and respectful work environment"
good,"Men's Wearhouse was a great experience, and company to be apart of.  Besides the positive support of fellow co workers and management, face to face encounters with various individuals rewarded a unique experience with each person."
good,"The company likes their employees to have a good time. They take care of them with major holidays off, holiday party, vacation time for pt/ft employees."
good,"I'm sure it's different from store to store (maybe?), but my experience has been pretty good. The employee purchase options are great. The CSA bonuses on tux rentals have been approx. a 15% (of my weekly part-time check) bonus!"
good,Good Basic operation. A little laid back and even keeled. Very diverse employee base.
good,"This is mainly a sales job, but the selling is that difficult, i will say as long as you have a functional team behind you, this job can be fairly easy"
good,Men's Wearhouse is a very good place to work and they really care about their employees. The best part of the job is helping a customer who knows nothing about suits and helping them look their very best and get the best fit that they need.
good,"Menswearhouse is a fun place to work. Nice opportunity to build business within business. Great human resources. You, just have a feeling the human resource people are getting the job done."
good,Great company to work for but the pay structure has recently changed and I can't live off of what I am being compensated with. The workload has increased and pay has decreased.
good,"I love this company, it was a fast paced environment during the weekends and around prom and summer which is when weddings usually take place. The employees are very nice and caring, they are very helpful and provide tips on how to be better at what you do. Overall, this is a great place to work"
good,"Great people when I was there, and great atmosphere. Everyone was so helpful and easy going! It’s great for college students who need a easy part-time job while in school."
good,"This was a great company to work for for my first 12 years. After the owner was removed, the company started going down. The company started to loss money after purchasing other companies. All incentives was taken away from the employees. The stocks went from $80 a share to $4 a share. The company was planning to eliminate the transportation part of the business. Th"
good,Great place if your working in a high volume store. Low volume you will make mediocre wages. The company was a better place to work but is in a slow decline
good,Was the greatest learning and development of my retail career. started when the company was small (80) stores to watch it grow to be the largest mens formal retailer in the US.
good,"After a couple years in the retail trenches at previous jobs I thought I was a pro, but I had to lose the ego pronto once I started at TMW. Every store is different, but mine threw me to the wolves and expected me to make quick, high-quality decisions and understand how other people made theirs. I got in trouble a few times, but my manager never gave up on me and ended up crafting me into a high performer. In the end you're just selling clothes; it's simple when you think about it, but at some point it starts to feel like an art form."
good,Relaxing easy job to advance in.  If you're young and looking to get experience in sales this is the place for you.  You will be working most days of the week and the hours can be random.
good,My experience at MW was positive!  I’m highly customer service oriented so for that I excelled.   For a retail store I was paid very well and the benefits were phenomenal. I was able to take a couple vacations a year and intermittent days off in between. The culture can be petty but that’s many places.
good,I was a salesman and I measured individuals. I learned how to deal with customers and learned different sales tactics. I enjoyed working there and being able to speak to people.
good,"Everything except the shifts is what makes this a great job. If you're looking for a 9-5 Monday through Friday job, however, this certainly is not it."
good,"You may occasionally be asked to work in a store a far distance away.."
good,Fast paced and a little stressful especially during prom season. You get a pretty awesome discount which really helps you build your wardrobe and the managers always have your back.
good,"For me was all, and it was fun, I love it because I have a great memories of Men's Wearhouse, a place where I learned all about retail, and Customer Service, Cashier, deposits, counting merchandise, scanning etc., my manager super patient, and nice is really a great place to be at, it really have the door open to anybody, no big deal, all it was easy, a good image and environment! "
good,"I has been lots of ups and downs over he years.  Most of the managers try to be reasonable.  As far as the customer service, there are good and bad days."
good,"I was young when I started here but I learned so much about presentation. Awesome company parties, great contests and easy spiffs. Enjoyed my managers and I wish I had kept my career there if it wasn't for going to class for welding."
good,"A great day for me was helping a soon to be groom and bride pick out tuxedos and vest to accommodate the braids wedding dress, and the groomsmen to match the bridesmaids."
good,"You work hard everyday, but the people you work with make it worth it. Plus in the down time you might even get to play a little ping pong. Very competitive but in a good way."
good,"It was an on and off kind of job. Sometimes there would be people looking to buy and then there are days that no one comes by at all. Sometimes, it was fun working, but most of the time, we were always standing doing nothing."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of consulting, fitting and ordering suits and tuxedos for wedding and prom groups. Also selling tuxedos, shoes and professional accessories for a commission. I learned how to multi-task and overcome being overwhelmed. I also learned how to speak spanish due to the demographic of clientele in that specific location by practicing small words with potential customers. The management at the location was very helpful and attentive to my needs as a new employee. They made sure I was properly trained and prepared for the influx of customers to be served. The hardest part of the job was the prom season, being understaffed with almost an entire high school to consult, fit and order tuxedos was a very trying task. Although I was able to weather the storm I would not wish a work environment such as that on my worst enemy. The most enjoyable part of the job were the pictures and stories satisfied customers returned with along with their rentals!"
good,Things changed a lot when the founder and CEO George was let go. Felt the company was going down hill after he left. Stayed for 4 years and saw to many changes. Loved my job just didn't love the company ladder
good,This is a really good job to start with no experience as well as to start your career with. They have great benefits as well as great job advancement.
good,Have been there for years and really enjoy the people. Meet and greet with customers and build relationships with those customers to create a residual business.
good,"-Greeting customers, putting away stock, helping customer with needs and wants, answering phones calls, and cleaning duties "
good,"Basically clean the santuary floors and seats.  Dust the tables, clean the bathroom. Make sure all the bathrooms are looking nice and clean ."
good,Great work environment and loved the people I worked with. Great training in the company. Very busy and fast pace. Always something to do. Potential growth in the company and promotions within. Loved giving great customer service and building relationships with my customers.
good,"Men's Wearhouse is a wonderful company. I can't say enough about the company. Upper level management cares about every level of staff. The company pushes a fun and light environment, even through slow seasons by providing things like mini pool tables and ping pong tables for the staff. Commissions were great, I learned a lot about the businessman attire and the businessman as a whole."
good,"The people I worked with at The Men's Wearhouse are some of the nicest and most giving I have ever worked with. The job is fun, fast paced, and you get to work with a lot of different people."
good,Fun working environment.  Entry-level sales compensation.  Balance of work and home life is terrible as with any retail position.
good,"A basic traditional company to work for. You are not overworked, the stress level is minimal, and you enjoy the people you work with."
good,The Men's Wearhouse has been a great experience. I have learned how to work with all types of customers and employees. The Men's Wearhosue teaches their employees the important concept of team work by fostering a team environment.
good,"I have had the privilege to work at a store with management that I consider family.  i am trusted with opening, closing, and training new associates. i do daily inventory, bank trips for the deposits, book weddings, measure children and men for wedding or special events. hardest part of the job is prom season. it is our most impacted season. extremely busy, however i enjoy it."
good,"A typical day began with taking our deposit to the bank. As the manager, I would walk through the store to inspect it's appearance and the completion of any tasks left for employees the prior evening. The day included both walk-in retail shoppers and customers who had appointments to select their wedding garments."
good,"Since joining Men's Wearhouse almost 12 years ago, I have been able to grow professionally and also expand the positions that I filled.   Not only have I been able to expand my positions, but I was afforded the opportunity to transfer into a more challenging department with increased responsibility and a higher level of accountability, which has pushed me to new levels of performance.  I was able to achieve this all the while enjoying a very diverse and fun culture that provided a fun and exciting work environment."
good,I didn't have the chance to work here as much as I wanted to since I had my job at Tender Greens but overall TMW was awesome
good,"Assist daily operations"
good,"Fun and competitive work environment."
good,Great work environment and friendly staff. would not recommend a CSA position though if you're expecting to make any real money.
good,"Open and close stores and daily paper work and daily UPS drops as well as two trucks a week. Run three separate businesses under one roof. Sales floor, Tuxedo rental, and a full service tailor shop."
good,"I enjoy meeting the customers, talking to them and helping them out. The job requires less labor and more brain work. You have to know the Oracle system, all of the rental item codes, how to measure, how to track down items not in the store, tailoring, displays, cleaning, making calls for groomsmen/wedding parties to come. It's ALOT! Too much for the little I'm being paid. It's nice to work at in high school but now that I have real bills, I need a better job. Great part time for extra money but not to pay bills. I've worked at a store on the East & West Coast. Both had happy vibes :)"
good,"Celebrities would come in the store on occasion"
good,"My almost two years experience at Mens Wearhouse has shown me so many different doors that I could open. I am currently an assistant manager and one day hope to be a manager but they only problem is that the people that work for this wonderful company will never leave without retirement so my chances are very small to get advancement at my current store. The company has given my the option to move to another store but I can't drive further into Columbus because I am starting to have a family and would like to stay closer to home. A typical day at work starts by opening the store and making sure everything is ready to start the day. Then as my employees show up for a days work I begin to help customers and tasks that need to be done day to day. I have learned so much from this job because I have never worked a commission based job before so learning how to sell without being pushy and still giving customers the experience they deserve. As a manager I am very important to that store because the location that I am in has three stores in one. First the retail department store, then the retail store for tuxes, and finally the tailoring shop each part of this store has to run smoothly because one part of the store falls apart the whole store suffers and the employees. the hardest part of my job is customer service issues. because there are three parts to the store I have to be in three places at once some days plus trying to make sales for my own commission. each customer is unique and could have the same problem just in different parts of the store so sometimes it is hard to please"
good,"I worked for this company for 4 years in various positions. I would have to say they are one of the better companies to work for making the forbes fortune 100 and fortune 500 list. They pay well, offer insurance, 401k and many other assistance programs as well. They have an open door policy regarding problems and disputes, They also do lots of things during the year for their employees and their families such as the company Christmas party, the summer picnic and several team building meetings and outings each year. It is pretty easy and fair trying to move up in the company and if you show a genuine interest and drive they will train you and work with you to  succeed. With stores nationwide and even in Alaska and Hawaii there are lots of opportunities."
good,"Excellent company to work for, good values nice people, family atmosphere, I was just not making enough money."
good,The Men's Wearhouse has been the best retail company I have worked for. They keep their employees up to date with current trends via training. They also offer great benefits.
good,You learn great people skills along with how to dress classy.  I loved working there great people and benefits!

good,* Helping many customers for all types of events
good,Help customers with weddings and kids with prom suites also count and handled large deposits of cash
good,"I would not want to make a career out of The Men's Wearhouse, but it is a good place to work while I am finishing my degree. They are flexible with your schedule, which is nice. And if you want to be in sales then it is a good company to work for. There are a lot of advancement opportunities for individuals that excel in sales."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and making sure everything has been done the night before. Getting shipment in and making sure it is put up and neatly displayed. Customers are our number one priority so whenever one comes in they have our undevided attention.
good,"Great coworkers, very innovative, pride themselves on customer service. Been working there a long time you learn something everyday. The managers are so dedicated to pushing you to succeed."
good,"I catch up on the stuff from the day before such as associate issues, customer issues, audits, stats, training, etc. This job taught me basic alteration skills and how to be a better version of myself. Management is a joke because they don’t care about all aspects of their team. They are not involved in new hire training, resolving store issues, they don’t have anyone’s back but their own. The workplace is chill, thebut it’s hard to deal with the customers sometimes if you’ve already had a day with the manager. The hardest part of the job is finding the energy to go to put up with your boss and their lies. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping brides and grooms make their pictures look the best!"
good,This company is the best to work for when looking for job security. Great environment & versatile group of employees. Great opportunity to move up in the corporate ladder.
good,"Safe, comfortable work environment.Caring and considerate staff.Trained for multiple jobs so the day is never boring.Always a chance for advancement. Open door policy."

good,"Love this job got laid off due to job statewide job cuts. Awesome team work. Supportive company,,, Great  advantages and holiday perks for employees/hardship assistance"
good,"I have learned how to take measurements of a person for a tux and a suit. "
good,"The hardest part of the job is prom season, as it gets tremendously busy. Other than that the job can be very easy once learning the ins and outs of the suit business. It becomes fun helping people put together outfits for business and events."
good,"Working for this company has a lot of perks.  Healthcare benefits are amazing for full time employees, as well as friends and family discounts.  With the company expanding it has given the company a bigger family and opportunities."
good,"Internal Promotion opportunity for good sales performance.  Great place to grow and learn the fundamentals of sales and management.  Employer paid benefits, relocation ability, and performance driven culture."
good,"men's wearhouse was the first job i had. i started working there when i was 17 and stayed there until i was almost 19. it was super easy and prom season was fun!!!!!! the managers were serious yet friendly, and they would always go out of their way to help, buy lunch for us after a rush, and were flexible with scheduling. the most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. we had to maintain a positive attitude as most couples coming into the store were getting married and we had to match their excitement. taking the guys measurements was a piece of cake. cooperation was easy, even with little boys. i never had grumpy customers and almost never had a bad day. the hardest part of the job was getting used to taking measurements. it took a long time for me to figure out which chest size goes with which jacket size, etc. also, learning and memorizing the styles of the tuxedos and patterns of vests and whatnot was difficult, but they provided lookbooks and other materials to help. they were not very generous with pay or benefits -- but i was only in high school so $120 a week was awesome!!!"
good,This is my longest job and I love a lot of things about the job and there are some things that discourage me.The people I work with make this job a lot easier than it is. Retail is never fun work but my teammates help me through each day and I hope I do the same for them. The only negative is the compensation that is provided to some employees and for myself. It seems that corporate has some greedy mindsets with the changes that have been made to this company. Non the less it has been a great experience being apart of the Wearhouse.
good,I actually got to work at a few different stores and everything great the management is great and sales are actually pretty good! the only issue I had was working more hours and more pay...
good,"a typical work day, busy certain times of the year, some of the best co-workers/colleagues. apart of management as management you were able to travel."

good,I started working at Men's Wearhouse sophomore year of high school and it was very easy to learn and understand how things work. Offers many opportunities to move up into management
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning the store and making sure everything is tidy and clean of the customers. I've learned that the customer is always correct, no matter how difficult someone is, you've got to make them happy in the end, or at least try to. My manager and co-workers, I got along with very well, they were all very polite and friendly. I truly enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was seeing people who either couldn't afford something, or me not being able to meet their needs, for example, if something wasn't in stock and they needed that certain product the next day. There was nothing in my power that I could do for the customer, but that was defiantly the hardest part about the job. The best part of my job was when people found the perfect thing, they were so happy. I enjoy helping people and making sure their customer service needs are met. I know whenever I go to a store, I appreciate when a sales associate goes out of their way for me to help me find the perfect product. That's why I enjoyed helping people find certain products to suit their needs."
good,"Great place to work! They offer a very competitive benefits package that includes some great things that other places don't offer. The company also does several things throughout the year that are expenses paid, team building activities, such as a multi store christmas party where they give out awards, a company picnic the employees can bring family to, and other events as well."
good,"Great company to work for. Their motto is ""Our employee's are our first customers."""
good,Always welcoming and very well-rounded company to work for. Management was very open and very friendly and listen to your needs as a worker.
good,"My day to day duties include resolving pending issues on deliveries, reconciling discrepancies, and analyzing inventory losses. Management allows you to control your day to day duties without micromanaging your desk. The hardest part of my job is making sure people understand that I am working with them, not against them and the purpose of my job is to control shrink. I love training and making sure people are aware of preventable measures that help control inventory losses."

good,Men's warehouse was a great way for me to improve my customer service skills and just general communication skills. During my times there I got really good at selling and acquired formal wear for interviews.
good,"Great company with great benefits. Work is relaxed, fun, and competitive with great chance for bonuses. Parties are part of the culture and most stores have a TV in store or something like a pool or pingpong table."
good,I worked for men's wearhouse for 12 years. My dad worked there for 31 years and retired comfortably. My whole life was revolved around this company and is still welcoming to me to this day.  I grew up with this company.
good,"For those looking for the kind of work that moves on your pace and easy to understand, then yes i definitely recommend this place to you. "

good,"Your typical day at work is busy. Lots customers and things to do. But, you are always laughing and enjoying your work with your coworkers. They are almost your family, they look out for you. The management was great! When I messed up my manager would always tell me in the best way possible, she never yelled or belittled me. All of her criticism was more like friendly advice and in turn that really helped me to excel in everything that I did. I really learned how to take criticism in stride. Instead of overthinking it, I would just take it in and adapt myself."

good,Great staff & fun environment. Holiday Parties and pay increase periodically. Very reasonable company to work for. Tuition reimbursement is also available.
good,"I loved the customers and helping them make their events the best they could be.

good,"Company believes in self discovery.  Men's wearhouse creates an environment for customer and employees to enjoy.  As a manager, you are held accountable for your own sales goals along with the entire store.  The company spends more time training in sales rather than ""management""."
good,"I have worked for Men's Wearhouse in TX and CO and so far the best management experience I have ever had was in TX. I had trouble with vehicle at the time and getting to work. The manager there took onto himself to talk with higher up management within the company to find a way to help me fix my vehicle still having to pay back. That there is great management also not only that the management in that area had great communication as well as did not go off of favoritism, actually saw potential in their employees and the management in that particular store fought for those particular employees."

I would take their measurements for the purpose of finding the proper fit. After suit(s) is selected, a tailor would do a fitting with the customer. After the fitting, I would present several choices of shirts, ties, shoes and accessories that will best compliment the customer's suit(s) selection. I learned from my experience how to dress for the occasion at had with confidence that I too will ""like the way I look"". Unlike my furniture sales experience, everyone at the Men's Wearhouse was encouraged to offer input or assistance to facilitate the sale and enhance the customer experience if it is all helpful. I enjoyed the team concept way of selling. The hardest thing to do was finding something for someone that was pare shaped or very athletic."

good,"Men's Wearhouse was and amazing job because it teaches you that professional side to a work environment. I dressed up and went to work everyday always with a positive outlook. Always on top of sales, and trying to get every customer to at least buy one thing, with the amazing sales we had. The hardest part of the job was probably taking the measurments because its a little hard to get at first. But when you get the hang of it you can literally eyeball each customer thats coming into the store and know their size. Also I tried to make sure of mannequins looked presentable so that would attract more people into coming in and maybe even wanting to buy what they seen on the mannequin. To me a great sales leader just needs a good tactic."
good,I assisted customers with purchasing merchandise as well as setting up wedding parties. I assist with selecting perfect wedding colors for their big day.

There was a strong sense of putting the customer first, and making sure that we we whatever it is we need to do to give the customer the best experience possible. Management from the top down was very personable and they were always listening to their employees thoughts and concerns. This enabled everyone to feel as if they had a voice and that everyone's opinion mattered no matter what role you played in the company. The job itself wasn't hard at all but making sure the customer felt comfortable and left happy was the goal and great training from above helped us to reach that. The most enjoyable part about working for this company is that everyday was new, and that diversity was accepted and celebrated."
good,My very first job ever. I couldn't have asked for a better first job. The atmosphere was a step above most retail but generally the same experience.
good,"A typical day at the men’s wear house was full of excitements. Some days less busy then other. But we always found something to do. Something really important that I learned while working here was that, customers are first and they always right. However it is satisfying to see a happy customer. My coworkers were polite friendly and helpful, and some how competitive. The hard part of the job was the long hours standing. and when it was really busy moving around all day"
good,"Been working with them 1.5 yrs...great so far. Great environment,  good team. It is retail, so hours can vary. Customers can be challenge, but just have to keep going.  Sometimes the task are alot, but again its Retail.  If you have worked in that field then you can handle it."
good,"- Hit or miss"
good,The day started with a meeting and stretching. Then job duties were distributed and we were assigned to our areas. As soon as I got to my station I had to set up the computer and make sure I had tools and equipment for my day. Each order was reviewed carefully to make sure that all of them were complete and no mistakes. The order was rapped up and sent to be put on truck.
good,"They are not about employee moral, but every man for them selves. So if you are looking for a company that you can grow with then you might want to choose a different company."
good,"Mens Wearhouse is a comfortable exciting place, brings lots of happiness helping costumers plan an important day (weddings,proms,interview,christenings,ect.). The employees all were very nice and easy to work with. an average day was to book weddings by setting up the info for all the groomsmen renting tuxedos, taking measurements,picking styles and color to compliment the bride,groom, and wedding scheme, fitting the men in tuxedos, and taking deposits. the hardest thing to deal with was during prom season when most products are in such high demand, some orders that came into the store for pick-up did not have the correct style,size, or color which does not go well for the costumers; it does teach you how to deal with certain situations so everyone can be happy when they leave the store. management was always nice and respectful to those in position under them; i would just say the actual company higher up who make any changes to the company and its opportunities can tend to get over on you."
good,I really do enjoy workking here! Its been sucha great 3 years! highly Recommend
good,"I enjoyed working at Mens wearhouse, but most of this came from the great store team. At a corporate level, I regularly questioned decisions and management; but they are trying to make it a better place of employment."
good,I really like the mens wear house.not only did i learn ways to maximize each and every sale i learned very good selling techniques that i will forever use in all my endeavors of retail sales in the future.i have been. trained to be a very valuable asset to the retail industry.thanks to the mens wear house.
good,This is a great job for students or college students anyone looking for retail experience. Great customers great management benefits to move up depending on location. Company hosts parties and conferences / events to involve all store locations and create a sense of community
good,I enjoyed what I did when I got to help someones visions become a reality for their big day and the customers that I got to work with. It's always changing and fun.
good,You take clients throughout the day.  Clientele were mainly interested in buying suits or slacks for work or for events like weddings.  I learned to love customer service and sales process.  Customers were always coming in.  There wasn't too much down time to take a break or eat lunch.  Product knowledge including fit and size for each customer was extremely important.  The key to making more money was to up sell customers beyond $600.  I had a variety of managers and ultimately became one myself.  The customer service and sales positions are entry level so people can be hired with a wide variety of skills.  Sometimes management felt more like baby sitting than selling clothes and I was still expected to sell the most in the store even as a manager.  Everybody at the store seemed to get along even if there was differences.  The hardest part of the job was the ever changing schedules which could change week to week especially when folks wanted to take vacations during the summer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers who you could genuinely  help find the best size and fit for that they can't get anywhere else besides a high end clothing shop.
good,"Very fun filled enviroment. Help get groomsmen and young fellas together for either weddings or proms. The little time I worked here I enjoyed all, but one person, and she is what made the work experience a horrible one."
good,"Great place to work, however hard to become permeant staff, seasonal work is available every year  for at least 9 months pay is minimum but the company itself is great."
good,"Great and fun job, not that great of pay. "
good,"As an employee of MW, I've found the differences in people depending on the locations. I've met employees from several states up North that made me have appreciation for the store I worked at. The guys I worked with were extremely appreciative of everything you did and always found a reason to appreciate and congratulate you for. The manager could always work with your schedule and was more help and hand than any manager I could ask for. He never yelled, or spoke down to his employees and could talk to you in ways that made you feel comfortable and at ease. He wanted to create leaders, and he did just that."
good,"I loved my job, from my co-workers to my managers, just the care was enough to be there If I was considered to return I would definitely take the job."
good,"Working for the Men's Warehouse has been a wonderful experience. All the staff works in a very honest and team-oriented environment, which makes the work day and the operation go smoothly on a daily basis."
good,"Bosses that treat you with respect and working with co-worker that work with you as a team.Hardest part is to move up in company. The enjoyable part, is that we like to party each month."
good,Knowledgeable job to learn about formal wear. Helpful and positive management. Co-workers all work together to help get obstacles out the way and make job smoother throughout the day. Very fast paced job. Need good multi-tasking skills.
good,"This store had great management, it was an encouraging atmosphere. The team as a whole worked well together and helped each other when necessary."
good,"I would book weddings. "
good,Company was good and fair. Co-workers were nice and friendly for the most part. Worked well together.
good,IT professional. Interacted with systems users on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my user community and my coworkers. The hardest part was lack of advancement opportunities. Management was OK. I gained a lot of experience in financials software.
good,Tailored brands LLC is a customer obsessed company. It used to be employee obsessed. Some benefits have been lost and the corporate competition has allowed that personal touch to be lost but overall a great company to work for.
good,Cleaning up and waiting for customers to come in. Merchandising inventory and making displays for sales associates. Shipping items to other stores. Receiving inventory and stocking the sales floor.
good,Great place to work!  You will learn how to work as a team in order to build sales and hit store revenue.  This is a fast pace environment and requires everyone to be organized.  The hardest part of this job is when the company wants to achieve so many different thing from so many angles without evaluating the pressure it puts on the store teams.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the joy on customers faces in their new suits.
good,It was fun learning sales and how to sell retail and clothes in bunches. However highly over priced in my own opinion and doesn’t carry many updated brands.
good,"Men's Warehouse is a wonderful place to work if you don't mind having to work with ignorant people coming in assuming that they know more than you."
good,"I had a really great manager and everything ran smoothly when he was there, although some coworkers really did not do their fair share of work."
good,"The people in my store were like a tight-knit family.  We had each other's backs, and had flexibility to accommodate for family and education."
good,"Every day we take care of customers needs. Most people are in need of something particular at the Men's Wearhouse. That is what sets us aside from most retails stores. We have to take an initial need and maximize the sale based on the questions we ask the customer. The questions relate to the initial need but also the lifestyle of the customer. This helps us to determine what is best to offer a customer, what price range a customer is willing to spend and gives us credibility when we offer something that the customer didn't ask for. For example if I sell a suit for a customer who has an interview, I am also going to suggest to him shoes, shirt and a power tie. If I ask the customer what he does for fun and he likes to golf, I may suggest a polo and docker type slacks to him for his days on the course. It only makes sense to make our store a one stop shop for all men. Especially because most of them do not like to shop. on top of that I have to manage inventory coming in and out of the store Monday through Friday. I have floor awareness of customers that are being taken care of and employees that might be in need of assistance. I have to multitask. I have to delegate tasks to employees, observe and give constructive feedback. Plus I have to maintain all of this while keeping the highest average ticket in the store. My coworkers are wonderful. We spend most of the time laughing about work experiences. When it's time to help customers are clean and maintain store upkeep, we work together to get the job done without cutting corners. We watch each others backs and bring issues to"
good,"•	Prepare daily inventory of tuxedoes for the store"
good,"Excellent management , only the best of the best learned alot of skills that i take with me to this day"
good,"Welcome to retail!  Nights, weekends & holidays are the best times to sell.  Your potential customers usually do not work and they are ready to buy or spend money with family.  "
good,"I enjoy working here, I've learned alot and continue to learn new things about the suits, tuxedo rentals, the etiquette. Everyone at this job feels like family, we work hard together and get alot done especially on busy days. Some days are usually the same we just clean, dust, organize as well as tuxedo fittings and our day to day sales."
good,"Great retail experience as well as knowledge about fashion and how to dress properly, Learn how to measure and size people. Great cultural environment and many people to meet."
good,"Staff are very easy to work with. More of a friends and family environment. Nothing really to hard to the job, just patience with the process of learning the requirements."
good,"Working at Men's Wearhouse can be a very rewarding professional and social experience whereby, you get to interact with people from different backgrounds"
good,"This location of work is great for those who would like to gain some work experience. Management was great and supportive, but you are thrown into some scenarios where they would like to see how you handle the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see a couple leave the store with a smile on their face because they have one less thing to stress about for their wedding day."
good,"Men's Wearhouse welcomed me with open arms, and helped shape me into the business man I am today. The company has changed over the years, and that's why I'm looking for a career change."
good,I enjoyed my time there for the most part. I was constantly moving around and learning about the luxury clothing lines. I liked being apart of one of the most important days in others lives
good,Working here is never boring. So much to do and learn every single day regardless of how long you have worked there. Many challenges that prepare you for advancement whether you stay within company or decide to move on to another company.
good,I love working for the Men's Wearhouse. It's too bad the pay or hours aren't what I need. We have fun while working and I truly enjoy my co-workers as well as my boss and RM.
good,I been at the Men's Wearhouse for over a decade and I have enjoyed the advancement but I have not been compensated for the years work. Advancements are more if your part of the crew and liked over qualified for it.
good,It was a great job with a great learning experience. I like all of my coworkers and managers a lot and I developed several friendships while I was employed there.
good,professional work environment that greatly improves multi-tasking and speaking tone. It can get very competitive seeing as the pay scale is commission based. Small number of coworkers so effective team work is what really shines.
good,It is a great first place to work at if you have never worked before. You learn how to be quick on your feet and to deal with different types of customers. It was an over all great experience and i enjoyed working there. I only wish there was room to grow with the company.
good,Fun place to work. Flexible shifts and hours. Part time and full time. Healthcare benefits. Paid time off and vacation days. Sick pay. Floating holidays also.
good,"No matter how slow or busy the days get, your shift would always fly by because there is always something to do. Throughout the busy seasons were the best, from prom season to wedding season all year round, you get the exercise you need daily just by working here."
good,I personally didn't mind working at Mens Wearhouse. The manager was really nice but didn't notice a lot of the drama that was created in the atmosphere. I was also young at the time and the drive was not worth the amount of money I was making.
good,"Fairly easy, but my store didn't have many employees so when i was sick i had to work on sick days. Also they pay minimum wage which sucks and they take out so much from pay check."
good,"amazing advancement opportunities, love this place overall. I travelled and went to different stores to work and made great friends along the way. Corporate management in the Texas region know what they are doing and you can learn a lot from this job!"
good,"I worked as a tuxedo rental associate. Pretty fun place to work, everyone gets along, customers are interesting because you mostly deal with wedding parties."
good,"I enjoyed the work environment, at times it may get stressful but its  great job. The job is relatively easy, as a csa you are in charge of booking weddings and ringing up the sales for the wardrobe consultants."
good,"Every March, Chesapeake Bay Academy's high school students go out and work at a job to get experience while putting something together at the same time. I did Men's Wearhouse in my Junior Year and it was pretty fun for the most part but was excited about the Tuxedo rental department."
good,The company has great employees working for a company that prides itself on world class customer service. Typical retail hours with night and weekend hours.
good,The hardest part of the job is making sure you stay on top of your quality scores an make sure you provide world class customer service and nothing less.
good,Best work place ever. Nice atmosphere and nice people. What I learned while working here is to do my best and give everything my all.
good,"When the team works together in a cohesive unit, amazing things get accomplished. Lone wolf types won't fit in too well."
good,"The daily fun for consultants are getting to know people from all walks of life, secret service agents, actors, doctors, blue collar and white collar people. It is an ever growing environment with heart touching people. This is the only company I ever worked at were I felt like I wasn't just a number. If you need motivation, Chaseray Harvey can do it in person or from a phone call."
good,"Been there for 20+ years, been great knowing I've heaped create a culture that has fostered the growth of many both professionally and personally.  Many team mates will be life long friends.  Amongst the biggest challenges is hitting somewhat of a glass ceiling for growth and not fulfilling the desire to do more beyond what I currently do to fully leverage what I believe are advanced skill sets and my educational background."
good,This job was not challenging me. My background is accounting and I love working with numbers. I have learned how to be patient with customers and customers are always right. Great management team here and everyone was a team player. My most enjoyable moments are when I came get a customer to laugh with me and I have the ability to persuade customer to buy more items.
good,Learned a lot about clothes in a great working environment.
good,basic days is prepare everything u need to work we roll call do team stretches head to station log in cpu prepare station scan suits 3 breaks 20 mins and 30 min lunch
good,At this job I was the floor tech. I worked six to seven days a week. I enjoyed this job because I made my schedule. fast learner and a hard worker
good,"The work environment is fun and feels like family; however, having worked at multiple stores I can say that they can be managed very differently."
good,"Fantastic Company. Always listed in Forbes in ""Top 100 Companies to Work For."" I'm interested, however, in getting back into an office environment."
good,"Able to balance home and work very well. There was a discount on clothing,great people to work with."
good,Make sure your vocal with the customers. This job requires you to stand on your feel all day so wear comfortable shoes. Be punctual and ready to work when you clock in.
good,"1.Today a great place to work.The company has a whole was ran and the employee s were paid a fair wage for the service provided. The new location is better now, and is outside the mall it's self."
good,The company really takes care of their employees. It's a fun company to work for with good benefits. The atmosphere is laid back for being a formal retail company.
good,"I was a Tuxedo Rental Consultant for Men's Wearhouse. I helped people rent tuxedos and suits for their special occasions. I took experiences in helping others, problem solving, and color coordination into other aspects of my current job and helping others with the same outside of my work. Take care - if you work here, March to May is a crazy time and bridezillas are very volatile, but usually easy to talk down."
good,this place is a great place to work with a great corporate structure as well as a great company culture 10/10 would work for this company again no doubt about it.
good,"I love to hate working here.....great job, i love all my customers but dang the upper mgmt never improves. We need more sales people and they won't hire them but they hire managers that should be in a different position."
good,I enjoyed my time at Men's Wearhouse. It was a fun experience for me. I learned a lot about selling and formal wear. Their were opportunities to advance and I was able to learn job skills from multiple seminars that the company would hold at various location. They really helped you suceed!
good,Typical days are very easy. The hardest part of working there was staying cool during tense situations with grooms and brides shopping for outfits. If you can talk easily and fluently to customers along with staff you'll have an amazing time
good,learned how to be a better sales person. When to approach customers and know their need depending on the events they are attending . The company has a great training program
good,The Mens Warehouse was an excellent company to work for. They always have room to grow. Its fun because you get to be creative with helping the sales team put together suit and tie displays as well as helping couples coordinate their weddings.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working up through the ranks of this company. From customer service rep up through manager, I enjoyed every day working with talented individuals"
good,had TVs so when no one was in the store we got a little down time to watch march madness. Got to go on break if we had down time it was fun just to get to know everyone you worked with.
good,"If you are willing to put in the effort and buy into the corporate way of doing things and believe it and practice it you will do well.  The sales people that do not do well are the ones who insist on doing it their way.  The company treats you like you are a somebody and put a lot of money into your doing well.  If you fail, it's you not them."
good,Mens Wearhouse has wonderful products services and employees. With over one thousand stores there is a perfect fit out there for everyone. Best wishes
good,Awesome family environment. Easy to move up. Training was great. Management made you feel prepared and comfortable. Good place to enter into the workforce.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Good benefits and flexible hours. We all treat each other like family. Lots of opportunities for growth.
good,"Day to day functionality of the store consisted of stock moves, consulting and educating customers on fit and feel of product, as well as meeting individual and team sales goals."
good,this company has a great culture devloped around the employee being the focus; alot of company funds are spent on functions and promotions for the benefit of the hourly associate
good,"I enjoyed working at The Men's Wearhouse,.  There was always something fun and interesting to do."
good,"At Men's Wearhouse, I experienced a very professional work environment.  Management was helpful and my co-workers were very friendly."
good,This particular location was very slow paced. The hardest part of the job was meeting my sales quota due to lack of clientele.
good,Unfortunately I gave up on them too soon. This is a great place to work and some of the best people to work with in the Houston area. I never really heard a single person complain about The Men's Wearhouse and those were people that had been with the company 20+ years.
good,Work on daily task; learn different systems PeopleSoft and Quick books; familiar with Excel and Word; most of management were fair; enjoy working together with co-workers and training; is working without a department procedure manual. Coming to work daily.
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Cool Management, very outgoing staff very great at showing workers how much they care for us doing a great job"
good,Over all my experience at The Men's Wearhouse was a positive one. We had allot of fun in the store and with our customers. When we were not in peek selling seasons we had plenty of down time and would play with a football or with a table top ping pong ball set. It is a great place to gain work experience.
good,I enjoyed working at Men's Warehouse. The only downside to it was that it was a seasonal position and ended too quickly.
good,The Men's Warehouse is the best job I ever had.
good,"This was a consultant/sales position.I am a true people person. I loved talking to the brides about their wedding plans. My main objective was to consult with them about the attire for the wedding,and to get the account set up for The Mens Wearhouse to handle all the formal wear for the entire wedding party--this was cold calling which is the area where I really excel."
good,"Great Company,great people to work with,and always work as a team."
good,"I valued my time working at the Men's Wearhouse. It was one of the most satisfying and enjoyable positions for many reasons. The company was structured but encouraged a relaxed environment promoting personal potential. My position as administrative assistant for Director of Real Estate was particularly special because of the relationships we made between each other and the other team members that were located at various cities nationwide. When we got together for meetings, they were productive and lively and when we met informally, lots of fun."
good,I enjoy helping others and helping them choose their outfits for their event. I also help them with their wedding outfits. This job is more one and one with your customers which I appreciate.
good,My coworkers and I always worked as a team and helped each other out through out the day. We always kept a positive vibe around and always have each other a hand.
good,Great to talk and meet new people all over. Was able to grow with the company and got to see and create different things. This job has taught me a lot
good,"A good place to work. Management was OK. You were treated well. "
good,"I worked in the tuxedo rental shop and I thought it was fun! The tuxedo manager was the best and a really good instructor. Because I worked with rentals I assisted a lot of students going to proms or dances. Another batch of people you may encounter are people in a weeding such as the groomsmen. The atmosphere was great because the customers were always happy and friendly. Once they realize you care about their event (prom, wedding, etc.) a connection will be built and for the days, weeks, months leading up to and right after their event, y'all will be friends. I learned a lot about sales and processing orders. The general manager could have been better. I believe that he made the job a lot harder then it had to be. Be prepared to do a lot of cleaning and extra stuff. Otherwise, this job is great."
good,"Working with Men's Wearhouse taught me how to stock properly and taught me how to work with Operations."
good,"i enjoyed working here had a good time and would do it again. my boss was super nice and had a great group of guys working for me. "
good,"Given that its a customer service based job you can expect the usual drags of dealing with customers and hiding your true feelings towards them. However, there are perks to working for this specific company. Men's Wearhouse does care about its employees in many regards. The managers are very understanding of emergencies and work-life balance and never make you feel bad about asking for certain days off. They recognize a strong work ethic and usually listen to any concerns you may have. They promote from within which is great and rare given the competition in the job market. This can be advantageous for people looking to move up in the company. Benefits are great and most of the people are easy to get along with."
good,"In the rental department, I would help customers (mainly couples booking weddings) choose their suits and accessories for events. LOVED IT! Coworkers are super friendly, working environment is quick-paced and stressful at times, but very fulfilling."
good,I have learned have to be a better employee and manager to my employees. It is a very fast pace job and keeps you on your toes. The workers and customers make me love my job.
good,I really enjoyed working at the Men's Warehouse.  The customers were fantastic and the management is great.  The company gives you tons of resources to do a great job.  The training is top notch.  Very professional place to work.
good,The job is enjoyable. Working with a variety of customers can be enjoyable/challenging. Management does a good job of communicating and the hours can be flexible.
good,"The people I work with are wonderful. Everyone helps each other throughout the day. It's a real team atmosphere, we don't compete, we work together and support each other constantly."
good,"I'd do my best to make sure clothes were folded and organized nicely and in their proper place. I learned how men's sizes work and how to fix little issues creatively. The hardest part was trying to keep up with cleaning up all the clothes on the floor and everywhere. The most enjoyable part was simply organizing, which I love to do anyway."
good,Men's wearhouse is avery relaxed yet professional sales place. I would highly recommend this job to anyone trying to get their foot in the door with retail sales or entry level management.
good,Some days can be long but fun . Great environment to work at. Each day has it vibe. Cool people to work with. No room for advancement. Learn how to build people skills and work values
good,I worked at mens wearhouse for 2 years and I loved it. My managers were very personable and accommodating. I left to fulfill my apprenticeship at a funeral home.
good,"Great place for learning from the bottom."
good,"Hard work paid off. Hours are kind of weird but convient to customer to come and pick up things they made need last minute. "
good,I learned a lot of responsibilities here on my first job. A typical day would consist of me opening the store one hour before opening time to prep for sales.
good,"Warm and friendly environment with little standing-around time; employees are kept busy.  Hardest part is prom season - beware the Prom Moms.  Must measure men of all shapes and sizes, but none of the measurements are uncomfortable or compromising to do.  Must know how to set an unsure customer's mind at ease with detailed knowledge about products.  The small-business feel makes it a wonderful place to work, and gives plenty of opportunity to form friendships with fellow employees."
good,I enjoyed working here. I was employed with Men's Wearhouse for over 9 years. If someone is looking at the retail world this would be a good company to work for.
good,"My task were to load and unload trucks, sort through package for the department, hand pick threw merchandise , inventory, maintenance, prep packages for the outgoing store"
good,Really loved working at the Men's Warehouse.  My coworkers were amazing and so were my clients. Learned a lot about how to be a great leader and even to manage the difficulties of life.
good,I enjoyed my stay at menswear house depending on the different managers I worked with but generally I was ok because I know my job and could solve any fitting challenges and could handle all recuts I loved working at menswear house
good,"I have worked there for 4 years and love it but current management has me looking elsewhere. An average day will consist of helping customers putting stock away and dealing with other store jobs. I learned a lot about sales, management, and style. Saturdays they give you a free lunch but as time has gone the company has gotten more and more corporate making it a little less fun."
good,"At The Men's Wearhouse, I worked with Tuxedo rentals assisting couples in picking out color schemes and Tuxedos for upcoming events such as prom and weddings. I measure customers as well giving them precise numbers to what size suit or tuxedo they would need. Once we entered all the information into our systems, we go over all the disclaimers before we send them on their way. We periodically check up on our customers to make sure that everything and everyone is good to go."
good,"opening the store, planning the work schedule for the day,running reports, bank run and training. What I learned, is a new sales technique, going out to other business and involving them in our sells. Management, great upper management. Co-worker, just like any other company we have good and bad co-work,But its management responsibility to train them to be great co-workers. Hardest part of the job, when other management fall short in their daily routine. Most enjoyable part, the customers."
good,"We got to interact with customers to help them chose the right color for their wedding, the management and co-workers were easy to get along with, and was also a fun place to work for."
good,Fun work place great management team. Awesome customers. Really enjoy working with my collegues. There was a lot of variety in what I did daily.
good,"Everyone works as a team. Days are pretty easy, Booking weddings are exciting if you are into helping make things memorable for couples. Work with schedules and transfers if you move areas."
good,"The key is to over exceed customers expectations and up sale!"
good,managers are always helpful in most cases. they are understandable and always thankful for you work you do. co-workers are nice and funny very enjoyable people. this is a very nice place to work the hardest part about this job may be the standing for eight hours but other than that not to much to complain about.
good,This was oneof my best jobs. they we nice they treated me well.They even give you trainingif they see you need it. you get a certificate when you complete the training. Overall it was a good job. its a laidback place but it gets busy which makes the day go fast.
good,It was so much fun to work here! we also got free product and discounts!
good,A typical day was all commission and sales  and what I learned from management never under estimate a client and a sale. My co- workers was always working toward there goal and be the best sales person they can be. The hardest part of the job never knowing what your salary was because of commission  and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and large sales you could have with your own talent and fashion style.
good,I worked here for 5 years and up until the business closed it was the greatest place in the world to be.
good,MW is a great place to work.  Very demanding on a day to day basis.
good,I loved working at Men's Wearhouse and the people I even worked with.  I made a personal relationship with all of the people I worked with.  I would say the hardest part of my job was when I was in training but when I learned what I had to do I was great.  Whenever I had a question I was not ever hesitant to ask.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be when we had meetings and we all got together and discussed everything that we could do better but I would say we were a little family that tried to get along as much as possible.
good,"Mens wearhouse had great pay and great hours. My only complaints are that I felt a bit out of place because I didnt speak any spanish at all and the girls that were in my department always looked at me and spoke in spanish, I felt they were making fun of me."
good,Great place to work. Management was great and the benefits were good. I had a chance to learn so much with men's wearhouse.
good,"• Greet and Assist Customers with merchandise selection,"
good,It was a family style environment. I learned to work with a team as well as work on my own. Management was great because they always wanted to know how they can help you reach your goals. They also made sure I was well trained. I enjoyed educating the customer about the products and helping them find what they need.
good,Mean'swearhous is good company fun and famelar healp each other good management.I like to work here but by the case of family I need to change the city and they don't have open thare
good,The Men's Wearhouse is an excellent place to work to get experience in sales or even start a career there. I learned how to have great customer service etiquette. Staff and training are very helpful. They offer pretty good benefits as well.
good,"The job was a good time, when I was full-time, I really enjoyed it. Once I was full-time in school, it became a bit stressful but better then any food or other retail positions I have encountered."
good,My co-workers really made the job worth it. I enjoyed working with everyone and they made the days and time pass by faster when I worked seven hour shifts.
good,"Takes a minute to learn the craft of what your selling but once you learn different people and the job, it becomes easy and make you feel like that you can sell anything!!!"
good,I love my job here. It is extremely laid back. It's easy to learn and the other employees are extremely easy to work with. The pay isn't great but if you work hard then the chances of moving up are high and can happen fast.
good,"Great store for fashion sense and consideration. Very upbeat and welcoming. Typical day involves folding and stocking clothing, creating clothing sets for prospective customers, and seeing a sale through with friendly synergy."
good,I absolutely love working at my current store. Helping wedding couples pick outfits for their weddings and assisting customers purchase their first suit always keeps me busy. My current manager could not be a better human being to work with and create a wonderful place to work as a result. Phillip Schuld deserves an almost infinite amount of recognition.
good,"A relaxed work environment, good opportunities for advancement, and good pay. Coworkers that are friendly and helpful and even management that's willing to listen to ideas from below to improve store metrics and workflow. Men's Wearhouse is the best job I've ever worked."
good,start day in back kept busy thru out day makes day go by fast no complaints able to work part time and full time hours are great and managers are great and easy to talk to there enjoyed job
good,I learned a lot  in this company. The was opportunity for personal growth and advancement based on performance and ability not seniority and favortism. There was a sense of family between co-workers and multi-unit management.
good,I loved working with the people.  The regional manager was amazing and had a lot of knowledge.  He was given a couple of promotions and had an impressive work ethic. Seth gave everyone in the region something to strive for.
good,Employees were very friendly with family like atmosphere. Company provides good benefit package with option of buying a stock. Overall it is a good company to work for.

good,I liked working for men's wearhouse. the customers were great and the employees were great as well. They have great benefits. they are also flexible with school schedules.
good,Men's Wearhouse is a good company. The management is great. I definitely enjoyed my job there. It's a slow paced environment. would definitely recommend this company.
good,"Men's Wearhouse has been a positive and productive work environment, and the managers are very constructive, but encouraging. We help one another to make our sales goals while striving to meet our own. I have enjoyed the time I've worked at Men's Wearhouse, it has been a great learning experience."
good,"During my time at Mens Wearhouse I was still in high school and it was immeditly a welcoming enviorment with a great team. Even though it was commission based for the majority of employees there was not a lot of tension. I always felt conmfotable and during the slow season there were ping pong sets that attached to tables to keep both us busy, and kids that came in to shop with thier parents."
good,I have worked for TMW for nearly 13 years. Its culture is fantastic and a great company to work for.  Hours are somewhat flexible and team work is key.
good,Mostly I just liked working there. I never knew what would walk through the door and when it was slow my coworkers were allowed to play games.  When it was fast we all pulled together to get it done and get it done right.
good,"the typical work day is walk in get started right away, with any work that needed to be done or was told to do while working on that making sure all customers are being helped and giving great assistance with anything."
good,"Good care for employees,more respecteful,strong customer service,excellent team work, super qaulity work, high productivity,respect of time card every day."
good,"Very professional work place, management makes sure employees know how to approach customers and how to book weddings, sell and measure men for tux rentals and color coordinate. You need to be educated on mens different suit sizes and different types to fabrics of suits."
good,work never felt boring because the coworkers and customers were all very interesting. I learned everything there is to know about men's dress clothing. The hardest part about the job was to see what the customer's were imagining
good,This has honestly been one of my favorite jobs so far i got paid well for what I did and the discounts and uniforms were very good and enjoyable the managers were awesome and very good at working with you and training the hardest part of the job was dealing with prom
good,The management was awesome. Many of the customers became regular walk-ins. The sales were great as well as our employee discount. there was always something great to find on the racks.
good,"While there were long hours, the company made a point to make the environment fun for all. Regular meetings and work social events made for an enjoyable atmosphere. All levels of management were engaged and would be willing to listen to anyone."
good,I had a job at men's wearhouse for about 6 months and enjoyed it very much. I normally worked with the sales staff and learned a lot from the salesmen at the store.
good,"A typical day is a stream of rapid fire intimate and meaningful connections with customers. Your goal is to help, and you're taught every day how to be better at selling. Without this job, I'm not sure how great I would be as a person or as a salesman. I wholeheartedly recommend working for this company!"
good,Enjoyed working with customers to find clothing needs. Very enjoyable people to work with. Looked forward to work during the week.
good,"i would help customers pick out styles an colors for their rental or event. i also open the store as well as close, help customers pick out what they want to buy."
good,"Laid back environment with excellent training. If you are trainable and driven you will excel here! "
good,For me the best part was being able to help someone with what they needed. Having the ability to have a customer come in need of something and me being able to fulfill that.
good,"Coming into work, I never know what the day may look like which I enjoy. Every day could be something new. My staff that I work with is always upbeat, caring, makes sure everything is in order, and there to pick each other up when needed. Great learning tools that I've gained is problem solving, communication, and the ability to multi-task which I believe are all important."
good,"This was my first job. Management had patience with me and taught me how to deal with customers, answer phones and set up appointments for tux rentals. What I loved the most besides the customers, management had an open door policy. They accomedated my school, did not conflict with my school hours. It was a fun environment, even helped me get thru my bad days. THe hardest part of the job was dealing with angry mothers on prom day. Of course with tux rentals not much can be done to them because its only rentals and I had to explain to mothers thats all we can do and I would get help from management if it escalated."
good,"Walked around the store and sold suits."
good,"Clock in, get to work cleaning the store or working with customers, depending on how busy the store is at the time of arrival. Have fun conversations with coworkers and eat lunch together."
good,"Work is very productive as far as tuxedo rentals and booking weddings and also for prom. I can get very stressful at times when there are a lot of customers but when we all work together and do what we have to do then everyone is happy at the end of the day and that's all that matters. I love my co workers, but the management could be a lot better. I really enjoy making the customers feel relaxed and comfortable. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like work and that's what I love most about it"
good,"Great Management team with encouragement to help succeed. Was given numerous opportunities to prove myself on new tasks and given the right training to ensure my confidence and results. Retail hours are not best for single parents, but salary compensation helped a little for baby sitting costs."
good,Working at The Men's Wearhouse was a great experience. I was able to work with some wonderful people and see part of the retail side that most people don't get to see. I loved working with customers and giving them advice on what would be appropriate for certain occasions.
good,"The company truly cares about there employees.  There pay is above average for retail but not excellent, but there benefits are better than anywhere.  "
good,it's retail. you work all the time including holidays. good company to work for. if you know how to sell you could make good money as a sales consultant. 
good,Our customers were amazing. I was in charge of tuxedos as one of my primary duties. I loved being able to help a bride and groom pick the perfect tux for their wedding. I helped make our store number one in the district in 2009 and that was a big deal as there was thirty other stores to contend with. The store manager was a pain though. He didn't like women or white people so I was out of luck. He would make snide comments about it being a mans store and world and I had no place there. When I complained to the district manager he told me I was reading more into it than what it really was. I loved what I was doing but the store manager made every one of the girls miserable.
good,"The Men's Wearhouse is proud of the value we deliver to our customers. This Value Commitment includes our quality merchandise along with everyday low prices, convenience, professional on-site tailoring, and perhaps most importantly, great wardrobe consulting that guarantees you will like the way you look. The Men's Wearhouse stands behind every purchase you make with us."
good,"Men's Wearhouse has developed one of the most effective combinations of close knit teamwork, corporate professionalism, and in depth selling compared to any other clothing retailer in the United States. The training provided while working for Men's Wearhouse stresses team selling with an aspect attempting to be a wardrobe consultant to the customer. This provides a service that is more in depth than simply selling a piece of clothing to a customer. The greatest point in any Men's Wearhouse however is the team itself. In an environment that is by definition unstructured due to the range of services provided in the store team unity and efficiency becomes the greatest asset in your day to day activities."
good,"Typical work day was to clock in, have a group meeting for 10-15 minutes then go right to work. I learned many different skills to help me complete my task at work and i also learned better social skills. The management wasn't strict but they made sure everybody was getting the job done. The hardest part of the job was picking up extra slack. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to socialize with everybody and have fun."
good,"This was a fun place to work, with a great corporate culture. Lunches were provided on Saturdays and you get some great benefits."
good,"Subscribes to the philosophy of servant leadership, great training, fun environment"
good,"It was always a learning experience when new items came in, learning about different fabrications of garments and all. Management was fine, everyone worked together at most times.I couldn't actually find anything hard about the job. It was a good atmosphere."
good,Good company to work for there has been alot of changes in this last year but company is very good about listening to any problems you may have and try to resolve them.
good,"I was a tuxedo rental associate at men’s warehouse, I loved my job and all of my coworkers. Everyone was like family and treated each other with complete respect"
good,I really enjoyed my time with this company but i just outgrew the opportunity for me in my area and with a young family wasn't in a position to relocate. Average tenure in my area was well over fifteen years.
good,I believe that everyone should have a role in the workplace. Everyone need to work together as a team. A great team will get a lot accomplished and very proficiently
good,"Daily I would arrive a hour before open to prepare my store; drop off the previous day’s deposit at the bank, check emails and send reports, prepare my tailor shop and tend to any needs of my clients. Once open selling big is the goal, building relationships with anyone who walked in the door- if a client is comfortable with me I can sell them anything. I always promoted synergy on my floor amongst salesman and sales associates; empowering the team through verbal praise for simple and major tasks completed. Communicating store goals is the strength, when goals where visibly written on our dry-erase board we seen numbers continue to rise."
good,"The company is very good to work for. From a quickpace CSA position as training for becoming a retail sales associate, the company only promotes from within."
good,it was a pretty good work environment. i tell everyone that every young man should work here at least once in there life for the simple reason that it teaches you how to dress business oriented and confidently
good,"I love the atmosphere at my store. I come in, help customers find clothes they like and will suit their needs whether that is for weddings, business or anything else."
good,"The Mens Warehouse was an excellent place to work and network. It gave me a chance to work and talk to many individuals in other industries, which gave me a glimpse of what I could do in the future. I would always recommend this place for others to work for, and I have to many of my friends. The company makes sure that you work hard, but also have fun."
good,"Great job for a high school or college aged person. The hours are flexible, the management is really cool and understanding. I would recommend this job to anyone needing minimum wage work."
good,I loved working with the designers. There was so much great people and interactions. Company parties and company lunches where always the best. Having to set up meetings were great and I got to learn a lot of different types of positions since I helped out with every worker there.
good,This was a wonderful place to work. Sometimes during prom season it would get a little stressful. But overall it was an amazing job. The work culture was incredible. It really did feel like a little family.
good,"If you want work-life balance, this is a great company to work for but not the highest compensation. Unlike other retail companies, they will accomodate your life  with performance expectations of course, as any company should. Love this company!"
good,"There wasn't an dual time when there was no work around the warehouse. From cleaning shoes, breaking down tux from the trucks to pressing the new coats to be place on the new lines, this job was amazing."
good,"I don't understand why I need to talk too much about my company. I am just asking a part time job in your company."
good,"For quite sometime Men's Werhouse was voted one of the top places to work, and I would agree. The company always makes sure that their employees can have a friendly and welcoming environment not only for the customer but for the employee as well."
good,"my day involved fittings, making wedding partys what i learned waas filing and how to fit people and culture was pretty laid back and the hardest part of the job was probably return day"
good,"Men's Wearhouse was a great company to work for.  Although I worked from home my team was extremely motivated and hard working.  We managed all of the opening construction and on going maintenance for 2000+ stores and office locations.  I worked from home for the last 15 years, and learned a lot about time management and good communication.  I enjoyed everything about my job, the daily duties assisting the stores as well as the large projects."
good,Men's Wearhouse is a great place to work! The management and other staff are easy-going and are very willing to help with any and all wardrobe needs. It is a positive environment and employees enjoy assisting customers with high-level wardrobe needs for any occasion.
good,"I worked at the Quakertown location for several years and learned many valuable life skills and people skills along the way. Management was very understanding and willing to work with you. So long as you don't mind working with people, this is a fantastic place to work."
good,Management was always very approachable and daily tasks were monotonous but you always know what you're supposed to do.
good,"1-as an asst manager I had to do a ""shoulder"" count every morning that means suits and sport coats, and send to corporate."
good,I learn a lot at Men's Wear House. I've been working there for a few years now. My management team is wonderful. I Also have great co- workers. The hardest part of the job is trying to leave. I want a new adventure.
good,The Men's Wearhouse is big on family values and every employee from the CEO down to the lower levels are treated as such. Advancing within the company and promoting from within is one of their greatest strengths.
good,Fun staff. Family ran store. A typical day at work would consist of helping all other associates when needed. Team work was a huge plus in the store. Management was very respectful and showed leadership each and everyday. The most challenging part of the job was dealing with angry customers. It was always easy for me to put a smile back on their faces as they left the store. Proving to them that you're there to help is key. Overall the job was an amazing experience.
good,"Men's Wearhouse, while an entry level job, did it's best to give every worker a chance to succeed and to be promoted. Furthermore, the management asked a lot of the workers but nothing that they themselves were not willing to do and usually led by example."
good,Extremely busy and fun place to work. Co-workers willing to stay late to get the work done and can always depend on them. I love the Christmas party.
good,"Very laid back yet progressive and business oriented, with emphasis on creating amazing customer service experience."
good,"What I enjoy most about the Men's Wearhouse is their drive to ensure that every customer that walks through the door will become and remain a repeat customer because of our commitments to excellence. We go above and beyond to ensure that every customer, whether they are buying items or just coming in for wardrobe advice, leaves our store with a smile and the satisfaction of knowing that they got what they needed and it was a whole lot easier than they expected. "
good,"Loved working for a company where they actually care about their employees. "
good,The work environment at the Men's Warehouse was comfortable and the supervisors and management were approachable.
good,Hardest part of the job is during Prom season when you have hundreds of teenagers that know nothing about tuxedos trying to decide what they want and all of them waiting till the last second to rent.  Management has always been friendly and willing to work with you through any problems you may have.  A typical day at work is pretty relaxed at my location so it provides enough time to complete school work while at work.  I have learned how to dress well because of this job and am able to match colors and patterns very well.
good,A typical day at work was to have fun and enjoy the company of our customers. Ive learned to be professional with the my coworkers and our customers at all times.
good,"i did start since 1999 at this company,and every day it vas fun working with the tailors and the sale associate at the store"
good,Great work environment with great training programs for understanding of products to increase sales. Great company values and supported through out the management. Very supportive of employees and great benefits.
good,"Job is great. Very proffesional. Good staff, and work environment. Good managers.I am respected very much, and I respect peers. Good"
good,This company really cares about their employees. This was one of the best companies that I worked for. Even though they are a large chain the company still valued the opinions of all of their employees.
good,"Easy going job. All about safety of employees and public."
good,"A typical day revolves around fitting customers in tuxedos and booking wedding parties for the groom. Presentations on available tuxedos and style options are frequent as well as discussions on pricing and discounts. During free time, associates help fill product on the sales floor and regularly clean and tidy up the store to maintain appearance. The management team is highly professional and relate to each other and other associates appropriately."
good,"Fantastic atmosphere, great people, great product"
good,This job was absolutely great. I enjoyed working here. I enjoyed helping customers and meeting others need an wants.
good,"I enjoyed working here. My coworkers were all very helpful and good people. Plenty of options for advancement to higher positions. Training is very good. Very nice store, great management and workplace."

good,This is a great company to work for. There are a lot of perks/benefits and room to improve. I worked at two stores and the staff always worked well together.
good, Hiring and training personnel
good,"My typical day at work was very fun, laid back, and creative. I started working at Men's Wearhouse when I was 17 years old, and worked my way up to Store Manager. Every body that work for this company was extremely polite, and felt as if we were all family. The hardest part of the job was selling clothing, but I ended up always meeting my goals. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I work for."

There is always something to work on.I have learned that there is always a way to show and give great customer service. also that being positive and productive will get you further in life.

They are great and always happy to shop in our store, also you meet so many people from all over.Absoulutely the best."
good,"Working for TMW exposed me to several leadership styles that worked together united in a common goal. Supporting and consistently informing changes, challenges and most of all the customers needs. Challenges in training new employees to be consistent, replicate processes and follow through became evident in the success of each store I worked at. The atmosphere of everyone is accountable for their job responsibility. The company created enthusiasim with processses and rewarded the dedication, and acknowledge accomplishments with goals and rewards. A weekly encouragement to meet goals and improve processes were discussed. Access to beneifts within store hours, information about company growth and challenges was shared openly among all store managers with staff. A montly meeting was kept by regional sales leader to re-inforce challenges, successes and strive for leadership rewards. A team approach to inventories, and challenges met with leadership teams was easy, yet a time consuming process. Accountability with shipping, and receiving, assured more accuracy, and uniform involvement from all employees making the process accurate, and speedy."
good,"Scanning out products to be shipped to customers.Loading and unloading trucks. To put orders together scanning the locations and destinations. Management is easy to work with/for.They explain things well making it easy to understand. My co workers are a very energetic group. The hardest part of my job is unloading the trucks, The most enjoyable part of my job is scanning the product and putting the orders together."
good,"A typical day at work was with production quality,setting goals to better the production. I learned to be friendly with customer and co-workers. Management was excellent. I got along with all my co-workers and respected them.Did not think my job was hard at all. I enjoyed working with all sales reps and customers."
good,I would recommend Mens warehouse to any one looking for a great opportunity.
good,Commision sales pay is a little low. Great teamwork enviroment. Proven customer service methods.
good,"I got my first job at Men’s Warehouse. To be honest, I feel very happy working there. The management team is very friendly and very encouraging. They provide a conducive environment and relationship for their workers."
good,Second time around is better than my first with company. looking forward to moving up with my store more than I have already. good teacher in my store
good,Very diverse place to work and I loved it! The training does take a while but in time you can sell a suit in no time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that worked there.
good,"Very great place to work. Great team members, great pay and healthy competitiveness within the employees. I truly enjoy working here and helping customers with their wardrobes."
good,"It’s a really fun busy and friendly environment. On a busy day the day goes by pretty quick, employees help one another including management. Managers are very hands on, never just sitting in the office they’re always ready to work."
good,"There are many opportunities to grow within TMW and the skills taught translate to future endeabors. It is a retail job, so you follow retail schedules, which means the work/life balance isn’t amazing, but it’s nothing out of the norm for the industry."
good,"Loved every minute of working here. Every aspect of the job was great. The people, the workplace, the customers, and the store itself was great. Not much more to say."
good,"I worked at Men's Wearhouse for 2 years and it was the best job I have had so far in my life. The pay was decent though the particular store I was at was not yet doing full commission. The best part was the employee environment. It really felt like working as a family. While there were some issues and disagreements they were never major or highly detrimental to the job or work environment. Working one on one with customers was generally a pleasure and felt very natural."
good,Management was really great understanding. The environment was stress free. Warehouse gets really hot in summer time . great way to pay the bills and get by.
good,Sometimes gets busy and requires teamwork. Sometimes it can be a very calm work day. The manager is very nice and understanding. I've learned how to work in a team and how to get along with others.
good,"Open store count drawers, drop deposit, tailor all garments on line, if work is complete come out on floor and assist with customers sales. End of day lock down store, count sales, do deposit for next morning. clean store and tailor shop. make sure all garments are places were they should be. ensure all doors locked. clock out"
good,"If you are a self-managed, performance based mind, this is the absolute best retail environment for you.  The pay is great, the training is useful well beyond work, and the respect that you feel from the company and your customers is beyond compare of anywhere else in retail."
good,Men’s wearhouse does a pod job hiring staff and supplying its employees with good benefits. Can gain very good customer service experience dealing with all types of customers.
good,"Best thing is you see your results right away."
good,"This place was fun and great to work at very flexible with school schedules, Also has school benefits and health benefits. Randomly treats employees to free lunches and dinners."
good,"There is definitely always something to do. You stay busy, because the company is steadily growing. Management is awesome and the culture is amazing. I'd hate to leave the company, but when life comes knocking...."
good,"Great Company to work for. If you are interested in working in retail, I would recommend that you apply at The Men's Warehouse."
good,"Everyday at Men's Wearhouse, it was never the same, everything was different from the customers you see, the problems that occur, and even the sales focus each day. This job taught me a lot with independency. Being a wardrobe consultant, i am in charge of selling the right suit, or garment to the customer. At times i would have a large variety of weddings that i would manage, and organize. Managing wedding parties gave me the freedom to style the wedding party as they dreamt of, or give them my opinion on what would look well for the whole party. The hardest part of work would have to be overcoming a customers style. Some customers are used to the classic look versus adjusting to the new style in suits, so giving the customer my opinion on a modern suit may not interest them. The most enjoyable part of work would be that each interaction with a customer was always different. I always look for that common interest that the customer and myself share so therefore it becomes easier to sell the product."
good,Really enjoyed my time at Men's Wearhouse and enjoyed working there. Management is very supportive and great advancement opportunities for those willing to work hard and give their all.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for Men's Wearhouse. It was during prom season, so it was kind of crazy. The people I worked with were great. Managers were great. Pay isn't bad either."
good,"Easy work that is rewarding and face paced, but not to bad that it seems to rushed, but doesn't seem to drag either. "
good,The day stars with UPS delivering 20 boxes of inventory and right after that The Men's Wearhouse truck delivering 10 More boxes and tuxedos. I have learned to do the hardest task first and the easy ones last. We all work hard as a team to get everything done in a timely manner. There are no hard parts of my job. I enjoy helping customers and getting the job done right the first time.
good,"A great, fun, and rewarding company to work for. Lots of incentives. Room for advancement within the company. All expense paid travel for work conferences."
good,I worked for this company for 9+ years and thoroughly enjoyed it! Was just time for me to move on. I would highly recommend it as somewhere to work and shop.
good,"Men's Wearhouse is a great company to work for there is plenty of room for advancement within the company. They offer great benefits while working for and not with the company. They offer a scholarship for past and present employees children. The employees I worked with was like a family, we spent more time together than with our actual families. We would plan store outings after hours to celebrate hitting store numbers and at the end of the year after inventory our manager would cook and have a celebration at the store after closing as a thank you to his employees."
good,"My most enjoyable part of this job is to see the bride and grooms happy with their style selection and fit of the garment. My co workers are more like family we take care of one another on and off the clock, hardest part of the job is during prom season a lot of business and not enough staffing our management team is awesome very supportive and helpful."
good,Great working environment.  Challenging position.  Very productive position.  Enjoyed all the co-workers.  The longer worked the more production increased.  The management treated everyone equal. Fun and challenging work atmosphere.
good,"In a typical day you will have many things to complete such as schedules, setting up the tailor shop, and inventory management. Throughout the day you work with many customers in many ways. every customer is unique because you are helping them prepare for different things. They may be getting ready for a new career, wedding or graduation. Customer service is held to the highest standards and you must be able to understand every need and want the customer may have. Management of the store is a very important aspect because there are so many things that need to line up in order to run well. Consultants and tailors must work together and their work most be overseen by management to insure that the customer gets what they expect when they need it. Training is done everyday and inventory is received everyday. The Hardest part of the job is not knowing what pace they day may bring, the job itself is fairly constant, but customer flow can change how much time you will have to complete your daily tasks, it may be a very slow day or it may be a very busy day. The same amount of daily tasks are there no matter how much time you have to do them, so time management is very important. The best part of the job is that you know you are preparing people for for something important in their life. It can be a promotion, wedding, funeral, or an interview. Knowing that you helped the customer with something that they must look their best for and that they trust you to do so is a fantastic feeling."
good,"Our department consists of myself, my boss and two co-workers based in California.  We are an infomapping shop, and this is reflected in our product."
good,"- I helped customers with choosing a tuxedoes and educating them."
good,"This job is like a job anyone could ever ask for. For me, the only things I haven't like is sometimes I feel as if managment isn't always appropriate and strong like someone selling suits should be. But, I guess personal life is not necessarily what's important in the business world."
good,"Great company, honestly a fortune 100 best companies to work for."
good,"The Men's Wearhouse is a great place of work, with a very welcoming environment for all people. My typical work day includes helping people in the search for tuxedos and suits for all types of events, from weddings to prom. It is a very hands on kind of work, where you must be aware of how you are presenting yourself to the customer, as well as how you represent the company. It is also important to be aware and knowledgable about all the products you are offering."
good,"Great co-workers, almost a sense of family. Scheduling was flexible for me as a college student and also benefits and earnings were not bad! It was a fun environment, with workers and customers!"
good,Awesome place to work. I have worked at two locations across the US and both have been wonderful.
good,"What ever the challanges, we always got the job done right and on time,we had very little drama. We had very little turn over, it was a place where people in Winter Garden wanted to work."
good,"Rental department was a blast to work in! The opportunities that have been given to me by working at this company are fantastic. From the experience, to the suits I purchased!"
good,Great for making connections. Good communication between management and employees. Appreciate relations between customers and employees. Friendly environment.
good,I really enjoyed my job at the men's wearhouse I had some personal problems going on in my life so I had to leave. While I worked there I found the people very friendly and helpful.
good,Mens wearhouse was a great experience. Only reason for leaving was to seek better job opportunities after graduating college. But it was defiantly a greaet place to work for sure.
good,"A great place to work and shop. Clothing selection is too of the line. Employees are top notch, always helpful whenever help is needed. Working there was great experience."
good,So grateful for the opportunity to have this experience. We work with customers fitting and preparing them for future events. I feel very pleased to help them look their best.
good,But be about your work there but the work environment is great it’s a great job for students that are in college worked around my whole schedule and enough free time if isn’t busy to study

My coworkers couldn't be further from that thought. Everyone that comes in they make a point to greet and engage. They want to know what event is coming up and how can they help to make you look and feel great. They do their best to meet different constraints (Rush orders, budgets, specific colors and designs) and make sure everyone is satisfied with their garment.

It took hours just about my entire shift. I really enjoyed my job and everything about it. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I met George Zimmerman himself the CEO of Men's Wearhouse my first week of getting hired. That was awesome. So invigorating. He even asked me a personal question. He asked what do you like about working for my company, I responded I love the open door policy.

Management was actively involved in helping staff and were very supportive to all employees and customers. Dealing with multiple coordinations of events and weddings, I learned how to accommodate each person to their specific needs. Customer service related issues are the most difficult tasks. When dealing with an unhappy customer, you must maintain composure and ensure that all parties are satisfied with the ending result. You must maintain a steady, consistant and focused pace in such an active environment."

good,"Mens Warehouse is one of the best company's to work for. Everyday we our taking orders for tux rentals for our busy season prom! also available for weddings as well. After going threw the orders with customer i measure them for their tux rental. I take a deposit , go over our polices, and see them back two days before their event. When customer comes back two days before the event i have customer try them on and make sure everything fits. I scan them out and take the final payment. Customer comes back day after event i check the rental bag and scan them in to be returned if everything is in the bag, if not customer is responsible and i take that payment if needed. I Have learned and improved my customer service skills and i now know about tux rental. The co workers and management make it all worth it because they actually care about learning who we are and why we do it. High management comes in all the time and actually works the floor with you.

You will advance based on merit only! Several of their executive level employees started out as the entry level CSA part time employee. You do not need a college education to go far with this company! The level of respect given to every employee is wonderful! The Founder and Chairman of the Board makes it his business to meet EVERY employee he possibly can! I have met him at least 6 times over the years. This is not an easy task with over 15,000 employees! I highly recommend this company to anyone who wants a career in retail. The compensation is better than any other retailer in the country!"
