bad,"Its your typical shift work gig, pays well but they only pay u well enough to torture you and let you know that cant be part of their team because you're not a relative or friend of management. Constantly cutting back on workers, HR is a nightmare! the most turnaround i've seen with any company and they make sure to hire the wicked witch of the west as HR."
bad,"This company was good to work for while it lasted, I worked with some great individuals and developed some lasting relationships over my 11+ yrs as an operator here.  My typical work day was 12 hr rotating shift from nights to days, it consisted of me running my section monitoring the operations from a computer and making adjustments as needed, made tank movements as needed, recorded temps, levels and other variables pertinent to the safe and proper operation of the section.  Hardest part of the job was the amount of overtime sometimes, but overall is was fine.  The most enjoyable part was the people, it was great for that and that is something I will miss the most."
bad,"No new hire onboarding process. Lacks cultural diversity and inclusion.  Antiquated systems, business managed via Excel spreadsheets. Co-workers pleasant and supportive."
bad,Private equity owned company with minimal staff.  Be prepared to work hard with minimal support.  Company is going through a lot of changes and downsizing.
bad,"It was good while is lasted, worked there for 11 yrs and was just informed they were closing the gates.  I've learned a lot of operational skills over the years, the management was good for the most part, and my co-workers were the best part of the job.  The hardest part was probably the overtime but for the most part that was fine.  The most enjoyable was my co-workers."
bad,"no training then they fire you for it"
bad,Work 8 to 12 hrs a day. Dumping chemicals and making sure they are the right batch then pack out into super sacks or bags.  We driving forklifts sit down and stand ups.  Have to pay look really close attention to make sure you have the right chemical going into the right batch.
bad,Good  place to work but can be challenging the people  are nice.  much training  is put into each employee. To be able to keep  up with the paste.for smoking  they have special  places for people.
bad,Hexion has become more about the numbers than the customer! There was so much unnecessary work added to the customer service department to where we could not focus on the customers need 100%. Meetings to put on a show on how CS will be given more authority to make decisions yet management did not and would not let CS do their job! The job has become a joke! Constant fear of losing your job because you are not perfect (being human is not a good fit) management is constantly to busy pointing out errors than what you accomplish and that was the only time you would see your managers
bad,"Company has no work/home boundaries.  Lots of overtime."
bad,This company was originally a great place to work.After being acquired by a financial buyer things just weren't the same. No clear direction and poor communication ensued.
good,"Typical day at work is shift change, then work on your batches. You learn a lot about processes here, it's very interesting work. It's outside in the heat, working with hazardous materials and substances, high pressure and heat. It's definitely worth working there for the high pay and if you are able to work fast and safely and follow direction well."
good,Management were on the buddy system that's how they got their job. Some had no knowledge of the role they were in but their friend got them the job anyway. Advancements are hard to come by in maintenance but operations was easier.
good,"The pay is ok. Could be a lot better. Benefits suck. It's only 5 operators in the whole plant. Single man operation. Which means you do everything. Board operator, lab work, loading and unloading, outside work, etc. Nights, your the only person there. Its a job until you find something better."
good,"Company talks a big game but routinely puts profits ahead of long term solutions and/or safety. There is people that have been with this organization for decades and not had a single employee review. How can any company have improvements or accountability if this does not occur?!"
good,To many chiefs not enough Indians. They would always say one thing and do another. Majority of the time I was the only one working hard and trying to over excel. But you know how that goes those who are lazy will set back and let you do all the work and I got tired of that also.
good,"At first this was a great job. Wonderful work life balance great managers, but as the market downturn got worse so did my experience with the company. After my first boss left the company everything changed for me. The work life balance changed and it seemed like I was there just to punch my time clock. Hexion corporate is willing to build massive RND facilities around the world, but when the oilfield market was struggling they resulted to layoffs rather than finding a way to keep good people on board. I loved the people that I worked with on a day to day basis and it was a fun environment, but the downturn changed the culture and not for the better. Until the market picks up I would say Hexion OTG is going to be a difficult place to work."
good,"management varies from business to business, group to group. Unprofessional management harms productivity. Unfair working environment causes a high turnover and cannot keep talents"
good,"I wouldn't refer anyone to work there, it is a cutthroat environment. The morale is terrible, it used to be a great place to work but it has gone downhill"
good,"Productive, Fun, Exciting, Energetic, Caring, Safest, Employee Recognition, Family  work place"
good,"Hexion is a decent place to work.  My co-workers are talented and professional.  Leaders are approachable and knowledgeable.  Compensation is fair and work-life balance is as good as it gets these days.  Professional development is entirely up to you, though, as there are no programs and HR plays a very administrative role."
good,Hexion is a good company as far as I could tell with the minimal amount of time I spent with them. The training I received with them was excellent and coworkers are always willing to help. Management on a corporate level seemed involved.
good,"The company is truly concerned for the safety of their employees, its not just talk.  The company is committed to responsible chemistry and sustainability."
good,"Progressive culture and decent work/life balance. There is not a good process for promotional or developmental opportunities, and job security is volatile as a private equity company."
good,"Nice people and the company is really trying to change it's culture. However, there has been signficant turnover and that has not led for much advancement. Promotions seem to come from the outside instead of from within which is disappointing. It is a nice, secure place to work."
good,Good company to work long term for. Only problem is bad communication skills from Management to floor level. Small company so it makes it hard to communicate properly.
good,Hexion is private equity so it is highly leveraged with debt. With this comes pressure to perform. Workload varies but is usually high. Different departments have different cultures - some are very friendly and some are cut-throat.
good,"Private equity ownership hasn't done this organization any good.  It has recently gone through bankruptcy and with no change in direction, will struggle going forward."
good,"I had a very good run at Hexion.  It is filled with good people who all do their best to work together.  While some degree of overtime was always expected, the last few years have been difficult as many people who have left have not been replaced and their duties have been spread around to those who remained.  That left many people spread very thinly with an increased stress level."
good,This is a great place to start getting experience for being a process technician. The environment is pretty relaxed and everyone I work with here get along very well. Start off as a Loader and it takes a long time for a position in operations to open before you can move up.
good,Leuke collega's maar managment was niet echt motiverend.
good,"Results driven company, process orientated. Many good professionals - have to work on team atmosphere."
good,overall a good place to work with a good culture. management is solid and new CEO is a refreshing change. natural work teams are easy to get along with.
good,Hexion seems to lack strong and fair leadership. They show favoritism to only those with degrees and who are their friends. Not a place for someone who wants to rise through the ranks. Great place to earn a paycheck
good,Mangers don't know how to manage. Very frustrating. Poor management skills. Co-workers are nice and the enjoyable part of job. It is crazy what they pay us for the easy work it is.
good,Each day brings me opportunities for helping the person on the other end of the phone and I thoroughly enjoy that part of my job.  It is very rewarding when I hear people say they were told if they needed something done to ask for me.  I am privileged to have involvement and responsibility in so many different aspects of HR for my company.

Hazmat Certified, good communication skills, work well with other and independently, can lift 50 pounds"
good,This plant is closing down in 2018 due to changes in market forces and with the old method of production and lack of previous investment the plant is not longer viable.
good,Great people to work with and very good pay good teamwork and opportunities to advance I will miss HEXION I still hope they call me back and need me...
good,Overall a good place to work. Employers are considerate of their employees and vice versa. Opportunities to advance. Opportunities for pay raises. Willing to help employees learn new positions.
good,"Fast paced and always something new to learn.  This is a large Global company with a strong user group in SAP and business processes.  As a contractor, it is one of my favorite places to work"
good,"My coworkers are great! Everyone in the building is skilled and hardworking."
good,"For a large company, they are very open and communicative across all job titles.  There biggest downfall is not having very open communication across the various business units. But the people are very willing to help advance your career."
good,At times it was very hectic. I learned a lot about different in-house programs. The hardest part  was dealing with people who tried to sabotage others.
good,Hexion has a lot of well meaning individuals and has a long history of being over leveraged due to being held in a private equity portfolios for well more than a decade.  The result is many long tenured individuals are only sometimes fully qualified for their roles and a there's a significant lack of internal process and policy rigor.  Very nice people and a family environment.  Not all the decisions are business oriented and there's long history of not making all the hard decisions needed to get the company's financials back on track.
good,"Met the challenge of directing a team of seven professionals engaged in the technical support, administration, and security of SAP R/3, BW, and non-SAP Oracle systems at this world leader in specialty chemicals.  Coordinated and led projects spanning SAP security and Oracle database deployments and upgrades, troubleshooting, software patches, performance tuning, transport management, and the interface between the Vertex Tax Q Series software platform and SAP systems."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, co workers were fun, too bad the job closed due to oil industry slow down. Managers were always good to the employees. Room to grow."
good,"DuPont Schedule, shift work. One person per shift at Baytown location, and overtime is minimal, so if you don’t like overtime this is great. Pay scale is about in the middle compared to other companies, higher than some but lower  than the bigger companies. Medical  Benefits are average to good, 401k company match is average, but not great. Overall it is not a bad company to work for."
good,It was one of the best places that I have worked for.  They crossed trained you to know more than one thing.  The 12 hour shifts were interesting to get used to but it worked great with your life.  The only bad part was some managers showed favoritism to employees.
good,"Great people and every day is different, not really repetitive work (R&D building). Company has had some layoffs due to accumulated debt. Otherwise, good place to work."
good,"good place to work, opportunities for advancement. fellow operators were always helpful. good amount of overtime and seniority is a definitive plus. just wish plant hadn't shutdown."
good,Solid businesses with a bright future.  Being owned investment firm with while heavily leveraged has its downside.  Company culture is great.  Management cares about the associates.
good,Nice people but company on the downswing. Trouble moving up or around in the company. The new CEO seems to want to bring about major change which may not be good news for employees.
good,"Coordinate daily production for customer orders and maintain optimal levels of inventory to maintain the lowest cost possible to meet all demand."
good,"Must be self motivated to be successful at your job. "
good,"if you pulled your weight it was never a bad place to work. A fair company to work for."
good,A global company with many functions and activities. You will never get bored. Very cooperative R&D teams but you may meet resistant to change at some manufacturing sites.
good,"Good place to work. Flexible management, close knit group. Speaking specifically about the R&D building. Summer company BBQ, decent 401k matching, employees hang out after hours often."
good,Learned a tremendous amount about directing a global organization. Had the ability to hire and develop a very effective global team and to organize and direct a global matrix organization.
good,Fair. Paid well.  Advancement is available to those who are willing to put forth the effort.  Knowledgeable Corporate staff and my manager at the time was very good.
good,"I do not respond to information concerning day to day operations of a company, please reframe from asking me again."
good,Was good while it lasted. Management was positive and helpful. Team mentality. Became very proficient in operations.
good,"Daily operations can be difficult at times, but mostly pretty easy going. Great group of coworkers who for the most part are willing to help each other when needed. Shift foremen are knowledgeable about the process and are willing to help in any way. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Enjoyed my working life at Hexion, sad the site is closing. Employees are trusted to carry out their duties and took responsibility for their work. Redundancy has forced me to seek employment again."
good,Not a bad plant to work.  Pretty safe and laid back. I would have liked to stay but I wanted to change careers because I got an engineering degree but they wouldn't let me change/move around to change.
good,"Excellent Plant to start a carrier with. Excellent employees to work with. Pride in safety , and doing the job right in the first place."

good,Learned a lot and became a professional chemical operator. Got to meet some good people and make a good wage. Staff was very helpful. Co-workers were a great help when needed or asked to help.
good,"It was a good place to work; in addition to completing my lab duties I was responsible for maintaining seven first aid kits for the R&D lab. The major part of my work was for the tech service dept. in the lab. If time allowed, my services were available to any of the other 7 depts. in the R&D lab."
good,"lab scale up to piloy plant"
good,I grew up with this company working with them for thirty years. Starting out in the Accounts Receivable department posting payments working my way up to managing departments. The most enjoyable part of my time with this company was the people I met. The hardest part of the time with this company was the the stress of the job.
good,"A relaxed work environment built on a lot of trust. As long the job was completed in a respectable manner, I was able to work at my own pace and get things done my way."
good,"Good people to work with.Family oriented.If someone had any kind of a problem,It was everyones problem until the problem was solved.No matter whether or not it had to do with the business at hand.We were the fast food of the chemcal industry,quality product at anytime.I learned time management efficency from not only the management,but also my co-workers who i deeply respected for "
good,This company no longer exists.  When it was open I was assigned a chemist with whom I worked with in the development of UV curable inks.  Everyday there was something new to work on. I felt like I was truly a part of something exciting.

good,"Great Company to work for. The pay and benefits could be better, but over all the company is a great place and i would recommend it to anybody."
good,Hexion Norco is a great place to work.  Co-workers are some of the people you will ever meet.  Great company always treat myself as a person not a number.
good,"Good place to work with plenty of challenges."
good,They are a good company to work for. Just like most companies in the oilfield it revolves around the OIL PRICES so it can be unstable at times.
good,"I very much enjoyed my role at Hexion Specialty Chemicals.  This company saw the potential and career driven mind I had to offer.  I enjoyed the working in a fast paced high demand environment.  I enjoyed the opportunity for growth and learning in the logistics industry.  I very much enjoyed working with our Management Team as well as our Operators and Vendors."
good,I loved heroin because I got to learn alot of really interesting things about chemical bonds and much about the periodic table as well was a great job but I was layed off
good,Hexion is full of greta people who will take care of you! Benefits and pay are amazing as well. They are strict on safety and love hearing from the lower level guys.
good,"Great place to work, family oriented, very laid back, but very safety conscious. Good opportunities for advancement.  Great management and training opportunities."
good,If the company would not have went through a reorganization I would still be employed. This was a great place to be employed.  I enjoyed the team I worked with.

good,Company was great while it lasted. The company closed but had a very  friendly staff which some of them I still keep in touch with.
good,op het dag begonnen we altijd met een kopje koffie.daarna begon het wachtoverdracht en werkoverdrag. iedereen gaf het informatie van hun collega ervoor wat ze hebben meegekregen. het leukste van de baan was om zo snel mogelijk te handelen daar ben ik goed in en observeren van lekkages en storingen.
good,"This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. It has everything - excellent pay, amazing flexibility, great co-workers, superior supervisors, and a great team atmosphere."
good,"Hexion was the ""one that got away"", to think I started with such minimal job duties and ended up having people hinge on what I would say is the greatest feeling in the world.  Unfortunately I knew an upcoming lay-off was coming and it would be a permanent one.  I miss Hexion and my role there as I felt very important and also, most importantly, I felt heard.  I was shown so many things and given so many opportunities.  I learned all about Six Sigma and became Greenbelt certified, I learned about proper use of a fire extinguisher, also a hear defibulator and I was a safety team member with some first-responder training.  I did inventory and was in charge of writing up and writing off any adjustments.  I was familiar with SOX 404 (Sarbanes Oxley) rules and compliances and I wrote many Standard Operating Procedures.  I learned all about MSDS and knew SAP like the back of my hand,"
