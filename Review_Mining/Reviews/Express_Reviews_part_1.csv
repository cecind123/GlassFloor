rating,review
bad,Out of all my years at Express I had the best work experience at Towson Mall. The staff was exceptional and the customers were well mannered. It was the national harbor location that could use some work.
bad,"I do not recommend working for this company. They are unprofessional, rude, selfish, and overall just disrespectful. They do not value their employees. All they care about is their numbers and if your achieving them. And if your not then you are of no value or importance to them. Too many great companies out here totowork for then to settle."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. The managers talk to you as if you are a dog, they don’t give praise when you did a great job, and they make you feel like you do everything wrong. I would give this place 0/5 stars if I could.. terrible place to work. No room to grow, no benefits, just a standard internship... oops I mean retail job. If they changed the Management I’m pretty sure this would be a upstanding place to work but until then, this place will continue to sink."
bad,"not satisfying or fun in any way. nothing good to say about this place at all, besides to not waste your time applying or considering.  management is horrible and inconsiderate."
bad,"Bad experience with hours given, got in car accident and head boss wasn't understanding of situation. Hours for a seasonal position were horrible. Hours like 9pm to 12am became longer. Not for me. If you can't work hours like that they don't care they keep you there, think before getting a job there even if you need a job badly."
bad,Only worked here cause it worked with my school schedule. Co workers were nice but there was a hierarchy and it ultimately made me leave. It’s biweekly and just overall not a fun time imho.
bad,"I have been in retail management for other 17 years, this is by far the worst company I ever have worked for. They make you work every holiday including Thanksgiving. As a manager I would often work from 11am-2am then back to work at 7am. If you have friends, family you want to spend with or even a day off this is not the job for you. I suggest you run far,far, away from this horrible company."
bad,"My manager terminated me without informing me. I called in one day due to a shooting happening in my hometown, so I immediately had to return home. The next day I had to call in because just my luck, my car got towed. When I called in, my manager hung up on me after I told her my car got towed. A couple days after I was not able to log on to see my schedule and so I called the store. Another manager picked up, and did not know of me being terminated and said she would talk to the other manager and never called back."
bad,I think this warehouse could of worked out if they were more careful who they hired i think some of the people they hired were not coming to work prepared to work like others it was drama on a daily basis
bad,she only gave me 2 hours of training for the cashier position. you can’t memorize the whole system in only 2 HOURS of training. next day I was working up there ALONE. I asked her for help and she looked at me as if I was the dumbest person EVER & gave me the worst attitude & embarrasses me infront of the customers. she did that also on the other days I worked there. I resigned  immediately . that is NOT how you treat your associates!
bad,"Upper management has no control over the store, the associates run the store. The managers only care about themselves and give preferential treatment to certain associates. No structure in the store at all."
bad,I worked for Express for two years and they are very unappreciative do not appreciative with your work ethics They will match your check up pay you the next week and taxes You twice for work once
bad,"Poor scheduling. Unorganized. Not treated fairly or equally to others. Management did not work with employees, had favorite employees and treated them better than other hard workers. Gave other workers bad schedules to accommodate their favorites."
bad,Working for Express was the most stressful job I have ever worked at. Their management was terrible you could not get anything changed with your shift times even when requesting off days weeks in advance. Non-stop work.
bad,"The job was stressful "
bad,"Only the front staff were nice management has no respect for the workers, talk about a 3 strike rule that’s a lie! I got fired for someone else slandering me on a site! The pay is horrible for the labour requirement and they say they will help you find a job but don’t actually do anything. Say they want journeymen trades men but not willing to find job suited to  your career, payroll time sheet is not explained well at all and the app doesn’t even work properly save a bit of your pride and don’t bother with them!"
bad,"I worked there for the seasonal time and it was annoying. While other employees were just laid back chilling I had to do everything. They threaten with firing you if you dont do certain tasks to their level of liking and expect you to do everyone's job and if you slack even a little the manager is on your butt constantly. The store is divided into men and womens side. Everytime I worked I had to take care of 1 full side by myself including recovery, fixing mannequins, ringing people out and also talking to everyone and letting them know about the sales all at once while answering any questions about the clothing and they expect you to make sure you speak to everyone which is impossible if your just one person working the floor and its alot of traffic while the other side they make sure to have more than one person taking care of it. And every time we rotate sides jo matter what I was always by myself and when I had questions  or didnt understand how to do something the employees/floor supervisors will have attitudes and tell you to ""do it yourself "" or ""figure it out"" Alot of people kept calling out so they NEVER have enough people on the floor to work sometimes you have to take extra shifts for full coverage. Then they will hit u with the if you perform well then they will keep you after the seasonal term. They dismissed my butt even though I did the most far more than the rest of the employees. The benefits are supposed to be good but didnt stay long enough to enjoy it."
bad,"The Express in the Cape Cod mall was the absolute worst place i’ve ever worked at. The manager is so rude to her employees and will make fun of you and customers behind your back. It’s pretty much like junior high school all over again. She constantly puts her employees down and you will NEVER be rewarded for your hard work, going above and beyond etc. If you’re thinking of applying...just don’t, I promise you won’t be missing out."
bad,also a good job to go to after high school. totally underpaid for someone who had experience and availability. expensive clothing. very competitive. good luck
bad,"No matter what they always side with the client even with proof provided by the associate. Doesnt matter the situation, if the client wants you gone then you are gone"
bad,"Management was the worse. Pay was not goot for what you did for the company and all the DRAMA! Would never recommend this job to anyone, needs better management."
bad,Well can I say about this company completely run abysmal false promises and the workforce well some are good to work for others are just obnoxious and treat u like something on the bottom of ur shoe if I was anyone I'd think twice about doing this job rubbish pay for the amount of heavy lifting u do AVOID
bad,"management are busy competing against each other to care about the employees. theres no help when you need it, people are constantly calling in sick, so you have to pick up the slack. benefits are not good, they only cover 40% and you have to pay the rest. the only people advancing in this company are the office people. the people who are actually putting in sweat and tears in production are getting ignored."
bad,I had an issue with the manager giving away my hours. The staff was unprofessional and often involved in drama. They did not mention or offer any opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Unless you're the manager's best friend, you will get treated terribly.  You won't get any hours and will be ignored.  You are forced to spend hundreds of $$$ on the brand clothing, even though you only make minimum wage."
bad,Just a typical day at work includes walking around folding clothes and greetings customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with clothes.
bad,"Worst place you could possibly work. First off I was trained for one day at the register and after that when I would ask questions one of the managers was always extremely rude. They didn't have enough employees, and the ones that they did hire had no experience and were not trained so most of the work was left to me. On top of that the store manager was disgustingly rude and played favorites, and another manager constantly harassed me and no one ever noticed although the store claimed to be all about making us feel comfortable. Anything that could go wrong at a job went wrong. So glad I left."
bad,Not paid enough for the work being asked for. Management was all over the place. Management is very lazy and unprofessional. Many complaints from employees about how management treats employees.
bad,"Express is the definition of a job nightmare. Late nights that go into the early morning hours with lazy people that prolong the time there by not working. Management does not know how to manage and have, or had, regular associates that understood the store processes better than they did. Associates are treated as though they are expendable and easily replaceable."
bad,"Majority of people there(management, leaders,dispatchers), are not professional and have there favorite people whom they distribute the best work both with dispatchers and the office depot work. Best to have a back up plan if you work with them and don't let this be your sole source of income. "
bad,"No work life balance."
bad,management was horrible. they would either cut or schedule you the same day. expect to loose your weekends. wouldn't leave the store until midnight closing bc managers only schedule 2 closers for the whole store. don't waste your time with this company.
bad,The managers don't know how to talk to their workers. The closing shifts were a nightmare. you had to work twice as hard and the pay was not worth the work.
bad,The sales floor is very aggressive they want you to chase down customers for sales just so they can make quotas. There seems to be no open space to advance within the store.
bad,"terrible work experience, worst place to work. nothing is neatly kept, the pay is absolutely terrible and thee manager was by far the worst part of the experience."
bad,Working with a young manager was not a good fit. Learned how to be independent. The culture was okay when dealing with the younger people. The work hours are horrible.
bad,Horrible place to work. The hours are scarce. The pay card takes forever to obtain and you basically work for free untill it gets activated. DO NOT WORK HERE
bad,"poor management , store manager thinks that is an army ,instead a group of workers, cero empathy for employees ,what I've learned there : Nothing!!!!!"
bad,It was a great job it was just that they wasnt paying me for the hours I work I would work 32 hours they would pay me for 18 hours but it didnt matter to me because I really needed the money for me and my family to eat
bad,Because the store was a new store I didn't recieve much hours. I had more call in shifts then actually shifts. I stayed for the holidays and shortly after parted ways.
bad,How in the Holy world if you're making $14/HR  does overtime pay workout to $19.50/HR?  Do you people not understand what time and half is? $14/HR x time and half = $21/HR. What kind of scam are you people trying to pull?
bad,The management is absolutely terrible! Everyone pretends as if they're all working as a team but in actuality everyone is looking out for themselves. They overwork all of the employees. They have a hard time allowing employees to leave on time. Breaks are not always given on time. There is some growth opportunity within this company. They don't officially train their new hires. They leave it up to old associates to train them.
bad,Start you off at minimum wage won't get a raise until a year overworked when sales goals isn't met for the hour managers expect you to go above and beyond to make that money back .managers sometimes show gratitude other times it the blame game that you are the reason people didn't buy anything.opening or mid shift is ok but closing is nightmare .
bad,Worst job ever worked here for Christmas time. Management is horrible they expect so much from you especially starting at minimum wage it is not worth it!. I went in one day around 5pm and didn't get out until around 3am without a break. if you ask for a break they cut your time. DO NOT recommend!
bad,they really don't care about their employees unless they are in a particular department. the cashiers and baggers have the worst job in the company. I've even seen some of them get fired for things they didn't even do. Ridiculous
bad,"The workers are very friendly. They give you information about one job and they send you only for you to find out it isn't what they said. They started to get rude and dont really seem to care about what works best for the people they are trying to ""help"""
bad,You're overworked and underpaid. All the coworkers are great but the management sucks. The turnover rate is ridiculous. Don't waste your time.
bad,"Learn selling skills, can move up to be a manager if you  like the field, flexible hours. Pay is not the best but that is how it is for stores, nice clothe, good discounts."
bad,"At least in the location I worked, management was horrible in dealing with rumors beening spread.  Also their personnel managment was horrible.  Overstaffed the store in the morning when customer traffic was low but understaffed in the evenings when customer traffic was at its highest.  Company in general wants you to protray an ""Express"" image but they don't really do anything to make their expensive product affordable to associates."
bad,I was never happy with that company. They had a favoritism thing going.
bad,"inconsistent schedule, not enough hours, not enough pay, mostly on call and not working for weeks on end"
bad,"express was horrible it was just like working with monsters, although there was one cool manager who handle everything correctly and got things done productively."
bad,"Didn't work that that long to write a whole review, but it felt like management played favorites"
bad,Marketing is always a little off. Store manager is bipolar.
bad,hauled steel local I preety much liked this job but i was a contractor and the company i worked for would tell me they was going to make me a part of the company and never did so i left
bad,Used to work here in the 90's to early 2000's.   A lot has changed.
bad,Sale clothing and promote best sales to benefit store and make budget
bad,I did not enjoy working here at all. I think it was mostly due to my coworkers at the time. love the cloths and the discount we got. the pay was not enough for my lifestyle
bad,"I was hired part time along with about 20 other people. Most quit extremely quickly. Here is why. After being hired I only came in for 'training' a few times over the course of a month or so. Then I was put on an on call schedule. On call for them meant I was given hours and then had to call them an hour beforehand to see if I was needed. It would take several phone calls to get the right person available to tell me if I had to come in. I was hardly needed, though I learned very well later they were entirely understaffed. The schedule was never made on time and they often made mistakes on the schedule and scolded me for not calling or coming in."
bad,"I have never felt so unappreciated at a job I worked so hard for before. To elaborate on all my low ratings here is what I put up with from this company. As for salary, typically a minimum wage job with higher than normal expectations. I was often required to work 9 hours without any breaks at all. Id work until 6 in the morning, for FREE just to make sure they got everything they need to get done on time...which was my choice but a simple "" thank you"" from the manager would have been appreciated. Worst management ive ever had to deal with by far. Complete lack of management skills when it comes to dealing with employees. Threatened my hours if I didnt stay late because that would show "" i have no dedication to the company"" ( meanwhile, I would stay late every shift, come in anytime of the day they wanted me to when I was not scheduled in for that day, and work for free) all while the manager herself would sit in the back on her blackberry the whole time and never once stayed late to help out stafff. The best part about this job, was the discount, and my co- workers. What I learned from this job is that I am a good hard worker and I deserve to be treated with a lot more respect."
bad,"Not a good place to work for I worked for them for almost six months when I had issues they did not care anything about me. They NEVER even asked me my name, no id now they do not even know who I am?? NOT A GOOD PLACE... They did not even get me the job,,, my friend called them."
bad,"The overall experience was disappointing and the expectations were over-the-top.  The business expects their employees to strictly follow their ""formal"" work attire policies to represent the merchandise they sell.  They will discourage wearing visible brands of other businesses, which is understandable.  However, if employees lack such attire in a short duration of time right after starting the job, managers will get on their case, even suggesting constantly to part-time Sales Associates who are only scheduled 2-3 days a week with 3-4 hour shifts with a low pay wage to purchase EXPRESS clothes in the clearance section, which are still EXPENSIVE even with the employee discount.  You could go shopping at other stores to purchase clothes similar to EXPRESS without brands, but if you can't afford to, you're going to be hearing constant reminders from the managers."
bad,"This place is awful. Technology doesn’t work. They try to make you ring people out on the floor using devices that don’t work (and their receipt prints on the other side of the store), they don’t give you an actual discount (50% off ticket price is typically what customers pay). The stock room has no organization (you’ll spend an hour looking for one sign). Most shifts you’re not allowed to leave the building on your lunch. Not allowed to keep your phone on you (has to be locked up at all times... NOT DAFE FOR EMERGENCIES). I could go on and on. Do not work at Express. SAFE FOR"
bad,"Beyond stressful, dealing with wacko customers, extremely low pay, doing more than being paid for. Being barked at for not getting a credit card and NOT ENOUGH HOURS!!! I sold $20,000 of stuff in 2 months and still won't Get HOURS! I AM THE TOP SALES PERSON! I should get more hours! Crappiest Pay in the world! I can not live on 9 hours a week! AND the hours are spread out so I waste even more gas! I CAN WORK 12 hours in one day no problem. but 9 hours a week? Really?  Management wonders why people quit and call in because working there sucks especially if you have talent and can sell. The new update at Cashrap doesn't let anyone get credit for the stuff they sell. If I didn't have a stupid credit card to pay, I would have quit a long time ago."
bad,I worked at the Downtown Summerlin location. I could not believe the workload that I was expected to do for minimum wage. I don't understand how a company with an average ticket of at least $100 is only paying minimum wage to work you like a slave. Management made the job extremely uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone let alone shop at this store again...
bad,Worked here for over two years and you'll definitely stay where you are. There's no opportunity to advance and you'll only get scheduled once or twice in two weeks for 4 hour shifts and they expect you to be happy with that. They do not allow you to do any over time whatsoever. Keeping payroll on check is more important than providing hours for associates. Sales leads and managers work over 40 hours a week. Its an easy job but you won't make much. If you're a full time student this job is probably for you. Otherwise this place is a waste of time
bad,"Unless you want to work for an inexperienced manager and a district manager who does not listen to your concerns I would not recommend this job. Previous management was great but current manager will constantly take off and leave for multiple weekends at a time while forcing you to work long hours and not give you a weekend off for months at a time. You will be constantly written up and most likely be forced to work days that you request off months in advance. Be aware: once the new manager came in, all other managers have quit due to her terrible management, even ones she has hired. I do NOT recommend working here. Company asks too much and won't have your back."
bad,"I worked for express for well over 6 months and I knew how to do some of everything.  Some would say that's great which it is but it doesn't matter. Retail sucks.  The pay is horrible , there is always drama. At this location no manager was ever on the same page.  Manager thought they we're better than the sales associates. I'm a fast learner but I was never trained properly. Which in the time of me being there there we're 2 store manager that we're fired or couldn't handle the job.  Some of your co workers are friendly but all the trouble comes from the managers.  It's just a very unprofessional environment so before you sell your soul to express think about if 8.05 an hour and working 5 or less hours like 3 days a week is worth it."
bad,"SM is beyond passive aggressive and lacks of professionalism, she is always in the back office gossiping instead of supporting the team. This Express location is super stressful, doesn't appreciate their employees and hardly ever offers breaks. Here you are expected do three things plus at once and still wear a headset which pushes you to ignore clients, Not okay!!! Associates quit all the time due to the very discouraging upper management who doesn't care about them."
bad,Express sells their customers on the deal & not the actual product it self! The company has no since of direction at the top & it has trickled-down to the store level. The result is a staff that does the bare minimum in a lot of stores. I would like to see this company succeed but unless they change course that seems impossible! If you need a job work there--but don't stick around.
bad,"They don’t care about their employees. They only care about getting people to sign up for their credit card. If you don’t push credit cards onto people who don’t need them then you don’t get hours, whether or not you’re actually helping a customer find something in the store."
bad,Management gives best hours or more hours to their friends that they hire. Regular staff will get around 15-22 hours a week. Good for teens and college students.
bad,"So below will be my personal opinion and my personal experience. I hope it can be helpful and if not maybe it can just give you a good laugh. I worked here at Express in Friendly Center (Greensboro) for quite a while before I finally found something that I actually went to school for. They sent me home a lot. The salary was terrible for the amount of work I had to do in such a short amount of time. Sometimes they would be like, “do this quickly so you can leave. We need to cut hours.” So I’d be rushing around working twice as hard as everyone else just to bring home two hours worth of pay. The gossip between associates was really annoying and I don’t think anyone really liked ANYONE to tell you the truth. When I first started I had one day of training. They refused to train me on the register for 6 months “because that would distract me from my actual job” until the only manager I liked stepped up and finally did so. As you can see- no opportunity to move up if you don’t know how to work a register which I didn’t. It was my first retail job. On slow days the management would stand around and do absolutely nothing. They’d be on their phones and whatnot while the associates were made to refold things that didn’t even need redoing. It was a very micromanaged environment which is fine if you’re going to practice what you preach. In my opinion there were way too many managers there. It was a small store with like 4 managers and NO full time associates. So if you’re thinking of working there long term, the only way is to become a manager. The place I work at’s STARTING pay is $4 more"
bad,the location I was at was filled with dumb employees who didnt know how to run the store properly. Lots of theft and nobody who was there for a genuine experience. Just managers there for the money and associates who did not care about anyone or anything else
bad,Working here is cool if you like to shop and get discounts on your clothes but not if you want to advance in your career and if your Black. It’s sad but if you are Black you will not be getting promoted. I once got called a “mini manager”. I got overlooked for promotions i was qualified for over those who weren’t. I was disrespected by customers on managements behalf and no one did anything about it. And they love to play favoritism.
bad,"Expect to do a lot of slave work for $7.25. No hours, lucky if you work twice a week. Management is a joke, and  completely disrespectful - talks badly to employees, about employees and about costumers. Just don't waste your time."
bad,Honestly Managers were horrible the customers were okay not a lot of people go in there because of the prices. I didn't get any break and if I asked for one mangers would complain. The pay was decent. The work load was easy but be careful cause some mangers will take advantage of you and make you do the work they don't want too. I can't really say to much about the company since they said they would hit you with a lawsuit
bad,I spent more than 6 months on their waiting list. I found jobs only in their list of vacancies but according to them the jobs were already taken. Doesn't take 6 months to offer an office job to someone educated with experience. If you are a real professional looking for a job Express Employment is not the place for you.
bad,"Start off usually processing the new shipment, and when thats done, we would set it out on the floor and restock. As were out there, we would help customers and promote new product/discounts."
bad,"Too many managers, scheduling issues and hardly any of them pay attention to the schedule. The fashion is years behind, no new ideas and prices are to high for plain clothing just boring."
bad,Only worked part-time for the company. Provided Great Customer Service for the Customers during my shift. Worked the floor with organizing clothing and merchandise.
bad,I was offered regular position after the holidays and took it. They said when school gets out to open my availability. I changed it and they haven't gave me hours in a month.
bad,First company I worked for that does nothing for there employees. Only good thing is the product!  District manager feels he can email you about nonsense to your personal email address and contact you when your out of the business.
bad,the company the sent me to had not been open that long. and they didn't no how to pace there workers.
bad,worked for a few companys got into a company thru express.work there for awhile.thay just couldn't find me the rite fit
bad,"The company is going Downhill. The first two years I worked for express was great! After that it became more of forget our workers it’s all about the customers, conversion and sign people up for credit cards. If you don’t care about your workers and if you don’t care about protecting them they won’t care about their work. This was the last year raises will be given, they changed the discount thinking it will make associates want to shop more but they don’t pay us well enough to want to shop with the old discount. The company is trash, management is selfish and stocks haven’t been right for a while."
bad,Too much work...little pay....it takes forever to receive an increase in your pay. Working there for 4 years and still make less than 10 dollars. It's a fast-paced environment
bad,"Overall this isn't a bad company, if you're into customer service then it's for you. There are more bad customers than there are good, and it's by a long shot. I once had a customer come in and flip every pile of clothes because no one who was working spoke Spanish. I've worked here for almost a year and I'm not making anything close to a living wage. I've worked longer than some of the managers here, and I've watched people rise around me. I'm honestly a really good worker, but the managers at Express will always find ways to make you look bad. This company really is competitive, and if you aren't prepared to be hated then you've got another thing coming. You don't get any benefits, and your employers will make false pretenses in order to keep you from quiting. When I told my boss I wanted to put in my two weeks, she told me to stay on and that she would let me make my own schedule based on my needs, and now she is scheduling me almost every day even though I only want a part time job, and she won't change any of it."
bad,"I am a bit heavier than an average person, but still a size 12. And 40-50 years old. The hired me on for part time work. They only gave me 4 hours every other week!!! While the others alongside me got 30-39 hours!! No explanations except ""hang on"" it will get better.""   Q"
bad,"I do not like my job here. It is stressful, difficult, hard work for unreasonably low pay. I feel as though all of the hard work I put in amounts to nothing because of the low pay rate. Hours are inconsistent, and we are highly understaffed."
bad,"Job is stressful & very inconsiderate of your personal life. If they need you last min then you better be there or they won't schedule you at all because you're ""unreliable"". Oh & if you're seasonal, they won't let you know if they're going to keep/let you go, you'll just suddenly not be on the schedule anymore & then eventually won't be able to log in the site at all. No phone call or warning, thats that."
bad,"I was a part time sales Associate for Express Factory Outlet in Locust Grove, GA and it was the WORST retail experience I've ever had. Management was horrendous, nothing was ever organized and the lack of communication was unreal. All of the managers were childish and power hungry. Not only were they rude and unhelpful but they would purposely undermine the associates right in front of the customers any chance they got.  The schedule was always a mess, management would ask you to come into to work even though you put in time off. Express is a great company to work for but the Locust Grove location has got to be the worst."
bad,"i like the people in the company, but management was not very nice.  Getting hours working here was fine.  You are required to do many different jobs."
bad,"Store is always unorganized, they often schedule me during hours I told them I can't work, several times they canceled my shift minutes before and my job is folding for hours because the store is almost always empty."
bad,"I cleaned sludge tanks out, chiseled  off sides of tanks and waste material into storage drums. Used a dry-ice machine that was used to spray on walls to get the excess dirt and grime."
bad,I worked hard for these people in a factory and was just tossed a side when my time at this factory was done and there was no more help getting me other placements
bad,"I have worked for this company for several years. I enjoyed the fashion industry and a generous employee discount. That's one of the main reasons why I applied to this company. The retail industry, in general, is a tuff business; meeting daily sales goals, deadline floorsets, corporate visits, and overall multi-tasking. The benefits are good when you become part of the management team. The down-side with working for the retail industry; high turnover rate with sales associates (scheduling is based on peak hours), working nights, weekends & holidays.  So, there is a lot of sacrifices, especially if you have a family. So, you can say there's no work-life balance. However, if you like challenges and don't mind the other small stuff, then you may enjoy his type of work for a while."
bad,"I have worked at the Express in Troy, Mi for a few months and this has been the worst work environment I have ever experienced. I have worked retail for a few years and I would never recommend anyone apply to this location. Management is very rude to employees and the work environment is very toxic. They offer no job training because they know little about store policies and procedures while expecting you to know how the store is ran and treating you as if your illiterate if you don't understand protocol. One manager may tell you one thing and another tells you something else, but you get in trouble if you don't do your job the right way, so there is a lot of confusion. The management curse, are unprofessional, unfriendly and always complain about customers. Out of about all 10 managers, only 2 co-managers are understanding and professional. The employee turnover rate is at an all time high because the work environment is so toxic. They struggle with coverage and because of this, this high volume location is suffering in customer service. Again, Express is a great store, but I WOULD NOT recommend anyone apply to the Troy, Mi Somerset location."
bad,"I feel as though I was hired to make it appear as though there was a diversity in body types, despite the fact that they did not sell over a size 10-12 in store. I had a very demanding school schedule when I began working, and despite giving the manager a schedule with almost all of my free time, she still scheduled me to work on days/hours I had explicitly noted that I was not available. There are very much sales-first. I was a greeter almost every shift, which meant I had to go to every single customer and deliver the 5-minute welcome speech, and was reprimanded if I missed someone, no matter how busy the store was or how much I had to mention to each customer. There was very little opportunity to learn. I was never formally trained on anything and instead was just thrown into different positions. It was assumed I'd know what was going on, and I was made to feel as though I wsa inconveniencing others when I needed assistance."
bad,"The company is desperately trying to find something that works to get them back on top. Everyday something is changing from the day before making whatever was done the previous day a waste of time and payroll. The store manager is selfish, petty, and loves to retaliate. Its a great place for a part-time associate! but if you're looking to join a great management team who enjoys a fun environment, look elsewhere!"
bad,"After bringing up harassment on at least 6-8 staff by management, I was treated soooo poorly the stress made me quit. 25 yr retail manager. Shame on express they don't follow the whistle blowers LAW. Nor protect their staff who became sexually harassed. Shame."
bad,Working at Express was my first job and I gained a lot of experience. I gained trust in customers which made them come back. Although I wish I had a closer bond with my managers.
bad,"Express is not a fun place to work at. The pay is good, only if you're a manager. The company and management have unfair expectations and are constantly unloading promos in your lap, while you have other major things to get done that they have assigned. They surprise you with promos so good luck getting out of work at the time you are scheduled. Many people spend more hours than scheduled doing things for this company than necessary."
bad,"fun, nice"
bad,"Staff from management to associate level typically very unhappy at work day-to-day. Extreme expectations such as one person working on sales floor in large square footage/high traffic. Company is more interested in impressing it's capital firm owners, and shareholders by severely limiting resources for it's field employees in order to gain large profits."
bad,"Working at EXPRESS gave me a great opportunity at first. Then as the holidays came about, work started slowing down. I need a long term job i can call home!"
bad,This was my first retail job but it was one of the worst experiences for retail. Management is not good. Overwork the workers with NO breaks either paid or unpaid. They do not care about their employees.
bad,"I was a sales lead mananger. The management team did not have good communication with each other or associates. Management treated associates badly, as well as other managers. "
bad,"I have worked retail for over ten years and have never worked for such a horrible place. I don’t believe it is Express as a company but the management they have. My first day I wasn’t even greeted with a hello from the staff and was treated pretty badly. From gossiping about me over the walkie to management screaming how much money needed to be made in each department I decided this job wasn’t for me. Apparently, Express is more concerned about meeting sales goals than having a healthy workplace environment because their management is absolutely appalling."
bad,It was a okay work environment from a summer job not any thing long term. I would not invest a lot of effort in the company because that pay is not worth it.
bad,"They hand out jobs that no one stay at for a long period of time. There are bad company's to have, they have them."
bad,"I would go months at a time without a single day! Why?because for one they have too many full timers leaving very little for part time, also the manager plays favorites because her daughters work their and those that hang with her outside of work id often seem all of them at places like gyms etc its great when you work i love the culture and the poeple that work their too bad i never got to bloody work more then 3 hours every 3 months at minimum wage and im a college student so it was a joke"
bad,Very long days. You have to be into retail to work at express. Hardest part is the people and the messes they leave for you to clean up.
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. The way they treat the people that work for them is truly astounding. In my time being here, they have let go of at people who dedicated over 8 years of their life to the company for some of the most foolish reasons. They do not make it feel like they care about you as a person, that you can simply be replaced. I look forward to the day I can leave this company."
bad,"I recently just quit my job at Express due to a store manager who has the worst work ethic I have ever seen in a manager. If you are interested in working for Express DO NOT apply at Carolina Place Mall in Pineville. There is absolutely no leadership whatsoever when it comes to management. When I was first hired everyone worked well together, the store was always organized and communication between management and associates was great. Now, under new management the store is always a disaster and no one seems to have a clue about anything that is going on. It is completely unorganized."
bad,"-They sent me to a site that had a horrible history and when I started working there they told me ""you just killed a little bit of your soul working here"""
bad,"there was an extremely high turn over for the managers. The job was the same as most retail jobs but since management was very inconsistent, it was hard to connect with the manager and feel a sense of stability."
bad,They treated me differently then the other employees do it wasn’t fair to me at all that’s why I left I was told to do other things then my shipping job and was out of work late
bad,"Management was messy and only noticed when you did something wrong. No recognition for a job well done. By the time I quit, I was treated poorly, and they were so vastly understaffed that I was one of under ten employees. No one cares to work there because the boss is abrasive and everyone is too defensive instead of open to criticism."
bad,This is a staffing agency that just sends people out to work in menial offices with menial people with menial pay. This area is not conducive to anything but more menial living. Move away and enjoy life elsewhere.
bad,Welcomed customers to the store and answered their queries. Assessed customers’ needs and provide assistance and information on product features. Organized and restocked shelves.
bad,"I am not sure how every retail store is since I only worked in one, but I had a terrible experience during my time there. It is a short term job and I do not recommend."
bad,"It's retail. If you can handle being abused by customers and your managers, then do it. If you can handle your W2 being lost in the system, then do it."
bad,"Bad employees, bad pay, no benefits. The employees were rude and didn't train me at all. I had to figure out everything on my own. I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,"This job was very stressful but I managed to stay committed for almost two years. There were very few pay-offs for doing this minimum wage job, but I did enjoy the discounts, although they were the same discounts that consumers were given as well. Typically, I would come into work, refold the same article of clothing numerous times, and work the register. Working the register, checking out customers, and suggesting outfits in the fitting rooms were my favorite parts of the job. However, cleaning the entire store, folding things over and over, and the constant change in managers made this job a less that ideal one."
bad,No i cant say what this place is it couldnt get me a job when i really  needed one.  They dont know how to take care of the people  thst are looking for help .
bad,"Ihave worked in production packaging products and I consider myself a friendly and compatible person I am resistent I learn easy "
bad,a typical day at work would be clock in go to the front of the store and help out customers until closing time
bad,"Hours were very inconsistent, some weeks you could have 30 hours, then only have 4 for the next month. They often give all hours to management as many of them are friends, they delete associates off the schedule to add themselves. On multiple occasions I was not given my mandatory meal period, but my time was edited after to look like I did. Overall management was very poor, immature and gossipy."
bad,Express was my first job and I expected a lot going into to it. The managers have no idea what they are doing. They are very unorganized. They overhired and because of this fired employees who shouldn’t have been fired. They didn’t help set up my pay or schedule without me constantly asking and they would forget most of the time. This was a terrible first working experience.
bad,This was my first job. I could tell from the beginning that it was going to be a disaster. I barely got any hours. The manager never kept up with my paperwork. There was a lot of favoritism here.
bad,i would be given a week of for no  reason they laid me of and then they just fired me
bad,Lack of leadership by superiors no control over scheduling and employees.
bad,its was a oka place to work just to learned things from.. and working with my co-worker its was. learned alot from my co-worker and management.
bad,"As a student it was fine for me to get a part time job at a store because I could always fit my schedule around my classes. The people that worked there are usually young and some were students like me so it was easy to get along with them. Besides that everything else was terrible. When the big shopping seasons are over they barely give you any hours and when they get very busy they work you till the point of exhaustation. Moreover, when trying to advance to a different position they make it very hard for you to pursue it and when they need to let go of employees they will look for any excuse to do so. I'm surprise I stayed in that job for so long and now I'm very happy to be working elsewhere."
bad,Probably one of the worst jobs I've ever had. Under paid and expect top notch work from you but dont appreciate their employees. The turn over rate is by far the worst I had ever seen. They also like to lie about their hiring rate and will fall back and say it isnt true once you receive your paycheck. I had numerous employees quit due to this.
bad,"I was treated very unfairly, it became overly stressful after 8 months of working there. I was a manager and i just had a very bad experience. Im sure it varies store to store. The only thing i got out of it was experience that was much needed. They focus too much on the money and not enough on customers."
bad,The store manager was always too busy trying to be everybody's friend. Allowed employees along with herself to come in late with no repercussions. Spent most of her time in the office talking about inappropriate things like her monthly and several other things. Also had employees working off-the-clock which is totally illegal when reported company did not seem to care. All in all I would not recommend this company especially the north Factory Outlet.
bad,"No training, thrown to the wolves sort if speak. Store always dirty, co-workers gossip about everyone. If they don't like you- you'll be forced out. Accusations that are not true messes with your character and integrity."
bad,"There is absolutely no training in this job, you're expected to just pick up as you go.Hours are slim after the holiday season, and I recommend everyone to be careful when getting hired. "
bad,I had a terrible time working here. None of the coworkers were friendly and no one would really interact with each other. It wasn't a fun work environment at all. You are extremely minimally trained and have no idea what you're supposed to be doing the majority of the time. It's way too much work for terrible pay. You're expected to wear their extremely expensive clothes that you can't even afford with their minimum wage pay.
bad,"One great thing about Express is the associates, the clothing that they offer is very good quality.. and dedicated customers. However, the management is very unprofessional, rude to other's, no sympathy  of outside personal issues of associates..Please if u dare stay away from this store....training!!! what training,"
bad,"I have been employed at Express for less than 6 months and I was hired under the false pretense that it was full time and I would be working 40 hours a week. Well actually, its part time and I'm not working no more than 30 hours a week and I haven't worked since Black Friday and I'm a regular sales associate not seasonal."
bad,"i worked here seasonal and i thought that working there would be great and really fun but NO. "
bad,Voicing your opinions and thoughts are frowned upon and upper management does not take fair action.
bad,"I loved interacting with the customers, they were fun and usually nice.  I have worked in retail for over 14 years, and I have never left a company with such a sour taste in my mouth.  Certain management said everything ""you"" wanted to hear to get you to not leave them.  They are sneaky about business, and mix social with work daily.  The company itself is struggling and starting to take away employee perks. There are more times that the customer and employees get the same discount.  This store has not only lost me as an employee, but a customer as well."
bad,"Wanted to run you day and night without proper rest. Didnt want to maintain trucks. Gave good runs that made money to his buddies. Management didnt tell you about expenses until they occurred."
bad,os dias de trabalho tenhen sido bons.
bad,"very rude and mean management with crew members also with customers, they don’t pay enough for what they make you do, they expect too much from employees !"
bad,"Manager was more of a friend than actual manager, very petty and childish. Hours weren't even good got about 2 days for a bi-weekly paycheck. Not a good place to work at all"
bad,"the store its self is very nice and they really do have great prices, so from a customer stand point its awesome! working there on the other hand was awful. management and the owners are rude and youll never get past the feeling that no matter how hard youre working its not enough and youre expendable. you can expect to start out making very low hourly pay (about 25 cents over minimum wage) and very very low job security."
bad,"Love the outside work interactions we had (offf-site meetings).  A lot of positions competition, so difficult to advance."
bad,"There were times when I genuinely loved coming to work, but it became clear that Express does not care for its employees.  From cut payroll, so that management staff has to do three times the work we are paid for, to nasty customers that the company bends over backwards for even at the expense of their staff..."
bad,transporting cars was fun taking all the new cars to their dealership so they can get shipped off to the right company so people can drive them the co-workers was rude the hardest part was not to hit the other cars that was park i enjoy driving
bad,Very nice clothing and discount other than that horrible place to work. Store management  was clueless about everything they talked behind each others back especially about the store manger.  Very unprofessional.
bad,"Managing staff to reach company goals"
bad,Not the best place. No hours are given because they dont want to give benefits
bad,We would work together and talk .Make the day go by fast and great communication
bad,"I've been in retail for quite some time, I enjoy sales an being a customer service representative but my time at express made me feel the total opposite. The environment was ideal, fellow co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job an what made it a bad experience was 'managment' as well as lack of sales incentives when goals were made..The most enjoyable part of the job was the location an being able to meet so many different people..."
bad,"To establish a career in which I will be a positive force. To be an energetic, dynamic employee in a career that offers challenges; wherein I will meet, exceed and create new goals for myself."
bad,"The job itself is nice, co-workers feel like family BUT the pay is not worth it. Don't recommend it. Typical day at work is sweeping in the mornings, ringing up customers, help customers on the sales floor, folding & organizing merchandise"
bad,Working there was not fun. There was favoritism and caddyness. The made you do busy work when there were not customers in  the store and you always had to be moving.
bad,"* exhausting, over worked, under paid "
bad,"Being a small business, it did not have enough budget to have two in-house developers. No career path was there. Subpar benefits. Weird rules on parking in the parking lot. Be careful in parking in someone's parking space even though it does not have any reserve parking sign."
bad,There is certainly a good ole boys club at Express.  There are serious management issues that step from poor spending and lack of true subject matter knowledge.  The CMO for example did not understand specialty retail and the CEO could not select an assortment.
bad,"My time at express was an ok experience, my typical work day consisted of taking municipal transportation to downtown san Francisco and going into the mall. i learned how to work autonomously due to the lack of employees, i operated the mens floor alone often times. my managers constantly argued over our headsets, the hardest part of the job had to be listening to that each and every shift."
bad,"I started my Express career on Black Friday weekend. No proper training; simply put on the floor and "" learn as you go"". Intimidating at first, but the routine becomes easier over time. In two years, I was able to learn the ins and outs of a retail store. Wore many different hats including brand assistant, stylist and management of the stockroom. Cons: Management did not pay competitive wage although insisted on maxing out my part time hours; would be expected to do more work for very minimum pay. Would play favorites, and over work good talent. Pros: Learning daily about styles, trends, and overall fashion environment. Depending on team, very enjoyable work place."
bad,got a new job and didn't show up. they said i cant work for them again.I was in a need of a job in a time of crisis and they rejected me. i felt unappreciated. i need help was all.
bad,This was a sesonal job so a typical work day is when they would call there employees to work and we would help customers with finding what they want to buy. Some days we would stay til after 12:00 am sorting out clothes til 4:00 am. I learned to keep myself busy while working on the floor. The workplace is friendly where mangement would be on the floor helping out. Sometimes the hardest of the job is getting there on time because the manager can call an employee to work last minute. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting discounts.
bad,I don't make much here but I do love my boss she's a sweet heart and I feel like there is no room for advancement since it's just a clothing store. Not enough hours and I enjoy working with my co workers. I feel like the company itself should pay more for the work thats given.
bad,High Call sales and Quotas. No benefits available. weekly paychecks part-time only. Maintaining all the accounts and customer complaints.
bad,"Very kind management ,  the  very  fast  pace and large amount of different parts makes training a bit difficult  .lots of  heavy lifting and 12  hour shifts with voluntary and some mandatory over  time ."
bad,It a great place to meet cool people but the pay is horrible. I would not get into retail ever again.
bad,"Fast-paced, very challenging, and must be able to adapt to change."
bad,"They want you to work on their time, and what they want you to do."
bad,I just had an overall bad experience with them. I was promoted and the lady that promoted me passed away and the new management unpromoted me after. It is a 50/50 chance with these people.
bad,"I worked for this company for 16 years. It was mostly in a part0time position, which was great. I enjoyed working part-time while holding down a full-time position elsewhere. For the last 18 months of my time there, I stepped into a full-time management roll. Promises for growth were made, but never came to fruition. I went through 4 different District Managers with zero forward movement toward my stated goal until ultimately being driven out based on heresay and technicalities. I would recommend Express as a part-time job, but NOT as a full-time management position."
bad,"While at Express there was no sense of an organized workplace, nor was there a good attitude presented by half of the management staff. Regular tasks were not explained, goals were only communicated in terms of what needs to be met, not how to achieve them. There was little recognition for staff efforts, or efforts made to help struggling team members. I have learned very little with my time at Express and do not recommend it to anyone. It is a very superficial work environment that does not offer any real benefits to its associates. I really do not have a part of the job that I enjoy."
bad,basically my schedule has been messed up every week and closing shift has to pick up everything. Also expect to stay least 30 mins after your shift time. Closing shift expect it to be like 40 mins untill you can leave.
bad,Somewhat okay working there but mangers not so great to work with easy task love helping customers answering questions just don't give time to get work clothing
bad,"Express is a temporary agency, and they did find me a job, however, there were quite a few reasons that I listed above that displeased me, including low pay for the work being done, no paid sick days, and very little, if any, benefits."
bad,"So been here for about a year and some change and all i have to say about this place is its a wonderful place to work at but management suck, policies suck too (they are so strict with call outs yet coworkers would lie just so they can have the day off..) um pay sucks.. customers suck... you have to constantly talk go customers and get them to buy merch and the management forces credit cards... i dont like working here. If i was some of you i will run away.. this jobs a dead end."
bad,"There are reasons I only stayed here for only about 4 months... the hours were very inconsistent, and I would get called in AT LEAST twice a week because people would just drop their shift for no reason or not show up. The coworkers were a little rude and weren’t very welcoming at all. The pay was only .50 cents over minimum wage, and they only give you a raise after a year. Management was ok, nothing special."
bad,"Working at express was good for entry level retail experience, I   felt very outsided working there kind of like the black sheep of the workplace, it just wasn't a good fit"
bad,"The manager is young, and new to the leading role. so there was a lot of back and forth between the other customer rep.  The main manager kept talking about his old store I guess he felt nostalgia. They break there day into segments, and if you have the morning segment, and the customers that walk in arent converted into sales, you later have to explain why you didn't make that segment. Its retail."
bad,i dont recommand this place the pay rate is very low and the discount is okay you get 40% but thats about it other places in that mall be having better pay rate
bad,"up sale! up sale!  up sale! I have work with the Express company for 10 years and there is no room for advance growth. The job promotes with in only when someone quits and is no longer working for that position. You have to earn your hours by meting your sale quota for the department your working in. and you must open up a lot of credit card accounts 2 a day  to beat sales quota. that the only way for management to see your performance and to get you more hours. you must bring in at least 256.00 to the cash wrap each hour. to hit quota, if you are not sale to each customer  you are not working. you must stress the promotion to every single customer. after all the hard work you do not  get  any % bonus only a hourly check and a very small discount when you buy the merchandise for full price. yes the cheep clothing prices are high."
bad,"typical day would depend on which shift you worked, either you opened or closed. in general, you organize/fold clothes, or you keep to the cash register as directed. i learned the ins and outs of the system (Point of Sale). hardest part of the job is closing on a very busy night, cleaning up other people's mess. management was super dramatic; filled with rigid females who only see your value in how quickly you do tasks, and how many credit cards you sign up. the only enjoyable part of the job was the slim chance you get scheduled with another associate. Other associates were pretty fun. if you like retail, then this stuff is for you. just be careful, this one is filled with drama."
bad,working at expresswas a drag. so much going on and no comunication. the staff lacked massive customer service. a typical day is cleaning and dealing with loud obnoxous people
bad,"I enjoyed the time I spent at Express. I learned a lot about different aspects of retail business, however when I was relocated to another location, I do not believe I was treated fairly in the terms of me being a member of management. I was treated more like a supervisor than an assistant manager by the new manager. Tasks were given to me that were generally given to the part time supervisors and other managers were given other opportunities that I was not."
bad,It was fun working there but the store manager favored people and went above and beyond for them. A lot of drama happened that could have been left at the door before they entered work but over all it was a good job to work. Company was selfish but the people in the store I worked were professional and friendly.
bad,"God awful pay for a store that charges so much for clothing. It's relaxed with the dress code and attendance but managers are unprofessional and careless. "
bad,Really didn't like working there. It was extremely inconvenient and inconsistent. Not a very good work place too much drama. I dreaded coming into work .
bad,"Typical sales associate position. rude customers, entitled middle management, cliquey coworkers. nothing new.. Pay was bad but the other stores in the mall were nice."
bad,"The hours were very minimal and they had times where they made you feel temporary. The starting pay was minimum wage and it didn't really seem fair taking into account all the differ net things or task you were doing. I really needed a job at the time so it was a job that I had to just keep some money in my pocket, but it wasn't enough to pay bills and things like that."
bad,I was in a accident and they did not help protect my job  No insurance benefits  no short term disability offered  no compassion nor any help with a bad situation .
bad,"Not a lot of job fulfillment, long hours, low compensation. Many times a 6 day work week is required. Great co workers, really enjoyed my team"
bad,"Express Employment Pro, is a temp to hire service. I've been staffed with a couple of companies for a limited amount of time. Last company I was sent to by them was a telemarketer job."
bad,it was a good job people there were nice and made me feel comfortable but the only reason i left was because I wasn't being put on the schedule as much and I felt like the managers could have been more reliable
bad,I enjoyed my job at Express as the Stock Manager however that was short lived due to the unprofessionalism exhibited by the upper management team. They were not supportive of their staff and lacked the knowledge of how to train and motivate the staff to do better. Most days there were very draining because managment had a tendency to be very negative and created a hostile work environment. Very uncomfortable...I loved the position and the challenge it presented daily but not the work environment created by managment
bad,"Express was a very busy store. It was one of the high-priced stores that i worked at in Charlotte. It was on the southside at Southpark Mall. It was on made for me to work seasonal but my skills were good enough for me to get hired on part time, but unfortunately i had to move back to Danville Va so my time at Express had to end"
bad,Job is great. everything else is not. availability is asked for (four times) and never looked at. unable to work here anymore because shifts change week to week and not predictable.
bad,Did not get any hours at all and it was just a mess. The managers would get all the hours anf i wouldnt get to leave at the time i was supposed to leave.
bad,I always go above and beyond was is expected of me. I do not like that the pay is so low and that we are not allowed to go over 20 hours. The managers are easy to talk to and we all work as a team but at times the work load is not equally distributed.
bad,"It was a good first job to teach about the workforce but beyond that there were ridiculous standards of appearance, terrible pay, and uncaring managers (not all of them)."
bad,Working at Express help me improve my communication skills and also help me learn problem solving skills when it came to making sure the customers were happy with the clothing's they brought.
bad,"typical retail job"
bad,"The store management was solely interested in reaching their hourly sales goals, and making the customers number one. This may not appear to be out of the ordinary but, they really were not too involved in the needs of their associates. This was my first job in a larger retail chain, and in working for other large chains, I've learned that Express absolutely should have done more for us. I was making minimum wage for much longer than I should have. People were being promised promotions and raises, and the managers were going back on their word. I would be scheduled one night to close, and be in the mall until about 2 AM; the manager would know I didn't have my own car, at that point, but would guilt me into staying much too late, considering my ride had been waiting outside. After said closing shift, I would sometimes be scheduled for the morning shift, eight hours later. Even though there was much misery in working for this company, I did learn a whole lot about working for a store. I gained most of my advanced register skills, opened my eyes to the visual aspect of retail, and can maintain a store better than my own bedroom. The associates whom I worked alongside were also very pleasant. For that, I do not completely regret working for the company."
bad,"A typical day at the Express location that I was an employee at was very slow, the weekend was usually the busiest. Even though it was slow I learned a lot about the company and how to properly demonstrate customer service. Management was very unorganized. I didn't really get the chance to get to know any of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the managers/supervisors of the store weren't as patient as they should have been with me. They always seemed annoyed to teach me how to operate the cash register etc."
bad,help keep store organized. learned people skills. co workers were respectful and management was nice.
bad,Work at EXPRESS was not as expected. co workers tend to be rude to one another. Management would apply what they had agreed on and made me work in days i couldnt and i had spoken to them about.
bad,The work environment is okay but the discount isnt great because the clothes are so expensive. The management team are not supportive.
bad,"I started on black Friday. I was very uncomfortable almost all the time I was there and I barely knew anything, they just threw me out there with no real introduction to the job."
bad,"Express is an interesting place to"
bad,"This place is horrible! From the management, to the hours, it is absolutely horrendous! Save yourself the trouble and do not work for this company!!!!"
bad,"I learned newer cloths can still be wrinkle and we had a dream steamer to unwrinkle the cloths which was nice. I've always loved working for retail because I feel like I have a people person skills, and would know what they want or needed. The hard part about this job is their is too much shipment which is alot of cloths the get sold quickly."
bad,"The best thing about this job is my coworkers. They are fun to work with. Management is horrible. They do not care about their employees. All they care about is making money. The managers mistreat their employees, abuse their power and can be quite condescending at times. The pay is more than minimum wage but is low compared to other retailers. If you need something that is quick and temporary and you don't mind dealing with the mangers then this is the place for you otherwise look somewhere else."
bad,"This company was so much better when it was owned by Limited Brands."
bad,"Working here is cool, the discount is ok but the hours suck. You barely get any. No real chance of moving up unless managers really like you. The employees and managers are cool but work is what you make out of it. The biggest con here is the pay and the hours"
bad,great for high school kids and kids who are just starting off in college.
bad,Don't have work for everyone.Only work for 7 weeks at a time then your back looking for work for 5 to 6 weeks.
bad,"Express has 8 seasons in each year, with lack of manpower, each TD needs to work overtime almost everyday."
bad,- A lot of working in particular zones of the store.
bad,"In the beginning I loved working at express I enjoyed coming into work every day. The managers was cool, my co-worker was polite, and i was making great hours. That all came to a halt when new management came, I didn't get enough hours and it wasn't has fun either."
bad,"When I first started at Express it was a dream job. Absolutely loved working there and my coworkers and managers were people I could look up to. Working there for three years really took it's toll on me mentally and physically. Company expects a lot of work for little pay. Treated like a commission paid job but its hourly. I made less than $10/hour as a manager. Very high chance of burn out.  Just an exhausting environment, introverts beware!"
bad,"It's a retail job, so you know the drill: do a lot of work and don't get paid much or receive steady hours. You have to assist customers, maintain an orderly floor, do stock runs, checkout, etc., but you don't get to have a decent wage. With low hours you can expect to be home a lot since you can't really afford to go anywhere."
bad,a boring and typical job for a high school student. The job is simple depending on where they put you if its in the front your jib is basically greet/help and cash out customers. If your put in the back of the store you fold new clothes and sort them on the racks and shelves on the floor.
bad,"This is a fast paced work environment that requires a lot of interactions with guests. A typical day at work is pushing sales, ensuring that everything is stocked and organized up to standards, and handling cashier duties.There is a strict demand to make sales, with verbal reprimanding. Being a supervisor can lead to very long hours during the day, sometimes over night work."
bad,"It's a secure job with flexible hours, perfect for students. Not something I would recommend for post grads or adults. I enjoyed my time there though."
bad,"I felt that the assignment that was given to me was a dead end job, where I would never be hired on. I found out that no one had been hired in my position in 3 years. If you want to be a temp for years with no paid vacation and no benefits help yourself."
bad,Co-workers were relatively easy to deal with. Management on the other hand I think needed to be trained more properly. Hardest part of the job would be asking for more hours. Most enjoyable part was helping customers.
bad,"Long work days, difficult work/life balance, high turnover in lower mgmt.  Hours can be very demanding, pay is fair.  Discount is very good, benefits are also very good."
bad,"At express Limited i served as part time tutor, preparing students for the standardized grade six examination in Jamaica-GSAT. Express Limited was a privately own institution that helped with the preparation of students for National examinations"
bad,"A typical day at work: allows many opportunities to connect with customers who want your help"
bad,"Pay was good, however as a store manager you have no say, you are basically a puppet."
bad,Working at this landscape job we would usually get calls for different landscaping tasks so we had the ability to do a variety of things. I had co workers who were a joy to work with and made the job enjoyable. sometimes the hardest part of the job would be having long work days with short breaks due to the time limit but I enjoyed being able to learn how to do jobs that I didn't know how to do prior to being employed at this job.
bad,As soon as you're clocked in you put to work. Loved speaking to customers. Co-workers chilled and easy to speak too.
bad,Was able to meet people and provide excellent customer service.
bad,"Very young, fast-paced. High turnover rate. Work-life balance is very poor. Boot camp of the retail world."
bad,"I've been with express for almost two years and to sum up my work experience there i would have to say that overall it was a 4 on a scale from 1-10. The managers and working conditions were poor, and they always seemed to change a policy whether it be regarding cashiers or dress code. The pay for everyone was unfair and aafter a year you are supposed to receive a raise (i have yet to recieve mine). If you need a job simply to make money then work at express, otherwise? if you are looking for a fun job where you can love what you do and make money, apply somewhere else"
bad,"If you are thinking about working for Express, don't expect to have any hours. If you need to work financial reasons, Express is not the place for you. You would end up spending more money to work there that what they pay you. You are required to wear their brand or solid clothing close to theirs. If you can't afford to shop at Express, don't even try to work there"
bad,Express gave long hours. Not very flexible with their hours and would always change their schedual around. Most of the time the management was stessed and rushing.
bad,"The work is easy but the pay is awful. Express is a good starter job for high school student who want or need working experience. They start at $7.25/hr and only go up 25¢ every year for sales associates. The hours range from 4-6hr shifts. Only managers can be full time employees, this makes it even harder to make any kind of money. Management does work with school schedules and is extremely flexible."
bad,"I worked at Express for a month or so, I was hired as a part time sales associate. The people I worked with were great, but I was being scheduled less and less and eventually not scheduled at all. I was not told I was let go or even fired. They just stopped scheduling me and that was the end of it. I was asked to come in many months later for a shift (out of the blue to cover someone) but then was told nevermind. Very weird but I moved on from it."
bad,"Express has a strong work culture. No dress code and very nice people in the office. However, upper management does not listen to suggestions well. They act like they will help with concerns, but they rarely address the issues at hand. There is a lack of career growth especially in the planning and allocation team."
bad,its okay if your in need for something short but overall it isnt worth it short hours sometimes they call you telling you to not come in because they have to take hours away from employees .
bad,It is a retail company that sells clothing sales at discounted retail sales rates to shoppers in shopping retail malls. Mostly had to deal with store merchandise.
bad,Like any other retail job. You only make enough to pay your phone bill. If you have real bills don't work here. If you need pocket change and you like express clothing and just want the discount go for it.
bad,"Of all the retail stores that I have worked in, Express has to be the worst. Discount is good but policies are unnecessary and tedious."
bad,Almost every closing shift I had I would stay 2 hours later than scheduled. I really liked the people I worked with but after hours of folding my back would be sore and when my shift was over there would always be one more thing I would be asked to do. The managers were awesome but are more concerned with getting recovery perfect than with making sure their employees leave at the correct times.
bad,"As a first job I recommend applying but as time pass and you learn try finding something new that will appreciate your work and time, not you use and make you work how for a minimum wages, it’s a lot of stress when you don’t get pay good enough for you hard work so it’s your choice"
bad,"The environment wasn't the best , even though the workers weren't the nicest the discount was what kept me at Express. But very similar to a day at Dillard's ,which was SALESSS ."
bad,provide an exceptional customer service to our customers. always make sure customers leave the store feeling better than when they've entered.
bad,"A typical day is coming in and chatting In with a manager. "
bad,"My normal day would be looking after my customers and making sure each one is satisfied. I would also suggest certain clothing and outfits that I personal thought would look good for that customer or that fit similar to what they were looking for. I learned about customer service satisfaction to a T. I learned how to suggest things just by looking at a customer. Management made work fun and helped with certain areas that needed to be critiqued. My co-workers also made work a fun environment and they made sure that if I needed help, things got done. The hardest part was learning everything so quickly. I enjoyed learning things and being around people who tried to make work go by faster. I also enjoyed making my customers happy and satisfied."
bad,I built units that the military flies Predator Drones from. Hands on construction work with high powered tools.
bad,Company used to thrive couple years back and actually be a more top-tier brand. Now seems like another failing Aeropostale. Now a days you can tell the hiring process has gotten a lot lenient due to now allowing 16-years old to work there.
bad,"At my particular location, management is great and the environment is fun and friendly. However, I work as a full time sales associate at a Best Buy, so I have experience with a well ran company and work standards - there are many things that are critical to a good experience for workers and customers alike, that are portrayed and treated nonchalantly and as inconsequential (SOP procedures, safety procedures, notall itsms thaare supposed to be security tagged are tagged, there was about 20 minutes of formal “training” that teach you how to fold, tag, ring, etc. correctly."
bad,Not enough jobs. Always looking to hear back and dont. When calling them they never have any jobs at them moment. I need to find a job as soon as possible
bad,the people they have working at the location where I was act dont do anything and they through all the work on the new people glad I was fireD because I didnt know how to quit
bad,Typical day you come in and find your orders to be delivered. Sometimes it's ready most times not. Didn't really teach me anything. Your given your paperwork and have to deliver to homes and businesses. The hardest part of the job was when they sent you out of your delivery area. Best part was you work by yourself on the deliveries.
bad,"I worked here because I thought that retail experience would be beneficial in the fashion industry. While I still believe that to be true, the mall was always dead and management was changing. Since I was one of the few neat and organized employees they asked me to do shipment a lot. Saying that the trusted that I would do it right. It just wasn't really what I was expecting. I wanted more sales experience and to help style customers."
bad,"Depending on the division you worked for, the culture was very different.  The retail division had great plans in place to ensure deadlines could be made. They were more involved with the stores and development of the staff.  On the Outlet side there was not enough hours given to accomplish the expected work load.  Meaning I was working a large amount of overtime (which would have been better spent training the team) Many hours were spent by management trying to just keep the store together not allowing for the training that I believed the staff needed. There was little to no guidance above the store level, no active involvement from DM's or any other corporate officials."
bad,The opportunity is there if you are willing to work for. Like all the retail jobs you want to do plenty of people and finances day to day.  This was not a bad job just not for me.
bad,"Typical day at work involved doing inventory, folding clothes, helping customers find whatever they needed, making recommendations, informing customers of promotions."
bad,"It was an amazing place to work at when i had school. Flexible hours, great people to have around me to succeed, and management cared about everyone. I made a lot of friends while there and learned a lot about careers in the future. The hardest part of the job was generating sales of the company credit card, and i hated that fact about the job. It was hard denying people that weren't able to qualify for it. I sacrificed low income for a chance at friends and good times."
bad,"The job CAN be fun if you work with fun people, if not, the job can be so boring and life draining. Fortunate enough, I worked with the right people."
bad,good starter job for anyone who wants to have a good start with a technical background
bad,"Wasn't really into retail. The pay isn't enough and the store is just too crazy, too many customers running in and out"
bad,No room to move up. Very strict on making the daily revenue goal.
bad,Sell clothes and credit cards while maintaining store visuals
bad,"Express is not the best corporation to work for. As a manager, I was asked to cut hours to the point that customer service and visual standards were forced to suffer. This was not acceptable to me for the simple fact that we were doing amazing at the time of these cuts."
bad,"Loved it at first, but you get low balled depending on location; it’s a great job especially if you’re just starting out. I moved up quite fast but the pay isn’t worth it at all."
bad,"I would start early in the morning and have to travel all the city with even if it was raining, sometimes in extreme weather, snow, flooding..I learned the city very well, my management was make up of good people, whom were also messagers...my co-workers were Cool people, we all got along, there was the monthly Blow ups...but these were hard working men...the hardest part of my job...was delivery a packages and the customers were not home...going home after my last run, "
bad,"fun group of girls,fun clothes to merchandise, good bonus programs"
bad,The job had some fun things about it but the managers mainly only care about money. You could try as hard as you can and your work will go unnoticed...
bad,I disliked my time at express because I hardly received any hours because I worked per diem but was hired part time. 
bad,"Gives NO hours, but you have a discount of 30% but they try to make you buy a lot of clothes but will only give you 3-10 hours in a week or even two, so you don't even have gas money."
good,"lots of work to be honest and a lot of work feels unappreciated here. I became a sale leader, but unfortunately had to quit after my availability was being disregarded. I have school till 3, and they would schedule me at 10 am. I asked to have Tuesdays off, and they scheduled me Tuesdays. It was a good company overall, but as for my location I did not feel appreciated for the effort I gave."
good,"I worked at Express for about 9 months, give or take. At first, I was super excited, as I loved the clothing (Still do!) and I thought the brand was really fresh and new. The team I was with was pretty good, we didn't fight or disagree much, but our manager was a different story. At first, I thought she was pretty relaxed, easy going and motivated to help us out as much as she could. But as time went on and we opened the store and went through the first fall and winter, she quickly became someone I absolutely despised working with. She would make comments that made me uncomfortable, so much as to having microaggression, borderline racist comments to me. She also was the least punctual person I've ever worked, coming in 2 hours after she was supposed to, and leaving early for no reason. She'd schedule everyone so weirdly, not really working with your availability, and would often schedule you on days you had requested off MONTHS beforehand. No one would report her though, and her behavior continued for months even after I left, and to this day, to my knowledge. She couldn't keep associates because of the scheduling issues, and there was no real reason to stay there. There was no room for advancement whatsoever. I felt completely trapped. Funny enough, I trained at a different location, under a different manager and different team, and I absolutely loved it. I would've gladly worked for that Express, instead of the one I ended up. Overall, my problems weren't with the company, but with the manager who was not equipped from the get-go and just ruined the experience for me and a"
good,"Did not Enjoy work to life balance."
good,exceso de programaciones y multiples metas no pagadas ademas de las trabas para la obtencion de tus vacaciones
good,I have gotten better with organizing folding clothes putting them in order an takin my time
good,"Custom farm operational, a typical day consists of heavy lifting mechanical knowledge driving,  "
good,everybody is very nice but its a really senseless job. they cut your shift if they are not making money even though you are scheduled. sometimes ill leave at 1am just because they cut a lot of people and at the end of the day ill get stuck doing everything. its also a multimillionaire company a year and you start at 8.25 an hour and and whenever you are about to get to your 40 hours to do overtime they send you home. 50+ employees and nobody gets hours. in a McDonald's job you will get more money in a week. only ones benefited there are managers they are always working and everyone else gets cut. there's nothing to enjoy. i hate my job.. when you get pay they give you an extra discount trynna wash employees minds to spend 140$ a week that most people get back on them. oooppss forgot something also my store manager only thinks about herself and gets the best shifts and about the money that she makes.
good,"The manager hires too many people to work at once."
good,"Express is a fun place to work to sell clothes although the some managers need to be taught both people and managing skills. While it is great to meet people and sell the product it can be very difficult as a student to maintain this job during the holiday season. During the rest of the year, it is impossible to keep up with daily expenses such as gas and basic bills. There are no opportunities for advancement and this is just a basic job to get you just enough money to cover a pair of jeans, which you are forced to wear."
good,Management very unorganized and some can be very mean at time. Very low pay and short hours. Worked there for almost a year and no raise. Coworkers were great though.
good,It's a good starting job. I learned how to fold clothes nicely and learned a few things about the clothes they offer. It's nice to see the style would be good for professional use.
good,I think it's a good temporary job but if you are looking for a full time job it's not worth the time. I only work for 4-5 hours a day and only work 2-3 times a week.
good,My experience with Express was filled with lots of team work and a lot of activities accomplished during seasonal changes. Definitely a job with a sense of urgency and great customer service ..
good,This company is ridiculous and requires too much from its associates. I wonder if they've forgotten that college students typically work in these stores. Managers are extremely lazy (in my experience) and leave all of the work for associates. If business is tough the associates are blamed for the lack of success. Managers don't know how to achieve goals and talk to their team.
good,"Behind the scenes, this company is not very professional. The goal posts are constantly in flux and micromanagement is queen."
good,"come in, count items in boxes, sort items, sensor and steam items, put them out on the sales floor, help customers on the sales floor as needed, keep the backroom organized. the hardest part of the job was being alone and having no help."
good,Managers do not care for their employees. They have big favoritism when it comes to giving hours.
good,"Working at Express for three years you learn a lot. Before leaving Express I learned how to do almost anything. I worked in the fitting rooms, cash register, on the sales floor, and even in the back room. Being an extremely diverse employee you would think you would get more compensation. However this was not the case. Also, I would take on shifts I did not need to and still, no recognition."
good,A typical day at work would be bonding with your customers to help them leave happy and accomplished. It was encouraged to always be doing something to better the store and everything in it. The management was never very good. In the short time I worked there I had two different managers and several different co-workers.
good,Not a good environment to work in. Management is irresponsible and all over the place. They are not considerate towards employees feelings or needs. Everyone there is all about themselves!!!
good,"Depending in which store one works, the management team would prefer to talk about other managers in other Express stores and envy other managers that are doing great in their own stores. "
good,Express overall isn’t a bad place to work. Coworkers are amazing it’s management that needs some help. Unrealistic sales goals to meet and you keep getting pushed to open up credit cards for customers to meet daily/weekly goals.
good,"My typical workday required me to style customers for any summer events they had to attend too. "
good,The CEO of Express has no idea how the stores are operated and what happens on a daily basis. His too busy counting money in his underwear.  Overwhelming
good,This was a difficult place to work at.  The environment was toxic and unhealthy.  The management at the time was not good either.  They kept changing managers.  There's a reason why the store closed down
good,"Macho operation. Looked over palitizer every time it broke down I had to fix it. Some times boxes would fall over while the machine was trying to stack them on pallet. Another problem was, the computer my malfunction and I had to go in and reset the computer."
good,"Falta compromiso en administracion y falta de compromiso en herramientas de trabajo , buses en mal estado."
good,"Not a good job to work, only given 4 hour shifts. The management team is sometimes not understanding about the lack of hours. Low pay, not worth it. Intense responsibility for a very small store"
good,I learned about policies that the company enforced and how to accommodate customer's needs. I learned the middle-ground for the customers. I did not feel like I was able to move up in the company.
good,Poor communication throughout entire store. Store manager lacked any presence on the sales floor which resulted in poor effort from associates. Little growth in company.
good,"I was both a cashier and sales associate. Enjoyed working with my co-workers and learned more about fashion, the clothing and how to give a person what they needed."
good,Nice job but no job security (parttime status only).  Looking for better job opportunities.
good,"Fast-paced, hard work, and no benefits is how I would describe working for Express. If you have little to substantial bills to pay, Express is not the company for you. However, if you only have, say a phone bill to worry about, then you may fit right in. Hours are scarce, minimum wage is what you can expect (no matter what your qualifications are), and few shifts per week."
good,Always have to work weekends hours are poor. Management always gets into a frenzy when higher ups come in town.
good,Depends store to store. I've worked in multiple and each was different. Management has generally been there X+ years and is stuck in a set way of doing things. A lot of passive aggressiveness towards those who they themselves have trained but are not as well versed in the Express way as they are. Discount is good. Hours are long for the workload expected. Minimal payroll. Express needs to focus less on constantly revamping the store and go back to focusing on the customer experience. The customer will be happier shopping in a store that is fun and familiar versus a store where things are always moved and staff is turned over monthly.
good,"Management is so terrible that nobody lasts. Starting pay was terrible until you moved up."
good,"good job self-employed lost contract pick-up meds and deliver to 8 rehabilitation sites.  The hardest finding new locations and dealing with traffic. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with patients, nurses, and doctors."
good,"It's a pretty cool work environment for younger employees, like myself. Great for a college student looking for a part-time--as long as they are being supported by their parents. Didn't work out too long for me as I needed to satisfy more financial responsibilities. The hours are pretty bad, so you barely make any money yet they expect you to wear Express clothing and not wear anything too old from them. So really, they just pay you enough just so you can give them your money back. Even with the discount, clothes from Express are pretty expensive when you're only getting 5-20 hours a week at minimum wage. The cheapest stuff they have are casual tees. You're only allowed to wear Express jeans which are about $50 after your discount. MAYBE you can get away with it if your manager is more lenient, but not always the case. If you're going to work here, it better be for a pass time, starter, immediate manager position or even stock associate."
good,The management gossiped and talked a lot instead of getting work done. Played favoritism to the employees they liked. Blamed others for things they did wrong.
good,Keeps you up to date with fashion. Constantly meeting new people. Making new friends. Building customer loyalty. Surprisingly you grow and learn  alot about yourself working in retail​.
good,"express is a temp work place "
good,Great clothing and discounts for its employees. Management was not the best and was not flexible with school schedules.
good,"The job required alot of work for minimum wage. Coworkers were very friendly, some managers were okay and others were extremely disrespectful."
good,"fun and exciting place to work, there aren't all of places for advancement and the upper management and compensation could've been better"
good,Long hours long standing but that's if you into retail very low pay it was very dis organized stock room.
good,"Okay so I had my group interview and was  hired a day later. You do have to wear express jeans (any top as long as it doesnt have a logo) so I bought jeans with my 30% off. Later that day when I was closing I was offered my 50% off of 300$purchase bcuz my store was about 100$from meeting its mark.I declined and tried to do it the next day...then I was told I have to wait :/... Itypically have gotten all the time off I ask for.When im working its not fun at all the associates are only supposed to talk to the customers and tell every single person that comes in the sales of the day...im good with customer service but theres most likely a manager watching you. My schedule will day I get off at 9 but im usslly there until 11ish. We nvr get out on time even if you arent closing I always get off a hour late. I have a manager that wants us to send all the guy customers to her, I got written up for helping a guy find jeans for insubordination.When I  closing with a manager they usually stand around and talk about other managers or associates...not even caring my standing there. Maybe its just where I work necause the people are very very catty. I have aanager that acuses everyone of stealing openly. If I return something im isualy hounded by a manager cause its a ""bad look"" uhhh I bought a guys graffic.tee in a size extra small amd they almost wouldnt let me cause I was buying boys clothes and im not married and didnt believe it was for me...until I showed them the outfit I wanted to wear it with...im currently looking for another job"
good,As a salaried employee I always had to work to cover the store hours open to close. As the store was in a rural area it was hard to employee sales representatives at just minimum wage
good,"I worked here for over a year, had great attendance and loved having to get dressed like a walking mannequin for work. The 30% discount was wonderful, I must say. Employees were given the appropriate breaks for the hours they worked and managers were kind. "
good,"On a typical day at work, I work multiple reports, functioned in a lead capacity in answering questions and I am also the Reserach Technician for the Pfizer Data Entry Department."
good,"A typical day would include assisting customers, building sales, and managing the registers. The management and environment is a little bit skewed but all in all its a great experience. The hardest part of the job would be holiday season but in the end it's all worth it. The most enjoyable part would be meeting different people and personalities and being able to build sales."
good,Every week your schedule changes and there are call-in shifts. I prefer not to work weekends or nights but is a good job while in school.
good,Typical sales at a retail store.
good,"The management side of this position is simple, keep the store in order and assign tasks for associates. The sales and credit card goals they push are ridiculous. Upper management gets bonuses/perks for meeting the goals and the sales associates who make it happen get minimum wage. Very high turnover rate and very rarely had a quality trained team to work with."
good,I liked working there but now i don’t anymore . mangers have their favorites . they promise you will more hours but thats a lie . honestly the environment is not healthy .
good,"I believe my time at Express would have been better off if we had had a better management team. One didn't care about anything going on in the store, another cared WAY too much and drove us all mad, and another one you could walk all over and acted more like a timid mouse than a manager. Overall, in my short time with the company, I recognized the decline in the product quality and the rise of prices."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"This was my 1st job and I worked there for 4 years. It took me 3 years just to get a raise and the management was not great. The Manager was really nice but the co-manager was annoying and made the job stressful. She was always micromanaging everyone. Too many employees, it was hard to get hours. But there were'nt enough sales leads, I saw my friends as part-time sales leads work full-time hours. The staff was fun though, best part about the job is that you can make your own hours."
good,"While employed, the store cycled through two store managers. The first was terrible both as a manager and as a person. But the second manager was a one who lead by example, coached and inspired growth in the employee's personal and professional development."
good,"I started off with a great manager who was dedicated to the staff and the store, who left for another store, their replacement didn't care how the store was ran and thus the sales associates took all of the workload on themselves and it was a dysfunctional mess. I loved the vibe and style but in my short time there I saw a decline in  the product quality."
good,I worked at EXPRESS as a second job. I needed some extra money. I only worked 1 day a week which the manager told me was normal. I quit after a month and a half because I couldn't just work 1 day a week. It wasn't worth it.
good,"People you work with and relationship you build are great. The stores are a fun place to shop and the company does a good job of setting expectations every day. The company has a huge wage gap between stores and positions even though responsibilities, expectations, and assignments might be the same. Could use more structure on how to coach and develop of upper level in-store management (Co Manager/Store Manager)."
good,"From my first day working there, i felt like i was being looked down on. When they had hired me, a requirement was we had to have ""natural"" colored hair and to wear their clothes. When i came into work, i had gotten red colored box braids, they requested i remove them because they were not my natural color. It was the same when i wrapped a scarf on my head. They felt that i would try to steal if i had a scarf on my head so they asked me to removed it and i had to spend the rest of my work day with my hair looking very unpresentable. Then it was very difficult for me to wear their clothes because they didn't carry my size (size 14) and their clothes were very expensive. They told me the most important thing that had to be theirs was my jeans, i couldn't afford their jeans so they told me an alternative was colored jeans, that that would be fine. Suddenly, a policy changed that all jeans i wore had to be theirs so i had no choice but to quit because my budget couldn't handle this requirement. Over all this job was not enjoyable, however i did gain a lot of experience as an accessories stock person with organization."
good,"a typical day at work when working at express consisted of opening up the store getting all the cash out and counting it then dropping it off at the bank, cleaning up the store before opening it and then helping customers find anything they need the whole day while keeping the store clean."
good,"Love the work great tools some staff issues variety of different tasks from cutting, assembly, glazing,  sitework needed more time to fit in properly."
good,"Managers are great but environment is hostile "
good,"llegar "
good,"small customer base; informative; management is well structured, but still easy to work with; definitely the perfect environment for any fashion enthusiast; hardest thing to do is make a sale (easy); fun fashion forward working environment"
good,"On a typical day at work would consist of opening registers cleaning the floors/dressing rooms and windows. doing any go-backs from night before, running bank deposits. greeting customers as they come in helping them when needed and starting fittingrooms for them. numbers is a big deal there if you didnt make numbers you would hear from district the next morning along with the store manager. closing time was a pain, customers would come in after 9pm taking their time. by the time we finally finished closing down the store it was already midnight on a good regular night 1am if the store was a mess."
good,"basic customer service activities,daily sales quotas,managed payroll to sales goals.loved the line and customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"No matter how i feel before work, once I clock in Im in retial mode. i enjoy helping customers, its like a big game of dress up in a way. im a people person and enjoy interacting with people and having the opportunity to develop a customer/employee relationship."
good,I barely even recieved hours at this job. I made no money and everyone was rude.
good,"This was a seasonal position where i pretty much just got blamed for anything that went wrong just because i was new, but i didn't let that discourage me. I still came to work with a smile and completed all tasks within a timely manner."
good,"Typical day at work would be to help customers find what they were looking for, try to sell a look, and just work the register."
good,"This company was a great company and had its good and bad things about it.  As a hole it was ran great but below the main managers there was no real structure and i feel like to run a good sales store you have to have structure from top to bottom.  A typical day consisted of organizing the store and helping consumers.  Me personally i was one of the ones who helped the customers because that's where i flourished.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unorganized way the store was ran.  I know from experience that know situation is perfect but at the same time and especially with a business there is a was to have a better structure from top to bottom.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when i can help a costumer and for them to leave completely satisfied and thankful, there was no better feeling."
good,"This was a retail sales job that required representing the brand, providing excellent customer service, maintaining the store, and processing transactions. I really enjoyed the personal shopping/styling aspect of this job. The most difficult thing about this job was being expected to stay well-beyond the end of a closing shift. Regular closes lasted until the manager on-duty felt that the store was in acceptable condition, (anywhere from 2-4 hours depending on the manager, number of staff, and store condition). Employees were also required to stay for ""perfect closes"" wherein we would re-stock, re-fold, re-size, and re-hang every piece of merchandise in the store. These were surprise occasions that happened about once a month and lasted anywhere from 5-10 hours beyond a normal shift. For example, I once worked a closing shift from 5pm-10pm, then stayed until 7am to complete the ""perfect close"". I was required to come back to the store by 10am for our quarterly sales meeting, and then work my shift from 11am-4pm (which included personal shopping for the daughters and granddaughters of the company president.) These instances did not include overtime pay, or extra breaks. I ultimately left because these extended hours began interfering with my schoolwork. I believe this practice was specific to the flagship store, but I'm not certain about that."
good,"a typical day at work would be to clean up the store, place the apparels neat and tidy, interact with the customers and make them feel comfortable, achieving targets, increase the sale.."
good,"Its a pretty good job, but the manager can be harsh sometimes and very rude."
good,"Employer is really located in Oregon and controls jobs electronically. They usually treat employees as just warm bodies. I work for 2 different companies, and am sometimes switched over to another company without notice, so that I sound confused when I answer the teleplhone by the wrong company name."
good,• Consistently generated additional revenues utilizing thorough product knowledge
good,"I was an associate and hours were based on your ability to get customers to apply to the company’s credit card; still there were very little hours being scheduled even with an over-achieving credit applications done. From what I have observed, there was favoritism with the sales leads, I’ve noticed that even though the same results were being made one gets more verbal warning than others. Management was awful but then the co-manager left and it improved. Besides all that my co-workers are easy to get along with."
good,"Honestly, for all I do i strongly believe I don't get paid enough. No Sick days or no paid time off. Also i believe the management could be better, it used to be good. They ask too much and pay very little"
good,I worked for the company for 5 years. They are very serious about their customer service and that’s why I still love shopping there. But there was absolutely no work life balance. It is very “clique”ish. You are side eyed for not staying past the end of your shift. But the benefits were pretty good.
good,"Standard retail job and environment that encompasses a mild range of personalities. Retail jobs today are fast-paced and labor-intensive, so they might not be the best kind of job everyone. As a college student, I was stressed when scheduling conflicts placed my academics in jeopardy. This is counter-balanced by proper communication with managers and a positive attitude when negotiating shift scheduling and other components of the job."
good,Everyone was really nice. There wasnt much training because it was just putting clothes on the shelves. The training that was provided was very quick. The dress code was very particular
good,"Its very hard to advance if you dont know someone higher up, they expect alot from their employees but do not pay them fairly for the work that they do."
good,you had to promote every single person and had to do go backs it was pretty easy. also u had to go back and fourth to fitting rooms at cashier to fitting rooms and also do go backs while doing those 2 things.
good,"Loved most of my co-workers and manager! Loved the discount although I heard that they recently lowered it...which sucks because they pay just a little over minimum wage to start. The pay is one of the down falls of working for this company, its not enough. I was promoted to sales lead (manager) and was getting paid $10.75!!! which is a joke. But I took it because I was in college and it was the only job that would work with my class schedule. The other major down fall is that there was little to no positive reinforcement from the higher ups but there sure was a lot of feedback."
good,The wages are low but it’s a fun place to work. It’s good for a first job or for someone with little to no responsibilities. I feel like the selling motive wasn’t about the customers most of the time.
good,This is a great place to get introduced to the world of retail. The worst thing about working at Express is closing. If you don't have to close every night then it's fun and less stressful.
good,Busy and fast-paced men's clothing store. Help maintain the inventory of store merchandise. Flexible work scheduling and staff were all great to work with.
good,"Very competitive environment, how much you sell in a typical work day will determine your employment experience. "
good,"Largely your experience depends on the location you work at and your upper management. I have currently worked at two stores and both are very different. Managers everywhere are obsessed with making the company money, but even more so if the store isn't doing well. They will put the pressure on you to make the money or meet goals and may act like it is your fault if we don't. The only way to move up is to be manipulative enough to make people buy or sign up for their rewards program or credit card. Way too stressful for just a retail job, but like I said, it's based on where you work and who you work with."
good,I wasn't a fan of working at Express. The general vibe of the place is very privileged and many of the people I worked with were just rude. I barely had any hours in the time I was with the company.
good,"This store is closed now so it does not matter what I say about it. I enjoyed working here when it was open, but I left because I wasn't getting enough hours."
good,"I worked at print shops, a resort and at the Reno Convention Center."
good,"They are genius in business but they don't know how to treat with employees. Management is very aggressive."
good,"it was a ok job there wasn't much work in Lufkin, decent hours day shift only no benefits and it felt like you were paying them to have a job"
good,"Fun but not a career you will love forever if you have the will to keep moving up. It's fun being around young kids, most starting at their first job, however there is huge turnover and lots of constant change"
good,The first 3 years was great while at EXPRESS but after a while the management started going down hill after that. Many of them started stealing the merchandise. They also hired people who knew nothing of our product or even the knowledge or skill of customer service. Making the store have a HUGE turn over rate.
good,"A typical day includes selling and talking with customers. I learned many managing skills here. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers. Shopping with them is a lot of fun."
good,Fun place to work if you are looking for a part time job. Good employee discount. Not able to use coupon even though it may be better than employee discount.
good,The best part of working at Express is the people there. the hours at express are really long especially after closing. I got to learn a lot about being a manager and how to multi task
good,"iThis particular place is a good place to work at if you are starting for the first time. Management what sorta of alright, somewhat understanding when it came to emergencies."
good,Nice work place with supportive management. 50% about the numbers being made and 50% about customer service. Co-workers were always happy and present to help with situations on the floor.
good,Fun work environment with friendly management and coworkers. Learned in a deeper way to communicate with customers to make sure they return to shop at the store again.
good,"In the beginning, I was drawn to what the company had to offer.  Over time, the policies have changed and more is being taken away from the employees.  More recently, they have changed a policy to where the store manager cannot take two days off in a row.  It just took away from the focus on what was important to the employees and growth was based on people leaving."
good,This job pays minimum wage. Will work well for a student. It's a Typical mall job.
good,"A typical day here at Express was helping customers find clothes, selling promotions and helping customers purchase their clothing in store and on line. I learned how to be more personable when it comes to clients. The management there is at best ""C"" Level. Simply because of the high turn over rate of retail. My co-workers were all great because most are students looking to make hours to pay bills so they all usually mature young adults. the hardest part of this job is working on holidays, because we all have families and we all want to spend time with family during that time. the most enjoyable thing about the working at express is how many people you end up meeting. Because of the nature of the job and styling people one can make a lot of ties with regular costumers."
good,Many of my co-workers would not show up for work nor call in. The managers would overload the workers who were at work and expect them to cover the shift for missing employees
good,"Because Express was my favorite clothing store, i figured it would be easy to work there. The discounts sucked because you eventually found out that people who come in with coupons get a better deal than you. the clothes are lovely and well fitting. Some management were cool, some took their jobs too serious where you actually didn't want to work for a certain supervisor.  Coworkers are usually fun and i  keep in contact with many of my old coworkers. Hardest part of the Day, cleaning up and closing the store. Most enjoyable part, when it gets packed and you have to run from sales on the floor, and behind the register."
good,"On a typical day, I would clock in for my shift and use my customer service skills to help the customers have the best shopping experience as possible. I would continually keep the store clean while straightening all racks to make the store presentable to all customers. I would handle currency everyday while performing fast and efficient check-out regulations. My co-workers were great. The hardest part about this job was the culture differences to pull away from between myself and the manager. I loved the interactions I was able to experience with the customers"
good,I liked working here the Employees were fun and so were the Customers
good,overall the job was pleasant. Friendly work atmospere. The pay was not that great. It is a great job for a student.
good,"Although I did enjoy working with the co-workers I got scheduled with, I did not get much work time because I worked at one of the smaller store locations in a mall.  And when I was scheduled to work I only received about 4 hours every two weeks.  I also only got paid minimum wage ($7.25 in Virginia) so that with me only working about 8-10 hours a month that didn't amount to much.  I did however appreciate that the hours were flexible and I was able to put in my availability so that my work schedule did not interfere with my school schedule."
good,"At Express I worked different hours every week. A typical day we would rotate positions. I would first stand in the front to greet customers and let them know about our promotions. I've worked through out the store and the fitting rooms. I've also Selected and assembled entire wardrobes for clientele."
good,I spend most of my work day at the cash wrap being here allows me to communicate with guest and make sure all their needs were met. Management is always around helping throughout the store and can be there in a timely fashion when you need them. The one down side with management and this job is it isn't applicable for employees with families. I am never released on time unless i constantly remind management to let me go. Now i don't mind staying past my shift every once in a while but for this to happen every shift and to not even be asked if i can stay or to make me feel guilty when i can't is a problem for me. i have two kids and have to be home with them while my husband works. On top of that I am always scheduled shift that are extremely short and never allow for a break and with only making minimum wage it is hard to support my family.
good,Aside from constantly straightening up in the store(cleaning up after customers) this job was a lot of fun. I got to meet a lot of people and help create stylish solutions to their fashion problems. I had a few issues with the broad range of responsibilities the would be droppen on me at any time without notice. For a minimum wage job I was basically responsible for the entire men's section of the store. I did more on a daily basis that the key-holders and got paid less than half what they did.
good,"Fashion is a fickle business. Express will educate you on the do's and don'ts of working hard in retail. Once your experience here is finished, every other retailer you work for is a piece of cake. However, even though the days and nights are long, and you are always stressed out with the work load, you learn SO much from this company. There's a reason Express is still in business - The company knows what it's doing; with its assortment & decisions that are made behind closed doors."
good,"At work, you start of with listening to the store goals. The overall goal of the store is to have the largest revenue (every day) out of all the company branches in the country. A typical day consists of greating customers, asking if they need any help, tell them about promotions, assist them in every way possible, keep store display neat and tidy (folding clothes, fixing store displays, restocking shelves)."
good,"This is your ""fun job"". You get the pleasure of meeting wonderful people every single day. You can make someone's day or change their life, just by opening up. It's never redundant of repetitive."
good,"Typical day at work would be fast paced majority of the time. I learned many things in my role that lead to advancement. Everything from accountability, inventory, payroll, shipment processing,credit acquisition was openly discussed and ideas were shared for success. Upper management could have been more cohesive with working more as a team. The hardest part of the job was the break schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job and easiest part of the job was styling clients based upon their personal needs."
good,"Working at Express is nothing fancy, It's a normal retail job. Just hope your co-workers are cool, the job is super easy. You can make your schedule as flexible as you want."
good,"A typical day at work involved consistent cleaning, continuous employee and customer communications. Often, customers needed some form of advice on clothing to consider purchasing. This was quite frustrating at times because it seemed as though you were expected to know their exact style type when he or she did not even know it themselves. The pay is a lot lower than you would expect for the price of the apparel to be somewhat above lesser expensive brands. As an employee, there is a 40% discount but you can only use it when select clothing is 30% off. Overall, the environment is decent."
good,"I first applied to Express hoping for a job within a few days and it took them roughly two weeks to get me a job, and it wasn't a good job at that. Minimum wage working maybe 30 hours a week."
good,"I started working at express about a year ago and I was very happy to start. Over the past months, I’ve dreadfully wanted to quit. The new policies were terrible, they fired my favorite and the best manager over something very very small, they had low pay, they cut hours tremendously, and the management became terrible. I recently quit and got another job the same day. The only thing I’m grateful for with Express is they gave  me my year of retail experience."
good,"Express was a stable job if you’re looking for your first job. After a while it gets old and you start to realize you are getting underpaid. Managers tend to talk about employees on the sales floor, making employees feel insecure."
good,"Good teams and friendly culture - Approachability between teams."
good,This was my very first job out of college and it nearly tainted me. The company is very image conscious and shaming if you don’t look a certain way. They only want certain sizes to wear their clothes.  Extremely overpriced and always pushing their credit card.
good,"Management showed a lot of favoritism. Certain staff members were able to do whatever they wanted, others were forced in front to greet and clean. Some of the corporate staff were very unfriendly. Made work a difficult and sometimes unpleasant place to be."
good,"The managment team was decent execute for a few of the managers, but it was a job that was fast paced and they expected good result to help the company grow."
good,"Express is a place where you interact a lot with customers helping them find all they need , while making sales goals for the day. Holidays are always busy"
good,"Depending on your role, it can be very stressful or very relaxed. On a slow day if you are to work in the front of the store, it can be a very smooth shift. If you work in the back, you constantly fold clothes and resupply the shelves. That's not as fun. If you're closing in the evening, that can be very miserable because all the music stops and all you're doing is folding clothes and arranging the items to be nice and neat. I've gone home past midnight because we were understaffed and customers can make a mess."
good,Constantly traveling across primarily Orange County from homes to Restaurants or P.O.S. systems @ taco trucks. the work day was like a box of chocolates. you never know what your gonna get
good,"Okay first retail job, although its a little demanding"
good,"-Preparing to execute daily goals. "
good,For the most part I like working here. Good people and I have learned a lot. Although I feel I have had a lot of responsibility and stress put on me. Which I wouldn't mind if I felt I was being compensated adequately
good,"My first few months working there was incredible and I absolute loved the management and staffing. After transferring/relocating, I was shocked at how much different things were. The management was completely different and left me unsatisfied. Unfortunately, I will not be returning to work there but I will continue to shop there because the clothes are very nice. I learned that retail is not my forte but I enjoyed my stay while it lasted."
good,Express is a retail store and in many ways the company reflects the daily routine and products or other major retailors. The target market is men and women age 20-50.
good,"removing finished product from production floor putting in warehouse into inventory job was temp for one year,good overtime paid weekly"
good,It was a nice place really have nothing bad to say about Express it taught me a lot and brought me up a lot in my retail abilities I would say its not the job but the co workers that make working the job so difficult everyone just seems to be angry and negative and just purely rude all the time and plus my property got stolen so just not a positive experience for me.
good,"Very serious about how neat clothes are and folded exactly right."
good,Express is like any other average retailer. High turn over and low pay. But is well worth the time if you only work there for the discount.
good,"Managed all calls sent or received from other stores in the district or customers, which consisted of: credit card payments, store checks for specific items, online orders, or just ordinary customer service. During the shift, I managed all associates within that zone, and walked the sales floor to assist each and every customer with any problems or questions. Managed the night deposits, and controlled the registers."
good,Job offers were varied and sometimes companies were not the most safety conscious employers. At times the companies were too fast paced and they ignored proper palletizing and stacking rule.s
good,"Apendi a aprimorar as técnicas de vendas e atendimento ao cliente de forma clara e dinâmica, apendi a superar metas e desafios."
good,I liked working at experss. My cowerkers and most managers made time fly in there altho we were not given enough hours. sometime I would have lesst than 4 hour shifts.
good,"Normalmente hay tensión por la premura en las entregas, el lado positivo es poder cumplir bajo la presión de la actividad. Aprendí a manejar la presión, controlar el estrés. Aprendí el manejo y trámite      de la mercancía de importación y exportación, atención al cliente. La gerencia en términos generales bien. Los compañeros de trabajo, como en todas las compañías, los hay de todos los matices: leales, colaboradores, insolidarios, honestos y desafortunadamente deshonestos. Lo difícil del trabajo es el manejo del tiempo cuando depende de terceros, como el gefe de despachos, el tráfico de la ciudad. Lo más interesante de este trabajo es la satisfacción total del cliente, que produce la satisfacción personal al cumplir."
good,Working as a sales associates was definitely beneficial in acquiring that good customer service every individual should have. As an employee at Express you were challenged to meet and know the wants of most customers that walked through the store and shopped. Being able to observe people I was able to determine how to approach and offer my help. Co-workers were wonderful and easy to work with. Hardest part of the job I would have to say was during Holidays. It used to get very busy and demanding which required long hours at work. Overall I did enjoy the time I spent with this company.
good,"A lot of customer service, where the store was located there was not much traffic which made the job kind of boring"
good,"I've really grown and learned a lot from working here.  I'm given all duties and faced with all tasks that help run the store, so I've learned everything about everything.  The hardest part of the job is the job itself, it keeps you busy.  Co-workers and management currently need fine-tuning to help things run smoother.  Mall jobs only give you shifts of 4-5 hours which I wish were longer, most positions are part-time only, and you start out at minimum wage with little room for raises.  The discount is nice, the clothes are nice (both pros because you have to wear Express-brand clothing to work)."
good,"Throughout the day, many tasks are asked of us, including selling to as many customers as possible for the maximum potential amounts. Cashiering, stock and organization are also key components to sales position at Express. I learned how a company works from back to front, and how in a retail environment, turnover is high. Management was sub-par as the communication was in disarray most of the time. However, that was due mostly to the fact that the turnover was very high in the two years that I worked there. Co-workers were another story, as they were easy to get along with and ended up being friends. The most difficult part of the job is when you are trying to help a customer but the resources are not there. On the other hand, it was enjoyable to be able to help customers in making their decisions and spending their money efficiently."
good,"You come to work for Express, which most days were very busy with a variety of customers.  It may include selling of products, handling cash, providing customer service, and assisting different zones within the store.  Although I spent a a few months working for Express, due to a referral and recruitment from a former manager, I learned that speed and efficiency is very important.  This high-volume store was all about turning lookers into buyers, and assisting as many customers you can handle, all while maintaing the store and carrying out various duties.  The hardest part was with Express was the management.  When I was hired by the store manager, Nicole she soon after left Express leaving a large team to many managers.  There was poor communication between managers, and manager to employee; this made the job at times confusing, time-consuming, and frustrating.  I got along with all my co-workers, some I kept in contact with.  I most enjoyed this high-paced, high-volume store as I interacted with various people from all around the world.  So when you come to work for Express, they sincerely mean providing a positive shopping experience with fast and efficient help. "
good,"Loved working at Express, I met some great people, it was fast pace, the only thing that wasn't great was the hours, pay, and benefits."
good,Folding clothes. Handling the dressing room. Long shifts.
good,"Not a bad position for those who love fashion and want an entry level position in retail. Your work schedule is ever-changing, but that is usually to be expected in retail. The associate discount wasn't too bad, especially if you already shop there."
good,Helping Customers buy stuff in store
good,"A typical work day consist of learning new promotion before going on to sales floor. After being assigned to a certain zone, task would include engaging customers, recovering zones, and perform stock checks. I've learned how to work as team to accomplish sales target goals. Co-workers are great at motivating and encouraging to excel in work performance. The hardest part of the job is multi-tasking with high customer volume and minimum coverage. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet personal and corporate sales goals, and helping to satisfy needs of customers."
good,"Stocking, customer service, receiving of shipment. Working with custkmers"
good,"Express is a good place to work for as a seasonal employee. The management is very energetic and some of your co-workers could be very helpful. There are lifting, bending and reaching high shelves, but finishing all the shipments can feel very rewarding. Customer service and organization are the two valuable things you could learn from the job."
good,working at express was rewarding because each day was full of challenges and surprises if it own that mead the work day unpredictable. At express working as a sales personal i got a chance to meet new people each day and help them have a stress free shopping experience that would make them feel great about how they look and feel.
good,"Always a productive and fun day at work, positive attitude and goal oriented ."
good,Express is a fun company to work for. My coworkers are the best part. The customers are the worst part. Almost every task is easy to learn and complete. The most annoying aspect of the job was the pressure put on you by managment to get credit cards. Overall a good place to work.
good,was the culture. Great peers made work everyday a fun place to be. The fashion was great as well. Plus the discount didn't hurt either. It was a good experience
good,"Express is a great place to work during holidays however it lacks training for the new members that join the workplace since training only lasts a day and there is no further training. Overall, Express is a good job."
good,"Express is a great place to start a career in you are looking into fashion."
good,"Easy job, just got stuck with a manager that sucked. They want you to be on everyone's back to get the sales target but there's no commission........."
good,I love my managers but they get all the hours. You would be lucky to work 8 hours in a week because associates only do 4 hour shifts. I would stay if I had more hours.
good,When I worked here the staff is great everybody is interactive with one another. The store management is unprofessional doesn’t know how to run the store at all . Overall the company is nice to work for I had fun with the coworkers and we had little events but the pay and no commission after working there for a year is unreliable.
good,"People that work there are great but no room to advance, only about 3 people in the store so low hours, shifts were about 5 hours each, discounts on clothes was good"
good,"I loved to work there, I loved the people I worked with. But the management did not care about anyone but getting things done. Which is fine but at a certain point everyone was getting really sick because it was very dirty in there and also the AC would always go out sending a lot of people to the hospital."
good,"Starts as a fun and upbeat environment. If your dedication is noticed, management positions will open up to you quickly as long as there is a position available. No commission, just an hourly pay unless you are a co or store manager, then it is a salary pay. Competitiveness among other locations/districts. Constantly on your feet and running around besides your 30 minute break. Working weekends is a requirement."
good,"Fellow employees were very friendly and welcoming. Customer service skills improved due to this job. Management was not too considerate of the associates' schedules outside of working, this includes school or a family emergency."
good,"Great entry level job to work for experience in customer service and relations."
good,i was only making 7.30 an hour and i was there for a year.i was not happy working there for that reason so i was looking for another job that paid more.
good,"Just needed better compensation for management. They were a very good company to work for, They treated me well. Just wish they paid more for the hours put in."
good,"The overall job was fun, the manager and my coworkers were very nice. They only bad thing about the job is that they dont give enough hours. Best part about the job was associating with customers"
good,Its a good company to work for if your looking for a relaxed work environment. They are very flexible if you need time off but not much room for growth. Pay/benefits are not great and it can be unorganized at times.
good,Job is interactive and can be competitive with the goals that they give you guys to do pay is low but besides that the job is pretty cool and laid back
good,"Fast-paced, typical retail work environment. Highly competitive compensation and benefits packages. Would recommend to anyone looking for high risk/high reward."
good,Express can help you find many jobs very good when your not able to find a job express can find onee for you very quickly and they are not terrible job that they find you
good,"This is a great company to learn how to handle customer service and retail skills. Holiday hours were difficult of course but overall, the coworkers were easy to get along with, the managers were understanding and encouraging and the hours were flexible."
good,"When I applied to work here, I was mostly just desperately searching and was willing to take whatever I was given. I quickly learned that customer service is not all it's cracked up to be. Even though there were days that I may not have been on my 'A' game, i really challenged myself and was able to get in better touch with my people skills and the ability to multitask."
good,"Tough hours, asked to do multiple things without be trained before and. Compensation didn't feel justified for labor provided. Staff was reasonably understanding, managers were hard to talk to and communicate with"
good,"Fair employee discount"
good,Working at Express was fun. Management was great and co-workers where awesome. there wasn't really nothing hard about the job the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my best friend.
good,"At this job you learn to work as a team and learn how to print magazines threw a press machine. the press machine can be running well, I worked on the same job on the press for three days straight. the environment at the job is well managed and the people are easy to get along with. I meat plenty of nice friends that work at quad . though working hard as i can my feet was killing me on the 12 hour shifts we worked. That was the hardest part of the job , But learning how the press and seeing how magazines are made was the most fun part of the whole job."
good,"Considerando o tratamento diferenciado para alguns funcionários, isso não pode acontecer...."
good,"The job itself can be very fun and you can gain a lot of knowledge regarding sales, management, and customer service. Compensations are good if youre making sales"
good,"It was constantly a busy environment. I did not always feel to welcome because the other employees had seen how untrained I was. The job took a lot of getting used to, but I learned a lot about the cash wrap, how to treat customers while under pressure, how to properly handle store merchandise. Folding large sections of clothes as a single-person task is probably the hardest part of the job. Being able to take a half hour break was most likely the most enjoyable part."
good,"I have worked for Express for nearly 5 years. My mom worked at Express when she was in college, and I decided to follow suit because I loved the clothing and the environment. I only wanted to work in a place I believed in and knew I could sell. I loved my job. I was promoted about a year and a half there, and was promoted again the following year. This is where I lost faith in the company that I loved for so long. Express did not believe I needed a raise even though I was promoted as a full-time management position and going to school full-time working my education around them. They believed my benefits were my ""raise"". So essentially, I was paying for my promotion. It's a shame. I love the environment, my customers and the people I get to work with, but they just simply don't pay, nor recognize their employees."
good,"I learned the process of how to run a store from start to finish. Typical day consisted of opening registers, editing time sheets, adding and cutting payroll hours, checking in shipment, updating daily sales goals according to company plan, supervising sales floor productivity as well as shipment processing. Motivating and coaching sales associates to obtain company sales goals as well as other standard tasks. The hardest part was getting people to be excited and interested in their jobs as they were mostly teenagers. Most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of giving outstanding customer service due to the efforts of the entire team."
good,"It  could be a better  organization , if they were a bit more considerate. A typical day  at  work  would  include  providing  service to  patients , physicians and  third  party health care organizations / insurance companies"
good,I worked mostly morning shifts and I liked that. I learned communication and inventory skills working with this company. Most of my co-workers were pretty cool. The hardest part was getting up in the morning at 5-6 am since I was not use to that. I really enjoyed meeting new people and learning new things.
good,Working for EXPRESS has been a great experience! Its helped mold me into the manager I am today. Over coming the challenges of low coverage and multiple tasks on a daily bases was a common occurrence but defiantly fuel for creative thinking  and strategies..
good,"A typical day of work at EXPRESS consists of constant costumer service and recovering of on floor merchandise. I learned how to properly use cash registers, meet store standards, and understand the language of business. The management is good and usually accommodating to personal schedules. The co-workers have been great, everyone is very friendly and helpful. The most difficult aspect of this job was, believe it or not, the need to constantly look busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting costumers, contributing towards making people happy is very rewarding."
good,"Did Get more backroom experience."
good,"Boa gerencia ,atenciosa com funcionários."
good,The management team is always more concern about make their segments.
good,I usually organize inventory as well as run cash register duties while influencing and styling customers. I have to maintain a positive image for the store and meet daily goals/standards. Management also has segments to make and look to me to help achieve them. The hardest part of my job would be to keep the store up to standards throughout a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to make people feel good about themselves in the clothes I chose for them.
good,"I've worked for this company for 6 months, and I can surely say that I am not satisfied with the management. They're just looking for young college students to do their work for them and that's not how it should be. If the store is slow they will send you home early"
good,"I enjoy helping people, that is the best part of my job. My co-workers are awesome, which makes work enjoyable."
good,I got an example of what it was like to become a sales lead during the holiday season while still being in school full-time.
good,"Great looking facilities, laid back smooth environment. The office assistant position isn't the most glamorous position and the work is very tedious but if you get the right manager like I was fortunate enough to do, it's not that bad at all."
good,"I would love more from my managers and my district manager"
good,"I did inventory on a typical day of work, I learned how to change displays and put clothes out by color codes.Management was nice jus as well as the co-works the hardest part of my job was learning everything a once because i also did cashiering and Maintenance sometime all in one day. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing every item."
good,a good job to learn more skill i have new skill thanks to the jobs i have worked.
good,Learning about fashion and opening and closing the store. Managing money and making a weekly schedule. In charge of inventory for the past 6 months and  achieving great results.
good,Great company to start off in. Not much room for advancement too much turnover
good,I have Been Promised Advacement but nothing has happened. Nice Place to work but don't hold your breathe on advancement. I Like the people that i like to work with but not the mangaement. 
good,"Express is a great company from the outside. The management is pretty flexible around school, but they play favorites. They treat people differently to their face and behind their backs."
good,"Lot of work, little pay, dealing with rude customers. The manager that I worked for was great."
good,"Express was a pretty standard retail job where I was expected to understand the register, credit card application, sales floor, and stock room while also engaging customers and pushing sales. There was a lot of pressure from the management and under the table i.e. favors given for reaching sales goals. My coworkers were pleasant but somewhat distant. The hardest part of the job was engaging with reluctant customers when the management was insistent that I do so."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced. Selling was the main goal and often the expected daily quota was not met due to low crowds and unreasonable sales expectations. I worked with great people who did their best, were always friendly, and worked well under pressure. The hardest part of the job was meeting the selling expectations corporate set for our store. Our store was located in a state that was suffering before the rest of the economy did, which means people had less to spend especially on the expensive fashion merchandise that my store specialized in. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people every day and working with co-workers who genuinely cared about each other."
good,I enjoy working with companyies that have allowed me to use all my skills within the companies guidelines. I would enjoy working with a company that gives me the ability to move upward....
good,Helped customers purchase the most fashion-forward outfit.
good,"A typical day at express was clocking in helping customers find clothes and cleaning the store. The management was very nice and always happy to help and lend a hand. There was not a hard part to working there, it was always fun."
good,It was a very interesting job. The experience that I receive will always stay with me along with the memories of the people.
good,It’s a friendly and understanding work place. Fast learning and not too complicated when you first work here. Will have to deal with multitasking and have good communication skills and great customer service.
good,"Express was my favorite job. I loved the people the vibe, everything about it, but... I had one manager imparticular who targeted people who weren't like her and was very rude and mean. All the other managers, however, were the best."
good,Working retail is nice when you need flexibility. Express was very flexible when it came to school hours and working. The bad part is having to work all holidays.
good,"This job requires you to stand all day. It's a good job for someone who is beginning to work. A typical day at work will require you to fold clothes, put clothes back and stay at the cashier."
good,"When i first starting working at express, it was new to me but fun. Sometimes whenever i asked for helped,it felt like i was annoying them. Towards the end of 2017 i was not enjoying the job."
good,"Everyone that works here is extremely friendly, and they all work well with others. While working here I learned a lot about myself, and I thoroughly enjoyed the environment."
good,Eu gostei de trabalhar com pessoas boas sinceras e transparente
good,I like the people that work here cuz they get the job done and the company i a good place to work for we where making  airbags for different company and i was a forklift operator and assembler who all ways got the job done
good,They was fast and helped alot to find d a job and easy way to get your foot in the door and good pay and lots of hours and great people and companies and a wonderful environment
good,"Express is a great company. I loved working part time with them. Pay was low, but the management was great! Had opportunities to move up but had to be willing to work nights and weekends."
good,Hay preferencias desde la supervisora hasta los gerentes . Se molestan cuando les pides las oras extras que hiciste.!
good,"It seems like the staff is a family. The discount that you receive on clothing is a nice benefit. Working retail hours is always very hard. Overall, fun place to work."
good,Overall this is a nice job to have. Make sure you are always smiling and have an outgoing personality or you will not be liked. The managers are fun and easy to be around.
good,Don’t really have much to say but it was an alright experience. Easy and fast with getting you a job but the jobs weren’t things you’d want to do for more than a month
good,"Difficult tasks and long shifts. There were hour breaks however, so this kind of made up for it. The pay was okay, but as a part-time worker i didn't get many hours."
good,Express has different kinds of temporary jobs that I have gone on such as warehouse work and cleaning jobs. I have to call and let them know when I am available and then they let me know what kinds of jobs they have at the time.
good,"Things may have changed a lot since I worked at Express so my review may or may not be helpful. It was OK working for express the pay was very low but I think others working the same shift, under the same description were paid more than me and were given opportunities to advance before me. Its not a career it was a job as for I was a collage student."
good,ser puntual y trabajar en equipo es lo mejor para q el trabajo salga adelante tener compromiso en el y con el trabajo soy una persona estable en el trabajo y no lo dejo porq no he encontrado uno mejor en cuestio de paga de prestaciones y aunq nomquiera decir en ambiente de trabajo
good,Express is a good company but they need to work on respect their employees. I felt as though the pay wasn't enough for the work/demands that management wanted performed.
good,"The job was underpaid, but the benefits, and the hours were good. The team can develop into a family, but then with that comes drama in some aspects. That isn't a company problem but a social one."
good,"A steady work pace good work envorment,good people to work with good work conditions ,be treated with respect. Shown what to do if I don't know already."
good,Working at Express was very demanding. There are times where hours are so scarce they call you just a few hours before your shift to tell you not to come in. Closes took forever.
good,The people are great to with and fun to be around. It's a cool environment to be apart. I enjoy the job and the atmosphere. They have good benefits and packages.
good,"this is a temporary agency, i was aligned to different positions. i worked at various companies. My day varied based on the job that i was required to do."
good,"A typical day at work consists of engaging in conversation with prospective buyers. Maintaining a home feel environment in the workplace by stocking merchandise. Ask customers if they need help finding their size. Keeping the shelves neat and organized. An upbeat energetic vibewith a be postive mindset. Sweep floors, charge at cash out . Hang new shipments from back on floor."
good,"Overall I loved working at Express, all of the managers and even associates made you feel welcomed and at home. Working here gave me the opportunity to make my own decisions when I felt something was wrong."
good,"I liked working at the express I was in, the staff was friendly and it was a great first job! The hardest part would be to upsell to customers, and catch shoplifters."
good,"Working retail at Express is a very busy, mall atmosphere.  I have learned to be patient with extremely rude customers.  I enjoy having a discount, and the management is very helpful."
good,"The company has great incentives and rewards top performers  with a company retreat staying at 5 star hotels normally in West Palm Beach Fl. This job has a lot of stress and high expectations so you must be able to multi-task and be available 24-7. The company offers great onboarding and great people to work with. The culture has changed as the company has grown and new leaders have taken over. It is not bad, however could be better. "
good,They were fair but no advancements but the jobs were maintainable and within reason I enjoy the company but they could use some changes and be linked with union work sites
good,"Friendly managers, customers can be happy or rude people but attitude is important when dealing with others. breaks are great when working in sales floor."
good,"EXPRESS is pretty par for the course with retail companies when it comes to how it is working for them and how they take care of their employees. Which is subpar for how they think they are. They hire from outside instead of promoting from within because they don't like to take the time to train anyone at any level. New associates are expected to learn on the job, but then get scolded or scoffed at if they don't do something right. Managers get a decent amount of training but it's very obvious from within the company they'd rather hire someone from outside the company that has been a manager than promote someone who has shown dedication and passion for the company. "
good,"I worked at one of the highest rated Express stores in the region. Work was very straightforward and about exactly what you'd expect. The coworkers were nice and friendly and would occasionally have out-of-work hang out days to spend time together outside of work. The management when I worked there were very understanding and cared about the store. There was one manager, however, that had it out for me and to this day I have no idea why. She would make my days difficult and had me do everyone else's work along with my own as well as staying well past my shifts. Aside from her, the management was great."
good,employee discount is ok but you cant use it on certain things. they pay minimum wage and other retailers pay more. a fun environment to work in and you can move up pretty easily. they give lots of award certificates.
good,Very friendly  place learn how to interact with other people learn about their like on clothing. Managers demand good customer service reach out customer to assist on their search for fashion
good,The pay was awful but I loved my team. I enjoyed coming to work everyday. The only issue I really had was the store managers. None of them were worthy of the position. There were always issues with their lack of management skills.
good,"I love my job, I love helping the customers and the satisfaction of helping customers and the feeling that you get from knowing that you helped someone in need to get the outfits they wanted."
good,The company is good. They are able to teach a lot for the basics of life. You become more of a people person as time goes by. Can become more versatile within the company and see what it you are best at.
good,"I had worked there for 3 years under different management. The first year and a half was great. I had fun at work so it didn't seem as stressful to do so much work for little pay. The other half, was under new management and she had a lot to learn. The turnover rate under her supervision was high and I ended up leaving as well. although I was a part of the management team, I feel as if I wouldn't have left if I had a better leader. They expect you to work fast but efficient and to make sales goals. The customers are the rudest people ever because they feel so entitled to be right and to be pampered. So getting yelled at for something you can't do for them wasn't fun. This was every day."
good,Would be nice if they paid more but overall its ok. They are willing to work with you and some jobs are temp to hire. Glad they have the second chance class too.
good,"management doesn't take the time to train you properly then blame you for not knowing how to do certain things. Overall, it was a pleasant environment. Customers were great, employees were amazing and the discount was decent (30%)"
good,It was really hard to work around the schedule. The management will call me in the morning to tell me not to go to work since it was not going to be busy. The hours were unreliable.
good,"Sometimes long shifts"
good,Express was chill workplace.  I had the opportunity to meet and talk to all kinds of people about fashion trends. We would have meetings to meet certain goals a week.  Hold competitions.  In sales the hardest part is convincing customers that they should be spending more money.
good,Each ay was different. At first I had fun but as time went on I didn't enjoy the job as much. It started with the hours and the uncontrollable upset my managers would have due to the fact the store would be empty or lack products of todays fashion.
good,"A good place to work if you don't care about anything other than doing your job and going home. If you actually care about the company and what you do, your feedback falls on deaf ears, and no changes are made to address glaring issues. Company grew very quickly, and very few attempts were made to make that growth scalable."
good,"As a sales associate making $7.25 an hour might seem ordinary. but given the fact I would lead in sales most days and have many repeat customers, it was less than ideal."
good,"Good learning experience for customer service and money handling, not great place for a career opportunity or paid time off benefits. Could be better on raises and incentives"
good,I was a sales associate at Express Inc from late summer 0f 2015 to fall of 2016. I learned how a different retail company operated; this retail company was higher end than my last company. I worked for a juniors company and Express Inc demographic was from college students to young adult to middle-aged adults. The store was geared towards men and women.
good,"repead the same thing over and over."
good,It's a rewarding job knowing you are helping someone feel good about what they are wearing. Even being the first person to greet them and making them feel comfortable as soon as they come in is great.
good,I only recently started and i am happy with my choice and the people that i work with. it is a fun and entertaining job and the location is very interesting with lively people and a fun experience
good,"I need a better opportunity. "
good,"Teamwork friendly, Flexible schedule, the pay is not enough for me personally. More of a first job or job for people in school. Not a bad second but if you have bills and responsibilities this is not a good main job due to pay being so low"
good,"5 hour work day, selling to the customers on either floor, a 15 min break, return to sales floor, possibly restocking the floor with the products, clock out"
good,"my coworkers always made me feel welcomed , it was nice atmosphere an good place to work if you need a quick job or into fashion  you are always on your feet and there is always someone willing and ready to help you if you need it,"
good,"Most of the employees are working their first job at Hollister. It is a great step in the door if you're looking for a customer service job. As far as management goes, it goes the same. Great way to get your name out there!"
good,Good place to work a bit busy at times but over all a good place. learned alot of customer service as well as cash  wrap and how to communicate with each customer.
good,There is always 2 part coverage. that means only the manager and an associate. Recovery is a hassle you have to start 4 hrs before closing to recover to perfection. I have learned to become more faster and know how to multi-task. The culture is not very fun to work it revolves around only tasking and talking to customers. Hardest part is getting projects done before openingo or closing. We only get 30 min to close and open as well as for lunch break. The most enjoyable part will be the discount.
good,I had a couple of jobs driving a forklift that llasted a half a year at a time and paid good but the job assignment ended. Warehouse  work with them was forklift and assembly  work.
good,"Work days were fun and busy at the same time. I learned how some managers only promote their favorite workers regardless of performance. The workplace is always full of amazing and different styles and expressions of people, and their personalities. The hardest part of the job would be the low amount of hours you worked per week if you was not full-time, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the team, and meeting new people making great bonds."
good,fast pasted. computer skills.good management. work environment clean.learning new skills.learning new skills. helping company improve work environment and safety.
good,It has nice people. I like working for them but i could not stay at one place for a while because they kept dropping their contracts with express. I really enjoyed working with temkin
good,"express is a great company if you don't like long hours, however, but not when you're struggling to pay for things. There's no hours to give if you work there part-time. I work four hours a week, although I asked for 15. your performance basically determines the amount of hours you will be given. so if you're not engaging with customers and pushing sales, you're more likely not get many hours.You are expected to engage with every single customers that enters the store, encourage them to try things on in the dressing room, and push them to buy things. All in all, it's great as a first job especially when you're in school, however, theres way to much expected from a part timer who's there four hours a week, and doesn't get paid enough to do the work that they do."
good,I learned a lot of my selling skills from Payless. I like the discount that they gave the employees. I would nor consider it for a long time job.
good,"greeting costumers and upselling products,very nice co workers.hardest part of the job is standing all day,the best part is that you get discounts on the store items."
good,"Good job, flexible with schedules, customers aren't great and the store gets very slow. The managers are nice and helpful when needed."
good,Fun place to work with enthusiastic people. Consistently receives feedback and updates to grow and better the team. Quarterly training workshops. Lots of room to advance at a store level.
good,"Well established company with great training materials. Enjoyed a fast paced, upbeat atmosphere with fun people to work with."
good,"Express was my first job. It had a nice staff, good managers, but extremely busy hours. I had great coworkers but I wasn't satisfied with the low minimum of hours given to me even when I was just temporary."
good,"I worked at the Express at the Crabtree mall in Raleigh. It's pretty fast paced. Some of the customers tend to look down on the people working there. I didn't have too much problems with customers. With these type of jobs, you have to be really cool with the managers. One female manager that was there was only cool with the people she knew"
good,Long hours but swing shifts.  Good co-workers.  Provides employees with uniforms.  Provides training for new hires and good benefits.
good,fastpace but fun. Got along with all my co-wokers. The management was friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed helping guest.
good,"strive to be the best at all times. Learning how to adopt to a new company and meeting deadlines can sometimes be very difficult, at the same time it is very exciting being able to have a verity of jobs."
good,"Receiving and ordering merchandise"
good,"I worked only for a small amount time but it was a fun environment and easy going. I learned people skills, had helpful co-workers. Hardest part is the customers and most enjoyable is the customers"
good,fun place to meet new people and a good place to make friends. fast paced environment. love the fact that you get a discount. the hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day
good,"pay rate is low, standing on your feet the entire shifts, a lot of folding all day.  most people will fold clothes and not even get on the registers.  expect to come in early before the store opens to clean, there is not a cleaning service.  the staff cleans"
good,express is a retail clothing store. Consist of long hours of standing. Staff was okay. It was an hourly job. I honestly will never go back to retail
good,"Seasonal position.  Work environment at that time wasn't ideal.  The work was very tedious therefore, you were always busy.  There was always work to be done which made the shift go by quickly, which was a plus."
good,I would start my day greeting my co-workers and starting on my first priority on my to do list of things to do. I'd like to learn something new and get assistance if needed. close the day with a good note for tomorrow's next assignments.
good,"Didn't work long enough to get a great impression but its just your typical retail job, nothing special. good employee discounts though."
good,"I did not enjoy this job. The hours were stamped on you due to the low staff, and not coming in when you were not initially scheduled leaves bad blood on your reputation in this company, making you a ""unwilling employee"", or so it felt. It's a good job to get into retail right away, but advancing may be a journey..."
good,This position allowed me to grow with strength in the field of soft line retail.  I was effectively involved with floor plans and sales direction.  Completed managers meetings in abundance and assisted in area store floor plans.  I was also given the opportunity to travel to other store locations to assist in managing daily operations.
good,"Working at Express is sometimes extremely irritating because they have some unrealistic expectations when it comes to selling their Credit Card.  I am not one to push someone into doing something they don't want to do and sometimes I feel like that's exactly what Express wants me to do when it comes to the credit card.  Also, all of my managers have very different expectations of us and it's hard to keep track of who wants what."
good,Loved working at this place because all the co workers were excited about work and willing to teach any new person coming into the field.
good,"As a sales associate I learned a lot from EXPRESS about the business of retail. The coworkers were very friendly in the business environment, but did not seem as much like a team as any employees I have previously worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with life in retail where everything must be presented perfectly at all times and people are in a constant rush. Management seemed hectic and somewhat unorganized, but trained new employees very well. The best part of the job was being able to help customers in finding just what they were looking for at a good deal. The business of retail is a difficult one, but it can quickly teach an employee a lot about business."
good,A typical workday for Express is like a box of chocolate. You never know what you're going to get. Express is very express like. They are a very reactive company and flexibility is key. While working at Express you will learn how to work with an array of personalities and a very diverse group. We are fashion forward and love the customer. The hardest part of the job is having to negotiate your personal time. One great part of the company is at the end of the day we have a lot of fun with the customers.
good,"Backroom stock help, along with merchandising. Employee Discounts"
good,Not enough pay. Living in Key West and making $8/hour made it hard to survive.
good,good place to work.. just sucks when you have to close because you have to make sure everything is PERFECT
good,"Express Inc. is a fashion forward retail organization. I worked in the Times Square branch, which is the best branch to work for if you are interested in challenging yourself. As an associate you must sell clothing to consumers, and provide exceptional customer service. The management at this branch is mediocre, and the associates are personable and friendly. Working at this particular branch is very fast paced. You must be the cream of the crop in retail to survive this atmosphere, and the pressure the management places on you in order for this branch to succeed. Working at this branch for 1 month is the equivalent of working at a lesser branch for 3 months."
good,"As an employee at Express, I would often be at the cash wrap ringing up customers and give them answers to any last minute questions they may have. This is the last impression of the store so it needs to be a good one. Also, getting people into fitting rooms and accurately giving them information about promotions and sharing product knowledge is very important. Management is a struggle sometimes. The best decisions are not always made and payroll is always an issue so people's shifts are cut a lot of the time. Also, the discount isn't that great for how expensive the clothes are. The hardest part of the job is acting as though the customer is always right. (customer service 101). The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly the people I work with."
good,They care about and train you to understand business acumen.
good,at express there is always work to be done. from straightening to assisting customers. i have learned patience and also a little bit of spanish. the area i work in is populated by majority bi-lingual people so i had to learn to talk to them. management is very understanding and makes it an easy and comfortable environment to work in
good,"Working at Express was very interesting. I enjoyed my time working with my coworkers, and manager. I have no complaints, I prefer a work environment were there is room for growth and opportunity."
good,"I would provide excellent service by listening and attending to customer needs, also restock and merchandise on-floor product, assist customers with questions and help style customers."
good,I have learned how to be quick on deliveries making it possible for me to exceed expectations of my employer.
good,"-they crosstrain employees to handle pretty much any job in the store, which can take a few months (a couple weeks in each position to fully experience some of the problems that could arise)"
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and exciting. Co workers are considerate and helpful.
good,"a typical day at work - doing shipment, processing new items "
good,Through working with Express I was able to gain and perfect valuable team working skills.
good,They get you jobs pretty fast.. and they send you to good jobs
good,I took this job to fill my free time but they began giving me a hard time because I was working my military job full time. Over-all an ok job. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"• Typical day: answering inbound calls, managing customer loyalty accounts, placing orders, and responding to customer complaints"
good,"I have freelanced here for about two years and doing so has provided me with an opportunity to write more mainstream articles that are viewed by a wider audience than my previous job, which was a trade publication. The editors are pretty laid back and easy to work with."
good,I enjoyed this job for the most part. However I did not enjoy how crazed and obsessed managers were with pressuring me into pressuring to make purchases regardless of their want/need to do so.
good,"This is a great job for sales people or first time job seekers. My co workers are the reason I still work there, I love the people I work with. The hours are not guaranteed so it's only good for part time work."
good,It was cool for something to do. Great discounts on clothes and keep my busy
good,"Always had something to do. There was never a dull moment. co-workers were amazing and really fun to work with. Only thing that I disliked was all the theft, so many sensors on the ground. And i disliked that no one sized."
good,"fast pace and multitasked, must be bilingual. learned about retail, hardest part is dealing with customers who try to give you a hard time"
good,"I enjoyed working at Express. My co-workers were very friendly and managers were understanding. A typical day at work included greeting and helping customers, stocking inventory, keeping the store neat, and cashing out customers."
good,It was a steady pace job but could get busy.  You worked individually but can work with co workers at times.  Everyone helped each other.
good,"Great place to work while still in school.  "
good,I helped the owner open up his business. I worked closely with the owner in the office and people overseas.
good,"I have found the attendance policy different than any other company I have ever worked for and this is negative. It is punitive. However, the job is easy and the pay is okay. Co-workers are great!"
good,Typical day was hectic but fun. I learned how much I loved fashion. I enjoyed styling and being a part of the processing and production process. 
good,"Other than getting a discount on the clothes, there is nothing great about working here. You work 4-8 hours. At 6.25/6.50 and hour, it just doesn't make sense. The actual work was not difficult though, just gets monotonous and a bit boring when they are slow."
good,"Customer service was supposed to be great but some employees were less genuine than others in helping customers or other co-workers. The employees were very involved in their cliques in and outside of work. The store was inviting, but the employees were less consistent in friendliness. I enjoyed helping customers pick out outfits for special events or back to school or for Christmas gifts. It was rewarding to help someone in that one-on-one way. I liked to find out the customer's style so I could help them pick out some appropriate choices."
good,"As a sales associate, we are constantly trying to make our daily sales. In order to reach our goals we have to share our promotions and create a relationship with our customers so they become loyal to Express."
good,The pay is next to nothing
good,"- Typical day consists of helping customers put together outfits, processing incoming shipments of clothing."
good,"A typical day while working for Express would mainly Include ware house work/Line work. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feets for hours, But the work is not strenuous."
good,"I typical work day required a lot of folding and customer service. For a retial store, management is pretty flexible with your schedule and they are very modern in thier POS technologies."
good,Express is a very popular retail store so there is always something to do. It keeps you busy which makes your shift go by fairly quick. Great way to help people piece outfits together if you are interested in a career in fashion.
good,Responsibilities included merchandize inventory. Assisting in the layout reorganization of floor layout. Customer service and sales.
good,Very fast paced clothing store. Staff is always at its max so it accommodates the amount of customers.
good,Retail sales is a different animal and anyone who has worked here knows that you will be committed to spending time here. Your employee discount is a great incentive if you take advantage of it but it's a lot of hours for minimum wage. You mostly work here as something part-time or perfect for that high school or college student.
good,"good work place, enjoyable. Fun job, work a lot with people and help them with their needs"
good,"I enjoy working here but regardless of the fact that I've asked for more hours, I can still only get 4-8 hours every 2 weeks. Not sure if this is how other stores work, but here, it is extremely hard to get hours because there are over 15 employees."
good,"I would come into work and make sure clothes were neat and organized. I would help customers and sell the clothes. I learned about selling. The management was good, though they did treat us like we were making commission and push us to sell things to the customers by constantly asking if they needed anything, and that could be hard because sometimes the customers did not want to be helped. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible hours."
good,load trucks by hand and scane boxes to make sure they were loaded intrailers
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, compañeros, supervisores y gerentes con muy buena disposición. El ambiente es familiar y de compañerismo. El problema que las pasantias están dirigidas sus necesidades y no así al estudiante y la practica profesional en su área. ."
good,It was a very fast pace job the asking you to move and help customers while ur making sure the store stays clean for everyone that walks though the door.
good,"Well this was my first job and with that being said my biggest weakness was that I had a hard time with was communicating with people along with when it came to eye contact and speaking to people in general, but the rule of retail was that if you wanted to sell something you need to have eye contact and be able to communicate with others. I will say that if it wasn't for this job I would have been fired at my current job for not being able to communicate well with others."
good,"It was a job not a career"
good,"when i was working at express i barely got any hours, i got milked for 2 weeks and then fired,. and i had no warning that it was a temporary position, because when i applied they said it was part time. so that was a huge flaw, but the positive outcome was the little experience i was able to gain and a nice manager :)"
good,"This job was a good part time gig for me as i focused on school and parenting. It had great discounts, but also made the position counter productive at times. This company should switch to a commission based pay system instead of hourly."
good,"Working at Express was a fun experience. We are always moving around, either helping customers or putting away clothes or putting up new displays. Management wanted to promote me but I was perfectly fine staying where I was."
good,I enjoyed my time at express it helped develop people and customer service skills along side sales. It helped me with responsibility coming straight out of high school. Definitely not something I wanted to do as a career just a job while continuing education.
good,This is a job where you are on your feet every second you are on the clock. The job itself is whatever you make of it. If you come in with poor energy than you will have a poor time. High energy people are what they are looking for.
good,Work here was fun and relaxing. The job wasn't too demanding or stressful. I loved working here the only downfall was there weren't enough hours for everyone.
good,"In my previou job, I've learned how to socialize more with people and asking questions about what type of service they are needed to know. Express workculture is more of nice out going employees that help people what to find or offer them good service."
good,"Working at Express was fun. It was a great working experience. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and my managers. I didn't feel threatened by them or had any trouble. They always tried helping me to be a stronger sales associate. However, the hours were very low. I wasn't getting enough hours to work so I would get a low payment every two weeks. I did enjoy working there but it wasn't enough for my survival."
good,Too many big changes made recently. Company has cut payroll and management rolls to an extreme level leaving very few people to do all lot of work with no extra pay.
good,"The job is simple, the work that needs to get done is fine, but it is the overall company and who the managers are. "
good,Overall a great place to learn customer service skills. The company offers several opportunities for growth and good incentives for employees.
good,"Very well known, with high volume customer service. Kept busy at all times. Due to high customer service, you need to really have sales experience."
good,A relatively good company to work for.  Fashion at it's best.  Many devoted & regular customers.  Great discounts on clothing. staffing can be tricky with keeping coverage for absent employees.  Motivating management
good,With express your day is about the customer and what you can do to help them. Any other advances is about making the store look good and making sure everyone who comes into contact has an enjoyable yet fulfilling experience. Management is great and cares about the well being of the staff which trickles down to the staff; also being caring and family like in entirety. The staff itself makes it really easy to work and feel good at work while the pay may not be all that great.
good,A typical day at work consist of helping customer with anything they need as soon as they step foot in the store we are to greet them offer assistance uncover their need and make sure they have a successful and pleasant checkout . I have learn patience and great customer services and the importance of team work and great communication. The hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy every customer. the most enjoyable is helping customer and making them feel good about themselves.
good,"My typical day would be clocking in and greeting people at work and getting my schedule ready for co workers, and makings sure everything was going good. The co workers were very nice and so were the customers. Some hard times would have to be on holidays. But overall it was a great experience."
good,Great on the job training and work materials provided. A true brand the leads you and trains you in a well rounded positive position. Very high expectations. We were given one hour lunch breaks.
good,The management here is very productive at what they do. Great part time job.
good,"A typical day is going in and greeting customers. I have not met one sour apple at this job. Everyone of my co-workers is friendly, outgoing, and willing to help at any minute. The management is very friendly and always there to help out with any problems you have. I would say the hardest part about the job is the peak hours, which is when customer volume is at its highest. At the same time this is the most enjoyable part of the job because it is a challenge."
good,"Work was an amazing place to be. Folding, stocking, sales, co-workers and customers were very enjoyable to be a part of. Management kept everything together and in working order, but sometimes wouldn't know how to separate personal from professional with friends vs employees."
good,"its the same retail experience just different company."
good,Great to work for while an undergraduate in college. After that it was time to move on to a more professional environment that challenged me.
good,"I feel that a retail management position does not enable a person to balance family life with work. The benefits seemed great, but did not compensate for the long hours. I did enjoy the customer service part of the job, but not many of the people that I worked with unfortunately."
good,-design and map the floor lay-out
good,Giant corporate with multiple travels overseas and in Columbus OH (Headquarter)
good,"hours will get cut, unrealistic sales goals, hassle customers to buy credit cards, managers have ""favorites"", great people to work with, flexible schedule...retail just isn't for me never again"
good,Great company . I really enjoyed working here. I had to fold clothes ring up customers. Order clothing online for customers. Also make sure no one is stealing from the store
good,You have to be driven and committed if you want to work at Express. The environment is very nice and welcoming but you have to get your work done. Benefits aren't the best so you don't get much off if you work at the factory store.
good,"I really enjoyed everyone that works there. The manager really worked with me for scheduling. It had its days where it would stress you out like black Friday, but for the most part, I enjoyed working there."
good,"The most stressful and most difficult part about working here is the fact that you MUST ask customers if they would like to open an Express Credit Card, I just liked helping customers with their fits instead of asking them all those questions and not a lot of people have good credit like that & when I first started working their it was like the training was rushed and it wasn’t done properly. I regret working their and I am so happy that I left and moved on with a better job I’m satisfied with."
good,"This job was just okay. I didn't hate it or love it. The hours were okay, but not the best for college students. The 5 day 4-hour shifts seem to take more of a toll than 8-hour shifts do. The company itself, however, is good. The employees are friendly and the management as well. There was this one manager that I didn't think she liked me but, she just has a personality that takes some warming up to. The pay is okay, but there's no commission for sales. Every once in a while they will have contests and give out gift cards to different places. It wasn't for me I am not a fan of hounding people and there is a lot of that here."
good,dont know about any other location but mine was kind of messy. I got cut off from my hours even if i was still working. Pay was lower than minimum wage
good,"I would clock in and then check in with one of the managers to see my specific task for that day, every so often I would get switched to a different task. If I get finished with my task I would go help with fitting rooms or the cash register. The management at first was good but as I started working there longer I noticed that it wasn't so good, communication wise.  The workplace culture was very diverse which was one thing I loved, I got to meet a lot of new people from different ages and backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was getting hours and my managers getting my schedule right. I would tell them plenty of times about my cheer schedule in advanced, but would still be scheduled on days I couldn't come in. Due to me being a minor, I had to have my mom come in a few times to enforce my correct schedule changes. Also, sometimes the treatment to us employees was not fair all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people and making and meeting new people."
good,The environment was good. Everyone followed and stuck with the mission and did what they had to do in order to keep the store in a solid position overall.
good,"Express is a great company, workers should definitely get paid more for all the work that they do. The atmosphere is great! If you are looking for a fun, easy job. this is for you"
good,It a good job if you going to school but if you working there for living then you won’t make it but the managers and my team members were great that all that cam with the job other than that I wouldn’t recommend working there
good,I worked here for two years and came back for a couple of months. It is a good fast learning job but the pay wasn't good. It is a very loud environment and limited shifts because overstaffed.
good,"It was a good retail job while I was in school getting my degree, at the time I was working there they were not offering pay raises, and the hours were unpredictable, so I had to seek other employment options."
good,it is nice to work in express. I started there with a less percent of experience and in this I learned everything and I have an absolutely experience with customer service.
good,"Great place, just not intended to be long term. Manager is a great person, however runs the store a bit unorganized. Very good young people come for a part time job after high school. The co manager is only 19, leaving room for some immaturity. However a good start for some college students! Flexible hours!"
good,"Good company to work for but they do not compensate you for what you deserve.  Anyone who works for them will tell you that, will have no problem making you work 39 hours a week but makes sure you do not go over so you do not get OT or benefits."
good,Express was good to me. I grew as a manager & person. The only hang up I had was being away from my family most weekends & almost all holidays. Having kids and working retail is extremely hard and Express didn't seem like they tried to make it easy on anyone with children.
good,"Nice Friendly place to work, very simple job. However if you do not preform at your best then your hours do get cut. Other then that management is friendly, coworker are really friendly they make you feel like your part of a team."
good,"Worked nights, usually 5-close. learned a lot about people and how to approach and talk to people. management was cooperative, co-workers were nice and uplifting, standing for whole shift, not long shifts."
good,"After punching in, I was given instructions for day on where I was going to be in the store and what I was going to be doing. Usually I was helping on the Dress shirt wall keeping things neat and helping customers find what they were looking for or helping them decided on what to buy. Management was easy to work with and was very experienced giving good advice on how to communicate with customers and sale merchandise. The coworkers were fun to work with and made the job very easy. There wasn't many difficult tasks because training provided me with the most efficient ways to deal with problems. The most enjoyable part of working was the positive feed back the customers gave for my service to them."
good,A typical day at work I would greet customers while I kept the store tidy. I learned to work with a variety of customers as well as fellow employees.
good,productive fun work place where I got to show my people skills and offer assistance to people.
good,"I liked this job, just not enough pay. I was given advancement but didnt take it because i didnt like the pay."
good,"Currently working as a sales associate is a very fast paced job, throughout the majority of the time. Customer Service is our number one priority. I've learned the fundamentals of how to help and attend a customer in what they need or any questions they may need an answer for. Sometimes it might be very vigorous when there's many customers that might need my help and I'm all over the place, but that's when I use ""IBC"" which means, "" In Between Customer"". It helps me attend various customers by going to each customer I see that need help and then switching back to other customers that I helped before. However, when I have other co-workers with me it makes it less vigorous. The best part of my job is making people smile and feel welcome to our store. Many customers come in with many personal problems that many people go through on a day today basis, but if we delight them by assisting them, being polite, and asking how their day is going etc. It may make them feel comfortable and express themselves. What I don't like about my job is that for all the work we do for giving our best in customer service and reaching sales goals I end getting paid minimum wage."
good,i loved working for express manager and other employees were great people.
good,"If you don't have previous work experience, Express is a great place to learn important skills. Depending on your management team, Express could be a very good place to work or a bad place to work."
good,"Working at Express taught me how to be quick, customer service skills. The hardest part was dealing with customers that didn't speak the same language,"
good,"Responsible for engaging each and every customer--warranted or otherwise--which isn't always effective. Must always be up-selling and maintaining the cleanliness of the store. Management is an area where most improvement is required. Managers are often unqualified for leadership positions, leading to mismanagement and disparity."
good,I was put to the pressure and learned in a high pace workplace and still managed to over come and sell to most of everyone the walked in that day
good,fun environment. Everyone is very easy going and polite. The management was just as easy going as the employees and just as nice. The hardest part of the job was the hours. Sometimes they went straight through the night. The most enjoyable part was working with amazing people.
good,"A typical day involved filling the floor, driving sales and multiple back office tasks."
good,"I didn't work there long enough to really get a feel for the work environment, but at times it did not feel as friendly of an work environment as I would like it. But I did like how everyone was very self motivated."
good,"I like what I do, but there are minor issues with receiving detailed information on certain process, then being reprimanded for the lack of knowledge. Overall, I like my job, but need more income."
good,I would come in and perform my duties as I was instructed. No real challenges.
good,*llegar y empezar a elaborar los productos.
good,"Very busy. Learned how to operate under pressure. Management was good, and also co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work would be a walk through the store to see any new sales and store rearrangements, cross referencing the BoL with the actual received stock, and proceed with processing said stock. Processing it included unpacking, sorting, attaching security tags, folding or hanging, steaming if necessary, and placing out on the sales floor. It was very difficult keeping up with the 120 units per hour quota, but the work itself was rather easy, if not monotonous. I had to learn time management, as well as priorities and the priorities of my managers. I was the only person on the stock team at the time, so achieving these priorities rested solely on my shoulders."
good,"I learned how to deal with customers. I learn to take my time when it comes to being around people. A day at Express was light work, you had to make sure the store was clean and the customers are happy."
good,Pretty cool part-time job. I got hired right out of high school. Worked there for almost two years. Management was good towards staff. Very understandable and willing to work with your schedule. Which helped me through college.
good,"Great hours, friendly staff, fun job. Usually worked over night the place was 2 floors and usually a huuge mess but the company was great, just way too much to handle."
good,"A typical day was fun, upbeat, good music, pretty & funky clothes ( I love to dress and look nice) We could wear what suited our personality in order to represent the store."
good,"Working at Express was not hard. In a days work at Express, I would work on go-backs( putting clothes back in it's place on the floor), Clean the fitting rooms, maintain the floor display cleanliness, an greet customers. The only part about Express I did not like was the fact that they did not give many hours."
good,"If you go to school or simply have another job they're great with hours, really flexible. Fun and exciting work environment, also a great place to keep you looking trendy."
good,"I was hired for a different position than i applied, so i didn't stay very long. The work wasn't what i was looking for and harder than i thought it was going to be. I didn't feel like i was doing the best i could."
good,"Some days are slow others are fast"
good,"Express is a place where fashion is the key. Different people of all races come in and ask for your opinion on what to wear and how to wear it ,and its your job to make them feel good about their self, and have them walking out with a smile"
good,le travail n'ais pas difficile il faut juste écouter ce qu'on le dit et après tout ce passe très bien avec toute l'équipe
good,"A typical day with Express started out with Starbucks before work hours with the team. Then we would begin our work pre-opening the store. We would have a sales prep meeting on the floor fifteen minutes before opening the doors. From there the fun begins. We sold wardrobe after wardrobe and credit card after credit card. Rewards were given out and amazing people are recognized through out the day. The only downfall of this job is that the security of keeping your job isn't there, nor is the possibility for in-house advancement. They can cut hours at a moments notice which could leave you hungry for half a week. It's not a stable job for a college student surviving on their own, but it's does have it's perks. I will forever miss Express. Who knows, maybe one day I might be back, but it will not be as a Fashion Expert or a Returns Key Holder..."
good,"If you love helping ppl and love fashion you will have a great time. Dont forget to show up, wear comfy shoes, look fabulous and have fun!"
good,"I prefer not to say more, I've been in the company for a few years and they could be better towards their employees and the hours could be better as well"
good,Express was a stressful environment to be in mainly due to the poor leadership and management of my specific location. The attitudes were fast paced and intense.
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere of my job. Lots of room for moving up in the company. I am part-time so I do not receive any benefits, but from what I hear they are good."
good,I loved working with the clothing around me and really getting to know how the store worked. This allowed me to know a lot about the store and help answer questions and resolve questions. Engaging customers regularly would help me build knowledge about the type of customers that where coming into the store and help them find specific items they where looking for.
good,"I applied to express with the impression that I would get at least 20 hours a week, however I only received 7 hours per week.. "
good,They are a good company but the cons are theres not always a job open or when u get to the job u get treated like scum
good,limited brands is a great company to work for
good,Great job overall for extra cash for a part time student. As a college student you are able to receive flexible hours and many discounts on all the clothes.
good,driving over the road. getting loads to destination on time freedom to work alone. keeping records and the friendly companions.adapting to traffic.
good,The store was great and so was the job but a store that sells shirts worth more than what i made working there a day was not worth it.
good,Not a bad place to work. Management was terrible. No room to grow. Not bad I would not recommend someone to work at Express
good,"The first 10-11 months working there were great, the managers and coworkers were great to get along with. We even had team bulding events on weekends every month or so. However, that changes when there's a certain salty employee that throws the fun and friendly employees under the bus. When the fun managers were let go and we needed new management, that's when the work environment wasn't so fun. That's why I left within the last month or so of my employment. The new managers weren't as fun or easy to get along with, and instead of team building, they just wanted to hang out with the OTHER new mangers. ??? Aside from the sucky new management that came about towards the end of my run, I would say that Express has been one of my favorite jobs to date, despite the pay. It was all about the people I worked with and the environment we created. It's what kept me around until they were gone."
good,"There not much talk about this company I never work there, I just worked for there name. The people that worked there was great trying to help me find a great job."
good,work is always fun.not enough hours but i love this place. management is really helpful and really nice people
good,The work environment was good. The management helped the employees when they needed help. There was a sales goal to be meet each day. At the end of the shift during closing the manager would let the staff know if the goal was met or how much money was needed to meet the goal. We were also required to meet a certain goal for rewards card that we would offer to the customer. We had to make sure that the store was clean and organized at all times. As the customers would walk in we had to greet them and thank them on there way out.
good,"easy work environment friendly employee make your only schedule"
good,"I liked having a different task for each shift I worked"
good,"Express inc was not the greatest place to work lack of respect for employees personal time, like of competent management, and rarely promote from within the company."
good,"did some warehouse work, customer service work, janitorial work, fast past, learned a lot, nice coworkers were met, really enjoued some of the placements i was sent to."
good,"In a job such as this , it is hot and cold, you may have hours or you may not. Usually there are no hours which technically leads to not working weeks at a time. I love the networking it does let me show my skills in meeting new people but would like to further that in a company that has hours to spare"
good,"Co workers always helping out."
good,great summer job for college kids great pay and great coworkers
good,they was friendly till something went wrong around us. they was very intense and rude.
good,Nice Place to work. Needed Better Opportunities. Found a better Job  Though.
good,There are very few opportunities to advance within this company
good,Honestly love Working at Express I just wish I could get more hours. I get like 12 hours a week when I oils work 30H/week. It’s all good though  it’s an easy job!!!
good,Express overall was good experience for me. It helped me interact with more people and helped my confidence. On the other hand express management was poor and truly dysfunctional.
good,"I enjoyed making connections with associates and working with them to achieve promotions and confidence in their selling power. This company however is really difficult about getting people that have had their loyalty for long times the training needed for promotions. It's an everyone for himself atmosphere. While being there I advanced and got promoted quickly, but there were several others who showed loyalty in the company and weren't ""favorites"". As well as being a minimum wage job expects a lot of its associates, for example being reprimanded for speaking to another associate. As well as managers being condescending to everyone under them."
good,This place was a great place to go after working in a hectic retail store before. It’s more structure and more controlled. It’s a great place to work but it’s time for something new
good,"Worked at a fast pace, during peak holiday season. A lot of chaos, but was fun, if you made it fun. Managers did their best to make sure everyone was happy and comfortable."
good,"The store is divided into a men's and women's sectioning. Most foot traffic and floor space are for women's product. Men are by no means the type of shopper to browse for hours like female customers. Thus, it is easier to build a relationship with female customers and make them return customers. The in-n-out nature of male shoppers makes this more difficult. What makes it more difficult is the largely out of touch managerial and associate staff with the Midwestern male fashion sense among customers that do shop at Express, which defines itself around a New York fashion style. Many staff push on items to customers that are either too tight, too ""sheek,"" or too effeminate for many male customers. The company needs to stay loyal to its brand, but recognize that most men do not want to buy graphic tees with bikini women on them, nor wear stiff polos with large lions."
good,It was a good staring job getting paid minimum wage but I wasn't fan of call-in shifts for part time workers. We also didn't have good supply chain/ean mindset when it came to taking care of clothings
good,"A typical day at work consists of us making our segments, selling, maintaining order, and a lot of customer service. This job is helping advance the skills I already have. Management is easy to talk to and co workers make it feel like a family workplace. Hardest part of the job is maintenance and making the day. Most enjoyable is being a successful stylist for customers."
good,"While I was working in Express, I think I felt every emotion possible. To begin with, I loved the store, so that was one of the parts that made my day enjoyable. However, the management of the store at the time of my employment were people who were not understanding and who lacked personal touch. I was going to school at the time, and they wanted me to close every night, making me leave the store at 12 or 1 in the morning. I would try to schedule myself for earlier shifts, yet they did not allow me."
good,Working at express was all about costumer service also folding clothes and being a great cashier. Making sure every customer has a great experience.
good,The management team is hard working and willing to help at any time.  I learned to be patient and a people person working in retail.  The best part about this job is being able to say I completed something at the end of the day.
good,Busy store not enough fitting rooms.Good management not enough hours available.
good,"The work environment was cool. I enjoyed interacting with the customers on a daily basis and the labor wast stressful. However after me having plenty of 8 hour weeks and time cuts, the money you bring in from here is a joke. Havent moved up anywhere in the company in 7 months and dont see it happening anytime soon."
good,An ok company. Not much room for growth. Management at this location is not very organized. Hours and schedules is flexible but not given more than 15 hours a week.
good,its a fast pace place to work you wmill lose yourself because it stays so busy but its a good quality upscale store to start at to buil your resume
good,Express is a great place to work. I’ve collectively worked for express for nine years. the only reason I left was because of restructuring. It was by far my favorite job
good,"Express is a company based on customer service, you can go a long way if you know how to make the client feel special in what he or she is purchasing."
good,"This was my first job and I was thrown into a wreck of a store, luckily we eventually got a brand new store manager and she turned everything around. It was a pretty easy job that anybody can learn, but it helps when you have a store manager that makes you want to perform at your best, and rewards you for it. "
good,it was quite some time since i worked there and wouldnt be able to give a good enough account in order to review. i would definitely recommend them for a young student interested in fashion.
good,Express is an okay place to work while looking for something more permanent. The hours are food during the holidays. After New years very little hours are given. Gm was very kind and motivating. Assistant manager was very rude and abrasive to both employees and customers.
good,A great place if you are looking for discounts on clothes. The polices have changed only upper management gets raises. No longer a fun place to work managers gossip far to much and has favorites.
good,People from the company are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met . Always on your feet and doing something but the right coworkers make the workplace bearable. Though sometimes they don’t tell you everything you need to know so you always have to look for someone to ask questions.
good,"Express is a work jobber providing workers to local companies, it isn't itself a company that produces a product.  Employment there is temporary and depends on what local companies need."
good,"I loved the experience at Express. Working in the stockroom and looking at the new product come in everyday, watching a costumers face light up when they find the outfit they've been looking for or the right dress for their occasion."
good,"Express is a very competitive company. They want to meet their quota daily. I loved working at Express when I first got hired. The environment was very welcoming and fun. As time went by, the managers got very comfortable with me. I would come in and work whenever they needed me to, would stay late hours than I was scheduled, I would basically do whatever they told me to. They just started to take advantage of me. I was basically doing the managers job but getting paid at a sales associate rate. And I would hardly ever get scheduled. So in the long run it isn't worth working at Express for me."
good,"Definitely a good part-time job but not a lot of room for advancement. Anyone interested in moving up in the business can partake in their management training program, but most complete it with nothing happening. Honestly, I don't think I even learned anything."
good,"Great products and great cliental. management was very nice and understanding. Everybody who worked there were friendly. felt good to get all dressed up for work. If you like fashion and enjoy dressing up for work, this is the place for you."
good,"This was my first paid job in college. I did learn a lot and I wish I had taken it much more seriously. Gaining retail experience in college is really important, and I would recommend working here because you can get a great discount for cute but professional clothing. This will help you down the road."
good,Express give you many opportunities for you to better your future. The company gets you into factories to get you experience.
good,Express is a good company.  I waited for jobs to come in.  I am thankful for the work.  It is a hard area with not alot to available openings.
good,people at the place is nice they work hard getting you a job. then when you roll over they call and tell you that they are proud of you for getting roll over great place to use to fine your job you want.
good,"Typically includes selling  to and assisting guests."
good,"Ecah day there was something new there was never a dull moment , never a time to stop and breath always movin. and fast paced"
good,A typical work day work  I would assist in opening the store with the cleaning and straightening of merchandise. When the store opens I begin assisting the customers that come into the store with what they may looking for. I learn the needs of each customer to better assist them. My coworkers are always willing to help and teach  me how to do something. The hardest part of the job is trying to help someone with every resource you have and they're fighting against you all the way. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to successfully fulfill the needs of each customer so you leave a lasting impression and they want to continue coming back.
good,"Express was the longest job I had held. I only left because the management was screwing around with promoting me as they should have. I was working hard at becoming the new stylist there and after many months, floorsets and a complete store remodel later, I was offered nothing. I had to generally quit in order to receive my well earned promotion and then that didn't even turn out how it should have."
good,"The company tries and ensures to contact its job seekers on regular basis if the have found employment and checks if they are happy with working conditions and working hours where thy have found work on their behalf, i found that working in a group or team requires communication and good work ethics to ensure good productivity and all that at times makes the work place fun due to good working relatinship built.A typical day at work would be realistic working hours and at times difficult clients to satisfy and on that note one learns to be patient and just to ensure that you deliver your best to the client to encourage them to do business with the company you work for, every work comes with a great package of learning experience and self development."
good,"When I was working for express I was ready for any kind of work."
good,It was typically very slow so your day would seem like it lasted forever. management i feel pressured you a lot but in my opinion it helped me accomplish my task.
good,It is a great place to work with great people and fantastic products.
good,The work environment is great. My managers are great but when it comes to the people above and the way they organize the staff in the stores is a whole other thing.
good,Nice clothes. Nice managers. Flexible hours. Good location. Helps refine social skills and communication. Good discounts for associates as well.......
good,"Enjoyed working with cliental and a great set of team members, perfect for balancing part time work and part time college degree. Was able to continue building on sales skills."
good,"working in the stockroom as a team was enjoyable and productive, the managers we're mostly good, could've been more productive, but overall a fun and nice place to work at"
good,Managers will are very flexible with anyone who needs their attention. Good for working as a second job from your first job. Your Co-workers are very socialable.
good,"I like working thru express. I've worked on various jobs and locations such as con air, bell helmets, and rantoul foods and they try to keep you working whether its a continuing assignment or several thru the week"
good,"At Express, my coworkers have become more like my friends. The people working there are extremely open-minded, making it a comfortable environment to work in as well as making it a safe place to work in. A typical day at work includes selling as much as we can, convincing customers to apply for our ExpressNEXT credit cards and rewards programs, helping customers out and interacting with them, working the cash register, and organizing the clothes etc. Management is alright, most of the managers there are very understanding and helpful when it comes to call outs, schedule changes and being flexible with their workers. They're also very supportive and try to motivate their employees as much as they can. The hardest part is definitely closing time and convincing our customers to sign up for our credit card. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and getting to hear where they're from and different backgrounds and why they choose to shop with our company."
good,"While working at Express I had the privilege of interacting with customers, working as a cashier, and working the dressing rooms. The atmosphere of Express was very welcoming and bright, you would walk in the store and everyone would be smiling while working and willing to help anyone. The hardest part about working at Express would probably have to be when the worker would have to call the main Express store and get verification for an Express credit card."
good,It was a very good work place the jobs keep you busy. The managers are very good with people the pay is interesting just wish it would be more work available
good,Walking into the back room with racks and bins full of clothes everywhere. Having to organize and back stock everything before processing the new merchandize that came in.
good,It's a fast paced work environment that provided opportunities to learn something new every day. The co-workers and managers made for non-stressful work days and allowed me to help others as well.
good,I really like about working for Express I got to learn how to lead sales associates in sales transactions. Also while working at Express I learned to communicate better with customers by providing exceptional care and attention to their needs.
good,This job was perfectly fine. There's not much space to advance and the pay kind of sucks compared to other retail stores in the same mall. Management was cool.
good,"Excellent growing Family Business"
good,"Working at two different locations gave me insight on what an ""in-store"" experience is. With all the retailers closing down, I'm proud to work for a company that allows me to grow as a leader and to change as the market changes. Also as a consumer, I know what exceptional customer service looks like and how to implement that through my leadership role at Express. On a daily basis, I hope to achieve and convey that to my employees in a fun while using positive reinforcement. While being in this position, I've been rewarded by seeing how much associates have grown in their position as well as being confident in all facets of their life."
good,"Great place to work, room for advancement, great merchandise, great discounts to the store as well as to sister stores. Work schedule varies, need more vacation & sick days, work to home balance not good, lots of deadlines to me, stressful."
good,"Over all Express is a reasonable place to work however, it's usually temporary positions and not long time career opportunities unless you get luck with your out souring company."
good,"A typical work day consists of working hands on with customers of all different demographics to ensure that they have a great experience while they shop for acquired outfits. Also, with my fellow employees that help make the business run smoothly day by day. Daily administration work is also on the daily agenda."
good,"Mantener toda la ropa organizada y con sus tag adentro, pero que no se vean."
good,"Good job for high school or college students, you get fair pay for entry level job, customers can be a pain but most are nice, nice people to work with"
good,"laid back, friendly employees, great help, good discounts, great product , lacks a little bit of management experience but besides that everything there is good"
good,Not treated right here treated like dogs half the time can't get ppe not a nice company to work for as of late get messed about with with our pay and then have to wait a month for it to be amended
good,"Overall great company to work for, some minor things here and there. Sketchy ways of finding information about employees out aka lying about what an employee did to find out other things"
good,It is a Temp. agency and they did get me into a job as soon as I applied through them. They have an awesome staff to work with. Never had a problem with my checks.
good,"Es muy confotable poder contar con managuer tan preparado"
good,The culture is very friendly but also professional. You'll meet lots of different people everyday and express your fashion expertise to others in need.
good,"Love knowledge, daily challenges,hard work many opportunities, fast paced challenges to overcome daily. Growing daily for my self, making sure that I always give %110. Improving daily."
good,Was a great retail-clothing experience. Got along with all the co-workers and management. Sad the store closed down. Most enjoyable part was helping others with finding the right outfit whether it be a man or woman.
good,This job gave a good insight into the retail industry and helped in progressing customer service skills along side other useful skills.
good,Sales associate enjoy the flow higher end fashion and inspiring customers to purchase. Management and coworkers are friendly and helpful. Great place to gain people skills internally and externally (customers).
good,I really enjoyed the energy and team player spirit of the company. Everyone gets their hands dirty and works. Not just sales associates. I do wish the compensation was a little more.
good,worked here for two years and i loved it we were a family and i felt like i knew the customers personally . everyone knew everyone at express and it was a fun expereince.
good,"Excellent job finder and very easy details that everyone can use.i would recommend this ""indeed"" to other people who are motivated and willing to grow with  experience."
good,learned how to deal with the customer in different settings and how i can make their experience more pleasing for them in what they wants to purchase
good,chill place to work at if you like sails. The only bad thing is the hours which are too low. the managers were really cool to get to know. the customers on the other hand can be very rude if you are not quick enough but I guess that's any place right?
good,Serving your country is amazing and the benefits are also amazing. Moving up is based on time in service and how well you work with others.
good,"All employees were always with a lot of energy and very enthusiastic, it was very pleasant to work with everyone, specially with the managers. The company always gave us tips and a lot information about product knowledge, customer experience and how to enhance our productivity and performance which it was very helpful and let me made the best out of my shift."
good,"Great challenges, easy going and fun for a first job. Great discounts and great co workers. You get a great work ethic while working at express"
good,"Good environment, good incentives. People are polite, policies are well written and easy to understand. There is overall good communication between the corporation as a whole."
good,An amazing place to work. The employees are amazing to work with very welcoming and kind. Although it gets super busy employees are able to get things done in a fast manner and were able to uphold stores cleanliness.
good,This is fun place to work at. Everyone is helpful and people feel positive to work here. The managers are really supportive and they want to make sure that all employees do an impeccable job.
good,"Express is one of my favorite places that I have worked. It is a very challenging, but fun, work environment.  The team environment between you and your peers is great, as well.  This is a company that is really trying to do it all, however, and as a result, a lot of that can fall on the Store Manager's shoulders as payroll is extremely lean."
good,"Express was my first retail job, I learned to be organized, a team leader, be efficient, and an excellent multi-tasker where I am now a more proactive and stronger individual. Although I do wish the compensation were better, due to the demand of work required of the associate, but the company does allow for growth for the individual instead of hiring outside of the company."
good,Express is a large company. I liked working their because I like giving outstanding customer service and helping customers find the perfect outfit. The staff was friendly.
good,"Replenishment of store "
good,I had the chance to put my organizing skills at use while helping and talking to customers. The hardest part of the job was looking for clothes in the back when nobody really explained on how to find the item.
good,"With the right people it is easy to click with one another because the brand is affordable ""high-end"" fashion. Customers vary but are easy to connect with. It's a great environment to work in. But the pay is very low."
good,"This is more of a young adult store, where there are great people working and shopping. flexible hours and competitive pay."
good,"friendly place"
good,"Fun job, great environment. Love my coworkers. The pay is kind of low, considering the responsibilities. Only way to get a raise is to get promoted to manager. Would've liked either a raise or work off commission like the managers do. A lot of difficult customers tend to come through Express, which is why you must always keep your head up and smile no matter what. Hours given vary, a lot. Every week is different so you have to be very flexible."
good,"If you have great fashion sense and have a great personality that is willing to be shared with excited customers that are striving for the new up and coming styles, Express is the place for you. As well as assisting customers with great customer service, you have a chance to show customers the best new fashion styles that are being represented on the market."
good,"Fun place to work, four hour shifts. Great employees and management. Fifteen minute breaks...no lunch unless you work 6 hours."
good,"Greet and assist customers."
good,Express was a great place to work. Starting out as an associate I developed strong customer service skills. Managers encourage and notice strong associates who show interest in positions with higher responsibility which is how I obtained my sales lead position.
good,"im a fast worker where many managers has expressed me as an leader. the days vary from fast paced, to a slow day. I always get my work done and set goals for myself, and always help other co-workers if needed. Ive learned to have more patience with others, being that I am a fast but diligent worker that others don't get things as quick as I do. The management team is ok, but im looking for an environment where management takes care of their employees more and pay attention to their needs and respect."
good,The ability to work with fun people in the fashion industry is always enjoyable. I had the opportunity to do so while also heating to use my visual creative skills to improve sales and customer experience.
good,Customers are priority. The store is very laid back and my co workers are very respectful and friendly.
good,"Day consisted of a 5 min wrap in of what to expect for the day, do everything possible to convince customers to buy and open an Express credit card."
good,"Express is a pretty good retail environment to work in, with a combination of casual and formal attire for men and woman of a variety of styles and fashions senses."
good,very slow paced environment with a lot of folding clothes and not many good interactions
good,"The team here was great, I met a lot of wonderful people and developed some amazing friendships. Management was also helpful"
good,It's great. Very fun. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. Most enjoyable part is helping people.
good,"Busy days with multiple objectives during a shift."
good,on call 24-7. i would put in anywhere from 8 to 24 hours. i would put up safety equipment on rigs for H2S gas. I preped and  checked all safety equipment in both trailers to be done if time i rechecked trailers going out. always checked traliers before we left yard with them. i would make sure traliers where in proper condition and our truck. I tought new safety hand how to service these trailers. Occationally i would go be a safety hand on location to supervise the safety and keep head count of all on location in case of emergency as well as watch for safety hazards on location. I also filled in for any position besides my own that needed to be done. i was cross trained for everything in our yard.
good,I've actually what retail stores do. It seem like it use to be the longest  4-6 hours ever. My co workers were actually cool.
good,called customers for there orders. gave drivers there routing schedules. promoted to assistant manager. handled 8 employees.
good,"- I applied for a seasonal position and typically work 5 hour shifts"
good,"a typical work day was very fast paced and full of many different tasks needing to be completed.  I learned a great deal here about time management and focus.  The main focus of our management team was selling and coaching the staff to build the store's numbers.  The people I worked with were also very focused and sales minded; they worked very hard to reach their goals, which was a contagious mindset. The most challenging aspect of this job was creating enough time to do all of necessary tasks throughout the day. However, this amount of work allowed me to take on more responsibility as an assistant manager and it was a great learning experience working in such a large corporate company."
good,A typical day at express is fast paced. you are always in contact with customers and your fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet all day.
good,"I worked for Express for a total of 4 1/2 years and worked at 4 different locations.  You will work hard and learn some great selling models to help you in any future retail positions you hold.  They feel strongly about promoting from within if you show dedication in the company and in what you do.  I met some wonderful people and had great mentors that really coached and developed me to become a great person and a great leader.  The benefits are wonderful for full time employees.  "
good,Not comfortable writing a review.  Everyone's experiences are different.
good,I liked the people I was working with and though there was drama it wasn't too bad. I honestly would be surprised if I worked in a clothing store and there wasn't any drama at all. Other than that the company itself is fine. They don't go above and beyond but they don't screw you either.
good,working here for the holidays was like it was Christmas every day. All the employees were happy and always on point with work
good,"A typical work day was a smooth, productive, enjoyable day. There were never any conflicts between coworkers or between workers and costumers. Ive learned how to properly greet costumers and become a better salesmen. Our management was a great team collectively. They made sure that the work environment was suitable for all of us and made it a fun energetic place to work. The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of the costumers attitude and how they would react to you. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and engaging in different conversations about fashion. "
good,i learned a lot about retail here. Management turns a lot. Dosent reallt work with ppl schedules.
good,"On a typical day you listen to a recording that gives the plan, then check a board to see who the manager is and report to the appropriate one.  They will then assign you to a zone or job based on the needs of the store. You are then responsible for the completion of the task.  I learned this is a very fast paced environment that handles many customers in a short time.  Management is laid back and understanding, while coworkers are young and full of life.  The biggest challenge is all the folding tables that have to be sized.  What I enjoy the most is working with people and trying to meet their needs.  "
good,"Working retail is not a piece of cake but at Express i really enjoy it. My co workers have great sense of team work and are very supportive. Our customers are charming and we do our best to tend to all their needs. Management is also great. They are always willing to answer my questions and teach me whatever it is i would like to learn. Hardest part of the job would be keeping up the neatness of the store while attending to every customer but like i said, I've been working retail for almost 6 yrs now and Express is one of my favorite jobs."
good,"You work with customers, helping them make purchases or return purchases. you clean up and maintain the store appearance."
good,Express gave me the chance to actively learn the meaning of listening and assisting.
good,I enjoyed working there because I had a lot of freedom and flexibility to do my job.
good,Mostly just help customers with their clothing needs and keep the sales floor as clean as possible. Management was very nice and understanding. My Co-workers where nice people as well. Hardest part of this job was getting to store cleaned up at the end of the night. most enjoyable when the season was over and I no longer had to work there.
good,"i loved working at Express however, i started to get 8 hours a week which was not enough for me. A while after i requested more hours, they were not givin to me so i quit. Working at express, I've learned to deal with all types of people, from picky to stubborn to understanding and helpful. A typical day at work consists of helping customers around the store, making sure they are buying what they want, making sure the store stays clean, and handling money. The hardest part of the job was to stand on my feet for more than 8 hours sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with everyone"
good,This job has given me more experience in the technology field.
good,"i worked fo rthis company a very long time this is where i started my retail experience and learned most of my skills that i have today i started out of high school and continued for many years. i loved the clothes my managers ,alot of changes took place with changes managers and i worked my way up from just an associate to managemennt. the best part of my jobb was the relationships i built with my clients and i had a regulars who would shop andi would be there stylist."
good,Clothing Retail Was Definitely A Good Learning Experience
good,I really enjoyed dressing nice and helping out everyone. The environment was also really fun to be in.
good,"The job itself as a sales associate was worth it, learning how to deal with different customers with different approaches for each individual. You go in and do what you can to make the best of your job."
good,"Assisting customers with any questions about sales and promotions regarding the company merchandise, I learned how to communicate with people and expanded my sale skills. The management was very professional and pleasant and enjoyable to work with. The hardest part would trying to reach the everyday sale goal for the company. The most enjoyable part would be achieving the sale goals."
good,"I enjoyed working within all aspects of the company, from being in the field to getting product into stores."
good,"Ove the course of a few years working at Express you really learned what it was like to work in the ""fashion"" industry. When going into the world of fashion, I am very thankful for my retail experience. You were able to make what you wanted, but I take what I gained during those years and still apply it to my current work experience."
good,The only thing I do not enjoy about my job is that I never get a thank you from my boss. I stay overtime. I come in last minute. I also finish other's jobs.
good,A great place to work with fun co workers who strive to reach company goals.
good,"Good place to work, through high school. They pay alright, but the surroundings make up for it. Friendly and helpful employees are always around for whenever you need help."
good,"Working for Express was great. Everything moved in a timely manner, and when something came out of left field management was there to correct the problem. Working at an outside mall location was such a pleasure, it was always nice to see the different activites the mall would hold for the locals like car shows and concerts during the summer. The people I worked with all got along and even became friends outside of the work place."
good,"I enjoyed working for EXPRESS. Sometimes the work environment can be stressful but if there is a strong management team, the culture reflects their hard work and values. The worst part of the job is the unpredictable hours. The most rewarding part is having the opportunity to build relationships with co-workers and customers."
good,Relaxing environment. Not very good pay for the work that needed to be done. no room for advancement
good,Awesome place to work. The supervisor and manager were very friendly worked around the schedule I was able to work. Fairly easy made sure store was kept up and clean.  Greeted and helped customers as they walked in.
good,The hours is really not that good in the beginning... your hours you get is depends on how good of a associate you are. The typical hours a day is 7-9 as a part-time associate but at the one I work at is 4-5 hours..
good,I enjoyed my team and customers at Express!  The pay was pretty good.  The biggest opportunity for Express is payroll allocation and expectations of executing operational tasks and still be able to lead an effective business.
good,It was a decent job the manager who was there was super nice she left and got replaced she wasn’t as nice didn’t pay enough and they didn’t know how to work together
good,I actually liked working at Express. I learned a lot and I have gained a lot of experience from working in retail. My only issue was the shifting between my hours and days. But overall I had a great time working there. My manager was nice and was supportive when I couldn’t make a day for work.
good,Was a great place to work I felt safe and comfortable in the work environment. The jobs were not to far also the work wasnt all that hard. Go place to get experience for those who don't have much
good,"Juntas, prechequeo, acomodo de mercancía y venta al servicio."
good,Express was a very chill and relaxed environment but also very productive. The environment was also fun at times and can be quick pace on weekends. Managers were very sweet and loving. General Manager was not so much.
good,I reccomend to any college student or graduate who is looking to make some extra cash. Working here would not be for someone who is looking for a career.
good,Express is a good place to work part time as a second job. As a only job you get no hours whatsoever and can only go off call ins. You don’t get paid much either. Tends to get boring on a slow day as you have nothing to do but refold over and over when done with everything else.
good,I don’t know much about the company. I’m still getting used to working there and how things are done. It’s harder to do so when you are barely scheduled.
good,Express for me at least was a great way to build up my experience as a worker but other than that it wasn't all that great. the hours were mediocre although the management was fair.
good,I didn't work there long so I don't really know what to say but I remember I liked my job and the only reason I quit is because I had to relocate. I was placed at the Sun factory and did really well
good,"I enjoyed working for the store it was wonderful, i learned many things here and also thought it was a great opportunity working for clothing retail, opened up a new realm of work for me. The only problem i had was staying a little too late after the time i was scheduled because there was a lot of cleaning to do."
good,"It was a good job. The workers are amazing, but there was not a lot of hours to give. There were times when it was busy and customers asked a lot of questions. you had to help more than one customer at the same time."
good,"Express not a bad place to work at, at times stressful because of the business but that's retail! Holidays always working and feels like no days off but not bad for a first job.. managers are nice and relaxed super cool environment just personally wouldn't make it a career."
good,"Express is a wonderful place to work.  Retail is stressful, and there are definitely long hours, but the people you work with are very smart and overall pretty amazing."
good,"If you're looking for a fantastic first time retail job, this would be it, you're working at one of the best clothing line stores ever, they have a variety of clothes for you to choose. The discount is 40% except off clearance. You get to meet very open minded people as customers and sometimes the employees."
good,"I hated the hours and standing on my feet all day. I had to work the graveyard shift when new merchandise came in, which I wasn't a fan of. my coworkers became my family and friends, so I loved the work environment, but the pay really sucked. the PTO was great though if you work full time. I got 3 weeks off per year, but u don't get holidays off"
good,"The job is great and one i will always adore. It has a staff that is always helpful in showing how to work at a retail store and the management are always working hard to help employees improve."
good,"really enjoy this job and the people it introduced me too, but the upper management is horrible. very hard to move up based on the people they currently staff."
good,"The co-workers made the job experience a good one, but the management sucked. They thought they were all that and had major favoritism with employees on giving shifts."
good,The people that worked there were friendly but the district manager was just miserable. Never happy and constantly put people down. It was an experience and I learned many lessons. Not everyone you meet in life is going to be nice.
good,The atmosphere as you walk into Express is a positive energy. The staff work hard to find the right job for the person. Good place to help improve resumes and help getting back in the work force.
good,I enjoyed working as a sales associate but found managing my team and meeting the company goals more enjoyable. Setting up floor plans when new product came into the store was my favorite part of working for Express.
good,Working at Express is a lot of fun but can be stressful. You get a great discount which is nice since we have to wear their jeans which can get expensive. It is hard to move up unless the timing is right.
good,"Great environment "
good,Your personality and ambition will take you to the top! If you have an awesome spirit the customers and your staff will help you to build on your strengths and weakness so that you will affect the results of your daily work ethic.
good,working with good and dependable people working to get the job and working overtime to get the job done working in a health environment
good,"collegue super agréable "
good,a day at express come early 8 am to work sweep and make the store look good and before people come 3 of my teammates go in the back and sort out the clothes that going to be sold on the floor and we was timed and had a number of boxes with fulled with clothes we have to sense the clothes before going on the floor so it willnt get tooking out the store. management was cool guy nothing bad to say about him co-workers changed alot bc it a fast pace job and if yu wasnt fast your out. hardest part bout the job we didnt have any breaks. most enjoyable part of the job was being around people with good energy all day everyday i was there was a good part of the job
good,"Fun and exciting work environment, job culture is typical, if you're in sales you meet and greet customers while assisting them making purchases, if you're in merchandising you replenish sale floor, assist selling associates in finding merchandise, assist visual manager in moving signs, table, and displays while merchandising store."
good,"Anywhere from warehouse to assisting Kitchens like the L.D.S hospital in the cafeteria. working with others from other cultures, Management was different different managers for other areas. Liked working with multiple people in all aspects of the kitchen or warehouse work."
good,I enjoyed the over night hours.  I enjoyed the people I worked with. I was upset when the job ended.  I enjoyed working with the merchandise.
good,"Greet Customers"
good,"Assisted costumers as they walked in the store greeting them and providing them with information about promotions about the store. Used open ended questions and other marketing/sales strategies to further profits to achieve daily sales goals. Effectively handled money to carry out transactions throughout the day at a fast pace. Learned valuable communication skills. Managers are very helpful and understandable. Co-workers are fun to work with and be around. Toughest job task is handling difficult customers. Retail store is very fun with a ""young & hip"" atmosphere."
good,Display great customer service and interactions with people who came into the store.  Set business plan numbers for the day and gave goals to associates who would be coming into work that day.  There was never really a hard part of the job other than sometimes encountering rude customers but I would handle that with kindness and hope the customer would leave with a smile on their face. Most enjoyable part of my job was helping people feel good and have a great experience when in my store.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy clothes and people discount is fantastic.
good,"A typical day would be to make sure all inventory is out, fill in sizes that are missing on the floor, check to see if the store got any new inventory. I learned how a store should look and how to display the clothes in a varieties of ways. The management was very fair and lenient with us. My co-workers where very driven and hardworking only their to work and leave. Hardest part of the job was making the layout on how the store should look. The most enjoyable to me was not having"
good,great place to work as a young adult. Friendly staff and management. 
good,I learned a good bit about retail working for Express LLC and this will help me out in the future.  Great company and good management. 
good,"A typical day at work would start off by coming in the morning and cleaning an hour before we open. As the day would progress, I would usually straighten up the store, and help customers in need always knowing that all of the employees, including me, had a goal to meet in the current segment."
good,I learned a lot about retail while working at Express. They really want their employees to understand their customers.
good,It was fun to work here. I made a lot of new friends. The clothes we sold were very nice. The Discounts we got were good too. I did well engaging and helping customers. When I cashiered I had no problem asking them to apply for a credit card.
good,"I would come in and see what needs to be done for the day. If we needed to finish processing shipment or working on floorset, I would look at that. I learned to provide exceptional customer service and how I would want to be treated walking into a retail store. I loved my co-workers. We became a family and that was nice. The hardest part of my job was probably making sure that everyone made their sales goals for the day."
good,I learned to be responsible for a group/ team. It taught me that hard work pays off.
good,"I enjoyed working wtih all the new fashions and getting involved with management on how to showcase the cloths. The only thing is that they requied you to where the clothing but wiht what you get paid compared to how expensive the cloths were, it was nearly impossibe"
good,"I would ring up their daily transaction for customers, assiting customers on the sales floor with promotional information as well making sure they had a wonderful customer experience while shopping in this store."
good,"provide customers with clothing based on their personal wants and needs, as well as contributing knowledge to each customer and serving them new styles. Strive to push myself and the sales associates to meet and exceed the hourly store goals. As well, tending to each and every customer with an introduction and showing/ pulling products for each guest based on theirs as well as my own personal selections."
good,Management teaches employees daily on selling strategies but very discouraging when you get paid hourly and don't really get recognition for efforts made by staff.
good,"hired as a temp to hire for local  merchandising company. breaks were told your on break when your driving from job to job. always being told to work faster to exceed beyond the 30 case an hour minimum so he looks good we get burned out and not appreciated.  the temp to hire was more pay with benefits but was always told company is not hiring. "
good,"Express was my first retail job and it was amazing, I had an amazing group of managers that were focused on sales and providing a great experience for the employees."
good,"I loved working at Express in my location. My coworkers/customers made work enjoyable and a fun environment. Everyone got along with most of the CSLs but the higher up management was a struggle. This one specific manager is the reason I’d quit. Rude and bad attitude. Disrespectful and if you ask a question it’s always a problem. Made work un-enjoyable while they there. Overall flexible hours. Awesome coworkers, fast paced, always something to do."
good,A very good customer relationship and take very good care of their customer and never joke with the welfare and time of there customer. They take the problem of there customer has theirs.
good,I am excited to be part of the team however sometimes management can be a little difficult.  But overall express is a fun place to work with. The minimum pay is not cool I think it should at least start at $8
good,"A typical work day was very fast paced, we had several tasks to complete during our shift. We had to maintain a good attitude and offer help to all customers."
good,"I did order fulfillment, so I'd show up at ten and be done around two. The store was rarely busy at this time, so it was pretty low stress. I could listen to music while packing orders, so overall not to bad."
good,"It was a job that i liked but it was really hard to keep due to different shifts. I was attending university and even though my position was a part time, my hours where never enough to pay for my expenses."
good,We normally tried to have contest for the associates and even for the managers to keep the environment fast pace and fun. Overall the environment was good.
good,"I worked at express for a summer away from college and they were very flexible with scheduling, management seemed to have a good hold over operations, and they knew how to communicate with staff in a way conducive to a good work environment."
good,"It’s retail so of course weekends, evenings and holidays were expected.  Company was very generous with employee benefits like health, dental and especially paid time off.  All benefits started the first day.  Some benefits were even available to part time employees. "
good,"The managers and other coworkers were caring and understanding of everyone. However, I did not get a lot of work hours so I'd only make about 50 every two weeks. If you put in a lot of hours and like to dress nice then this is for you."
good,"I worked during college and made very little money and had close to no hours. It was super fun to work there, drama free, and great employee discount, but definitely wouldn't be somewhere I would work for a full time job."
good,"Great workplace! All workers were super nice and friendly, but there was not much room for advancement and not a fast enough work pace for me except for around the holidays."
good,I have lots of management training with this company. They are very big on training and policy. There is room for advancement but you really need to work very hard and introduce yourself to the right people.
good,"i enjoyed working here eventhough sometimes the pace was very slow, i wouldve still been working here if i didnt have pregnancy complications and had to go out after 5 months"
good,"Medium sized store, faster paced, and numerous employees. Manager and Assistant where good and did there best to help whenever I was on the floor and talking to customers."
good,"Express gives individuals who don't have a job experience an opportunity to have one. They would only need to prove themselves why should they be kept. Pay may not start strong, but it be ok for pocket money."
good,Typically you are trying to meet the sales goal and preventing theft by walking the store. When I left they were implementing individual sales goals for the sales reps. You learn how to be observant and great social skills. Along with money management and merchandising. The hardest part of the job is mainly being on your feet all of your shift and pushing sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is the community that forms between all of the employees.
good,"A typical day at work consists of stocking in the back of the store.I would normally come in go straight to the back , carry boxes unpackage each box and sensor the clothing."
good,Each employee had a very large opportunity to move up in the company. Each employee had the chance to voice their own opinions on what they needed help with or what they were more interested in to move forward with the company.
good,We layer water pipe and sewer pipe. I was the ditch man so I had to lay the pipe in the ditch and stick them together.  We also layer man holes for the sewer.
good,"Company keeps up to date with current trends for fashion. I've enjoyed giving my input and customize every customer's experience with Express. However, like many jobs, there's always room for improvement, not just for our customers, but for the employees as well."
good,"This job is great when starting out, but then after 2 months it gets boring and tedious. If you like folding clothes all day, this is the perfect job for you."
good,I never made more than 15 hours a week part-time so the pay was not sufficient. Management is friendly and fun. Customers can be rude. Job overall is easy. Good for high school college students who need the extra cash.
good,Express is a great retail job to work at. Working there gave me more tools become a better worker and become more experienced.
good,"The discount is great and if you're into fashion this job will be fun. Typical day can be slow, but there's always a task you can do to stay busy."
good,"Overall a nice place to work at, and usually a fun time. Nice coworkers, and understanding management who work around your schedule."
good,"Aprendi mucho en la empresa, muchas herramientas conoci y las adopte."
good,I did not spend very much time at Express but what time I spent there was spent in long stretches. I enjoyed my time with Express due to the environment that is created and maintained by the leadership and staff. I enjoyed the holiday position as a sales associate. The staff seemed to be a revolving door of new associates constantly swooning in and out. The most displeasing thing about the store was the possibility that the 9pm closing shift could (and often would) extend well beyond midnight.
good,Long work hours that require open availability. Your breaks depend on the other managers showing up on time. Most enjoyable part is the customers that you get to know over time as they become regulars.
good,"A energetic, multitasking environment. Intention to teach associates the building blocks of customer service. Encouragement from management to aid company in success and satisfy a customers overall needs. Friendly relationships among coworkers, yet remained professional."
good,"meeting people,every day is different. travel all over the north side of brisbane.the hardest part is quoting. the pleasure is to leave with the customer happy."
good,"As a Sales Associate I helped customers find items that they were looking for, and offered suggestions on articles of clothing that they may be interested in. I ensured that each clothing table looked presentable, refolding and stacking clothes throughout the duration of my shift, and put clothes back on the floor after customers were finished trying on different items. I also worked at the cash register ensuring that customers were checked out in a quick and efficient manner, and were sent off with a smile. I enjoyed working with my co-workers who always made work fun, and who always lent a helping hand when I needed one. My management team was always willing to answer any questions that I had, and made working fun rather than tedious. Whenever my managers needed me to work extra shifts or help with shipment I never hesitated to offer my time. Trying to do half a dozen things at once while on the floor was difficult and it took some time before I found a rhythm and flow that I slid into, but my co-workers and managers had enough patience to walk me through everything that needed to be done, and offer advice on how to work more efficiently. I was more than lucky to work in an environment that was both demanding yet fun, no matter what time of the day or what part of the year."
good,Express was very diverse in culture. Met new people and I learned new things. I did not have any complaints on express ever.
good,"A typical work day will consist of learning what new item had arrive and in your mind already assuming the sale. learn to work great in a friendly team environment. Management was great everyone was friendly. Hardest part of the job was sometime having to do night stock. most enjoyable was to be able help customer looking for outfit whether it was a wedding, a party or just a casual wear."
good,"A typical day at work I would stay in my designated area and greet every customer as they walked in and made sure I helped them with whatever they needed. I learned that not every customer will be satisfied with the selections available but as long as I remained polite and helped them to the best of my abilities and they were happy with my service there is a chance they would return to the store. The management and co-workers were very polite and respectful and always helped me with any problems I had. The hardest part of this job was having to leave after my designated timeframe was up, it was only a seasonal job but I wish it was temporary because it was one of my favorite employers I worked for. The most enjoyable part of the job was a customer leaving satisfied because of a service I provided directly."
good,Helping Customers and working toward sales goals is always a fun challenge.
good,"A typical day at work includes ensuring a proper presentation of the sales floor, some light cleaning, checking up on customers wants and needs, and cashiering."
good,"Co-workers are great for most part, always willing to help out and socialize with. Management seemed to always be shaky"
good,"The typical day at Express, shipment wise, starts with the shipment coming in early in the mornings, breaking down the load and getting merchandise ready for processing. Processing merchandise piece at a time in timely fashion is key and remains the longest segment of the shift. With great management and co workers we work as a team to finish processing and taking merchandise to the sales floor. Keeping every item neat and organized from the days shipment definitely is the biggest challenge of the entire process, yet in the end the most satisfying feeling I get is seeing the work the team and I accomplished in that day."
good,"I loved working at Express. From the moment I walked into the door, I knew that I was prepared to make sales and meet goals. "
good,the shoppers are always a pleasure and management is very understanding
good,"Working at Express could get fairly boring. Eventhhugh the sto re could get pretty packed quickly on a good day, many customers really didn't want or need our help, but I always had to maintain the appearance of being busy; could get hard when there really is nothing to do. My co-workers and managers were all very nice and helpful. Schedual was flexible."
good,Its a good job just need more money and benifits the management is good
good,"Truck loader unloader"
good,"I gave Express an overall rating of a four. The reason I gave Express a four is , I feel that the management could be a little more strict and the store its self could be a little cleaner than what it is. The back room espiecailly considering there is so much shipment back there that has not been gone through , you can not even get to the rest room. Not only can you not get to the restroom or the water fountain but it is also a safty hazzard. I my self have tripped over the boxes plenty of times myself. "
good,"Express is a fast paced performance based brand. Daily challenges require creativity, drive and effective execution to overcome. The hardest part of my day is maintaining the agility to react in the moment at all time, The most rewarding part of my day is the growth, development and success of my managers and associates."
good,"Typical date is in-processing a certain number of units that must go onto the sales floor. Processing includes unpacking the boxes, sensoring items and hanging items. "
good,a typical day consists of covering your assigned zone and folding and organizing clothes that become messy and out of place. assisting customers is priority and when their is down time you must stay busy cleaning your area so that it looks like it did when you opened. closing the store is the same thing must look like when you arrived. 
good,How to provide a good example for associates while providing excellent customer care.  
good,A great atmosphere with stylish individuals and shoppers. Customer service is our number one priority. Making sure we make great sales as we accomplish a great visit for the customer.
good,1.Typical Work Day
good,Express is a company that strives for associate loyalty to the brand.
good,"A typical day at Express i would come and bring in high energy to bring in the sales, suggest clothing to customers, also play the part of a stylist and dress the customer if they are indecisive or need an appeal for a special events."
good,"A typical day at Express would be arriving 10 to 15 minutes early to clock in and speak to the manager for instructions such as where you will be for the day. If on the sales floor, I had to assist all customers with any questions or merchandise. As well as making sure I get at least one store credit card open before the end of the day. If in the stockroom, I was required to process the store's incoming merchandise. I had to open the shipping boxes, remove any bags or foam protecting the merchandise, then had to attach an alarm to it and place it in the proper section of the stockroom. I got along great with both, my co-workers and the management team, very respectful and helpful at all times. The hardest part of the job was to move the incoming merchandise boxes from the main floor into the stockroom which was in the stores basement. The most enjoyable part was that managers would give you credit for your hard work."
good,Great place to work
good,A cool place to work at if youre interested in fashion.
good,"Express located on North Ave in Chicago was a great experience for styling as well as communicating with an affluent, young professional clientele. Entailed in this job, experienced associates were allowed to transfer and apply personal style to Express shoppers to create a more personal shopping experience, new style and confidence level, all while building and meeting sales goals set by management."
good,The overall job is fun and relaxing I currently work as A stock lead the JOB is exciting but the people the works for the company sucks they don't care about nobody but themselves if you have a family emergency still have to go to work and say bump what happens they don't acknowledge you're hard work or notice something is different unless it's messed up then want someone else to clean up they mess made.
good,Even if it wasn’t my first job it would have been a great first job for someone. The managers in courage the workers to reach certain goals every day.
good,People there are great and supportive. The management team helped me from the beginning all the way up to when I was promoted to manager. I highly recommend this location to anyone searching to improve their customer service skills.
good,Not enough jobs its temp agencie i was there for two years worked a year in factory and worked and year as a jantorial cleaner managments pretty good.
good,Work flow depends on time of day but usually very lax when helping customers. You learn different techniques on how to approach customers to help them with their different needs in finding clothes to wear casually or formally.
good,So its a great environment but lacks in home life balance. As a manager im supposed to have open availability. But im working more nights and i barely have time for my family while the other managers work days and have their nights with their families. I work most weekends and only get 1 weekend off a month. Supposed to get 2 Sundays but i haven't the past couple months. I barley get my requested days off.
good,It is fairly an easy job once learned but was not making a lot of hrs to pay bills but I love the job an the owners are awesome very easy to get along with an very good at explaining what to do
good,Great job to help make ends meet and be apart of fashion. Workplace culture is inviting. Your coworkers are like family. You are taught how to work and well trained.

good,"It was cool, I had a good time and liked meeting and talking to lots of people and was able to learn a lot from this experience. However after seasonal I was not provided with enough hours because it wasn't very busy therefore it was pretty boring at times."
good,Good environment to start out in. The management really works with you to help you learn. Fun place to work. Everyone is nice and welcoming. Plus it’s great to love up
good,"Productive, fun especially with a love of fashion and clothing. Management was very helpful, especially for a new inexperienced sales associate. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers and helping pick out clothes."
good,"I would readily rejoin the team at Express. The facility truly facilitated operational ease, providing a product that is flattering and fun to work with."
good,Dj niemeyer best manager ever but after she left the stores production dropped. She is one the best motivating managers ive ever had the pleasure of working for
good,"This job was one of the best jobs I've had. The management was incredible, the culture was wonderful, and I was constantly moving. The only downside was getting paid so little and short shifts. I could not work a whole lot because of school, but enjoyed it nonetheless."
good,"Express was lovely to work at. While the semi-dress code is a bit of a chore sometimes, it was fair. People were professional at Express and knew what their goals and tasks during their shifts were."
good,"I worked here for a got time as a second job. The salary was competitive and you got discounts on clothes. "
good,"busy environment with alot of one on one interaction with customers in order to provide exceptional customer service."
good,"Working at express you will help customers find clothes in the store and start up dressing rooms. You will clean out the dressing rooms by making sure all clothes are removed and put back into their spaces. You will also work cashier which includes returns, purchases, ordering online, etc. This job will help gain experience with customer service and sales. Also this will help you keep up with the latest fashion and trends!"
good,"Decent company. Retail is long hours and low pay. Express has a warm welcoming corporate culture for a giant retailer. they paid for therapy, sm and dm in my current store are very good. no complaints. Don't think this is consistent company wide"
good,abercrombie and fitch was a good. i enjoyed the company and the staff. they always made sure i was helped in all areas. they always tried to see if i wanted to advance in some area. and i developed great friendships
good,It is a very easy going job if you are looking just for something part-time. It is mainly for youth or someone not needing money. They do not offer a lot of hours but the co workers are fun. You can move up quickly to sales lead or manager in short time
good,a job if you want to look cute all the time fun when its busy extremely boring when it's not. Good management. lots of shoplifters. got paid minimum wage
good,Great place to work and express your fashion while meeting and connecting with wonderful individuals. I enjoyed the fact that you could meet a lot of different people there and that they were open to you dressing them.
good,"The work environment here is second to none. Co-workers and management are both undeniably awesome to work with. Very team oriented. However, the infrastructure of the company is very shakey, stemming from poor software development and testing."
good,"one of the best temp places i worked. they always find you work, and they keep in touch. They've got me hired on at many places."
good,"Express was a competitive work environment, where each of the managers pushed the associates to work hard and give the greatest customer experience possible."
good,Nice place to work but they hire way more people than they need and use the extra people only to fill in for people that call out. Managers find not putting you on the schedule for the entire week to be ok.
good,"I get to organize everything in the store and make sure that the store is ready to be opened in the morning. I get to interact with customers on the needs and greet them in a  friendly way. Assist them and suggest on anything they need and make sure they are provided with all the information they need to know. I love working with customers and making sure that they are happy when they leave the store. The management is good. They are open to any comments or any suggests/ problems that are in the store. There is no hard parts in this workplace. The enjoyable part is when I get to spent time with the customer and getting to help them out. At the same time, the associate I work with make me happy and we have fun working together."
good,"I really enjoy working at Express. However, the compensation of pay really deters a lot of people. It's low and often times I find myself going above and beyond and never having any compensation for it."
good,Fan and enthusiastic workplace with a great team. Greeting all customers and making sure they're helped or checked in on. Learned how to accessorize better and engage more with customers. The hardest part of the job was  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with other customers and exchanging opinions and also growing in the company.
good,"Answered calls, key claimant responses, and escalate calls, provide Spanish customer service occasionally  for a litigation client.    Made outbound calls to invite technology chiefs to trade shows in the U.S.  In 2002 and 2007 performed data entry keying demographic information and claimant choices into database at litigation firm."
good,This company has a great  schedule process for all employees and a very friendly work environment. I have learned how to better match customers for their style.
good,My role as an associate at Express was great. I was given as much time as I needed to help customers and organize the store. Before promoted to an manager I was a top associate and was allowed as much time as needed to create a positive relationship with customers.
good,"A typical day involves uncovering how much money is expected to make for day for each segment. Chatting in with the manager on duty about promotions and expectations for the shift(s). Depending on the day, there may be tasks that are done in between customers if it's a slower day. It can be a very fast-paced environment, but overall it's a pretty fun place to work."
good,They are very helpful finding you the right job. I had a blast working for them. It takes a while for them to get a hold of them. But overall great job.
good,"A typical day includes making personal connections with guests in order to further help them find everything they need. In order to find what they need, you learn the likes/dislikes of the person, what type of occasion it is and what clothing appropriate based on the occasion. While helping guests, you also have to maintain the store and make sure it is clean and organized. I've learned how to sell clothes based on current sales and how to connect with guests on a more personal level. The management is very friendly and passionate about their jobs and the co-workers are just the same. The hardest part of the job is making sure you're helping every guest, even if that means not finishing the task at hand. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people find items that they are in love with, especially when they were struggling to find something from other places. There is no better feeling than knowing you have helped someone who didn't think they would be able to find something for the wedding or the dance etc."
good,Very hectic and demanding like all retail jobs. Can be something productive f you show motivation and initiative. You can find very good friends there. Mangers are understandable.
good,There management there was extremely friendly and always had good vibes. They were also helpful. The co-workers were nice and friendly as well. The hardest part of my job there was that I had to stand up for so long without more than one break. The most enjoyable part of my job was opening the packages and putting there where they needed to be.
good,"• Styling- Special projects"
good,"A typical work day includes:"
good,"Great management team, great co workers, we all worked together as a great team."
good,"On a typical day you engage with moret than one clients so multitasking is require, so one minute you're answering a question and then are move to the cash wrap. Its a fast environment."
good,Upbeat place to work! Great for early adults to grow in management.
good,"Typically, shifts are 3 to 4 and half hours a day. In a week, it is likely to be scheduled 12-15 hours. Its great if you are looking for something part time to go with your school schedule. The managers are very flexible as long as you show up to work and do your job. I have never had a problem with another associate. Everyone gets along for the most part."
good,"It's your average retail experience, but with fun co-workers and is fast to get a grasp on procedures. The hardest part is of course being on your feet for 4+ hours."
good,"Greet hundreds of customers. Basically, work every position possible at one job. Cashier, fitting rooms, greeter, cleaning, stock room, inventory, you name it. You work with great people. Very hip."
good,Working for express is a true pleasure I enjoy my job and I've been able to grow with express since I started back in 2008.
good,"A typical day at work would include me selling, and helping people find a professional attire for work, job interviews, or just a casual outfit for a date. I attend to all customer needs, and assist customers as much as I can to provide them with a great in store experience. I do also work the cash register so I spend about 30% of my day at the cash register. I handle angry and upset customers with a very professional manner. I learn how to talk to people, and I also learn to deal with multiple people at a time without getting overwhelmed. I get along with all of my co-workers, we are one big family. I think the most challenging part of my day would be closing the store. It takes a great deal of time to close the store and get it ready for the next day. Overall I like helping others and making sure they have a great in store experience so they come back."
good,"In my time with Express, the employee culture is adamant about prioritizing store appearance and customer service. The employee culture is nice and friendly. Flexible hours and an overall good company to work for. The management is well structured and orderly. Most difficult part of the job is really maintaining the decorum of the store while still interacting with customers, which is still relatively manageable. It is very rewarding to help our customers find what they truly need when entering the store."
good,A typical day at work would be tending to customer needs at the fitting room and suggesting clothes and then being the cashier also. I've learned different fashion styles. The management was very organized and my co-workers were friendly and awesome to be around. There wasn't anything I found too hard. The most enjoyable part is being around people and helping them out.
good,Would get to work and clean up the stock room. Would put items in there place on the sale floor. Put sales thicket on items.
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet customers as they com into the store. I help them shop for anything they are looking for and suggest any clothes them might be interested in. In-between helping customers, I help keep the store looking neat, tidy, and organized by properly folding the shelves and tables of clothing."
good,"Some days I would open up the store by counting the drawer, making sure the store was neat and clean, and then opening the doors. I would help customers with purchases and help them find sizes as well as help put outfits together. I would sometimes help close the store by figuring out percentages of sales for associates and stores, counting final days drops, and by following the managers to the bank on occasions to make the money drops. I would also help tidy up the store for the following day."
good,"-great environment with friendly employees"
good,"I enjoy all the diverse jobs that I am able to do with Express. I also work for very friendly and great people so that is an extra bonus! the only draw back with this, is that there are times when I am off for 3 and 4 days...making inconsistant work weeks."
good,"Company demands a lot with sales numbers and even with processing stocked merchandise in the back, but quarterly meetings with positive talk, free gifts, and great discount opportunities lets you know you are appreciated."
good,"Busy location, worked black Friday here which kept me on my toes for the day pretty intensely. The only problem I had with this job is the lack of hours I was scheduled to work from the get-go, but the supervisors here were all extremely friendly and personable, eager to help those around them succeed."
good,I love Express! The only bad part id the work life balance. When you are in the SM position you become over worked
good,"I enjoyed working for express, the employees were mostly very nice and helpful. They helped to make folding clothes and dealing with customers much easier and enjoyable."
good,i was there only 3 months i like that.i work in plastic one by their help
good,My typical day for express would be fast paced with hundreds of people coming in and out of the store looking for a new set of threads to add to their wardrobe. Spend a lot of time keeping your hands busy with tedious chores such at folding and clean up in-between customers. Learned to meet the customers needs and make the experience enjoyable. The other employees and management were splendid people that help to create a positive atmosphere. the hardest part is finding the time to fold all of the laundry in-between customers so the store can remain clean for others walking in or by.
good,"A typical day at Express is alway's mysterious. I would usually come in to do freight which is the only thing i was familiar with after working 2 months as a sales associate there. I really enjoyed working freight which some co-workers seemed puzzled to understand. They would always say i'm happy when i come into work and i always seem to not waste time. Sometimes i lose track of time and work right through my lunch because of how much i enjoy it. The hardest part of my job is probably having a deadline as to how much freight i should have proccessed in an hour, which is 112 units (items). I know to work my hardest which always makes me achieve my goal. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all my co-workers that i have a good bond with. We always know how to make work more enjoyable which is what i love about a job. One of my managers requested that i should get associate of the month in the region to her boss. Her boss then selects which person out of the 10 candidates should be associate of the month. Surprisingly, she chose me. When i received the call from her telling me i got associate of the month, i was speechless, but really happy. Probably one of the best news i have ever gotten!"
good,I really enjoy working at Express. I like assisting customers with their shopping arranging the clothes. All of my co workers are very nice and helpful. I've learned how to be a cashier at this job. I used to work at Express back in 2000 until 2003. They rehired me in 2011. Some of the same people in management are still employed there. It is a good job to advance in.
good,I enjoy working for this company. The benefits are excellent as well. For it to be a temp services the benefits packages are excellent. I enjoyed working as a banquet server for the few times I did work.
good,i love dealing with all the customers and helping them find exactly what they are looking for and make them feel good about their purchases
good,"Created schedule based on associates availability, as well as sales plans."
good,"learned knowledge in customer service, brand, being receptive to coaching"
good,"Working at Express means a lot of great days that tend to be focused on personal selling and maintaining great relations with customers. It is a hard working job, that requires me to be on my toes every second of the day. This great working environment helps me to achieve great results and enhance my working opportunity for the betterment of my future."
good,The management team is really invested in you but unfortunately you are expendable to corporate. The company is publicly traded so their profits for investors are their first priority. You’ll learn a lot at this company if you keep asking and use the tools. The customers and fellow workers were the best part of the job. If you’re willing to relocate you can advance pretty easily.
good,I like the diversity of indeeds job offering s. Indeed has been very helpful to me. They're employment opportunities are great. Working for express agency has been a good experience for me.
good,"If you're working part-time do holiday season only, shifts start getting scarce after once the holidays are over. Very flexible hours if you make sure to ask two weeks in advance. Nice benefits, 50% of store merchandise."
good,I worked for express for a little over two years. In those two years I was promoted to a stylist and giving more responsibility. However I did feel that my leadership skills were higher than my peers who were promoted over me. I showed genuine interest in working there and I become close with all of my coworkers as they made working there a great environment to be in!
good,"I loved working there, but unfortunately after new management arrived they started to cut hours and gave more hours to the managers favorite. I ended up working 4 hours a week at some point."
good,Express is a good company to work for however the store's environment is solely dependent on the team leading the store. Some managers are strong leaders who teach their team and lead them to success and other managers who depend on their title.
good,"Express is a fun atmosphere, all of us are like family and get along for the most part. Management is pretty good, a bit of favoritism but overall work is pleasant, fun, on demand, strong product knowledge is a must. I would recommend this company."
good,They give work but not based on the type of experience you have its more so based on the type of work they have available. I just feel like they are just trying to get their cut
good,"Tyson's Express is a pretty good place to work. Management is friendly and will answer any of your questions. Training is comprehensive, but there are a few areas that need shoring up such as taking calls for order and other inquiries. New employees can negotiate salary with management upon hire. Associates are often given breaks between shifts as well as lunch hours. Working hours are set by employees, so managing your personal life and working at Tyson's Express is easy."
good,"Express is a great place to work, it's a good environment, you learn a lot of good skills such as social skills as an example. But, working as part time the pay just is not enough."
good,it'll suck you in and you won't get out and the pay sucks. The environment is okay though. I like my coworkers. Heavy emphasis on opening credit cards.
good,it is a structured coaching type of environment depending on the managers. At times there seems to be little advancements or unfair advancements within the company it seems like a popularity contest insteade of actions
good,Typical day at work consisted of helping customers create the perfect outfit for whatever occasion they were shopping for. It made it made because you can let your creative side flow.
good,This was a job i had in high school which was good at the time for people who need part time job with very average pay. Would not make this a primary source of income.
good,"Sales, promoting new products, store organization and maintenance"
good,"good company, people are easy to get along with and are helpful. days are aren't very long, just depends on what the project needs at the time. this could include working weekends."
good,"This was my first retail experience and thankfully I enjoyed it very well. The culture of the company does have a warmth to it, you will also learn a lot about communication and you'll be working closely with management so you can also have a chance to show your skills."
good,Great people when I was working their pretty good pay. Good benefits when you are a manger and you get paid weekly. The customers that come in are wonderful.
good,I only worked here for seasonal. It was a nice change in pace from my full-time job. Felt rewarding helping customers & all employees were really nice & helpful to me. Loved the fast pass because your time flew by. Loved the fact that you could dress down & wear jeans as long as it was company attire. Great opportunity for growth & is encouraged.
good,They are good place they help find jobs they text u about different opportunity's daily very nice atmosphere inside the office I mean they really work with you
good,"It's your typical 9-5 job, except with the perks of great customer involvement. It's a very social job and you get the ability to express yourself  through your clientele and your clothes. You will learn patience, great customer service skills, organization, time management, telephone etiquette, group work, register functions, and a great deal more. Management depends on your location and team, however my experience has been pretty consistent across the board. Good training for their management team on leading the staff."
good,Nice place to work and learn. I learn a lot of thing since i work here. The way they manage the store is very good. Managers know what they are doing. I feel like im having fun at work and enjoy it
good,"As a sales associate I work with customers and help them with items they need. Suggest items is big, also product knowledge, maintaining store standards and working closely with the team is a must for the store to meet each goal."
good,"As someone who has never worked retail before in their lives, I can say Express has been good to me. I've been in food jobs all my life but once everything about retail, I've learned its not that bad."
good,"It is a fun place to work, and I was able to move into a management position fairly quickly. However, I feel underappreciated at times and the company focused too much on ""pushy"" sales rather than assisting the customers with there needs."
good,"Express is a nice place to work at, and the management is knowledgeable, and willing to work with their employees. I've mainly been a sales associate, but also a cashier in the time I was there. I do enjoy working at express and company loyalty is something I believe in, but unfortunately, the pay is too low for staying to be a viable option. Express did teach me about how be an efficient cashier, a good sales associate, and deliver exceptional customer service."
good,Express is one of the many retail companies that I have personally worked for that is a great company to start off at. Worked the ladder as an associate to a sales leader manager. They're a great company with trendy and stylish merchandise/products. With some great leaders and mentors.
good,Met and worked with some great people and it made working fun. Management was also great and treated associates fairly. Hours were given out fairly to who worked hard.
good,this is a very good job to work  if you have a family then this the place for you very flexible the only problem is too many chiefs and not enough Indians but also has awesome team mates who are eager to help people become employed.
good,"Great Company, Great pay, lack of hours after the holidays "
good,My employment with this company was for only a few months but I learned quite a bit and really enjoyed my time there. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable with training and helping new staff members. The management was friendly and they all started from the bottom of the hiring process as well so they knew exactly how to do everything in the store. all staff had to do the same things in the store so you was trained in all positions if there was a call out you knew exactly how to cover someone else shift.
good,Working at Express has given me the skills that I didn't think I would obtain. It has allowed me to grow as a leader while still being able to have fun at work. Great place to start a career in retail.
good,"I greeted the customers with a smile."
good,"I loved working at express and helping people wardrobe themselves, I love developing people and taking them to the next level, I found enjoyment in having a goal and striving for not only meeting it, but exceeding it!  On a typical day, I would set the direction for the store and then motivate everyone in that direction and do continuous touch basis with the staff to find out their needs and see what I can help them with to achieve the store goals!  i  was a training manager with in the district, training was always as very important piece of the puzzle for me, my most enjoyable moments was watching my staff hit an ah ha moment.  sometimes i felt as if the senior management wouldn't listen to our ideas, which was frustrating as it had been several years since they had four walls to be accountable for or if ever, i would try to explain the practicalities of the business and ways that i felt we could troubleshoot it!"
good,I've learned a lot working at express on being a sales associate and then rising up to be a sales lead to coach and train others on how to become better sales associates and how they can work their way up to become managers
good,Everyone just seems happy and proud to work at this company.  Very easy and enjoyable job which explains the low compensation.  Management is very caring.  The corporation as a whole seems to really appreciate their people.
good,"nice friendly hard working atmosphere, fast pace and a group effert to get the job done. shipped and received freight and got it out on time. the hardest part was it was so hot in there,but the etra breaks made it better"
good,"Self employed, organising and coordinating deliveries."
good,"A typical day at work sure becomes interesting. Managed to execute all responsibilities/ work smoothly. "
good,"Usually no more than 6 hours a day, help with marketing and visual standards, management is pretty fresh and they all contribute so much towards the store. Co-workers are great and what I enjoy the most is being taught more about visual standards."
good,"First and foremost setting the tone for the day, including sales goals and promotions. Establish a exciting environment for both associates and customers."
good,"Fun work place. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. Great way to meet new people and also make your self healthy an learn new things about yourself there."
good,"The culture I have experienced at Express has been quite enjoyable. I have worked for the company as a Sales Associate for an extended period of time and have seen management and the staff change a few times, which has mad it a fun and new experience each time. I have had to adapt, albeit not to hard situations, very frequently as the management does take getting use to, though they are wonderful. The clientele is also something that takes adapting to as each day is quite different, though I believe it is supported by management to make our time working fun while also meeting goals."
good,Very rewarding and fun to work at. On either day i would be in the floor greeting or helping customers or on the cashier taking care of customers needs.
good,"Working at Express typically calls for a five hour shift between 2-4 days a week. I have learned all of the components of retail from selling merchandise, processing shipments of inventory, to conducting floor sets. Management has always been very friendly and understanding. They always go out of their way to accommodate the needs of their employees when truly needed. There has never been moments of miscommunication or difficulties between me and my co-workers. Everyone is friendly and is family oriented. The hardest pert of the job for me has been the change between scheduling from the beginning of the year to the spring. It has been hard compensating when being only scheduled mostly two days per week."
good,"Express is a good place to go if you are looking for a job.  The staff are courteous and willing to answer any and all questions you may have.  After completing my application, they called me within that week and I started for Americold Logistics."
good,"A typical day would be opening, doing our opening routine which would include sweeping, dusting and cleaning throughout the entire store. Greeting customers that would come in and telling them about our promos. Assisting them if they need help with a size or particular item they are looking for. I learned that being responsible for a whole store isn't as easy. You have to make sure your sale associates know what they are doing and making sure they are doing it correctly."
good,Express is a place where you can be yourself. The work culture is very welcoming and motivating. The store manager is flexible with school schedules and other job schedules. I think the most enjoyable part of this job for me is that I get a chance to build relationships with the customers and in return their trust in me to wardrobe them.
good,"A typical day at work involves coming in and getting up-to-date on company results, district results, and store results, then going out to the floor and performing basic duties: leading the team in segments to optimum selling behaviors, coaching, and exhibiting great customer service. Working for Express has taught me how to work in a fast-paced environment and finding a balance between coaching a team to success and focusing on customers at the same time. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer service issues, but the most enjoyable part of the job is creating a relationship with customers to make them want to come back and shop with you instead of another retailer."
good,"The company is specifically focused on team work. As a manager, my job is to place my associates in the right area of the store to ensure that our sales goal will be met."
good,"Co-workers are nice, managements do their jobs for the most part, discounts are OK"
good,"Typical day include, opening the store (or closing), greeting customers and providing excellent customer service, leading your team to drive sales performance. "
good,"Despite retail hours such as early mornings, late nights and weekends, this is a good place to work.  I aspire to be in the fashion industry one day and I have learned a lot about fashion business through my time working here."
good,My experience at express has been a good one. They put on on jobs that allow you to learn various skills to help you in future jobs. My negatives about the jobs are they don't compensate me enough for my daily living. And some of the jobs are a long way to travel. But I do appreciate the experience between the different forms of employment.
good,This was a fun place to work with great people to work with! I would recommend working at this fun company.
good,"shipment with clothing and jewelry, folding clothes, customer service"
good,Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. I never had any trouble finding people to help if i had any questions. All the physicians at the job sites were nice and social. I felt very comfortable in there work setting.
good,"A typical day at work at Express could be anything from breaking down and rebuilding a denim wall (folding and sorting jeans), to processing the incoming shipments of clothing and jewelry. Everyone is involved with customer service, and everyone is out on the sales floor at some point during a shift."
good,This was a fast paced and continually changing environment. This company helped me to develop and grow as a merchandiser and as a manager.
good,"Ingreso a la 06:00 control de stock, control de planillas de reparto, carga de mercaderia en el utilitario, control de remito y reparto a los comedores. "
good,"I love the working invironment and most of the people I work with. My only regret is that the hours are nowhere near close to being considered part time. Ive learned how to effectively stock and code items to either be placed on the floor or in the stock room. Sizing and folding (zoning) all of your typical retail duties. The communication between management and employess has been a much better experience than my former jobs. The hardest part of about my job is just not having enough hours, thats my only complaint. I love working in the stockroom tagging clothing and just conversing with the other employees. Its professional but laid back and it keeps me busy. No idle."
good,"I love the people I work with, the manager is super nice and has a good positive attitude. Only negative thing I have to say is that they don't pay me enough for the work I do. Getting minimum wage for serious work, not that worth it. The discount on clothes isn't the best either, it's still expensive and it's just better to buy the clothes with coupons rather than with the associate discount."
good,very nice energy nice worker learned to work in groups very well set up manager always came and talk to us
good,"Depending on appointments which i receive by text message or conversation with the consultants at Express, with details of appointment addresses and type of visit. I arrange my day to ensure I am able to be at the destination with time to prepare myself. I conduct myself in a professional manner and work with both the client and the professional in translating the conversation of the meeting. Usually the meetings last one hour or can be longer. On one occasion this lasted 3 days when I went with social workers to Poland. The main things I learn in my role is to remain professional, courteous and adapt to each situation. The hardest part of the job is the scale of travelling over the west midlands area depending on the amount of visits that day. I find co-workers who I only really speak to on the telephone helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part of my job is being in a position to help, everyday meeting new people and having the opportunity how different sectors such as NHS, Schools,  GP's, Social workers work and carry out their roles and learning about the system."
good,Express is a good place to work at. Friendly associates and good management team. Sometimes the schedule is to unreliable. It is a bit overwhelming sometimes especially during holiday season.
good,"Get ready to work holidays, weekends, and nights. Long floorsets and sale set-ups."
good,"A typical day at Express includes, sales to customers throughout the day or doing floorset which includes designing the store when there are sales changes. I learned how to design a window and overcame my fear of a latter. My co-workers when excellent team builders. The hardest part of the job was making sure customers were all taken care of and satisfied while making sure the store stayed organized and clean. I enjoyed cashier rap."
good,"a typical day at work is re hanging clothing, applying sensors, running credit, and organizing clothing. i learned how to properly use my time on my organizing and selling skills. my management were always there in any situation i was in. my coworkers were also very helpful on explaining things in further detail. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with fashion and the lifestyle. the most enjoyably part was helping someone find that perfect outfit."
good,"A typical day at work greeting customers,helping customers coordinate the perfect outfits, management was awesome, the most enjoyable part of the job meeting new people and helping customers."
good,Ever changing and fast paced retail environment geared towards customer satisfaction
good,They put you to work fast. Pay isn't that great but it leads you to land a full time job.
good,Express is a great first place to work when being introduced to clothing. From the beginning they teach different ways to sell and how to utilize customer service from the best of your abilities.Also the closing is very long on weekends
good,"An upbeat workplace, the managers are very friendly and helpful as well as the other associates that I work with. So far everything has been wonderful !"
good,"Working with EXPRESS was very fun, and excellent learning experience. You learn how to balance, both customers and job tasks effortlessly in time. Co-workers were very friendly and supportive, and gladly assisted when needed. Management was very helpful, and instructive, and never dogmatic. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting to help the customers with excellent customer service and helping them choose which merchandise was best for them. It was also very assuring when management acknowledges that your doing an excellent job. Overall EXPRESS is a great and wonderful company for an exceptional learning experience."
good,"Fashion forward company. Strong focus on training tools, to educate associates about the merchandise. Customer service orientated. Continuous promotional changes and visual merchandise placement. Effective communication from upper management."
good,"The culture was a great environment to work in during the last seven years of my career. I have learned a lot across all functions of retail, and had many learning opportunities."
good,Overall the job position and the coworkers I work with are good. There will be days where things get difficult and I don’t want to be there or work. But over all I get the job done and I make sure to uphold all the policies and principals and I get along well with the customers.
good,"My time at Express was amazing and I can only think of all the good things. The team was collaborative and helpful and we had a strong bonding. Retail is a challenging industry as things are never stable, so it always kept us on top of our toes to excel and perform better in every quarter. Mobile App was the most profitable source of earning for express when I left and it makes me feel proud that my team was the best."
good,"I’ve worked here for quite a while, it was enjoyable. Of course there’ll be some days where it’s bad and some days that are good. There’ll be some managers that’ll treat you good and other managers that’ll mistreat you. In my point of view, I feel that they’re 2-Faced, they try to act all nice with you and hype you up but in reality they probably just faking it. Other than that I hate that all they talk about is “Credit cards” everytime in your headset all you would hear is “I need credit guys! CREDIT CREDIT CREDIT!!” I totally disliked that but oh well."
good,Working at express gave me the opportunity to engage with customers and ensure their experience in the store was efficient and enjoyable. Workload is manageable.
good,"My co-workers are fabulous! They make working there fun, and also getting that feeling after you have helped a customer never gets old. My favorite thing is to help people, and whenever I work, I get to do that with some of my favorite people!"
good,Good place. They treat you well.  a lot of work but the most important thing is that everyone knows their position at work and you also know what their role is.  all organized doing a great job
good,express works with you and they're friendly. Never had problems with them. always call me when they needed help fill in vacant spots. I hope to keep working for them.
good,The work is great and the people are friendly. All you do is unload recalled vehicles off of a train and park them so that they are ready to be taken and parked somewhere else. When you're not doing that you're at a golf course doing landscaping.

good,Everyday is different depending on the traffic of people coming into the store. As employees we must be quick to assess customer needs and execute them in a timely manner. which i believe helped hone my time management skills.
good,"The environment can be stressful at times. However the associates I work with make it a lot more fun. Our department specifically ensures to have ""Fun Day's"" at least every 3 -6 months, which allows us to get out of the office and have a day of fund with everyone. We also do a lot of volunteer work which is always fun to participate in."
good,The people at Express I enjoy them a lot. Flexible hours for me so I can See my wife more. The pay was great and the customers wasnt rude at all sometime.

I love meeting other people to make to make new friends and I learned a lot specially talking to the people who have more knowledge about my work. and I am open minded person as long as it is good I learn to accept it and I love to work specially when the management is good. and fair enough to the employees and I easily coop up in my surroundings. for me there is no hard job as long long as you know your job well and you know how to manage it everything will be alright . for me the most enjoyable part of the job is when work is fine, bosses are good and make new friends.. enjoying everyday and the most enjoyable part of the job is when you love your job and the people surround you."
good,Definitely was a good experience. Allows you to interact with many customers daily ever few minutes to improve your social and job skills. Fun workplace and the professional attire is great.
good,Great job for teens. Managers are usually flexible about scheduling. Great employee discount and great starting pay. CEO visits regularly and says hi or makes a purchase. Well organized store.
good,express is a job that's ok to have out of high school but is really not a job in which you can have any sort of financial stability however if you are in management its a little better
good,Express provides a great work environment. The management strives on team work and are very goal driven. With that mindset and the consistent assistance from the associates goals and planned sales are easy to acheive.
good,learning about how the business flows inside a store is quite intriguing especially when when you gotta hustle to make the flow going through. Learning the basic roles of this store is not that hard at all which interacting with the customer without being a robot and  getting to a person's needs in a matter of seconds.

good,"good."
good,A normal day at express was filled with orders taken by costumers and trying to persuade them toperchase our merchandise. The work place was a upbeat tempo.
good,This place was awesome because the workers would train you in all the areas and they would switch jobs duties just so the work load would be equal. The supervisor always encouraged us to apply for higher positions within the company.  The company gave us popcorn every friday and gave us a meal every month.

The hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with difficult customers, but the most enjoyable part would be helping others."

good,Express was an awesome part-time job for the holiday season. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and especially enjoyed the customers I met.
good,"Do various work like refolding cloths, processing costumer transactions, and processing shipment. Hardest part of the job is staying positive and happy when customers are giving employees a hard time. The best part of the job is how great the employees and managers are."

good,My Management Team Was Awesome!! They Were Very Understanding To The Staff Personal Lives & They Never Judged Us Or Talked Down To Us. My Co-Workers Were The Bomb The Only Issue I Have Is The Pay No One Can Live Off Of 8.50Hr Or 2-3 Days Of Work.
good,I learned so much customer service experience working here for only a short amount of time. Management is so supportive and encouraging along with coworkers. The hardest part of the job is when there is a rush of customers at one time. I enjoy my job because I love the work environment and the generous employee discount helps keep up my wardrobe!
good,"A typical day at Express starts with us clocking it. Once thats done, the manager tells us the deals and promotions for the day. My responsibility was to greet customers and also provide them with any help and product knowledge they needed. Working there, I learned that every customer has a different need and want and all they want is to be treated well and with attention.

good,"As a stylist, when I got into work I would go directly to the fitting rooms. If it was a mess I would have to fold and hang clothes and organize it to where it had to go in the store. If I had ""runners"" they would be the people to take the clothes and put it away in the store for me. If not I would have to do that. I would knock on the doors and ask the customers how they were doing and if they needed a different size or anything. My job was to add on to sales and promote the deals we had going on. For example, if jeans were buy 1 get one 50% off and tank tops are 30% off I would suggest another pair of jeans for 50% and throw in another tank top in a different color. It was a good job because I had to multi task some days between keeping the fitting rooms clean, assisting customers, as well as training new associates some days. The hardest part of the job was dealing with those really busy days with difficult customers, but in time you learn how to calm down an angry customer so the situation does not escalate."
good,"I greeted customers upon entrance. I handled all cash and credit transactions. Assisted all customers regarding store promotions and orders. The hardest part of the job but also what I learned from the most would be dealing with customers that had a bad experience. I learned how to help provide them with what they needed/wanted. Also was able to train new hires and teach them about the stock room, sales floor and the register."

good,"Have to work fast and get use to it. Pretty easy job to get use too. Fun meeting new customers and making sales.A typical day at work wold be making sales, cash register duties, cleaning up. Isn't really much things hard in this job, but if I had to choose one, I would choose working until closing and folding everything."

good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers when they walk in, asking if they're looking for anything specific and helping them if they need or want it. Going around organizing and refolding clothes on the table, and ringing up customers. What I learned from working at Express is to be more organized and being more experienced with handling money, and also customer service. The most difficult park of the job is trying to help angry customers needing something we don't have, and trying to do my best to get what they want. The most enjoyable is working with lots of others who have such different personalities and also helping customers who are wanting your help."
good,"Working 40 hours per week"

good,Great job keeps you busy. and dedicated to the growth of the company
good,"A typical day at work involved coming in on time, organize clothes and display items so all was ready for opening up the store at the beginning of the day. Greeting the customers, attending to their needs, and building a loyal customer base were some of my duties as well. I would also help in the dressing room areas, counting clothing items brought into the dressing rooms, helping the customer with opinions and suggestions as they tried on items, and returning items left in the dressing rooms to the sales floor. Inventory and returns were a couple other duties I had. I also had to be sure to only impress, and not impose the product on the customer."
good,"the environment was fun, upbeat, positive, and goal orientated. I learned how to provide exceptional customer service. Management was PHENOMENAL 100% supportive especially with growth opportunities. Hardest part of the job was obtaining more hours when I first started, everything else was great!"
good,"the management is really good, I really enjoyed helping out customers"
good,"Can be a very exciting place to work as long as you do your part and are self-sufficient. They give you a chance to prove yourself without breathing heavy down your neck to engage with customers and find your nitch. And if you don't take advantage of that opportunity they wont hesitate to replace you, but the good part is if you do exceed expectations they do recognize it as they did with me. Have to be a out going person to work with this company. Express is a very colorful brand and they expect their associates personalities to match."
good,While employed with Express learned a lot with them and took a lot of their culture and values with me.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, viewing my daily tasks, and performing my daily duties. As a sales associate excellent communication is the key to succeeding at this job. I usually start my day by greeting the customers very cheerfully and informing them on the store promotions as they enter the store. Throughout my entire shift I assist them with whatever they need while making sure the floor is organized and clean. The diversity within the workplace is very beneficial. I love connecting with people of different cultures and races. Working in a fast pace environment was quite a hassle at first but eventually I got the hang of it. It taught me how to multi task and deal with constant changes. I enjoyed the nice atmosphere and ""family"" attitude of the team members. Managers are very welcoming, sociable and straight forward. My coworkers are very helpful when I need help. The most difficult yet most rewarding part of the job is when an unhappy customer is satisfied at the end of the sale. For the most part I enjoy working for Express because I learn something new every day. The meeting of new people has to be the most fulfilling but also reaching my short-term goals and gaining recognition for my excellent services."
good,"l depends where your working,can be fun or just a job.to be professional about it.sometimes u dont meet management.lets just say some characters.just getting to get trained right.when the bell rings."
good,A typical work day at Express was very laid back in the stock room but hectic out on the sales floor.
good,Express is on of the best jobs I had so far when it comes to managment. The managers are really there for us employees and have an open door policy. This job has taught me how to communicate more and better with customers because we are always talking to customers. It also taught hoe to becomes a sales associate. This is my first job as a sales associate in a retail enviroment and I love it. My primary position is the cash wrap because I have alot of experience as a cashier. My favoriite part of my job is helping the customers and making sure they are satisfied and happy so they can come back to shop. I like the cash wrap because the cashier usually have the final input on the customers and its my job to make their overall experience great.
good,The culture was one of excitement. The majority of the persons that worked for the organization enjoyed being there. It was extremely diverse which added taste and flavor to the company.
good,"A very team based job, everyone has a responsibility to do their part. Everyone is treated fairly and is assisted by each other, although in a fast paced work environment it is eased with the team morals."
good,When walking in they were kind and helped me with whatever I asked for. They immediately interviewed me and told me my job options. I told them what I was looking for and they helped me choose the best possible option.
good,Working in express was liberating and educational. I learned about how to present outfit ideas to customers and how to close a sale. Reaching the goals was the way I made my mark there.
good,"Its a good job once you've learned the system and become a reliable employee in the company, which I've done. It pays good but the hours are not enough to sustain a normal lifestyle after work. Thats why I'm here. Thank you"
good,"Es gente que te ayuda cuando se presenta la oprtunidad , son amables y te buscan trabajo de acuerdo a tu perfil, hay personal de habla Hispana te sientes mejor"
good,"Though retail can be a bit daunting and, working at the Express store located at the Barton Creek Mall in Austin, Tx. was a nice experience. The management is incredibly understanding, yet they know how to get the best out of their employees."
good,"Express does a great job of developing associates to become great sellers, or advance into their next job.  You learn skills and the job enables you to break out of your shell and learn to interact with strangers and build that associate/customer relationship through engagement with Express' techniques.  There are many ways to advance in the company and the skills you learn will be valuable in the future."
good,Express coached me on many work basics and then some. The company afforded many chances for promotions and added responsibilities. Most locations focused on team building which added to the work environment in a positive way.
good,Working there was very intresting. I was able to work the schedule I wanted. It was a lot of work to do during your scheduled times. I will say that the company is all about its customers.

good,"Typical retail sales environment, wonderful staff and plenty of room for independent thinking. Input is valued, room for growth, good company to work for if looking for sales/retail experience."
good,"I nly stay at my job because my managers are great. I think that the fact that one or two items is equivalent to one shift of work sucks. If i was either paid more or had a better discount then It would be worth staying. If my managers leave, I'm leaving too."
good,you had to learn how to engage customers and be very friendly. Fast paced and its a job that if youre really into it. you will go really far. i loved my time there.
good,"Express made sure that their customers had the best experience as possible as soon as they walked into the store. A typical day consisted of putting the clothing stock out, straightening up, but the most important thing of the day was to make sure we took care of the customers and made them feel like they were home. The hardest part of the job was learning how to sell things to the customers because before hand I never had to do that but once I learned it came natural. It was a fun job though because while selling our clothing to the customers I got to learn their interests and everything they liked."
good,"Express helped me find a good job, that paid well, and i enjoyed. They are very helpful in answering your questions, and understand if you are having problems and just want full or part time."
good,"• Achieved status as a top sales performer and top credit performer."
good,I loved working for this company they treat their workers with respect and like a team. The management is phenomenal they like to make you laugh and they are the reason that I am looking forward to the next season of racing.
good,"En esta empresa aprendí muchas cosas como el vestir maniquíes, reposición de prendas, asesorar a clientas al elegir .una prenda. El ambiente era bueno , a veces cansado por la cantidad de personas que entraban a la tienda , pese a ello valía la pena ademas el salario era muy bueno. El trato con colegas era bueno a veces algo tenso pero fácil de solucionar."
good,"I truly enjoy being part of a wonderful team. The communication between the staffing agency and the employees is great, and there hours are flexible."
good,"A typical day on the job at Express is selling merchandise to customers, keeping brand and image of the store neat and tidy, friendly competition with your coworkers, and embracing opportunities to grow. I learned how to handle the ""good"" and the ""bad"" customer situations, the responsibilities of being in charge of a multi-million dollar store (i.e. payroll, training new associates, communicating with other stores and the district manager). It is very easy to move up in this company if you visibly out forward the hard work necessary for advancement. The promotions are extremely rewarding in this company and make coming into work that much more enjoyable."
good,"Productive and educational work space"
good,"The management team takes a proactive approach at guiding the store associates through proper sales techniques and providing overall excellent customer service.  As a store associate, your duties will include uncovering a customer's needs to determine the best products for them, operating the cash registers in a streamline and efficient manner, cleaning the store on a daily basis, and keeping up to date with product knowledge and projecting the brand in a positive and relevant light."
good,I learned that the managers at express were very hard workers and took pride in there job. I had a lot of fun there it was and experience I wont forget.
good,"Everyday involved helping others resolve a personal need or problem for various attire issues.  I am known for my customer service skills and truly enjoyed teaching numerous younger fellow employees proper customer service techniques."
good,If you are a single individual with no kids this may be the perfect lifestyle for you
good,"A typical day at this job would be packing vials, its very time consuming and requires you to be on your A-game."
good,"Once the day start and after reviewing all the results and checking the schedule for whom I have working. Zone out each associate and setting their goals.Do a touch base with each manager for the tasks that needed to be completed daily,weekly and Monthly. Strategy the day out. "
good,Learned a lot about retail work. Folded a lot of clothes and learned a lot about costumer service and helping customers .
good,"Going into my major I was told that I need a set amount of hours of experience in retail. I went to a career fair at college and got a job at my hometown Express. My first day was Black Friday. I was so nervous about working in a retail setting. Before working here I didn't have as much confidence in myself or in my communication skills. I wasn't shy, but I didn't know how to approach as well as others. That first day of work, needless to say, didn't go so well from my perspective. I was too quite when speaking, fumbled with words, and was too scared to approach customers. Now after working there for so long I can now say that I love talking to others. I listen to what those customers want and interact in an easy social setting. I am more confident with speaking and communicating with others. I like approaching others and am not afraid. These skills I have learned I carried over into my job as a server."
good,"A typical day at work would be come in and nine, but we didnt get started working until eleven. Then we would take 30 minute breaks every hour because the machine would break down. Co-workers and managemen are very nice and caring. The hardest part of my job was turning tubs because they would come down so fast and if you miss one it would cause the whole machine to break. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the coworkers because they make the night go by faster."
good,"Express is a high traffic retail chain that is most well known for its stellar customer service and fresh take on fashion. Throughout my workday, I am responsible for leading a team of 10 sales associates. I am also responsible for meeting daily sales goals. By boosting my team's morale, providing amazing customer service, and maintaining a positive attitude, I almost always find myself easily exceeding the day's goals. Since I have work with this busy company for over three and a half years, I have acquired excellent time management and problem solving skills, which is essential to the success of any institution."
good,"On a typical day upon coming to work my duties may range from chatting associates in to opening and closing registers, to managing a segment while achieving hourly goals."
good,"As an express sales associate you are required to either dress in their clothing or dress in a similar fashion so that you are able to sell their clothing. Its a fast paced environment, meaning you are always on your feet walking around and assisting each customer's needs. At times you are expected to answer phones and perform stock checks. That's when you ask the customer what item they are looking for in what size, etc, and see if there's any in stock. As far as co-workers, everyone was very helpful and respectful. I didn't have any conflicts with them what so ever. The managers that work there are strict with meeting their sales goals but they didn't treat me unfairly or poorly. For the most part they were very understanding, helpful, and polite. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job was getting people to open credit cards. What i mostly enjoyed about the job was putting together my own wardrobe and then selling my personally picked out outfits to customers."
good,I learned how to manage other people. I helped setup window displays. I gained many tools for success.
good,"Typically, a day can be hectic and fast paced, especially when you first start. Overall, it's a great place to get your feet wet in the Logistics industry."
good,it was a easy fun job the envirement is good and the manager was very nice to the workers and its also a save place i would recommend people to work there
good,Express is a fast paced company with high requirements for only the best customer service. Managers with different talents run the store. It is essential to have a lot of availability.
good,"Providing fashion advice; choosing and coordinating outfits adding props and accessories, Solving billing problems and handled customer inquiries; responsible for balanced cash draw at close of shift, Ability to multi-task, while being attentive to customers and remaining flexible to the needs of the business, Knowledge of customer and market dynamics and requirements Management was excellent they alway made sure there employees did their job and if needed assistance helped out."
good,Its fast paced so there's always something to do which makes the day go by faster. The workers are friendly and lively which makes work kinda fun.  Expect to be always on your feet and be very social throughout.
good,I applied online and just two days later received a call to come in for a group interview. Unfortunately i got really sick and couldn’t make it to the interview. So I called the hiring manager (she was amazing btw!!!) and told her I couldn’t make it and didn’t want to get anybody sick. She was completely understanding and scheduled me for a solo interview. She was so bubbly and energetic. 5-10 min interview simple questions. She told me I would receive a call in 2 days to let me know if they were going to continue with my application but she told me that she was going to hire me so I basically got hired on the spot..
good,"The managers would usually keep me in the front of the store because I was a very good salesman and good at greeting customers."
good,Must cater to the customer but fun job to socialize. Easy job that pays well if you have a higher position. My managers have been at express for years and they are making a great living off of it.
good,"As part of the management team it is my job to create a fun work environment for the staff and our customers, a typical day will include checking store inventory at customer request, processing transactions, and maintaining a clean work space. I've definitely improved my customer service experience during my time here, giving me the necessary capability of dealing with many of your typical customer related problems. Management is by far the best I've had to work with in comparison to any other job I've had, making the workplace feel nowhere near like work. Hardest part of the job is mainly learning the product and familiarizing yourself with the tech, but this isn't really anything to be concerned about as it's easily caught."
good,"Ambiente agradável, espaço gostoso e ameno. Aprendi a trabalhar em grupo e a ter responsabilidades"
good,"Like all jobs in retail, it's not the most glamorous job but it does have its moments. As a sales associate, I'm basically the face and backbone of the business--assisting customers, ensuring that merchandise is available as well as maintaining the overall appearance of the store in accordance to company standards. As part of the visual floorset team, I assist and am responsible for creating an eye-catching and well-coordinated display in order to maximize the exposure and highlight the key elements of current fashion trends, something I find enjoyable as it allows for a bit more creative freedom."
good,"productive , love working with the other coworkers .  The most enjoyable  part is helping with customers .  I good at helping keeping the store clean and neat. I also  like working with others ."
good,"Fun and fast paced Express is a great place to work. The culture at Express breeds work ethic, integrity, and a passion for fashion."
good,"a great fun place to work. daily jobs include customer servicing, Cashier, and Sales to customers. great co workers and management, very professional. hardest part of the job is the constant flow of non stop customers. most enjoyable part of the job is talking to people and knowing im doing something to help them and make their lives a little bit better."
good,"Well a typical day would start of with pulling parts for different areas of the warehouse intill all areas had been completed after that we would stock new shipments. I learned how to properly stock and pull items on the floor as well as through the computer system as well as a little forklift expierence. Management was very helpfull and was always able to answer any questions I had which helped me excel in my job faster. My co workers was all on the same page we got along, worked hard, and got task done in a team effort. The hardiest part of the job I would have to say was when workers in other areas would mess up on quanties asked for on certain parts which would make me and the co workers in my area have to go back and make sure everything was properly counted for in the system. The most enjoyable part was everybody was on the same page we got are work done on time everyday our team work was on point."
good,"Once clocked in, you take a 5 minute walk and talk with the manager on duty to go over daily promotions and the tasks they would like me to get started on. I have learned how to provide in-depth customer service. The hardest part of the job would have to be just the down time when business is slow, but there is always a way to keep busy. I just enjoy retail and customer service in general. The management is very professional and at the same time make the environment comfortable and equal."
good,"I started off as a part time associate to part time sales leader to full time sales leader. There is a lot of room to grow. I learned and gained a lot of responsibility, learned to be patient with my associates, caught on to business management, and being fair with every individual. I learned numerous things when i was in charge of the seasonal hiring, floorset, and inventory prep. Even though I was here for 4 years, no part of my job was boring. I enjoyed every moment of this job."
good,how to be well rounded in workforce working in an diverse background
good,"I learned about fashion and keeping up to date with trends. I also learned how to build a rapport with customers, provide great customer service, and achieve goals. A typical day at Express consisted of helping customers and ensuring that they had a pleasant shopping experience, as well as making sure the store was perfectly neat by straightening. The management team at Express is very reliable, honest, and a pleasure to work for. Each manager made sure that his or her associates were always comfortable with what they were doing and always helped associates achieve goals or improve. The hardest part of the job was enrolling customers in the Express credit card. Often times, people do not want to open credit cards, in fear of overspending. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find the perfect items that fit their needs."
good,"Generally a good place to work, with minor hiccups here and there, mostly due to moody customers.  It’s better if you already have fashion know how and are able to identify clothes easily and quickly.  Managers expect you to learn quickly, though, which can be a bit overwhelming, especially if, again, you aren’t particularly fashion savvy.  Pay is a little above minimum wage, which is fair for a part-time position, and your hours can differ.  Biggest complaint is that some weeks you make barely any hours at all."
good,"Just your typical retail store associate, folding clothes and helping customers. It is exactly what you expect it to be. It is a good work environment with friendly and semi-friendly people. Overall nothing wrong with the company, thumbs up."
good,I worked at express during school breaks and the summer.  There are opportunities to work your way up in this company if you work hard.  The management was very flexible with workers that were in school or had other jobs.
good,"A typical day consists of making sure you are giving the same customer service to each customer as well as maintaining the store visually, like go backs and straightening. As a manager you have the added responsibility of coaching the assoiciates you are working with to make sure everyone is working as a team to achieve the stores goal for the day."
good,"I have worked as a sales associate for 2 years and I never had a problem with it until i started working at Express. I was only scheduled on very busy holiday hours, which was nice, but then after the holidays, i rarely got shifts. I was disappointed because i wanted to work more.  Everyone that i worked with was unprofessional and rude behind closed doors. I would spend my shift greeting customers, helping them choose outfits, i would clean the store and work in the fitting rooms, and also worked at the register. I would always close the store at the end of the day, so i would be getting off my shift later than expected because i had to clean the store to perfection for the next day. I always worked really hard to clean the store at night, but the other co-workers didnt' put in a lot of effort. "
good,"great clothes"
good,"Cashier"
good,My time at Express was fairly decent there were times where the boss had no other people to help because they quit due to reasons i couldn't know but when we barely had anyone he had us work the other schools and not help what so ever it can be fun the supervisor is a nice person she'll tell you what you have to do and show you how to do it if you do not understand
good,Working as a Sales Manager at Express was a new experience for me everyday.  Helping customers putting complete outfits together for all different occasions.
good,This was a fun work environment due to all the interaction with customers. I love fashion so everyday was different but fun. The only thing I did not like was working all major holidays and not able to enjoy them with my family.
good,"Though the job position was only part time due to school/college studies, the work place was decent enough. A team that knew how to work together to get more done to being able to operate, sell and work independently. Management strived to push associates to excel within the company. And scheduling was more than reasonable to relate to school and life needs."
good,If you ever need to find a job wether is part time or full time express can help you and everyone find a job side job or just a regular job with a company
good,working for this employer was okay had to pretty much learn things on your own not a lot of helpful training. but even though i got some retail sale experience.
good,I worked through express as a temporary worker. I did different jobs from cleaning to industrial work. The only thing you did always have a job to go to which makes it stressful.  Sometimes jobs would only last a week to threes days.
good,I'm just a side laborer but they'll make sure you know that. I would over achieve only to be told I wasn't doing enough. You can show up early miss you're lunch and stay an hour late every day but you'll never be on time and you're always trying to leave early.
good,"Over worked, corporate has unrealistic expectations, they are very out of touch with the day to day operations of their stores. Managers are being terminated and threatened for not getting credit cards! No work life balance and extremely low pay for associates!"
good,Don't pay that good and the jobs don't hire on full time  and wen u ask to be pleased some were ells the won't bc u have to finsh the job u don't like
good,First of all we had to pick and looked for the stuff and put it in a box all the stuff that the paper ask and then from there we go to our desk and scanned it and packed it tape it the computer would give us a paper clued on the box and send it to the stated and city they need it
good,It is a very fun company to work for so as long as you have a good team working together. You definitely need to work hard and put in your years in order to advance farther.
good,Great place to work. Everyone is nice and the jobs are simple but demanding. They work with you if you have to have a day off for and emergency or leave early for an emergency.
good,The work environment is mostly based on who you're working with. I have a great team that's very driven and focused on serving the company. Always fun to joke around and be serious at the same time.
good,"This job is great if you are into fashion or want retail experience. Everything is fast paced and you have to work with a team. You learn different skills like cashiering, shipment managing, and of course customer service skills."
good,Fun work environment but the schedule fluctuates and you don't het thay many hours to work. The pay is minimum. Co workers are awesome and helpfull but just the hours is what really get you.
good,"It was fun working there in braintree, because you got to be a stylist and help dress your customers. But there were days that were very slow and that was dreading time would not move"
good,Express is a great company to work for and there is always room to move up in the company. They take the time out to train and develop and prepare you for promotions.
good,Its as any retail store but less drama which I love because everyone is so helpful when you start your first day of work and everyone is so energized to get the job done.
good,Express for the temp service I work there with many different jobs that was a great working experience I've learned how to work in Factory Line work because of them. I'm happy that I learned two things I learned with Express.

good,it was a great place to work at with tons of benefits and perks. I would go back and work there in a heart beat. It would be a company that i would recommend to my friends.
good,I Learn a lot working with Express a lot of customers in the store. In a typical day at work we have meeting to see what our goals are for the night.The hardest part of the job was to keep the store clean so our customers can shop for anything they need.
good,"If money isn’t a huge trigger for you, then you MUST work here! The all of the managers are super sweet, kind and approachable. I can not say enough of how awesome the main store manager is. The job itself  isn’t super straining or hard and the work enviorment is fun and welcoming. the only real cons of the job are they pay minimum  wage and ther really isn’t room for advancement (being a retail company advancement is rare) that also causes short staffing. But the discount is generous!!"

good,"Upon arrival I would get together with the ""CSL (customer sales lead)"" and have a five minute to inform me of what still needed to be done if anything. He/She would inform me about our sales goal for that day and any promotions if any. As a brand manager it was my responsibility to keep the store up to store standards so that meant to assign each associate to a certain section in order to keep the store up to par. Once a month the store would receive a brand guide for the store which was filled with store standards and a floor set for the entire store. Therefore, it was my responsibility to get a group a associates to complete this task. The most challenging part of my job was trying to satisfy the needs of each associate seeing as each had a different personality and different views on things.

Seeing the look on their faces when helping the choose an outfit for either a casual night or a special event was priceless."

good,The most enjoyable piece of being in retail is the difference from day to day.  No two days are ever the same!  The job requires a sense of urgency and a myriad of skills; ranging from HR to visual merchandising!
good,"I would go into work wondering whom I would run into that day - who would I meet? It was a very tourist heavy location and I always found myself speaking to many people from all over the world. I learned how to have patience with people in regards to language barriers. Management always assisted me if I was having difficulty, co-workers always offered support. The hardest part was getting to understand some language barriers, the best part was learning something out of everyone I came across."

good,Management was great at driving sales and coaching the sales associates to be proactive on the floor. Floorsets were excellent for refreshing the store and bonding the sales team.
good,"Express offers great benefits and compensation. They have great customer service and training, but leave little room for advancement."
good,"Great people, and great benefits. It's wonderful for any professional."
good,Set up line and pallets unload and load trucks and pick orders end of day clean up . Loved working there . Had a good supervisor and I eventually got a lead position
good,"As a college student, it was a fun place to work at, though it was a bit hectic. The pay was not enough to live on, so that is the main reason why I left the job."
good,"Express is a fun place to work. The salary is not the greatest, but management works with your school hours. The associate discounts are good and they give extra discounts quarterly."
good,"Hours are flexible "
good,"i love it i was able to learn many things about fashion but i wasn't able to get promoted because i felt like they weren't taking me seriously, i also did a great deal of many things of that little pay."
good,when i was first working at this express every one was nice and friendly and cool . Soon the managers left from when i first started and we kept switching soon we got one lady who was cool and wanted everyone to get along and then she left we then got the now manager and he was rude to customer and staff but fake as in smile and then talk behind you back other then that you got okay breaks and the costume were pretty amazing but the  clothes were nice but we didnt get alot of the cute stuff like the more bigger stores
good,"it was part time work. I enjoyed working there. I did get a lot of hours."
good,Going into work well dressed and with a great attitude ready for work. Being productive working fast. I learned how to deal and communicate with customers. I also improved on my selling skills. The managers that I worked with were great to learn from. My co-workers were awesome to work with we helped each other out when needed which makes the store a good work environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to improve on my working skills and learn new ones.
good,"Typical day at work consist of helping customers with their fashion and shopping needs. Whether they're getting ready for a work interview, funeral, or just a night out in the town, I always had fun helping with this part of my job. Express is modern up to date fashion store, which everyone worked there their own sense of fashion."
good,"The team I worked with, was amazing. We all had so much fun together, it never felt like work. We were also very successful at meeting our store goals, along with multi-tasking."
good,"A typical day consists of running go backs, helping customers, being a cashier, taking trash out, processing shipment. There’s minimal room for advancement within the company being that is so large."
good,"I enjoyed my employee discount, especially at the end of the quarter when there was an employee blowout sale everything 50% off and no limit I got a full suit, all kinds of shirts, a few pairs of slacks, sooo many sweaters. That right there made the whole employment worth it."
good,"Express is a great job for anyone in school, or looking for part time work. Their customer base makes it worth the time being there. Good management and training."
good,I worked Express part-time. This is a great job for anyone who is in school or needs a little extra cash to suppliant their income. The environment is fun and encourages growth within the company. The benefits come in form of discounts and a positive job culture.
good,"When I first started I was under a different manager, then when I left the company. I saw first hand in how brining in a toxic leader can effect the whole team."
good,A typical day at work starts with reviewing the sales goal for the day and becoming familiar with any new deals on the sales floor. The opening manager would be sure to leave a message for all employees encouraging them to cooperate with others in the store to reach their goals. The hardest part of the job was familiarizing myself and getting used to using the walkie talkie to communicate. The most enjoyable part of the job is that there was always something to do even if there are no customers.
good,I would come in and log onto the computer and finish the tasks that are assigned to me. Everyone is friendly and taught me new skills. I love being busy.
good,I always had a goal for the day for myself to continue to grow in my work. I had to stay on top of the fashion trends to help customers pick out outfits fitting to their style with the latest trends. I loved the cashier moments when a customer would tell me how satisfied they were to stop in our store. Express may seem a little pricey to the average 25-30 year old but with so much coupons out and the amazing help they should expect to get it's definitely worth it.
good,It was hard labor work and very hot (weather wise). Constant heavy lifting. This job was supposed to last 4 weeks but ended up only lasting 2 weeks which was disappointing.
good,Working for Express was awesome! Part time employees do not receive benefits. Great company selling a great product. Loyal customers and employees. Very thorough training which is extremely helpful when working and assisting customers.
good,Express was performance culture. They expected you to work and perform. You can learn a lot about retail buy working there. Sometime your a name on a piece of paper but other time they really get to know you!
good,was mainly temporary jobs but pay was fair & Kristen is very helpful
good,I enjoyed working for EXPRESS because it didn't feel like work. It felt like a team/family working together to help customer's needs and each other to create an amazing shopping experience.
good,"Company expects the best that you can deliver in what they have taught you. Nothing is unattainable, it just takes drive and dedication to deliver results. Would be a boon to the company to invest more in their associates. Too much turnover on the associate level. Company sees them as replaceable. Invest in your people, and they will invest in you."
good,Working at Express helped me build more confidence. It gave me the opportunity to advance within the company with more training and the help of the managers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Express. My coworkers were fun. I really liked both of the managers I had at Express. The clothes are great though priced a bit high. Luckily, we got a 30% discount."
good,this is a relaxed environment. management is friendly with the employees and strict enough to get work done. i like the dress code. enough to let you choose your own outfits according to company policy
good,"Managers were fun, flexible, and easy to work with. They created a great place to work and were very accommodating. The other employees were all looking at Express as a part-time job to gain some money for college and future."
good,"Loved working there, the co-workers are great, not so much the customers. Though hard to get promoted, or hours to work to make a living.  Though they are amazing about working with your schedule of when you can work."
good,"- fun work place "
good,"Hay que trabajar mucho para obtener un burn sueldo,ya que hay que hacer muchas horas extras."
good,"Enjoyed the work environment, very welcoming. The job was pretty enjoyable, not too tiring however sale days were extremely intense, very fast pace and interesting."
good,I enjoy attending customers and helping them decide what to purchase. I also like how i can dress casual. Also the managers are really helpful.
good,I loved working for Express I was with them for over three years. I started as a sales associate and worked my way up to a sales lead but honestly the work is a lot for so little pay. Great and fun company with good benefits but as far as paying their employees for how much work they do it is just not enough.
good,"The is fast pace. It is retail so no one that is lazy would like it at all. The fastness of the crew depended on the time we went home (if you are scheduled to close). Overall is it a fun job. It was nice to dress up for work, meet people from all over the world, and dance with coworkers to promote a fun and friendly work place."
good,"Great place to work and learn business. Very hard work - well over 40 hours per week for management positions. Weekends, holidays, everyday."
good,I worked thru Express for almost a year. They did a good job at finding me work as i needed it. They put me into jobs i enjoyed and wanted to learn. Although most employment was short term they continued to try and place me as soon as a job was open for me.
good,it is a good place to start since is a retail store but this job will only help you for a couple of years because they dont give that many hours and also is hard to move up because there is a lot of competition
good,first job I had on paper straight out of high school! loved the people both coworkers and guest shoppers. footstep into reality! thank you
good,"It's a great place to be, but at this moment I need a more stable job."
good,"I started working at Express as a Sales Associate and instantly loved it. I am very organized so I enjoyed folding the clothes and making the standards as close to perfect as possible. I also worked in the stock room and then worked as a member of the floor set team. I really enjoyed learning how the entire process was completed; from shipment, to censoring the items, putting them on the floor, and ultimately selling the product."
good,loved helping customers and dressing them for their events. I learned management skills and about the business side of retail if you like your job nothing is hard about it and what I enjoyed most was every day was something different.
good,"As a stylist, I help with personal shopping. Great and upbeat atmosphere workplace."
good,I wish they would've given more of a discount for the clothing considering we had to wear the brand daily (3 piece outfit).
good,Have a chance to spin many plates at once.
good,A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with transactions. Helping customers arrange outfits which helped meet sales goals. Offering credit cards and letting customers know about sales promotions and new products. Maintaing the store neat at all times. Very stong customer service required.
good,I thoroughly enjoy working here. The management team is not only kind but they are excellent at what they do and are always willing to answer any questions you may have and teach you new skills.
good,"Express was my first job, I got lucky that Express was one of my personal favorite places to shop, so when it came to the interview, the store manager saw my love for fashion and gave me a chance at being my first retail job which is pretty uncommon for Express. First I will talk about all of the reasons why I loved this job. The biggest factor was that I got along with the store manager therefore we had good communication and she helped me grow my knowledge of customer service and even fashion. The more I grew the more challenges she gave me to help me continue to grow. I also got a lot of hours for being a part-time sales associate. I was also one of the only associates that would pick up shifts and I was usually the first person the managers would call if someone else was sick. There are so many good things about this job I can’t explain everything. The bad part of the job was some of the coworkers. One of the assistant managers treated me like trash for the first three months I worked there, she quite literally acted like I wasn’t a human being, she didn’t start to come around to liking me until I developed a friendship with one of the shift leads. This assistant manager actually told the  shift lead that she didn’t like me solely because I got along with the store manager and she did not...the assistant manager was just very immature, she didn’t think that it was possible for me to work well with the store manager and be friends with others in management. In the beginning there was also a group of girls who had a little clique, they had pretty much all worked there for"
good,"I loved working there honestly, my manager was great , my co-workers were great. Everything so was great an fun up until I didn’t always had a ride or I felt sick most of the time and they cut my hours and I ended up quitting because it wasn’t enough for me an my family since I have a 1 year old to provide and take care of."
good,"I loved the clothing and my district manager was wonderful to work for! "
good,I’ve had a lot of fun meeting new people and enjoy the people I work with. I enjoy overnights because I’m detail oriented and everything looks perfect when done.
good,I’ve learned new and many ways to engage with many customers and finding out how to help them. The workers there are very friendly and very easy to make friends with! Also the discount is a great advantage from working there
good,A typical day at work involves you greeting customers. Helping customers with what they will wear for their event. There was a lot of customer interaction so customer service played a huge part in the job description.
good,"Assignments are not guaranteed, and not based on performance of the employee on the job site. Gaining employment with company who has a contract with express can be difficult. Overall express is a great place to work and they treat their employees great."
good,"I loved working at express. Took it just as a seasonal job and then stayed on for fun and the discount. You could never live off of working there unless you were a manager. Very fast paced , great discount, good structure, and mostly all managers were great. Managers had been with the company for many years without looking like they would be leaving so not much room for advancement."
good,"I had so much fun working at Express, great crew, very nice managers. But most importantly, the job environment, we have fun working. They only reason why I left is because I had to focus on school"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, just depends on who you with for.."
good,I absolutely enjoyed working for Express. The fashion is great and so is the team you work with. I recommend this job to all who are interested. The money was great as well.
good,"Through Express  I got job at lazyboy.  Good place to work had to drive about 45 minutes . Besides that it's good "
good,Working at Express will forever by my favorite role. The people in the company truly make it a joy to work there. It is long hours and a lot of work but worth every minute.
good,"A great company with a strong client base, creating a very specialize product. A leader in the industry with excellent opportunity for growth and innovation. I've learned new skills in the graphics and production engineering field. Management is strong and the workplace culture is positive. The most difficult part of the job is maintaining accuracy and limiting failures. Accountability is high, and succeeding in building an quality product is job fulfilling."
good,"I would start off my day by filling the empty slots on the sales floor with merchandise. Some days I would have to rearrange the sales floor because as every retail specialist knows, rearranging draws a customers eye to product more often. Ending the day I would clean the sales floor, back room, organize, and clock out."
good,"I did not work there long but everyone was so nice and I would gladly"
good,"I honestly loved working at express. it was a very enjoyable experience. on a daily I clocked in read our objective, got chatted in and went on with what I was tasked to do. weather it was at the registers or on the sells floor I enjoyed communicating with customers and for the most part I enjoyed my coworkers and managers."
good,"Fun work place with supportive co-workers and management. Difficulty maintaining on-call schedule, but this is expected when working in retail."
good,Keeping customers happy in good work environment making sure our expenses are low so that the company may continue to grow
good,I help customers find clothes that goes with their personality.  I have fun with my co-workers.  i enjoy working with our customers.
good,Go to work at 8am and inspect merchandise before it distributes for retail sale.  Ive learned patience and how to work as a team.  Also how to be innovative and creative when times called for it.  Management is the best at 1888Mills and my coworkers are like family.  The hardest part was the fast pace however I overcame and that is no longer a problem because the faster the pace the easier the day goes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant change of how you aren't doing the same thing repetitively all the time.  There are constantly new things to learn and to experience to push yourself further.
good,It was a very productive and high pace work pace. Always had something that needed to be done or someone to be helped. Enjoyed this kind of work environment. Kept everyone on their toes and was thus never boring. Express was a higher end retail store so a lot of our customers had to be helped with their shopping. It was always pleasant assisting them with their needs. Because the particular store I worked in was always flooded with customers being in stock was at times a hard job. I had to balance my attention with the processing routine as well as squeeze in the time to assist customers that sought me out. not to mention the assistance I provided at the cash wrap as a back up ringer. All in all this job was a wonderful experience and I am grateful to start my retail career in such a work place. I enjoyed it.
good,"es un trabajo en el cual tienes que ser muy sociable con las personas y aun mas saberlas tratar ,convives con todo tipo de persona sean jóvenes o adultos .aprendí en el campo de las ventas y que es lo que necesita el cliente o en su búsqueda en algo particular .la parte mas difícil del trabajo es ganarte y convencer a la gente de que el producto que le ofreces es bueno y ya que abarca mucho tiempo .lo que me gusto es saber desenvolverme mejor con las persona y a ver aprendido muchas cosas ya que aprendo muy rápido las cosas que me indican  o como llevar mejor el mercado de los negocios ."
good,"Unwrap shipments such as jewelry and merchandise"
good,"Great place to just go in and get paid. Simple."
good,I truly enjoyed working for Express. I would go back for seanonal work after my permanent job.
good,"	Assist customers with locating products in the store as well as count and track inventory"
good,Loved working and dressing customers for special occasions. Management really supports you.
good,"A typical day at work would be very fun and productive. Everyday i would learn something new like how to make returns, others days how to do floor set and inventory. It was fun place to work at because everyday was different. Co-Workers are not just Co-Worker they becaome like family."
good,"clock in, and listen to the memo for the goal of the day. Meet with the supervisor to make sure that I have listened to the memo and set a personal goal for the shift. Get pumped up to work and have some fun."
good,"Working at Express is great if your into fashion and know how sell products. We're all taught great communication skills and respect which is in a metaphor the blueprint of our sales. Giving a customer great costumer service leads to a great sale and revenue for the company. All of the employees in the Express Pearland Town Center are energetic and ready to work and while at times work gets a little tough due to the town center traffic, nothings better then making our customers smile."
good,Great opportunity for the highschool student looking for work. Its also a great place to define and everlasting career in retail
good,Love working here and it’s definitely developed me as a person and in the realm of business. Would definitely recommend to those who are in need of a company who truly invests in their associates.
good,"Nice and organized company."
good,"The job is fairly straightforward, peak hours is when it gets fast-paced and stressful, but the level of communication is key for things to go smoothly. Co-workers are like your family and enjoying your job engaging with guests and uncovering their needs and making sales is the most fun part about the job. The environment is quite competitive but it's all a learning experience!"
good,"Such a great place to work ,great clothing and great discount.My co workers and management make the job really great ,only con is the pay but other than that I highly recommend working for Express."
good,"Enjoy my shifts, the people are fun to work with. Occasionally get rude customers but it’s worth it when you get a good customer and a big sale. Nothing else to complain about."
good,"Express was a GREAT place to work, I lover the employees, customers and location. Unfortunately the location was rumored to close and is closing in may of 2017."
good,The website was very interesting and informative it was very easy to find what I needed and to get where I need to go. It was very easy to find exactly what job I was looking for.
good,"everyone was nice as a team we  all helped each other   to give excellent customer service ."
good,"Very relaxed and fun environment. Unfortunately, I work through their preferred staffing agency, BeaconHill Technologies who does not pay their contractors very well for the field or area."
good,"•	Assisted clients with daily banking transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and non-negotiable instruments."
good,made sure the store was clean everyday. Got a great discount and met lots of people. The cloths are really cool to wear. Learning about the clothing was a little hard at first.
good,I love the company and the culture of honesty that it stands for.  Every single day is different and challenging in its own way.
good,My time at Express was a good experience into the retail field. I was able to work closely with customers to provide them with what they were looking for.
good,"the express stores all around are very amazing at what they do, regardless if its taking care a customer one on one of setting the sales floor so the customer was expose to the product express associates and managers are so full of life and very positive and outgoing. working there taught me a lot about how a person should dress. its a fun, challenging and professional atmosphere that any can enjoy. however the opportunities to grow and develop yourself within the company is very limited and the pay does not suffice the amount of work one has to put in just to get very little done. but its a great place to use as a stepping stone to greater and better opportunities."
good,i enjoy working at candy store an have learned alot an every day learn something new. meeting new people an learning how to make fudge an many other goodies is cool an i enjoy it every day. i love working here but the job ends soon.
good,Learned how to become a sufficient cashier. Knowing the companies products and being able to explain them to customers to help them shop for the perfect outfit.
good,"my co workers are friendly, they smile and greet you every time they see you. management is very good and well organized."
good,"-Fast pace with serving large amounts of customers at once"
good,I love being around the people and just love being around the team. we have a great time and we have a great bond. my management team are awesome and fun to be around. only thing that would be a hardest of the job is the pay is really not that good and I would love to have more hours.
good,great place to work and great co-workers i learned a great deal about maching and reading gauges
good,"Busy retail store, fun environment, nice managers and fun customers."
good,A typical day was never typical. One day could be full of customers with a lot of sales and the next day could be no customers and a lot of cleaning and re-organizing. I learned that you always need to put your best foot forward and work through obstacles. My co- workers were pleasant and never gave me a hard time. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for 9 hours a day. The most enjoyable was the flexibility and company discounts!
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers out with picking out clothes and helping them with any questions. coworkers are great very friendly as well as well work orientated.
good,"it a fun place to work meet new and different people. my co worker are great & fun to work with. my managers always have positive attitude, everyones very energetic."

good,They are a great company respectful encouraging and very energetic work becoming a great forklift driver and working well with others and learning new things everyday
good,"Working at Express teaches you many skills as in customer service, task, visual, stock, and floor sales. It is an outstanding company to work for and be apart of."
good,Express is a very out going company to work for I  have learned so much in so little time I have learned all there is to know a bout retail. Express is always looking for friendly staff to work seasonal time or to stay for the long run it’s fun and there is always something to do.
good,"I had almost a 5-year on and off relationship with this fashion retailer.  EXPRESS welcomed me with loving arms when I became an adult at 18, and put up with me when I needed to leave the company due to college and the stress that came with it.  It also welcomed me back with loving arms when I desired to come back.  Both locations (Tukwila and Bellevue) I forged deep connections with, mainly with the staff, since employees I knew no longer worked there.  Highly recommend both locations (at malls)."
good,A company that cares about their employees. Great benefits and incentives! Favorite part about my job is the visual aspect. Love meeting new people too!
good,"Excellent place to work. Sound business strategy, ideas are heard, executive team is approachable. Depends on who you work for and what function you work in if your work/life balance is appropriate, but overall it's much better than in the past. Would recommend completely."
good,You get paid to fold clothes and help customers! It can't get easier than this! I had a blast helping customers find the perfect clothing item and being able to give then my honest opinion with what I think looks good together.
good,"I Pick up recyclables and trash, clean all isles,  put items where they belong, be helpful to others, sort trash and recyclables into designated directed areas by management."
good,Have enjoyed working with a great management team! We all work together to drive results. Being able to work together to achieve goals creates success.
good,I really enjoyed working there and learning about the retail life. The work was pretty easy going and the coworkers were nice. The manager is a genuinely nice guy as well.
good,"I love my co workers and management they taught me a lot so far and is very helpful, sometimes it's a little stressing but my co workers help me get through the day."
good,"Great starting job. A typical day at work consisted of various cleaning duties such as sweeping and dusting, stocking merchandise as needed, assisting customers on the sales floor as well as operating a cash register. I learned more about fashion needs/putting outfits and pieces together as well as stocking clothing merchandise. Co-workers - great diversity (people of lots of different backgrounds it really was a melting pot), younger open-minded crowd. Management was pretty good. Hardest part of the job was probably security tagging merchandise, was new to me. Most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers and the clientele."
good,"As a team member of Express, I work with our customers to ask questions about their needs and make educated recommendations about which products will help them achieve their goals and feel great! The pace is fast and there are a lot of moving parts, and sometimes it can feel chaotic but I have the support of the team and the leaders to keep the energy level high and the workplace fun."
good,"When you come into work each day, your co workers really help to make it a great day.  Management at the time that I worked there, really inspired you to work hard and get the numbers and hit goals."
good,"Express is a great environment.  Meet lots of different people, and have fun helping them create their own style. There is always an opportunity to pick up more shifts."
good,"I had no issues working at express. Everyone was very happy and up beat, and I have zero complaints with working there. It was very fun to work at express overall and I loved meeting so many different people."
good,"Working for Express was great, I never had any complaints. The management was all very nice, and understanding. They wanted to see their employee's succeed, and rewarded them when they did!"
good,"great management, always there when you need help, co-workers always friendly. most enjoyable part of this job is always helping custuomers"
good,"Se entraba a las 9 y se salía a las 6 "
good,"Crazy work hours, but worth it with the amazing co-workers and managers that make up the team."
good,"Great entry level job where you can learn customer communication skills as well as gain valuable retail experience in a fast-pace environment. Would highly recommend working as a sale associate if you can easily build customer loyalty, can provide excellent customer satisfaction, and multi-task. During busy holiday seasons, Express may require employees to work nights, weekends, and longer day shifts. Benefits include flexible scheduling and paid time off. Job advancement is slow and tedious. The job can be very stressful but rewarding. Additional job duties may include organizing or restocking shelves and ringing up purchases. Express fashion consultants stand for long periods of time."
good,This job had great benefits once hired in and provided meals.
good,Here at express everyone is very professional but friendly. I really liked working there but the pay was very poor. If it was not for the amount of gas that I had to waist and the low pay it would have been a great job. No drama strictly professional yet lively and friendly
good,"A typical day at work constists of dozens of customers to help everyday and in-between helping the customers, I am folding up shirts hanging up inventory and promoting sales. I learned how to be a better salesperson and a better businessman. While doing my work interaction with coworkers is inevitable and I treat as I would myself, and they treat me well. The hardest part about the job, I would say is not making the customer wait while in the purchase mode but I have learned how to keep there interest and keep the sale, and in return making it the most enjoyable!"
good,I have learned Customer Experience and More Retail Experience I Just love Helping Others.
good,"A typical day of working at Express involves helping customers and folding and stacking clothes.  I've learned a lot through the time that I had worked there from folding clothes to being a cashier and also a part of the stock members.  The managers are great people and very understanding.  The managers encourage us to do our best everyday and even help us fold and clean the store when it gets real messy.  Many of my co-workers have worked there for quite sometime, so knowing almost all of them makes my working experience even greater.  The co-workers that been there for quite some time help the new ones that just come in to work at express and all of them are really great and helpful people.  The hardest part about working at Express is when we have visits.  Visits for the usual involve one of the top branch managers to come and check up on the store.  When this happens, the managers and co-workers need to stay all night and clean and try to make the store look as perfect as possible in every way.  This involves cleaning the whole store, mopping, cleaning the store windows, etc...  Folding every shirt, jean, polo, pants to perfection and stacking them by numbers not only in the front of the store, but as well as in the back (stock.)  The most enjoyable part about the job is how managers and the co-workers are able to help each other and to be able to feel satisfaction of helping a person with their purchases."
good,Great atmosphere with co-workers. I have learned to successfully multi-task and communicate well with customers.
good,All staff memebers were friendly and willing to help. Always met quotas for the day and never over-pressured.
good,"Interactions with customers, from the beginning until the end of their visit at the store, informed them with the promotions going on, introduced credit as well to keep customer loyalty, exchanged names to be more familiar. Communication was key, my co-workers were all amazingly fun and very helpful we were a team I can say. The hardest part of my job I can say was simply those customers that dont understand sometimes or dont have patience with you when you are the only cashier, fitting rooms and on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part was the fashion, being able to dress nice look nice and enjoy what you did each and every day."
good,A company who can be who are you and not be judge!
good,"Working at express was a great way to gain customer service skills, and sales skills. The management was very respectful and nice to be around, great customers also!"
good,"I've had the opportunity to work at multiple stores, but my home store is the best. The vibe can be vastly different depending on your location. All of my coworkers are my best friends, we hang outside of work often, my management team (which I'm now apart of) is always encouraging me and strives to help me grow as a leader. Holiday can be an incredibly difficult time of year, as it is in any retail position, but it's smooth sailing the rest of the year. The only downside is the pay. The company values their store managers, but if you're anywhere below SM you probably will be underpaid."
good,A typical day consisted of taking care of inventory and greeting customers. You learn about fashion and style. Along with working a great inventory system and point of sales system. Perfect for students that like fashion and need flexible hours. Everyone who works there enjoys fashion which makes the workplace fun.
good,Express was a huge learning experience. It teaches you how to manage your customer service skills and how to work in a team with different kinds of personalities and people. The best part of Express is the people you meet the and connections you create. It is a great company with a lot of opportunities.
good,"The job doesn't pay much but a good side job if you are looking for one. Also, if clothing is your passion then this job would up your alley. You learn a lot."
good,"It had beautiful clothes and the people l usually look like they knew what they were doing and it had a nice environment around them the customers were usually looking for some input on what to wear and that was really fun interacting with them to see what kind of clothes matched their interest, also I got to see some familiar faces including my coworker who I went school with"
good,i loved working at express for the summer. all of the staff was great and made the experience enjoyable. the only downfall was that you didn’t make commission on the credit cards you sold.
good,"I really love working here. The environment stays fun, and you create a family within in your team which is really special. The customers are generally nice, which makes working retail a lot easier."
good,"If you take care of your personal appearance a lot, you will do well in this company. First impressions are important especially at a store level for helping and selling to customers. Hours for selling associates are horrible, but if you are proficient doing stockroom tasks like processing shipment and other support tasks, then you would get a lot of hours"
good,"I love working here because the people are great and it's usually busy. I need to constantly be moving and that isn't a problem for me at Express. There isn't exactly a typical day; some days I spend hours in the back processing freight; others, I'm at cash wrap or styling mannequins. I would say the majority of my time is spent at cash wrap and tidying the store."
good,"Can't wait to come back to the workplace. Everyone is close, but we are serious about our work. No hardships with any co-workers, but have to be willing to get everything done"
good,"Express is a company that challenges you in so many ways, great brand that leans to its core values to help deliver excellent Customer Service. There are many opportunities for growth and advancement within the organization."
good,"Every day was a lot of fun no matter who was working because we all got along to well. There would be challenges such as not having enough people to work that day because someone called out sick or a customer was disappointed because we didn't have what they were looking for in stock but I learned that at the end of the day all you can do is all you can do. You provide the best service possible and you make sure over customer feels like a guest. They should feel like you care by the time they walk out of your store. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to make people smile; even if they were just stopping in to escape the weather, I loved being able to start a conversation with them. I loved finding out how their day was going and being able to help them find what they were looking for."
good,"Working here, I learned that you have to be very patient with customers and actually caring for your co-workers because that makes the team stronger. The hardest part of my job was figuring out what a customer was upset about when there wasn't any communication going both ways. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people, workers, and the managers. We were all like family at work and I looked forward to go to work everyday. The customers to made it fun because you were able to play dress up with them and encourage them to buy things that looked great on them!"
good,"company was great, the store that i worked at was very busy all the time. Everyday was full of traffic, especially on the holidays.  The management will work with you and your hour."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the only problem I had was sometime u had work and sometimes u didnt, but overall good company to work for."
good,Pretty decent place to work if you are looking for part time work. The benefits are pretty nice for working for them part time. Never worked long hours and usually had days of just doing side tasks. Every now and again it would get busy.
good,Friendly people to work with. Cool discounts. Pretty okay flexibility with schedules. Very friendly managers. Had a blast working there.
good,"Responsible for Customer Service and store maintenance"
good,"Working is the stock room was very fun, because being in the back room with no music. We had to do something to make the time go by."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be servicing customers and being on a personable level with them. My goals are to sell and make segments for the manager in charge of each segment, while helping the constant traffic of customers coming into the store, I also help customers at the cash register, or answer phones: Being friendly and making eye contact and conversation. Express has taught me management skills, communication skills, verbal skills. The management at Express is filled with high energy individuals who keep their team motivated and determined to make the sales throughout the day, but also making it a comfortable environment to work in. My co-workers are either above me or the same level as me, or they just started. New Hires, I would train a good amount of them, being that I have been with the company for almost two years now and I would have to say the hardest part of the job is to keep everyones energy levels up, because after six hours on your feet and running back and forth, you eventually become tired. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team and I can honestly say that I could not have picked a better one to help me progress in my future endeavors ."
good,My overall experience at Express was good. I learn great things to take into the workforce from them. Like how to process 60 boxes of shipment in 2 hours or even knowing how to clam down a customer that's having a bad day. My most enjoyable part of the job was helping and making people feel beautiful and good about their selves.
good,"Management "
good,"great company to work for only thing was no work life balance worked 50-65 hours a week even when it wasn't holiday , but the bonus and overtime was amazing but after a while you get burned out"
good,Working a day at redbull was always full of different exciting missions to go to different types of places and interact with all different consumer age groupls
good,I love working a Express. You get to meet new people everyday and help customers find that perfect outfit. Express has introduced me to some great people!
good,"As a teenage Express was my first ""REAL"" job. My manager was very attentive to me, all 3 of them, who worked EVERYDAY. Our store didnt receive too much traffic so is was easy to fold and tidy. Also i've never had a rude customer. Cash Register is easy to work. Stock Room Easy to work. Overall great job for customer service."
good,"If you love retail then this is the place to be!!! However, the pay is sometime low but the longer you stay the better chance of being promoted to the next level. Then that will be all worth it even if the pay or benefit isn't up to par."
good,Very flexible with other schedules. Everyone is Always willing to help others. Treated with respect. There is always options to advance in the company.

good,"I've been at this job going on a month, a friend told me to go there an I did. The company its going ok but sometimes u won't make 40 hours. So I'm looking for warehouse I know how to learn from to make 40 an hour. I got the potential to do the work an be on time every day"

good,"It was a good place to work"
good,So far my experience has been great with Express. The people are great at the office and always help with what ever you need. but some times the manager at the schools I get sent to aren't great and i don't want to be a lunch lady forever though.
good,They are very great people and are understanding. They listen to the types of jobs you are wanting to work. I enjoyed working for the company.
good,"a typical day at work consists of me working out on the floor.Greeting costumers and helping them find the item and size that they need,i also am cashier and i do my best to provide great costumer experience.sometimes i will do shipment as well if need be."
good,"On a typical day, myself and my coworkers have tons of energy and we feed off of each others positive energy. It's always great when I get the chance to uncover the needs of customers to help them find the best possible items."
good,"it was a fun experience to work in. i love greeting people making them happy, especially having them walk out with a fresh outfit on. plus, if i can step up credit cards for the company through our customers  and upsell, i think im pretty much capable of getting the job done."
good,"Every time I needed help with finding a job, Express is there to help. They give job seekers like myself a chance to learn and grow with companies they work with."
good,My daily shift consisted of provding customers (mostly men) with optimal customer service and assistance in the area of mens fashion. I was able top learn about the professional ways to dress in a myriad of enviroments as well as furthering my public relation skills.
good,Fast paced work environment where your number one focus was always about giving an exceptional experience to every customer that entered your store.. Which resulted in promoting the brand and showed in your over all store results.
good,i had to answer phones and get them off the phone in a timely manner while still doing my job
good,I love working at Express. I think there is great opportunity for advancement and they teach you great selling techniques. The only thing I do not like is only sales leads and managers are full time.
good,"very friendly"
good,If you are looking for a true fashion environment in retail Express is it! You are not only highly rewarded for your performance but this company is open to your business and fashion ideas as well.
good,Express was definitely my favorite job! I loved the fashion industry and constantly learning about up and coming!
good,Working at express taught me great management skills within a fun fast paced environment. The clothes are great and the people are better!
good,A typical day at work included opening and/or closeing the store. On the floor sales. Recruiting and interviewing. Managing and training employees.
good,Always something to do and always something to learn. Love the people I work with and the customers that i help. Fashion is always new and exciting.
good,"Normally, I would review the previous day and/or week to determine strategies and realistic results for the day and week ahead. I have learned a great deal of retail management, managing payroll, setting up for corporate visits, how to provide an exceptional customer service to everyone, scheduling and handling all associates questions and concerns. All of this was achieved through working together as a team of managers, we found a great balance to keep the workplace fun and challenged each other to become better. This is what made working there such an enjoyable part of the job and we truly all looked forward to working together every day."
good,"when i get to work i start out by stacking and rapping the pacages on the pallets, how to load and unload how to put the right labos on the boxes that go out.managment is good. when i didnt know how to do a task they sowed me with my hands on oppertunity my co workers showed me how to get the job donelike its sapose to the most enjoyable part of my job is working around paintballs."
good,"Every day was a new experience as well as development. The company focused on training and development, followed with payback of practice within the business environment. I was challenged daily to drive an exceptional customer experience through developing talent, analyzing business results, and flawless execution. Recognition was a key to success and development, and encouraged teams to have a lot of fun. The challenge was the inconsistent schedule with long hours and the inability to take holidays off with family."
good,A typical day at work was always just walking around asking women and men who walked into Express if they needed any help. I would always do my best to try and help them find what they needed and to make Express a fun and friendly place to be. I learned how to combine clothing together such as matching a certain shirt with a pair of jeans and helping women look for clothes for a particular even. The managers at Express were awesome. They were extremely happy all the time and they never hesitated to help me out in something I wasn't sure of. My co-workers never failed to make me feel like I was always part of the Express family. Never did I feel like the new kid there. The hardest part about the job was having to climb the huge lader in the back to get clothes. I call this the hardest part because i had an insident where a box fell on my head. I honestly enjoyed everything about working at Express. Nothing made me feel like I didn't want to go to work. Everyday I'd go to work with a positive mind set!
good,"it was fun, the only thing was that i wish i had gotten paid more, or have gotten more hours. i was head of the accessories so i had to go back and forth from the stock room to the floor to restock merchandise"
good,"Stage : horaires très convenables, ambiance agréable, beaucoup de responsabilités"
good,Was a great experience as the manager.  I had a great group of girls and the clothes were the best back then!  We had to wear the latest fashion which was not a problem with the store discount.  My assistants were of great help and we all got to travel to Kansas City for additional training.  The benefits were great too!
good,"Express was a dream job, I left to relocate to a new area. Completely personal, not job related at all. I worked under 3 different managers and they all always had my back, taught me, and were very interested in my advancement and the career path that I desired. Very supportive culture. Fast-paced work environment. Positive environment carried across different teams in the building as well."
good,Always expect something new. Great environment and very understanding management. If needed hours or cheduls fix you always get one one with management team.
good,"Great management you learn a lot from everyone. It is truly a fun work environment if you enjoy fashion and providing a great customer service. You will always get feedback, the good and the bad which will overall help you grow."
good,"es muy buena buen pago pero se trabaja más de 12 horas y es muy cansado y bajo presión no hay mucho tiempo,po de descanso"
good,"A day at work consists of assisting customers to certain clothing, and helping with coupons. As an associate I explain what is excluded from coupons, and I could check them out. Co workers are helpful, and we always work as team to make sure our customers buy our products."
good,"It's been over a decade since I last worked there, but it was a great entry level job for me into the world of retailing, some good memories. Management in general is good, but they're known for sometimes giving incompetent people responsibilities they shouldn't have. Really helped develop my marketing skills in a variety of ways, and fashion sense too ;^)"
good,"Great place to work... Everyday something new... God customers, good co workers, good managers,good music... Clean store, nice decoration, clean bathrooms"

I also like how on out typical days, you can look out the store and see people happy and smiling as they came through the store. the co-workers I had were friendly and helpful when I couldn't answer the customers question. the knows hardest part of the jobs was to get the items for the customer if it's in the other store in a different location."
good,I have had the best work experience working with Express. Great and supportive Management team at MN (Burnsville Center) and Sharee has specially considered progress of people working in her team.
good,Enjoyed selling latest fashion items to different types of customers. I learned to ensure that all paperwork was done correctly . Excellent co-workers who also loved being fashionable.

good,management team and co-workers were great at coaching and training. always opportunity's for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually being at the cash register because over the time I have worked there that has become my strong point. All associates are expected to be available for assistance so that's also what I do. The co-workers are great, and became friends and everyone works together to get things done. I'm not 100% sure what I'd say the hardest part of the job is, but at the top of my head I'd say (being a retail associate at a clothing store) is when people get frustated with you because of something that unfortunately there is nothing you can do for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is when somehow someway, does not matter why but putting a smile on someones face. Because for the most part they're probably a total stranger so it feels awsome to be a positive part of they're day."
good,A typical day would involve processing new merchandise and stocking it on the floor. Maintaining a clean and orderly store. Greeting and assisting all customers. While working at Express I have learned how to multi-task in a demanding a fast pace environment. Both co-workers and management are helpful and help achieve the obtainable sales for the week.
good,"A typical day at work consist of attending the fitting rooms and providing great customer service. The most enjoyable part of work is talking to the customers and assisting them with any sizes or requests. At Express you learn how to operate the cash register to charge out customer receipts, Completes check and bankcard transactions according to established procedures, calculates discounts for customers, and to provide great customer service."
good,"I'm not allowed to discuss any information about my previous job. I signed an agreement stating such. I would rather discuss any of these questions with a potential employer on an interview instead. My job was fun, got to meet a-lot of new people on a daily basis...and the most enjoyable part of my day was making sure every customer was leaving the store happy."
good,Most days i can go between organizing with store floor while helping entering customers with every day questions and style inquires. The management was always very supportive of growth and taught the employees with grace and patience while implementing the companies core values.
good,Working for Express was by far one of the best experience I have had. Management and coworkers were incredibly awesome and helpful and helped me grow a lot in retail. I will forever have a place in my heart with them and I would gladly work with them again.
good,I really enjoyed working at express. they were so friendly and fun. the manager was very respectful and funny. most If not all of the staff were encouraging and had a great team effort.
good,"During my employment years at Express, I  learned very valuable skills in self management, retail management and customer service. Opening, closing functions, hiring, training and developing employees in order to achieve company goals."
good,A typical work day consisted of managing company goals when it came to sales and standards as well as motivating associates to help meet those goals and standards.

good,I really like working here learned so much customer service and how to communicate and gain lots of leader ship and how to run the store. so work at express.

good,"Great Company and great culture, growth opportunity, easy to work with management, flexible hours, and management is very helpful with time off request and sick time off."

good,Its vary stressful  but vary satisfying  .I loved learning  and making friends in so many different job places  way to.go Express  I will hunt for jobs till I find the one for me
good,"Everyday after school, I'd bus to get to work. I'd walk into the store and be greeted by my fellow co-workers. They showed me how the system works, how to organize, sign customers up for rewards program and credit. The most enjoyable part of going to work was recovering, organizing everything once the store closes and also dancing to the store music when no one's watching. I did not have any retail experiences before working there, so my knowledge was very limited. The hardest part of the job was probably speaking to the customers. I'm known to be a shy kind of person, therefore talking and trying to help customers can be a challenge. Sadly, I was balancing work, school and extracurricular activities at the same time, so I had to resign in order for me to stay sane and able to graduate. I enjoyed every moment as a sales associate."
good,I have enjoyed being employed at Express since I started. Even between managers nothing changed. It has been a great experience. I love my work environment
good,I learned alot it was a great experience i would love to have another opportunity to work for Express...very respecful considerate acknowledable understanding company
good,This is hands down the best place to work if you like fast paced. You are able to advance through hard work . All the employees were great. The management team would always help out and they wouldn’t expect you to do something they wouldn’t.
good,The people who were in the office were great. The people I worked with were fun and motivated. A tornado hit 2 schools in the area so they needed people to help move items from one school to the church.

good,"With my role at Express, being the stock lead and advanced cashier was a very simple task. You are able to work in the back majority of the day and are able to go home when you are finished. The manager is very understanding and is able to work around your schedule if it is needed. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with rare customers who try to go around company policy. The easiest part is having co workers that make your job easier."

The day just flies by because there is always something to do whether it be cashiering, dusting, sweeping, straightening out racks and displays, re-folding merchandise on tables, or assisting customers. I enjoyed learning that I could take on any challenge that was given to me. The hardest part of the day for me was  not being able to find what a customer was looking for because we just didn't carry the item."
good,A typical work day was very long and enduring but mainly it was about making the money. The management staff provided help to all associates. The culture was together and the hardest part of the job was during the holidays. The enjoyable times were the training meetings.
good,"Reliable company always lots of work"
good,Great work place. Amazing staff. Meeting and greeting new faces/people every single day. Your work is noticed and appreciated. Management cares about every single person.

good,"A typical day at work, is ringing up customers, helping them with paring clothing that they are interested in, or having them try something they would never think of on, in-turn boosting there confidence in knowing they are or can be more versatile in the clothing they ware. Also if we don't have something on the floor they want, going above and beyond to see if we have it in stock. If by chance we don't have it in back stock, then i would give them the option of ordering on-line (free of shipping) and informing customers about the Express rewards program, as well as offering them discounts thew e-mail and more discounts by applying and getting approved on a Express credit card. For all military personal, informing them that Express offers a discount on all persons that have a military card."

My managers make me love my job even more their energy and vibe brings out the best in me even or a not so good day . "
good,"Learned about sales, leadership and interacting with customers. My typical day is communicating with others, doing transactions, selling product, working to get to the day's goal, and tasking to make sure the store looks presentable to shop."
good,"Good place to start out in retail sales. I enjoyed the environment more than anything. Making a sale is a big job for a young person, though. I would suggest they put more incentives for those interested in beginning a fashion career. They could have done more to invite the associates to learn about their product. But, then nobody would have come if they had because everyone needs a life outside of work."

I also work the ""cash wrap"" where I end the customers shopping experience by making their transaction and sending them out satisfied."
good,"As a sales representative I enjoyed my days spent at Express. A typical day would consist of showing up in a trendy outfit and getting right to work. First we must be prepared with a mic attached in case a co-worker needs coverage, we must read the goal for the day, say a sales average of last year and to beat that exact amount on that given day, and to be energized. Having an upbeat personality makes you a better fit for this company because we must always be ready to help in every situation we are assigned to with a good attitude. "
good,"The best Company I have worked for ever, the managers,coworkers are extremely wonderful. Great atmosphere, people are a well mannered and pleasant group.
