rating,review
bad,"If you are hard worker than they let you do the most of the work because you work as a group with lot of lazy people and poor management. Raise is sucks."
bad,"What's to say? They've dumbed the job down to the point where a monkey could do it. It's either completely boring or super crazy, mostly crazy boring. It will take you 10 years to move up 1 pay grade as an operator and even longer to be the blessed ""upper level"". The person who gets all the decisions the engineers deem not worthy of their time dumped on them, also easy work by design."
bad,they love to hire young people to see if they can turn them into work zombies but they also love to lay off people and not tell them about FMLA when they or their family gets in a crash and injured.
bad,"You stay a temporary employee so they don't have to pay you anything or give benefits. Some nice people there, but it's the worst ran company I have ever worked for."
bad,TI is nicknamed transition institute for it's low pay and cut throat environment. TMG is not the best place to work for mothers. A typical day at work ...
bad,"TI is a great place and culture to work for. As a group, we work very well together and with a family atmosphere. Very flexible schedule and no micro management style."
bad,First time I had been discriminated against because of race.  Very unprofessional management.  No respect for me and others.
bad,"great place to work to improve job career"
bad,A very challenging culture.  Not willing to train and unreasonable schedules.
bad,"manufacturing is not a bad job, but when its is mismanaged and understaffed its a nightmare"
bad,"Es wird sehr viel Einsatz für normale Bezahlung erwartet, Kritik wird nicht akzeptiert und Arbeitsgesetze gelten in der Payroll nicht. Wenn darauf hingewiesen wird, hat man weder ein gutes Zeugnis noch Fortkommen zu erwarten."
bad,I learned how to work in a clean room fab and run semiconductor manufacturing.
bad,"Blatant favoritism, unclear expectations, and ever-changing rules.  Wide variations of expectations for people with identical job roles.  Would not recommend this job."
bad,It was easy keeping up with production because we were not working on an assembly line. We would assemble display shippers and filled them with calculators.
bad,"i've learned how to deal with other workmates, how to have a long cord (patience). I enjoyed my stay or work at the company because of the people surround me, because they teach or give us more knowledge about the work at the company."
bad,"You are not appreciated at this company, just a number and there is way too much drama there and no one even goes by facts, just hear say..if you can find another job. It's a sweat shop and management sucks from the top to the bottom"
bad,"Be prepared to be used. The more you get trained on, the more they use you with almost no chance of advancement. You make the exact same money as the people that don't do anything."
bad,"Contract administrative staff is always temporary - but still have to compete with ""permanent"" staff.  Very competitive, little communication, extremely back-stabbing. Replaced an admin who had been in position for five years; she ""just couldn't take it anymore.""  Moved to another department at another within TI."
bad,HR and management are in bed together. The employee is out if luck if a manager doesn't like them. HR will always defend and favor management over an employee
bad,Not an equal opportunity employer as federal law requires. Only accept temporary positons and then hire from those spots. People wait an average of 3-5 years to be hired.
bad,"Join TI at MFAB and be ready to become a six digit number ID in the huge TI manufacturing universe.  Worker ant - cog.  Management is only interested in new college grads and ""moving-on"" the experienced workers older that 40 years. MFAB is manufacturing on borrowed time making yesterday's technologies today in a semiconductor world that has pasted the site by many years ago."
bad,"The place is filled with three categories of people:"
bad,Was not up front with me as to the hours I would work until it was time to start. and when I tried to move up to a better job I got wrote up and was told I could not move up or even try to move up and when they had a lay off I was told I would come back on day shift with week ends off but they never called me back and when I called them they would never return my phone calls.
bad,"when i was a manager i always got told ""ill take care of it"" or ""ill fix it"" but nothing was ever fixed or taken care of, they did not even listen to me when all i wanted to do was do better  and make better for the company"
bad,"TI has a lot of contractors, actually a ton of contractors.  I was a contractor.  They hire contractors so they can blame them if the job doesn't get done or so they can have a scape goat.  Old timers there have no skills, be careful they won't think twice about firing you.  Lots and Lots of politics but whats job doesn't have that?  Best advice for this place and any place you work.  Keep your mouth shut and just lay low."
bad,No se cuenta con estabilidad ni motivacion laboral ya q duran muchos años sin dar plantas
bad,Happy with quick response and hire. Completely unaware of actual duties until 3rd day on job. Was not comfortable with clean room suite or environment. Very hard work for one person.
bad,Not good place for advancement you have to do the work by yourself and the other people will stand there and just watch you do the work. And they are not team player at all because you only here for yourself.
bad,"People here think this job holds kings job title in their career and take everything too serious I mean common it is a job not a heart from a surgeons hospital going into a human body, horrible place to work and very boring,"
bad,"long days, only worried about bottom line."
bad,"Wafer Specialist that has no potential to become anything else. 11 and a half hours of walking on concrete that will eventually get your back hurting like no one's business! As for the environment, felt like high school with specific groups to look after you and others to try to get you fired. No worth the money!"
bad,Salario mínimo y no tiene buenas prestaciones de ley
bad,Started in 1978 in the Silicon Products division and worked into a techical role as failure analysis technicican for almost 15 rewarding years.
bad,as a volunteer i learn about some management skills required for a function.
bad,"Good pay and hours, but even at the first day of training they tell you you will be cut down and thrown out if they feel like they don't need you anymore. They just want to get as much work out of you as they can for as little as possible on them."
bad,"It is very hard to get hired on directly with this company. The hardest part of the job was their people. Not a very nice bunch of people, very rude. The job was very easy. Just watching your machines and reloading the wafer boats when needed."
bad,"Poor Management, did not care about employees.  They are reactive company and not proactive.  THey only care about money and not the people. if you have an idea they could care less unless you are one of the chosen ones."
bad,the work is stressful and the supervisors are not friendly. they are discriminate between the full time specialist and the contract workers.
bad,It's not the same company it was 20 years ago. They have outsourced about everything.
bad,"Days have changed and so has management. The pay isn't fair nor half way fair and management isn't for you (the workers). The company hardly ever hire from within. Even, if you received your degree while working for TI they would prefer a fresh out of college graduate."
bad,"Love it here, great work place that love to see their employees succeed. Typical work day is exciting and relaxing. The most enjoyable part is the free food."
bad,"fun"
bad,"Me dedicaba a realizar mediciones y reportes de tales mediciones, inspeccion de material"
bad,"Help is always leaving and more heavy work got put on to lower levels w no help from mgmt at all at South portland, ME plant. No respect towards the employees who were working their butts off day after day to keep production moving as much as we could. No recognition ever. There was never a steady management.  Management and HR did nothing when employees had issues with things that you are supposed to bring up to a supervisor or HR, they would just ignore every bit of it. No upper management listens to the employees, nothing gets resolved ever, its the same problems day after day with high stress levels, no well grounded training from anyone at all. Supervisors are idiots. Thats an unprofessional business to run when NO one works together, especially management. Its not a way to live. Don't go there. Ray also treats everyone like they're stupid people and down grades them in front of other employees. Very unprofessional. Save yourself the trouble, apply other places."
bad,"I was never given real guidance or training and spent the majority of my time wondering and clicking around hoping I was doing something positive to contribute. Everyone on my team was older than I am by many many years so it was hard to relate to them. My boss changed after only 7 months on the job to a manager out of state, so I became a remote employee. I was excited about the opportunity to travel for work, but that was never revisited."
bad,"Raytheon is an old fashioned union driven company.  They have little understanding of the nature of professional, highly educated employees and their needs.  I left that company voluntarily to take a position with EDS."
bad,"TI stands for 'tiny income' and 'training institute'..  You won't get rewarded, but will learn there and leave."
bad,Hired thru temp agency as contractor never received an offer as full time employee with Tex. Instruments felt discouraged and decided to move on. Hope they can appreciate valuable employees.
bad,too slow paced. not really any room to move up and advance. not enough pay for the type of job that you are doing even though you only work 6 months out of the year.
bad,"It's pretty much a sweat shop, they don't care about you. They just want to meet high numbers and satisfy the investors. They will throw a bone to the employees while they make billions. Highly strict rules and expectations, expect people to be robots. There is no life balance there. This job fits someone that has no life outside of work and who has no family obligations, if you have family and spouse expect to neglect them as you have to always sleep on your days off to be able to function at work."
bad,I have been with TI just over a year. I never did what I was hired to do. We had a reorg and no one knows what to do with me. I have not worked on anything in 8 months. I come to work and sit in my cubicle and do nothing.
bad,There was no advancement for me and was told by management  that would only be in facilities. Management and engineers didn't  respect me and would take the caucasian side even after the evidence  was shown to them. So I left and moved on to another place of employment.
bad,"TI hires a lot of contractors and does not offer the opportunity to become permanent, they treat contractors like 2nd class citizens. They also force long time employees out."
bad,"I have been working for TI for quite a while and the culture has shifted dramatically."
bad,It's an ok place to work  they don't like to give raises. I worked there for seven years and started at 6.75 and left making 9.00.  There is no job security. Constant layoffs. It's nice working 12 he shifts 4 days on three off then three on four off.. you get paid time and a half for anything over 8 hours and you work 12 he shifts so four hours overtime every day you work which is nice.
bad,Mitarbeiter werden ausgebeutet wenn nötig. keine gutes Management.
bad,TI was my first work experience out of college.  It was a start for me and interesting technology but it was not my favorite experience compared to other companies I have worked for.
bad,the company is number one electronics here in angeles pampanga very interesting company and very cleanliness place and the other applicant are very good in there attitude
bad,12 hours shift can be challenging for people attending college or have a family. co-workers were helpful when you need them.
bad,"Challenging job."
bad,Not an engineering/technology company anymore. Saving money is the only thing they care about! Feel like a clerk!
bad,the day at work is nice.i learn how to cooperate with other people
bad,"As of right now, my experience with T.I. is very minimun. I did not work there for a long time. so I have no really good experience with them."
bad,"I have been working at TI for >5 years at a couple of different locations. Now I am in bay area. Here is my comments"
bad,"Texas site has a better work life balance with strong groups that is not seen in the northern California locations. High turn-over rate in all groups, but that might just be common with the area. Great for learning."
bad,"TI brings new hires on from a 3rd party contractor, This means new hires have to be there for an unknown amount of time to maybe be brought on to the actual TI team. They don't get the benefits TIers get, despite being held to the same standards of work. They're also first on the chopping block when TI needs to cut down employee numbers. Also, new hires can be somewhat alienated by TIers that have been there for 30+ years. The culture is very much like high school, except the people are well out of their teenage years."
bad,"Everyone is really nice, but know one seems to enjoy the critical aspects of the job. in my last year I have witnessed several cases of engineers that care more about ease of work than doing the right thing."
bad,TI is too big to not have proper training for a new employee. Not each  person that trains are talented in training properly. There were no training procedures written for daily job duties and training was not consistent.
bad,"This labs re-org has torn a culture apart. TI bought Unitrode in 1991 and has torn it apart piece by piece ever since. Forced into a ""good old boy"" type of work ethic."
bad,"A premier tech company that has become an also ran. If you like North Texas, then consider. However, many more options now available."
bad,"It's hard for Aquent to be an advocate for their contractors while the corporations are the ones paying them to hire the contractors. Contractors are dispensable no matter how much sugar-coating they put on our ""positions."""
bad,"TI is, and has been, well known for massive layoffs. I worked there 14 years 11 months...28 more days and I could have taken early retirement, but no - gotta go."
bad,Company prefers to hire candidates out of college and then groom them according to TI philosophy.  In recent years the company has embarked on a broad and encompassing management tool called Playbook.  Working with this system takes the creativity and ingenuity out of the workplace and replaces it with a drone like environment.
bad,"Texas Instruments (TI) offers good salaries and benefits. On the other hand, if you're into marketing, look elsewhere. TI doesn't hold marketing in high regard. The company's idea of marketing is a web page with a product datasheet."
bad,"Management's continuous push to reduce head count resulted in 30 year technicians being replaced with fresh out engineers. Their skill set imbalance was exacerbated by the rapid demand growth of new telecommunication ICs. Large scale projects were provided with lots of personnel, while small projects were starved for people. Working a smaller project meant that one was exposed to many more aspects of IC development. It also meant that engineer worked many more hours doing the jobs technicians used to perform. Working 15 hour days on back to back projects while colleagues played Friday afternoon golf with the supervisor told me that my hard work was unappreciated."
bad,"I have been with this company for 4+ years, and I am still considered a temporary employee. I have heard that this is typical and somebody in management has described us as ""replaceable"".  I like having the compressed shifts, but am not a fan of not getting paid time off like the non-contract employees. It's not a hard job, but can be fast paced and long hours on your feet."
bad,I was on the B shift which when I started they told me about this was the worst shift period. If they had better training and better management It would be a great place for semiconductors. I had got in trouble for my trainer telling me how to process something then I was blame for it and not even certified yet.
bad,"Worked as an apprentice here, and the management was a joke, along with the job security. Throughout the maintenance department all of us were constantly wondering when the next pay offs would be. The work was not what you sign up for and get given tasks that are nothing to do with your role or remotely relevant. The pay throughout the 4 year apprenticeship got better but still below other competitive companies of the same scale. However a lot of the senior techs were payed well. Shifts aren't too bad if you can handle the 12 hour shifts as you get a lot of time off. due to the shift pattern."
bad,"good small team, bad project managers, tribal culture for some business owners. had to verbally aggressive to establish ""authority"". unfortunate because all the technical people are great"
bad,good job schedule with poor management and also getting harassed with the shift supervisor . distance is not a problem but driving for 30 miles and work only for two hours is not fair to cover even for gan. I later work for 4 or more hours
bad,i work as cshop technician personnel. i enjoy the work and looking forward for new adventure or challenge in my careers. the my skill will evolve and learn more
bad,"Home/Work life balance is so-so, compensation is a little less than expected, job security is good pretty steady as turnover is due to employees leaving rather than being fired."
bad,"It was a very nice environment to work in for the most part.Some of the people in management were at times oblivious to issues that were happening on the floor,there was no clear channel for communication about potential backlashes and false claims by other co-workers.Other than that I enjoyed my work,especially liked working in the cleanroom processing chips.I learned processes and techniques that I might not have learned anywhere else."
good,"Throughout the years, TI went from a desired employer to a company known as having continual layoffs. The majority of workforce are contractors. So many people have started projects, systems and policies and never got the opportunity to implement anything, no one has a solid knowledge base and the wheel is often re-created. No one can find anything on the intranet, so time and resources are consistently wasted. After the repeated numerous layoffs, morale is extremely low and rightfully so."
good,"Nothing to say other than to get hired there, you must go through a temp agency and could work there as long as 2-3 yrs before getting hired on with them. During this time you have no benefits at all."
good,"Texas Instruments treats employees well, but Sitel is the contractor for TI's Educational Technology Support Division. This review pertains to Sitel Corp. Overtime is typically offered, but hourly pay is overall low for the body of knowledge and technical skills required for the job. Low upward career mobility and management often promotes based favoritism, as opposed to merit. However, coworkers create a supportive, productive, and fun atmosphere."
good,"be cautious to know the status of the company ,gain as much as knowledge possible."
good,Exigen demasiado por algo insignificante no te suben el sueldo jamás ahy permisos para nada(nunca pedí uno pero mis compañeros que pedían jamas recibían el permiso ) no tienes una vida social y siempre estás incómodo en el trabajo por los chismes y ahy mucha tensión.
good,"Okay place to work but low pay and lots of layoffs"
good,"Good for a starting position. Does not treat contractors very well. Was required to cross-train in another position, while learning my primary position."
good,TI was an exercise in stress management. I talked to students and teachers about the calculators made by TI. During the beginning of the school year it was call after call day after day. You supervisor was always listening to your calls and constantly nit picking your technique.
good,"Work life balance is horrible, pay was good. Management was not impressive. The group I joined was failing and I had no idea that was happening when i signed on. Layoffs at TI are legendary and the legends are true. If you want to survive at TI you basically have to know the right people and be a workaholic, unfortunately. Some people like that, I didn't. I found another company to work for that payed me the same and had a much more balanced work/life culture."
good,"Very disrespectful boss, terrible management and nothing but a lot of drama and favoritism"
good,"The management was pretty dense when I worked there, so much so that the division I worked for (Wireless Business Unit) essentially went out of business.  But those people are gone now."
good,"if you meet the corp. culture, you will do just fine. If you are a new college grad and in the learning mode - you are a hero. If you are experienced, work hard - you better start looking for a new job."
good,"Management is pretty clueless."
good,They should paid people if they are wanting them to have more responsibility. We all need money so pay should be upped if they give more responsibility as in training other employees
good,Your'e basically on your own nobody really not a team player. They just like to see you fail. You will be part of a contract and there people that have been here for 5years and they are not even with the company yet.
good,12 hours shift 4 nights alternate with 3 nights. Technicians are difficult to work with. Night shift is tough on Work/Life Balance. Days off are spend on recuperating from the long hours and loss of sleep.
good,"TI used to be a great place to work. Fast-paced, yet positive and enjoyable. However with the downturn of the market, constant lay-offs it turned into an ever increasingly cut-throat sweatshop. My job that was originally written as a technical position essentiall evolved into a communications position and when I balked, I was pushed out."
good,"Worked well with crew, worked better by self, due to type of job that was being performed. Safety a number 1 issue, watching out for self and other employees. Watch for safety violation."
good,One thing I must complain about is constant shift in management. Everyone wants to be a manager and nobody wants to actually do the work. In a room with 50 engineer and everyone behaves like there were managers giving orders. Work/life balance is horrible. Management constantly makes horrible decisions but typically leave before they consequences can be felt.
good,"A very fiscally responsible management team has created a culture where:"
good,"i'm working at the boxing area, where in i box the product, check if the product and its papers match, if the required stickers are paste on the product itself or outside the box.all is well in the company, but i want to experience something that can make me advance my skill,i want to learn new things and have a experience with my finished course..i want to work in a company where in i can accelerate my position."
good,"Good culture and diversity. Overall a good experience for starting in the manufacturing industry, some organizations in the company are better than others."
good,good pay
good,The management have ethic behaviour and they did not treat workers fairly. Especially they show no respect to workers and shouted workers in front people...
good,stressful and not enough training. lots of things need to understand and a big adjustment once you entered the company. things little bit awkward but can manage to do what is it
good,"Life in TI can be very stressful. TI is a fast-paced company, and the project schedule is always set extremely tight. The good thing in TI is, engineers are paid very well."
good,"Everything is great until something goes wrong. Then the daggers come out and the finger pointing starts. Nobody wants to own the issue while it exists. Once something breaks because of the issue it is, who can we blame?"
good,"You're expected to be on call, no matter your position. Additionally, this is a highly competitive environment and restructuring (layoffs) occur every January."
good,"You either love the job and you'll work here forever or you hate it and you'll feel depressed the entire time you work here, employees are very cliquey like a high school you will literally be working and not talking to any one for 12 hours straight"
good,"Starting pay is completely based on previous experience or education regardless of relevance. This was a wafer fab. An associates or bachelors degree in an engineering field is weighted the same as a degree in Theater arts. Managing An entire floor at a huge industrial plant is given the same weight as managing the worse fast food restaurant you can name. The pay rate is slightly higher than advertised because of they way they operate their condensed shifts. Shifts are 11.5 hours long, but anything over 8 hours in overtime. You earn overtime pay before you hit 40 hours a week."
good,"Texas Instruments was a great company to work for. It was inventive and creative. Now TI is a cookie cutter push button company focused on share holder value. Follow the best known method and do what you are told, and you can earn a decent living until they need to outsource your position. Most employees at TI are considered an asset or an expenditure. The list changes all the time. Where you fall on the list any given day determines your employment."
good,"Manufacturing jobs, not too difficult, lots of repetition"
good,"Empresa con buen nivel de desarrollo, pocas oportunidades de crecimiento salarial. Ambiente agradable de trabajo. Nivel de responsabilidad adecuado a los puestos de trabajo."
good,"good company for fresh graduate"
good,"A great place to work if you like a flexible work schedule and challenging and cutting edge work in your field.   The managers can be both good and bad like any company, but the overall company review towards them is based on work result and not on employee growth or morale.   Upper management is heavily focused on profit margins and will sacrifice revenue and businesses with low profitability , so job security is low with nearly yearly layoffs and advancement can be challenging in a continuously shrinking workforce."
good,"Contractors, contractors, contractors, out-sourcing.  If you've been there a long time, you have a target on your back.  No collaboration, managers having no business in leadership positions.    This once great company is changing quickly."
good,Not many perks for employees. Branch office is run differently from head quarters. Did not have first hand experience with head quarters
good,"I had a steep learning curve, but it was an interesting challenge to get the job done."
good,"They had an Engineering and Science Development program, in the 70s. I applied for it in the mid to late 80s. I was told, as I was turning in the application, that ""next semester I might be on the program"", by the HR person. About 6 weeks later we are all told that the program had been cancelled. While they do have a right to cancel a program they should give a few months notice, and anyone who had applied should have been, at least, still considered."
good,"Good place to start a career as there is a lot to learn from the manufacturing processes and other integral parts of manufacturing i.e. operations, engineering and planning."
good,"Company is old, hence a very old culture. They are doing their best to increase the site activities, but overall a pretty average experience. Good W/L balance"
good,not very innovative. inward focused. extremely political office environment. Everyone watching only their own backs. Still inbred culture. Extremely resistant to external hiring or ideas
good,"I had good friends at Texas Instruments and benefits, but had a terrible work life balance. Lots of over time is expected and people who do not put over time in are looked down upon."
good,Would return if part time. Was very happy there and would love part time split position. More women in tech fields and there is NOT EQUAL PAY. Women are not encouraged enough in good ok boy network started with CEO AND CORP.
good,"My experience at the company was very different between when I first joined 8 years ago and when I left. Important to note that each business unit operates almost as its own unique entity within the TI umbrella, so other experiences may vary. "
good,It is a raised within culture. Advancement really is for those who start their careers and will be life long TI'ers. Take advantage of what is offered. Focus on the positives - still plenty. Make the most of your experience.
good,"1. Daily work will be multi tasking. You will be interact different teams including your counter parts to support the demand or costumer demand and requirements how to be delivered on time. I've learned a lot for job responsibilities related to my work including the whole operation. How to improve the process and how to make it an impact to the organization in terms of cost, process improvements, time savings and quality product. "
good,"Mandatory 8 hour shifts, management staff like to ""work from home"", but zero flexibility for low totem pole members. Escalation process for inbound calls is rather cumbersome."
good,"The company has been progressively reducing the workforce locally, outsourcing and team building aggressively over seas, and devaluing the employees who actually do most of the product creation ie. Engineers, Layout designers, and back end support are all suffering."
good,People work hard and try to provide help as much as they can. Bandwidth is limited as people usually have a lot on their plate. There is a lot of room to grow (as an individual and career).
good,"Texas Instruments is a company that takes good care of it's employees and will push them to their limits. There are many different TI locations all over the world, each having it's own culture. The work culture in the Bay Area is harsh and fast-paced."
good,"llevar el registro  contable de las operaciones diarias"
good,"Although the company is one of the biggest name in the business instilling a very good sense of quality, it doesn't give its employees a good way of advancing through its corporate ladder. The benefits not that competitive in the market but its just the average. Most of the employees are not so friendly and not so accommodating."
good,"Texas Instruments is a place of working 12 hour shifts; 7am-7pm or 7pm-7am."
good,It was OK. A lot of extra long hours. It is not a M-F job for sure.
good,Create diverse employee group; a great company for engineers!
good,"I inspect incoming raw materials, monitor the machines, 5s and plan and do urgent upon receipt materials. I learned how to manage urgent, critical materials within a time limit, how to adjust with older co-worker. With regards to management, not much flexible with our family time (but well if given the chance to work abroad then all I do is work only). Not flexible in the sense that RD are not adjustable in case of emergency. Increase on salary are so small not competitive. The hardest part is when we have a certain new issue (new reject) and discuss with the team so hard to explain because others just relay on what you report they don't see the actual issue to themselves. There are things that couldn't explain or put into words. Others also don't read the whole report they just agree then afterwards new issue on the next logpoint and blame me for. The most enjoyed part is when the gave us a token/ gift due to necessity like rainy kit."
good,learned to think fast on my feet in a high pressure job with many technical nuances
good,"TI has a good corporate strategy.  But the hours are long, a typical work-work would be 60 hours and a long week would be upwards of 80 hours."
good,"Stort och dominerande bolag inom halvledare. Finns alltid något att sälja till kunder. Kollegor bra och skickliga, men management svagt och trycker ner besluten från sina chefer."
good,A typical 12 hours shift in my job involves treatment of valuable semiconductor wafers by putting them into a furnace at extremely high heat levels and transferring them on to next process this improved my ability to time manage and organize my work load well.
good,"As most big companies. Lots of benefits, but you are just a number."
good,"While TI offers decent benefits and promotes a healthy work-life balance, the company has really changed focus away from innovating and has moved to a focus of higher volume of commodity components and cost-cutting seems to be the only focus. If you are young and are looking for career advancement opportunities, look elsewhere as you'll very quickly discover that seniority and long-hours are rewarded but challenging the status quo will result in you being labelled as a complainer. The stack ranking system (where someone is always in the bottom 10 classification) pits employees against each other in a way that discourages teamwork and knowledge sharing."
good,"a decent place to work although the pay is a little too low for the work done especially for contractors. Also, a very limited opportunity for advancement. However, the work culture and people are pretty nice."
good,it was a good experience I am trying to move on just for growth i will always recommend the place to others and if my role can be said I would say its was pretty fine
good,"TI provides a fantastic training program to help you ramp up your sales career. They have a great brand and can, generally, be considered an innovative company."
good,"TI don't respect their contractor employee. Their attitude is not profesional. They just hire & fire. Never think that contractors have family. Manager has no capability to become a manager, just need to know how to oiling upper boss. To much internal politics."
good,"Texas Instruments is a great place to gain insight and experience in the IT industry. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of upward trajectory. You learn a great deal though."
good,This was my very first employer over two decades ago. A lot has really happened since then which I don't feel is very relevant now. But I did enjoy my 8 years or so with the company.
good,"1. Good Company"
good,Clean room maintenance repairs and training.  Good co-workers and supervisors.  There was a long transition period from days to night shift that helped.
good,"No communication within group/ mgt about what is going on with Upper Management."
good,Creating purchase orders keeping track of inventory. Working close with engineers.
good,"got more analogish.. so said time for me to leave"
good,"Computer chips manufacturing was not my business, it was an American Company at this time very hard conditions."
good,Too political and abysmal raises. Stifle talent and always fill openings with personal friends from outside the company
good,TI was an impressive company to work for.  They had a large amount of resources and were always looking for ways to improve.  The culture on my team was not as impressive.
good,"There appears to be two cultures: The Elite, and the Workers. Had a great manager that I initially trained under on the day shift. Once ""trained"" I transferred to the overnight shift. The shift manager was unfamiliar with the work he was assigned to manage. We'll leave it at that..."
good,"Depends on which you group you get into and what management team you get. Pay is pretty good and so are benefits, but overall highly stressful, especially if management team isn't very good."
good,"If you're starting in an EE career, TI is a good place to learn the basics. TI is in a post-maturity industry which put it under pressure of short-term performance."
good,Es buena pero algunos de los supervisores necesitan un poco más de factor humano.
good,"People are friendly and willing to help with issues. Also, so many areas to work with if not interested in one typical field. I learned a lot about the real world job."
good,"hardest part of the job: 12 hr shift work"
good,"Management seemed to have no clue how customers wanted the store to operate when it came to ordering parts, there was little to no assistance given when questions were asked, responses to questions were vague at best and when an issue was brought up or an error was made the company would blame it on the customer as much as possible."
good,The workplace is a clean room fab. The place runs 24/7 non-stop. Our work is very detailed. The communication among the team members was great. It's well organized.
good,"Good employees work there,interesting work, good environment, good conditions, work-life balance could be better. Supervisors are fair and respectful."
good,"•	Team Lead for on time monitoring system. (SPC)"
good,"Most of the electronic companies have unique systems in the way of their productions on how they will be most productive and innovative."
good,Texas Instruments is absolutely one of the best companies I have ever worked for. I would encourage any potential employee of Texas instruments to seriously consider becoming an employee of that company.
good,"Responsible for operating machines for production and unloaded incoming products and moved to staging area, sorted items and transported to final storage locations."
good,If you don't mind working in a clean room environment then it's the perfect place for you. I got hired in through a temp agency so I was paid every week.
good,Work was good. Training available for those who wish to learn. Got allot of good training. Good people. Hours are normal. Brought in breakfast allot. They expect allot.
good,I learned a lot working for Texas instruments. The culture was very fast paced and competitive. Learning new technology and getting a grasp on how this industry worked was eye opening.
good,I was a contractor for a year so I was not not included in any meetings and I had no idea what was going on except for what was expected of me and I did my job. I inquired about permanent positions in my department and they said they had none but actually they did but they prefer to hire straight out of college
good,Great Ethics. Is willing to fire even CEO level for any ethical issue. Great work culture. Small salary for Asian countries. Too much politics. Has hood opportunities for technical people. Tech ladder is available is equivalent vs manager and even the highest level of CEO.
good,"This was a very long time ago, I really don't have a review for this company. They did provide excellent benefits, and opportunities to advance your education."
good,"When I left, that place was a joke. Multiple supervisors in an 18 month period, many of whom had poor/no supervisory experience. Eventually became intolerable and was ""encouraged"" to leave. Hope they have learned a few things since then."
good,"Worked for TI years ago, late 80's work environment very good  clean professional met some of the smartest engineers and technicians I have ever had the pleasure of working with"
good,"“TIer” is a simple term we call each other at TI. But it’s hard to really know what “TIer” means until you are one. For one, as TIers, we realize that our sum is greater than our parts. Together, we are builders. We build with our hands and our minds, collaborating to turn unconventional ideas into world-class innovations. We are doers. We deliver exceptional performance and know that doing business the right way is the only way. We are dreamers, turning ambitious dreams into realities. We are givers, giving back to the communities where we live and work. And most of all, we are a team. A team of thousands of diverse minds united by passion and an unwavering desire to be the best. One mind is powerful. A team of minds is limitless. A team of TIers is unstoppable. Are you a TIer?"
good,"Difficult to have life-work balance."
good,"Managed multi-million dollar projects USA wide and internationally."
good,"I straddle line between Si design and definition and that was difficult position.  Si designers called most of shots, definition people had hard time influencing things. Actual experience will depend a lot on which particular group you join: TI is a collection of acquisitions as are many larger companies these days."
good,"Your typical night would be 12 hours on your feet, moving pods filled with microchips from the stock machine to the processing machines and back again. Very repetitive."
good,"Most of the people here are very much baked into standard corporate culture. If that is what you are looking for, TI is great. If not, you're going to hate yourself."
good,"It's was very nice working at texas, learned lot of things got a good experience, day to day challenges was good employee Where treated good.. Overall it's was great working in Texas"
good,"Production Specialist"
good,"Contractors are not treated well or invited to the TX employee parties. Work is okay , less direction,"
good,"I spent two years working for this company , and found it to be a mostly positive experience.  There were numerous topics and flavors of electronics technologies to pursue. Take your pick. "
good,"Texas Instruments was a good company to work for. they were very family friendly. I don't have the same opinion of Raytheon, so I would rather not say."
good,Management is very rigid.  No flexibility in lateral or vertical movement for employees.  Technical good company to work for; but in terms of advancement it is very easy to get holed in a corner as managers are not empowered to help employees.
good,"Loved the job, wish I could have been there longer. Wish benefits was better and pay wages were better. Would recommend to anyone to work there. love."
good,"TI went through a reduction in force when I left in 1991.  I was new to the company and their policy at the time was based on the color of your badge.  I had only been with TI for a few years and had just received a promotion.  Due to the fact that I was there for a short time, I was put on the list for layoff.  My boss at the time tried to reverse it, but could not."
good,"typical day of work - variable to my needs"
good,Decent job if you get hired on permanently within an understandable amount of time. Twelve hour shifts that consist of standing on your feet most of the day.
good,"I was brought on to TI as a co-op in their academic integration program. TI is a great company with a great vision and unsurpassed potential. With that being said, my experience was so-so at best. I attest much of this to the specific situation of my onboarding, not the firm as a whole."
good,"The job involved older equipment and the turn over seemed high"
good,I enjoyed my time working at this company.  Good benefits and plenty of overtime hours if you want to work them.  Really helped get the electrical hours need to advance in my career.
good,Texas Instruments when I worked there was a productive and teaming environment to work.  This was early in my career.  Texas Instruments has evolved as a company.
good,Learned a great deal working for TI. Very good experience working for such a large company. Gained a good knowledge of CSS3 and HTML5.
good,the plant was closed in Temple Tx in Nov 1996 so there for i can give you a review of how this company is operating but while i was there it was a good place to work
good,"Hi salary package for direct hire and professionals.."
good,"Company allows you to take control of your job title, while offering learning opportunities with some room for growth. Company has declined somewhat in job openings so you have to be sure to look for hiring opportunities through their website specifically."
good,Good benefits and good coworker relationships.  Good product offerings and genuine and sincere customer service.  The job was located near my home so my commute was manageable.
good,"Shift leader to coordinates outsource workers to maintain,monitor,trouble shoot,repair and send report to department manager if any problem occurred in plant."
good,Life inside TI is super fast-paced. Everyday there are lots of line issues to close. The work environment is competitive and stressful. But everything inside TI is systematized. The compensation and benefits is competitive. I learned a lot from TI. From work ethics up to how well do I deal with different people with diverse backgrounds.
good,"It always starts with an endorsement; endorsement is our way to know what the machine encountered errors. If there's any, we, the operators should ask the problems and what if so we'll know the to do's and not to do's."
good,The people were great and the work rewarding and a moderate amount of Job security. Payed well and great benefits.  Job location was a plus here in colorado
good,"I feel there is little opportunity to make a living in the positions I have been given at this establishment. I am doing what I used to do in the automotive industry for much less money. Although I enjoy learning something new, it does NOT pay the bills. Hoping for a permanent position after a year and a half.Excellent reviews but no promise of a permanent position for me. This spinning wheels in the dark is not working for me."
good,"A typical day I cleaned parts, using cleaning solutions, air hoses, and cloths. Use tools ranging from common hand, power tools, to precision measuring instruments and electrical and electronic testing devices to repair and rebuild or replace component parts for the paper drive in printers. Pack, seal, label, and prepare materials for shipp"
good,Hardest part of the job is not having much support from the client (Texas Instruments) when needed. Some people act like we are still in High School (talking behind other people's back but act nice to them when they are around that same person they talk bad about). This is a business and should be conducted in such a manner.
good,"Good company with good values.  It is headquartered in Dallas, TX and have a good employee package including the benefits."
good,"The company is good and well-established, the only one so far that has been very meticulous in operations to avoid accidents."
good,"Days start at 7 am with passdown from nights activities."
good,"TXN is like I envision a big company. Work is very specialized to a particular part of a business. Benefits such as health insurance are good because of the negotiating power that comes with the size of a business. Huge onsite gym at the headquarters. Due to the size of the business, one can change careers without switching the company which helps with benefits that depend on seniority within the company such as vesting schedule, vacation plans, etc."
good,"Testing, learning, math and communication is my typical day in working here. I do math everyday testing IC and talking is my way to communicate to my co-worker. Very nice management and very organized."
good,"Anyone below an engineer is treated like a number and seemed to be viewed as a necessary evil for the eng's to do their jobs in the mfg. fabs."
good,"Ethics is one of the key things of TI. They treat people with equality no matter what your race, color, religion, etc., is. However, as an engineer, I find the salary low with respect to the job and task assigned. TI is a place where you can actually learn a lot. As what a lot of people say, in TI you will experience a fire hose of knowledge that will definitely boost your skills."
good,This was a student project for the company. I wish TI had organized it better.
good,"Good job."
good,"I had daily contact with large scale customer who used our ""chips"" or needed a solution.  I would solve their power problems so that they could focus on the rest of their projects"
good,"Great compensation, fast pace atmosphere, team based environment ."
good,"Great work environment if you're a loner type of person; long shifts with only so many people working on the floor means you have a lot of free time to yourself between tending machines. If you can't keep yourself entertained, you might go stir crazy. It's easy to keep your job as long as you don't break a lot of the product; the occasional scratch or chip happens, but try not to drop an entire load. Compensation is excellent; a 10% night shift premium, as well as overtime pay for the last four hours of every twelve hour shift, means you can walk home with some $140 in pay in a single night of work. That is, however, on the terms you can spend that whole twelve hours on your feet in the fabrication lab, wearing the full-body smock. The upside is, you're given a total of two hours of break time - two thirty-minute breaks and an hour for lunch - which you can take any time you like, as long as you do so responsibly."
good,"Texas Instrument Phils., Inc. (TIPI) has a good foundation on operations because it is aligned to the world standards. Changes are implemented often times aligning to customer demands. Pressure has accelerated my daily tasks and improved time management."
good,Great place to work! Alot of great engineers work there that you can learn alot from.
good,"I oversaw production line work for building, testing, repairing, and retesting of printers on production line. Board level"
good,"Great co-workers to work with."
good,"Daily work was unsteady-we did not know what we faced until the morning meeting.  But overall it turned out okay with teamwork."
good,"good company to start to work out right out of collage."
good,"I obtained a great deal of experience there, but the frequent management change made promotions hard to come by."
good,There are no standard accounting processes across the businesses and therefore the quality of information and presentation are compromised as the businesses compete on how to present the same data.
good,"es una empresa muy muy limpia, con buen ambiente de trabajo, buen servicio de comedor y muy buen reparto de utilidades."
good,"Ik heb het prima naar de zin gehad leuke collega's het werk vond ik wel iets minder maar dat was omdat ik bezig was met mijn vrachtwagen opleiding."
good,"normal work day, duty on time do daily work, lunch, daily work, off time. learned to cope up with different kinds of people. don't argue with your boss just do what he/she says. you have to be patient with other co workers and don't trust anybody. the hardest part is trusting someone and he will only let you down for job promotion, also when they will assign you multiple tasks and you haven't finish your daily routine jobs. enjoyable part of the job is when this multiple tasks assigned to you is done within your shift,, enjoy reporting and endorsement for the next shift."
good,"A typical day at work involved communication, communication, and more communication."
good,work conditions are ok. third shift is probably better it pays more.
good,"It's an OK job, requieres physical effort. It's not a terriffic place for working."
good,TI is good company to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working at Volt @ Texas Instruments, but was always stressed about the job ending."
good,6 days/week
good,"My experience with the Make Organization was one where the product needs over rides the personnel needs for holidays. If a problem comes up, or some special ramp is not on target, personnel will be asked to skip holiday time to correct, or support whatever condition warrants the support. This is the nature of the business. Customers expect it. It is a hard place to be, when you find yourself at an 8am meeting on Easter morning instead of celebrating with your family. To add to that, bonuses are reserved for management, not so much for the team doing the hard work of managing the processes or their improvement. Rewards to individuals are extremely limited, or at the least, very difficult to come by."
good,TI was an good place to work for until our department was bought out by MEMC in 1995.
good,"This job is about being sure to have Heavily detailed cleaning."
good,"Culture and people are great, and everyone is willing to help you get accommodated. Overall, great work life balance unless you are working in manufacturing. Manufacturing at TI is a 24/7 operation so there may be some weekends that will require to be on call but not often (this includes holidays). Overall, it is a great company to work in but there is not a lot of growth opportunities as there are many people who stay in the company for many years. Once a company employee, moving to different business groups (which there are many) can be difficult as they are always looking for similar experience. Management will vary but overall it is not great. You will often find the most technical employees in management role rather the best management skills, which creates confusion on which growth ladder to take."
good,Lots of work for the pay. Contract labors gets alot of shafting and favouritism at the sherman site. Just being honest. Loved it but busting your butt for them just aint enough i learned.
good,The company is too big to make an individual impact.  And if you are geared to make a difference you will struggle against people that have been doing things the same way for too long.
good,"good place to work. people were treated fairly. good benefits. workplace culture friendly and people were helpful. stressful at times."
good,"Business is very stable and high-margin. Employees can expect around 20% profit sharing which is the maximum almost every year. However, there is not much innovation in technologies. TI produces profits helped by the high-yield manufacturing process, not by new or innovative technology."
good,"TI is just another tech company, with less millennial appeal  compared to the competition.   Work atmosphere is okay, but not energetic or filled with much mission or purpose.   Leadership is generally weak and uninspirational, but business has been strong and monetary rewards are highly competitive."
good,"Overall the company is successful, but has not increased market share. The actual group I worked in had poor management with little opportunity to accept new ideas."
good,"My work as a software developer was challenging  since I had to solve intractable bugs in the application.  Still, there were colleagues who I collaborated with to solve these problems. Deadlines and quotas were stressful however."
good,In a typical work day you would have to do the job of two people because they are always running shorthanded. Management is constantly placing pressure to produce more with less. Most people were not happy with there jobs but the benefits were good and the compressed schedule is great for most people.
good,"The company has pretty much the best schedule i have ever had. The shifts are work 3 days and have 4 days off, work 4 days and have 3 days off. Great benefits and at the end of each year there is a profit sharing."
good,"Pros:"
good,"The people are great to work with and are always willing to help.  TI has a very open team based culture that is great for learning.  However, the work load is consistently more than one person can handle.  You have to make a real effort if you want to have a good work life balance."
good,"The title says it all. You are just a number in this big company in Dallas. Although the perks are pretty good, and salary reasonable, you feel dispensible in a sea of workers."
good,I worked in a manufacturing site for TI oversea. The culture is very different between sites. Business people tends to be limited in certain positions and hard to influence decision.
good,"The company has some great people. However, the management staff's quality and ability to lead has greatly declined over the last 10 years. Everyone is overworked and always behind. My first 25 years with the company has been outstanding. Great leaders and workers during that time."
good,"I enjoyed my time overall, but it was a beating towards the end of my tenor. No room to advance. People that make decisions don't actually take the time to see how it will affect the workers."
good,No job security though if hired in as a contractor. I loved the experience though. Seems impossible to be hired in permanently though.
good,"Older company somewhat weak at building and retaining new talent. Work/life balance is fantastic. Management is solid, although company as a whole is less willing to facilitate career growth and development."
good,The sales force heavily recruits for new college graduates with EE and CE degrees.
good,Sressfull environment due to 2009 crisis in France.
good,It can be a stable workplace as long as you do well with an outdated environment. The coworker experience is much like family and you will make life long friendships.  At one time had great benefits but have followed the industry in significantly reducing benefits but the benefits are still considered very good.
good,I worked as a contractor so the benefits were very slim but the people and the work culture was enjoyable. It is a bit tough to get a promotion so be prepared to endure your position.
good,"Texas Instruments value their employee in terms of ethics program and individuals career improvements."
good,Advancement is very hard for technicians. Not too many opportunities to advance. Dead end for most technicians. Health benefits are OK likewise other benefits.
good,"EE tech on Thin Film metal tools. Repair, PM's, write procedures and checksheets for all maintenance on all PVA equipment."
good,"12hr shifts, learned that anyone would enjoy the working environment the company has. Upper management is willing to work the employee hands on. Hardest part is the city, I am country. The employees were family."
good,"TI is a company with a long term vision and strategy, has friendly work environment and highly values team work.  They reward employees for their hard work when annual company goals are met through profit sharing. Internal Networking is key to success."
good,"TI Philippines has a fast paced working environment which enables you to learn quickly and work efficiently to meet daily demands. Managing your time, decision making and prioritization are some of the things you will develop in this company. TI has a great manpower where every team has their own metrics to accomplish that is why team collaboration is must. the most challenging part of the job is meeting daily demands with quality on every task. although with the great support of the company and each team, things get exciting and enjoyable."
good,Every day is different challenge.  I learned how to learn and question everything for root cause problem solving.  Great people to work for and with.  Management makes the tough decisions well.  Hardest part of the job is 24/7 on call nature of manufacturing and constant push to do more with less.  Most enjoyable part of the job is finishing a long development project.
good,"Great people at this company, but there's a maniacal focus on cost. Decision making is very spread out and requires more alignment than should really be needed to make even the simplest of decisions."
good,Great Place to learn and meet intelligent people
good,Baseon the schedules it worked perfectly with my classes and gave me ample time to finish my degree. The main challenges came in moving upward after my school since limited options are available.
good,"I have learned many avenues of technology on the cutting edge. The co-workers are wonderful, the pay is average, and freedom of work schedule is great."
good,"I etched oxide and metal, ran plasma ash and solvent clean. Prior to coming to Texas Instruments I worked construction. Working for T.I. gave me a level of appreciation for getting a large group of people working on various levels of a given device and keeping their efforts coordinated. I enjoyed working with diverse cultures and I felt that T.I. did a great job of instilling a culture of diversity in the workplace."
good,"For a big company, TI is very agile. Which is why job security over the last 5 years have not been an assure thing. They expect a lot out of their people. And, they compensate above average. If you don't excel in a stressful environment do not join TI."
good,"Overall, TI was a great company that had a lot to offer. Unfortunately, if you are not an engineer it can feel a bit lonely. The HR culture is fast paced with deadlines after deadlines. It can feel overwhelming and like you're drowning in the midst of all the chaos. Management needs more training for handling early career employees. After many meetings with management, I did not get any real constructive advice."
good,"It's not a bad company it has great benefits, so if you want a job that has long hours on your feet and you want to do multiple things at once and you don't mind keeping your head down doing as much work as possible working with the fear of not getting raises if you screw up once in a year or for taking more than 3 days off for being sick in a 90-day period, and depending on the workflow not getting days off approved then this company's for you. If you want to move up in the ranks then you better have a degree or there's no chance for real advancement."
good,Texas Instrument is a very diverse company and many areas/skills/expertise to explore with. Its a very safe environment because they are govern with ethical standards.
good,"A good company which fresh graduate student can look for. I learned a lot in this company, Company provide good benefit and compensation to employees."
good,They maintain work life balance. The management is fair in their decision and it is actually a good place to work. Only that the work done does not really commensurate with the pay received.
good,"Typical work day would be myself and three other people running product through machinery as well as inspect the work during the shift we rotated jobs so not one person was doing the same job all day"
good,Working at Texas Instruments allowed me to gain a vast amount of knowledge within the semi-conducting field.
good,I work compressed night shift (12 hrs). Almost no activities for night shifters. Tried to change to new job but was blocked as being too important to be allowed to change. Then forced to job didn't want.
good,"Management wasn't very good, and career advancement was poor.  I applied for several supervisor positions and was well qualified for the job but they went outside of the company to hire instead of hiring from within."
good,"a typical day at Texas Instrument starts with setting up 14 to 16 testers, loading and unloading programs, monitoring and maintaining all testers and documenting any and all errors during your shift.  I've learned team work and the ins and outs of microchips. I had a great management team.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the changes of the semi conductor world. And, the most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with..."
good,Worked in hourly and salary positions. Enjoyed both. Advancement was available.
good,Modern technology took my job.  And lot of other admins.  Rather than help or offer another job within the company rather than lay someone off.  Even if there was a pay cut involved.
good,"The company offers challenging at the same time fun work. "
good,As i Technician Apprentice you will learn a lot from your senior companion. they will help learn new thing even they are busy in repairing other machine.
good,me gusto mi trabajo y l ambiente de trabajo y lo interesante que era su proceso
good,"un dia tipico es tener mucho trabajo para toda la jornada."
good,"Muy bonita empresa, bien agusto para trabajar, pero los mismo que en otras, se queda uno estancado sin dar oportunidad de ascender de puesto, el sueldo es demasiado bajo."
good,"Learned a lot but the atmosphere was fear driven ALWAYS.  To get the most out of talented people, management should NEVER utilize fear.  One should never feel unsafe at work."
good,"A typical work day consisted of several back to back emergency events taking place worldwide in which you were the first contact to organize and notify responders for the event taking place. Large call volume and alarm alerts were a constant thing. You had to multitask and decide what was the most important event at the time, dispatch, do emergency paging, updates and logs.  "
good,Me gusta mucho mi area es la mas complicada y eso nos hace ser más responsables.
good,"A typical day at work your wearing a full smock covering everything but your eyes and then add safety glasses. Standing for 12 hours walking back and forth throughout the fab (up to 6 miles a day) to pick up and drop off material. Being expected to run up to 20 machines alone which take amywhere from 25-200 wafers each machine and when an accident happen and you break 1 out of the 200 you get written up. After several write ups your gone. Very hard on your body, you have to work over a year (sometimes 2) through a temp agency before they Think about converting you into a TI employee with benifits. After beimg there over a year I got the hang of running all those machines alone but I could never get used to wearing that Smock. Pay is pretty good but it would be alot better  with some benifits."
good,This is not at all a great place for Managed IT Services (contractors); Absolutely nonsense model of Embassy and zero work/life balance or flexibility
good,"Management didn't always know what successes each engineer had or contributed to. However, the open door policy is a very good thing, if you can find the particular manager in his/her office."
good,"TIPI baguio is a good working environment is the northern provinces of the philippines.  people are nice, has good work life balance, and work is only 5 days a week.  some departments and section in IT tend to travel more.."
good,Texas Instruments  was great company. It was leading industry at the time. It was 24/7 hours production with very high yields.
good,"Great work culture. "
good,duty cycle is 10/7 & no job satisfaction as there is no technical work.
good,"It is fun working over there. I get to interact with all people and help them out.  Create new accounts, inform new prospect customers about the services we provide.  I also get to do some office and data entry. in charge of receiving phones and transferring to appropriate personnel.  Once a month work on a project of organizing a kids party at the center"
good,I am a part time contract in these 2 groups and looking for the full time job in DFW/TX areas.
good,Great place to start learning about the semiconductor industry. TI gives you lots of exposure to many business units and gives you a wide array of roles to accelerate your career track
good,Environment allows for good educational opportunities to prepare future career growth.
good,"Overall, people are the best asset of the company.  A typical day at work is spent in meetings. You don't always get promoted even when you deserve it.  There is a culture of family and people do look out for each other, but again, unless you are someone's favorite, you don't get the exposure or job advancement."
good,"I really enjoyed my job and my co-workers as I worked there (either for or contracted to Texas Instruments) for the last 19 years. I have made may life long friends working there. As for the work - we consistently met and exceeded the goals, metrics, and SLAs set forth by management. The most enjoyable part of the job was running a successful escalation and minimizing systems downtime or manufacturing interruptions."
good,"It was a fun, friendly and relaxed working environment. Team members were very supportive. Management was also supportive and did not put any pressure on the team about the performance."
good,National Semiconductor was a great place to work with a constructive culture that fostered learning and encouraged interaction with management. Texas Instruments not so much.
good,"Great company to work for. Manufacturing in the other hand is treated poorly. No opportunity for advancement. Too much politics and favoritism.  Would recommend for engineers, designers and testing."
good,"If TI weren't the Layoff King of the tech industry, it would really be a great place to work, with some small but important improvements."
good,"Overall, Texas Instruments is a great place to work.  The hardest and best part of the job is the constant change.  Employees are encouraged to change roles every three years.  TI places a high emphasis on education credentials.  Their commitment to developing employees if demonstrated by their strong focus on continuing education through CPE level classes on various subjects.  TI is a global company with a very fast paced environment.  Employees are expected to adapt their time to meet the needs of a global culture.   This means that office hours are often times different than the normal 8-5 job.  I believe the company, as a whole, is employee friendly on many levels.  And, they are committed to diversity.  There is an expectation that all employees embrace the diverse population and treat others with respect at all times.  The benefits are outstanding and include generous benefit time, insurance, profit sharing, employee stock purchase plan, and 401K match."
good,"Loved the local Federal Market place.  Several of the account managers were very nice.  However,  the development staff in Plano were behind the times.  The company was sold to a competitor."
good,5days
good,Lo bueno que esta empresa es su cultura trabajadora y la seguridad que brinda.
good,"Excited to work and has many activities for the employ. Very innovative company, you'll expect to grow and the company itself will help you and give you a chance to succeed."
good,"Fine place to intern. Nothing special, but not bad experience either. It's a huge company so you don't feel close to people. They also pay pretty fairly in my opinion."
good,"TI was a great company, but I tried doing tech sales and found it wasn't a good fit. They challenged me and gave me mentorship, but the type of role and consequently the manager and I did not work out."
good,"good culture, smart people. They really let you be creative with your solutions so you can definately grow profesisonaly at texas instruments. alot of travel opporunities"
good,"Häufige Umstrukturierungen"
good,A nice place to work and enjoy your career. Great benefits and abundance of different fabs to work in. There are many positions within the fab and one can move from place to place or position to position.
good,I was able to gain more knowledge and experience in a different type of workplace. I learned a lot working here. I was able to be on my feet for the 12 hour shift that i worked there.
good,"Great benefits and pay.  Workplace culture supported work  flexibility, at home work, and life work balance.    A high demand and fast pace environment."
good,Good work environment. Accomodating days and hours. Not enough money. Would return for adequate pay................................................................
good,"TI is a great corporation to work for, with phenomenal benefits. Executive leadership is great. Legal Department is not so great due to poor management/administration of the support staff.  Other TI businesses value support staff, but the legal department does so less than satisfactory."
good,Great opportunities to learn and grow. The company enables technology to be immersed throughout the educational arena. They look for new opportunities to engage and recreate.
good,Great company to get experience but the management structure is top heavy and things tend to take longer than they should. Job stability is based on the business unit and I was laid on 3 different occasions even a management position
good,At first it is very entertaining and educational but once you are accustomed to it you will find yourself doing the same thing every day and it gets boring.
good,"After oil bust in 1982 tons of layoffs but first 2 years worked 6.5 days a week.  When it fell it fell very fast.  We had a 6 month backlog that disappeared in less than a month, so much for forecasts."

good,Es hat wirklich Spaß gemacht in dem internationalem Umfeld bei Texas Instruments zu arbeiten. Fleißige Arbeitsweise wird auch anerkannt. Leider ist die Übernahme für Studenten fast unmöglich da es sehr viele interne gibt. Das Management macht hier leider auch nichts.
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar por existir grande respeito entre os funcionários
good,"Opportunities to advance are plentiful if you're willing to create them. Lots of employee churn, but also lots of leadership learning available to those who stick around."
good,"I've worked for this company 2-3 times on separate occasions each time i was laid off i would say that is one of the biggest concerns they do have very demanding hrs or 12hr days 3 on and 4 off the vice versa but it is a great work life balance if hired on the company has very good benefits and discount programs, the work environment is one you have to get use to especially if working in the clean room you have to wear a full body smock which takes some getting use to, the work is generally easy because the machines does all the work everything is automated for the most part, the pay isn't the best maybe $14-15"
good,Texas Instrument is a very productive company.All the benefits needed by their employees were being provided accordingly.Working in a big company like TI is a great experience.
good,TI tries to keep up with the shifting landscape of technology. They continually develop chips to stay competitive. They phase out obsolete product as needed.

good,the word place so nice to work with but i have to resign because i have to enhance my other skill and to more develop my field that i take in college
good,"Muy buen ambiente y estilo de trabajo diferente, diferente ritmo y muy monotono"
good,"This was a temporary position, and that was the only negative aspect.  The people I worked with were very welcoming and helpful."
good,I support TSK wafer probers specifically installation and unscheduled downtime. I learned a lot about 300mm TSK probers since joining TI however I still have more to learn. Management support is okay since they are fair and balanced. My co workers are fine and are supportive when I need help. The work is a bit heavy but I still enjoy doing it because I really like working on TSK probers.
good,"I worked night shift and followed specifications outlined by engineers on my shift."
good,Best place to start a career with a lot of support from the Management Team. Gained ample of knowledge throughout my journey here and still learning new things day by day. The people are very friendly and it was a great time working and gaining knowledge from the people who have worked here more than 15 years.
good,"Work is steady throughout the day as I field incoming emails (90%) and calls concerning the program. There are times during the year when the workload will pick up quite a bit (coinciding with typical school schedules) and a decent amount of overtime may be required to stay on top of things. Most of the time I work alone (not micro-managed) although there are department meetings at times to make sure everyone is aligned or to inform us when there are new products, promotions, contests, etc. Our business processes continue to evolve so management tends to be fairly open minded to everyone's ideas or suggestions. Co-workers are pleasant to engage. The best perk of the job is the ability to work remotely when needed. An overall good experience."
good,"Fun to be with old people because i learned a lot from i love their advice, with them they will teach us on how to do  the work in enjoyable and fun way.For the management its good also the benefits."

good,I learned a great deal about starting up a new organization and customer service and support. I have very supportive co-workers who encourage and mentor each other continually. The hardest part of the job is wanting to do whatever it takes to win with the customers and not having enough time to touch them all.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping someone internal or external solve a problem/design.
good,Nice palce to work except 12 hour shift is tiresome. Not easy to change working shifts.
good,Very good place to work for in general. Certain groups can be very dangerous

good,Always busy with emergencies and etc in the SCC. T.I. has it's own emergency center.
good,I worked as a Co-Op engineer at Texas Instruments in the early 2000s when I was completing my Bachelors degree. I enjoyed my time at TI. The pay was great for a college kid.

good,Smart people. Good diversity. A lot to learn. Various growth opportunities. Good talent program. Good Young Graduate program. Good trainings. Not as innovative as it could be.
good,"Pretty good place to work- If you end up working in a group that works on government contracts you stand a good chance of getting laid off depending on who’s the president of the United States - IE: Republican -no problem, Democrat - could get laid off.

good,"A typical day involved developing leading edge tools for automating the design of integrated circuits in the early days of this technology. Each day involved researching and developing algorithms, writing code and testing, resolving bugs in existing code, consulting with engineers on issues related to the software and developing processes and tools for managing code development cycles. I learned how to be part of a development team and to interface with a variety of people who had various levels of understanding of what the team was working on.  I enjoyed collaborating with a large number of people and driving the code forward until it was successfully working to feed circuit designs into production.  I also had the great pleasure of coauthoring a technical paper with my supervisor for presentation to a major technical conference.  The hardest part of the job was balancing an ever changing set of demands to work on both development and maintenance efforts with the software since our team had to do both. The most enjoyable part was consulting and developing solutions to seemingly impossible problems and seeing circuit designs go into production."
good,Keyifli ve olumlu bir calisma ortami. Kisisel gelisime acik bir calisma faaliyeti

good,"programar actividades diarias, revisar con el jefe inmediato los  pendientes del día anterior , revisar prioridades."
good,The company pertained four twelve hour shifts that model competition in production goals. An imperative meeting was conducted after the first six hours of each shift to either ensure the success of goals or to explain any issues that may cause failure of the achievement.
good,Schedules varies during first shift for non-exempt employees due to nature of projects and deadlines. I've learned increased sense of urgency due to the nature of customer engagement with international partners and production schedules. Hardest part is working under pressure with difficult personalities striving to achieve company goals in a quick manner. Most enjoyable part was maintaining relationships and building connections. The benefits after stress were rewarding.

good,I learned how uniformity of guidelines and services at a workplace could be both productive and counterproductive.
good,I worked at TI as an Intern for about 9 months. You can learn a lot from all the experts there. I didn't like the management that much though.
good,Good company to work for based on the position your working. There is not a lot of opportunity for advancement if your working in the clean room environment and pay is below the industry standards. I would only recommend working there if you need extra income and only plan on working for the company 5 years. After that you will definitely notice the diminish in pay increases and the lack of opportunity to grow. The health benefits are above average and the retirement compensation is average.
good,Loved the fast pasted moving of production. people were professional knowlegeable. I was able to train on many machines to be able to train and expidite production
good,Gotta get up and go to the store to pick up a few things that I can get my hands on your hips and legs.

good,"workplace culture is awesome"
good,Cool job with benefits and paid holidays. 3 days on 4 days off one week and then its 4 days on 3 days off the following week. 12 hour shifts. Opportunity to advance in company

good,"- Very competitive salary and benefits"
good,"Productive workplace, fast  paced,  you will learn fast and learn many things."
good,Gave an opportunity to develope skills and learn new one. Work ethics got better from previous mistakes ( lesson learnes) . Goal of the company is the utmost priority
good,interesting place but too many restraints that keep you from doing a better job. some of the saftey requirements make it more difficult and dagerous to use them to do the job.
good,"typisch amerikanische Firma, schlechte Karriere Moeglichkeiten, relativ gute Bezahlung, wenn man dafuer kaempft."
good,"Texas Instruments is a well-known company in semi-conduct industry. TI focus on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which account for more than 80 percent of our revenue."
good,"Excellent venue for young engineers with lots of opportunities when starting out in a professional field.  Facilities, tools, network, and management structure are excellent."
good,"good equipment, training where necessary, clean work space."
good,"You know every day what you'd be doing.  Work was good.  If you were there on time every day and were consistent in your work output, things were great."
good,"Always high expectation from the management but limited budgets. There is a good culture of resolving issue by utilizing the 3 x 5 why. Less concern about worker's feeling, be prepared to be humiliated in meeting in front of everybody if you make mistake. The hardest part of the job is never hard, take it positively and you'll be able to make it through. Most enjoyable part of the job is that the leniency whereby you are able to do your work your own way, as long as you get it done."
good,I always fondly think of the days I worked at TI.  All cross-functional teams worked very well with each other.  Internal transfers were always viewed as opportunities for learning by management.
good,"Like any place, it depends on your manager. My manager was god-awful and made my life terrible. But as I looked around, I saw other managers who were better and supported their staff."
good,"Very good workplace. The mindset is very clear, one goal."
good,"Open Excel, read emails. solve problems. go home. The work environment was competitive, but also about rank. If you were new, you were treated like a new. Not one intern out of 6 from UTD took the job."
good,its a good to be a part of TI. There is much opportunity you can explore if you have a chance to be there. Easy can gain knowledge if you always mingle with positive people.
good,An average and big company. Different groups have very different culture. Joining a good group with good manager is important. Engineers are paid below average. Work-life balance is OK.
good,Stayed so busy didn't have time to socialize with other employees.  Hardest part of the job was constantly working around other people while trying to get your job done.
good,"Always pushes for the best outcome both for the employees and the company. Always gives the needed trainings and seminars, rewards the performance of the employees & encourages positive working environment"
good,"Texas Instruments decided to move away from wireless industry - while that was a tough decision, it proved itself to be correct and thus the management strategy."
good,"This was my first stop on a career in electronics."
good,"Company does not put emphasis on furthering education or developing talent internally. Compensation, benefits, and perks (such as travel), are very nice, but you stand a chance of getting stuck in one role your whole career."
good,"I was one of very few female engineers. I was treated with lot of respect from  my co-workers. However, i realized i was not paid fairly, in fact way below industry standard. I did stay back for my manager, who was a great person to work with. He allowed me to get involved in project beyond my pay grade and helped me grow beyond my role, this helped me understand a lot about the business and helped me get to my next job."
good,Working at Texas Instruments was a decent experience. Not much emphasis on innovation but a very relaxed environment to say the least. I would recommend working at the company to anyone.
good,"Once in Texas Instruments you are involved immediately and learn to run fairly quickly.  It is fast pace; however, it is a good way to pick up lots of information and become a contributor in a short amount of time.  You will find that you can learn something from all of your colleagues."
good,"The company and it's culture is a very good place to start learning corporate things. The company hires new college graduates, technicians with 2-year courses and undergraduates."
good,"The company is good and the people are good to work with, but it is a high pace environment to work in.  You need to constantly improve to be compensated well. Company provides profit sharing but is the same regardless of position throughout the company. Be prepared for consistently changing environment."
good,"Working from home is possible as long as you are internet capable in you house."
good,Small office in Toronto writing programming tools for the TI chip sets. I do not know if they do that in Toronto anymore. Interesting place to work. I believe that they eventually outsourced these products.
good,i enjoy working at texas instruments coz i learn new things about semiconductor company. how integrated circuit was made of. i enjoy work when i learn new things
good,The company gives good benefits. Work is balanced because of shift work. In terms of advancement it is difficult really difficult. Working environment is good.

good,"High caliber employees, so wonderful to work with."

good,A learning process for me and to enjoy the company of my co workers. I have develop skills in this company that my supervisor has thought me and apply it in a daily basis. I am happy working in T.I but opportunity had come so i had decided to grab that opportunity and have a growth to my career here in dubai.
good,"Liked working there a lot, learned something new every day. The people where great to work with, and the hours where great, the only thing with working for Texas Instruments, was I was working for a temp. service, and there was'nt any benefits."

good,Work is routinary and most of it are computer based. There are still paper works but it is minimal. The work area are standardize and systematic. The management treats its employees fairly and equally. And that i have learned a lot here specially on the accounts payable process and how to use SAP in line of the work that is given to me.
good,"Great team work"
good,"TI provides fair avenue of improvement to its employees with annual certification & training required by the company & its quality standards. (ISO9001/ESH/TS16949/ES14000/Six Sigma, etc.)"
good,Lot of work and I have 4 areas I support daily. Hardly seem my supervisor. Work mainly alone.
good,"One dimensional work flow"
good,"Great place to work in the 1980s, especially for young relatively inexperienced engineering professionals. Interesting work, unusual level of responsibility great growth potential. Succumbed, do extensive reductions of defense spending in the early 1990s. went through several iterations of downsizing and was eventually sold to Raytheon in the mid 1990s."
good,"Worked in purchasing of raw materials for production of computers."
good,"There is not much outside of work at TI.  extra cirricular and fun activities are not really promoted.  However, the work atmosphere is casual.  jeans and tennis shoes are appropriate.  time is not heavily monitored as long as your work is accomplished."
good,Important growth businesses are understaffed to be successful.
good,"Productive driven, worked 12 hr shift most of it on your feet. Great people diverse culture."

good,Working for a class 1 clean room wafer fab can be a fun and exciting environment to learn semiconductor processing and product development.
good,"Durante el tiempo que permanecí en TI México, fue agradable y enriquecedor en conocimiento, me di cuenta de que es muy diferente el ámbito industrial pero a la vez agradable ya que el trabajo en equipo es prioridad para sacar adelante a la empresa."
good,Cool place. Long shifts. One of the better paying employers in Maine. Great benefits. Good culture. Clean room environment is interesting to work in .
good,"For those scientifically curious and can handle 12 hour workdays, TI will be a good place to work.  You will have seven days off in a two week period.  I loved it coming from the food service industry.  Management focus is on production and cost.  They run very lean.  I didn't find the job itself to be very difficult but the uncertainty around it during downturns.  For me, the two most enjoyable parts were learning the details of how chips are made and the people.  I absolutely loved the people I worked with in my module and on my shift."
good,"You can be sure that you are protected from harassment, so you can work at your full potential. Also, you can bring anything on the table; introduce new concepts, solutions, ideas, to solve your day-to-day problems. The solutions are acknowledged, and the best are rewarded handsomely."
good,"Company was not good in 80s when I join. The culture become change in 90s and become quite well after that.  Company has high ethic standard. It is a work orient company, sometimes is boring. It does not offer perk for employee like most high tech company may do. It does not even provide free coffee in work place.  Financially It did well and we have very good profit sharing in last few years.  Overall a ok but not great company to work for."
good,A well developed and cultured environment to work. A good training in safety and welfare of workers. One key thing introduced to all staff are ethics and morals
good,"Enjoyed working there and gained professionally.  Work environment is collegial and supportive.  Company is managed for share holder return, but has lost a lot of its historical strength as a semiconductor industry innovator"
good,"Working at TI was very good at the beginning for years, Good Benefits and Pay, But everything went left n had layoffs after layoffs, you never know rather u was on the chopping board or not"
good,"Ability to go management path or technical path.  Allows people to focus on what interest them.  Also have marketing, engineering, project management and business paths."
good,"TI was a solid place to work, offered opportunities and mobility.  I was allowed to learn a wide variety of job skills.  Typical days were 9-10 hours and weekends if necessary.  In last position 12-13 hour shift work."
good,"Quick challenging pace."
good,"It is a company that offers great opportunities, but you need to be in the right division and especially it benefits you if you are local in Dallas. Innovation is mostly done on HW, so SW is still seen as an enabler but the culture is changing"
good,"Everything and everyone was great except for the manager I ended up reporting to. I arrived as an intern and my manager had no projects or work assignments for me, and didn't reserve any time on their test stations for me (test engineering intern). Ended up working a lot of 5pm-1am hours to get very mundane work successfully accomplished only to have him block my application to other positions. TI is a great company and I met a lot of great people there, but as anyone knows a bad manager can ruin a lot of otherwise great things."
good,Overall a good company but not excellent to work for.  Company sometimes fails to properly anticipate markets and therefore has difficulty keeping up with fast moving technologies.
good,Moved from Manufacturing position to Engineering. Overseeing processes and Quality. I work with very little supervision and have many Operators that look to me for guidance when they have questions or issues.
good,The company provides outstanding benefits and takes care of employees.  It is a large corporation which has its pluses and minuses.  Overall I was very appreciative of my time with TI. They paid well and strove to continuously improve in all aspects of their products.
good,"It was a government contractor.  I was in maintenance and we were under allot of pressure to keep the machines running and production at 100%.  "
good,"Once in Texas Instruments you are involved immediately and learn to run fairly quickly. It is fast pace; however, it is a good way to pick up lots of information and become a contributor in a short amount of time. You will find that you can learn something from all of your colleagues."
good,"great work life balance, supportive manager, somewhat repetitive projects, minimum training opportunities, scarce conversion opportunities for contractors"
good,"Operates 2-4 machines per day with different specifications. Then follow each machines specified data. Following 5s everyday to make the workplace comfortable. Higher positions monitors their operator to maintain a  good and healthy relationship with each other. Communicating with others makes the work easier and enjoyable, sharing some ideas to improve ones capability."
good,"It was a good experience working in this company a lot of things learned and a lot of friends earned,diff'rent cultures and diff'rent people I've met."
good,"Relatively flat management structure which is good,  however,"
good,Challenging experience with complexity in terms of issues. It is fun working in TI with accommodating members team members and a lot of experience sharing that an employee could learn so much.
good,Completed my final year project at TI. Challenging work and good work life balance.  Colleges are very supportive and helpful. Excellent infrastructure.
good,Best part of working in TI is that it lets you set your own schedule and it helps you grow by giving free tuition money. It has a profit sharing program that divides the profit among all the employees
good,"Performed troubleshooting, debug, repair all Customer Returned products. Upgraded, modified configuration of software for customer's product. Testing, and calibrate new products. Trained new entry level technician in test area"
good,"Management above me in the factory was hit or miss. Excellent co-workers. Technical competency is a must. Fabrication environment can be very challenging, but I found it to be an overall positive job. Just not for everyone."
good,"work life balance is good, management is ok, good for first job. great place to learn design and related knowledge. over all is a good place to work"
good,The work life balance is good since I can be at home early and also can play basketball during lunch time. Management is also very approachable.
good,"Great place to work, always a chance to move up in this company.  The culture of this company is also great, they value education and will reimburse for their employees."
good,"I worked for TI for almost 17 years. For the most part, I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. The negatives about the company was the slow process of losing things we used to enjoy. Used to have quarterly bonuses and those slowly disappeared. Constant worries over whether the company is going to close and ship everything overseas."
good,"Pros: TI has a good office culture and great flexibility. Supportive coworkers and great management. Work is fairly fast-paced."
good,Assigned in QFN Assembly Operation where im assigned as Equipment Technician and to sustain  the production line  through machine troubleshooting and providing corrective and preventive action to various issues and also assigned as  conversion champion in our shift.The verry challenging and enjoyable  in a part of Equipment Technician is when you are encountering hard down error of machine and you have a couple of time to fix it.
good,Working 8 hours a day 6 days a week;i have learned how to repair and troubleshoot machine in less time; i have learn to manage my time in everyday schedule;
good,"Respectful and lovely"
good,"A good place to have started my work career."
good,"Great working conditions and knowledgeable and friendly co-workers, unfortunately no job security."
good,"TI is a great place to work - they pay well, there are plenty of opportunities to advance and climb up the latter. Good amenities, nice people overall. Unfortunately, the company is controlled by the shareholders... this is a bad thing when it comes to employee retention and layoffs....record profit margins for TI in 2014 and yet they still layoff 1200 employees world-wide. The company is moving away from leading edge research and technology such as wireless, micro processors, etc (because competitors are just beating them in the market, to put it frankly) but they are maintaining their large volume share in the IC world and raking in as much money as they can from that. Find a good, sustainable business unit at TI and things should go well."
good,"Overrall it is great place to work, you can always find some resource to resolve your problem."
good,"typical day: design boards, debug IC bugs, write Firmware"
good,"•	Worked as Software System Intern at Texas Instruments[May2013-August 2013]"
good,Best working experience and the best co-worker team. Unfortunately site closure due to mgmt money savings. Valuable talent was lost.
good,Overall Texas Instruments is great place to work.  Most everyone is excellent.  Its culture is very conservative and management style leans more towards execution rather than innovative new products.
good,Always have some of the best people in the business from the top down in all parts of the organization.
good,Productive workplace; was employed for 17 yrs; very diverse atmosphere.
good,"You spend your days working an assembly line or watching over the assembly line on the process of creating microchips.The management was good, the hardest part of the job is when you get busy, you get very busy. The most enjoyable part is the people you work with. "
good,Texas Instruments has a great working environment with many resources at it's disposal. I'd recommend getting your first 2 years experience here and then moving on to a more specialized firm or starting your own business.
good,"Texas Instruments is a fair place to work with an excellent work/life balance. Everybody I met was fair, friendly and extremely knowledgeable."
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Had good job security. Started as a security officer and transfered to a Supervisor position in the cleaning services.
good,High volume of very varied product lines. Excellent team inspired work ethics.
good,"There is no micro-management at Texas Instrument, you always have time to learn from others at work."
good,My co-workers have become like family over my 33 years at TI. The management are friendly and speak to you. I have learned to be diverified. The hardest part of my job is getting time off on vacation and weekends. Seniority does not help at TI it is first come first serve. I have enjoyed doing my job for the last 17 years in probe. There has been some up and downs and a lot of supervision has changed. I have had more supervisors then I have years at TI.
good,"Originally started up by engineers for production of oil exploration and military hardware, Texas instruments has evolved into an intenational semiconductor manufacturerin power. Research and innovation have always been at the core of Texas Instrument's success."
good,The company means business and is well organized. We set and meet aggressive deadlines and things run very smoothly
good,"productive place with a lot of  diversity and respect for culture.  Allows one  a high chance to grow professionally and mentally. Flexible schedule that promotes a good work, life balance."
good,"stressful but fun. "
good,"Buen ambiente, debes mantener orden en tu lugar de trabajo, contestar los correos adjuntando a todas las personas involucradas, terminar a tiempo, me gustó mucho porque aprendí sobre las importaciones en la vida real ya que es muy diferente en teoría.  Las personas son amables y te brindan atención y apoyo cuando se los pides."
good,"Good management culture, open door policy is good for building up relationship with management team. But technology capability will need a breakthrough."
good,"Team Leader in the DMOS5 Wafer Fab, job functions: Work hands on with the Process and Engineering and Integration teams to identify and resolve process and equipment issues while processing 8mm wafers using proper processes and procedures in the pre-production stage (New Design). Member of the ISO9000 -9001 quality assurance team, hiring team and the process audit team."
good,"Texas Instruments is a company focused on sales performance and profitability. It is very field-oriented and offers all the modern elements necessary for the efficiency of its employees."
good,"Worked here for 8 years under different organizations in the company. Good place to learn new stuff."
good,I enjoyed growing and learning with this company however due to poor management at the end of my time there I chose to move forward. I do not hold this experience against my overall experience with the company.
good,"Really great pay and benefits, Still a very good company to work for but it seems the bottom line and head count have become the most important factors."
good,"High energy, fast paced place to work. Great teaming environment and great people. Engineering, type A personality haven. Flexible for some jobs and good corporate ethics."
good,"Applied many technical works related to my field of specialization"
good,Good pay and benefits package. Great colleagues to work with. Fun and enjoyable atmosphere. Management depends on who you get but most are great and relatable people.
good,"Working within a team focused on a goal is the most enjoyable work I have experienced.  Seeing a project develop and grow gives you a sense of accomplishment.  Working side by side, especially in a lab, is just fun.  It's not so much about the job, its enjoying each other's company and learning from others experiences."
good,"Good management and nice work place."
good,TI is a great engineering company full of very smart people that work together to achieve collective goals. I would always recommend this company to any engineer that is looking for a fun and challenging career.
good,Texas Instruments invented the modern integrated chip (IC).  It has a long history of innovation.  It needs smart people to continue this drive toward excellence.
good,"Great company, good benefits, nice people.  Environment depends on the BU and manager.  They offer lots of opportunities for training and advancement.  With every large corporation there is a lot of politics.  Every couple of years upper management changes the priorities and makes decisions that disrupt the work environment.  They have recently remodeled and are trying to compete with Google and improve their image with adding ping pong tables, places to grill, large scale chess sets, etc."
good,They work a compressed work week. 3 days at 12 hours a day then 3 days off with a swing swift every other week. I was on nights. It was a hard schedule to get used to balancing family with small children.
good,"I enjoy my job at TI. The work environment if great. Good co-workers and great management team. Excellent benefits including profit sharing. Outstanding resources provided to all employees. The company is big on charity, highly focused on United Way. Lots of initiatives such as Chinese, Korean, Hispanic, LGBT."
good,Working for this company was a great opportunity for me.  They encouraged teamwork and personal growth through training seminars that were well put together and included interaction from the employees.
good,Pager calls at all hours because production must flow at all times in a 24/7 facility.  Great management team for the most part.  Good pay but high stress.
good,"If you're willing to give them your life, you'll make a good money. If life throws you a curve and that changes, it'll cost you.  It was definitely  a ""what have you done for me lately"" culture."
good,"Pretty standard task.  Limited advancement within the MFG group.  It would be a huge benefit to obtain a degree prior to hiring with this company."
good,Your analytical skills are tested and maxed. too much pressure from everyone around. Benefits are great especially the profit sharing. HR are always fault finders.
good,Good learning experience with good mix of customers from different sectors. Good work life balance but have to be ready to work with different time zone across the globe
good,"Worked nights and 12 hr shifts. Enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a high stress job to always race against the clock to make timely repairs. Also, worked on trouble-shooting and maintenance on approx. 30 tools."
good,"A failure analyst with two shfting 8am to 4pm and 3pm to 11pm work per day. "
good,An enjoyable work environment where everyone is willing to help each other achieve company goals.  Great leadership and flexible work life balance.
good,"As an intern I was given a large say in my project and the direction it went. My boss was great. And the other interns, all of whom had their own projects, were all very motivated and encouraged me to perform at my best."
good,"friendly and fun work place to work, the employees in their had their own place to work, they have Assembly area and Test Area. Assembly Area is where the materials are exposed so the apparels that they are closed while in the Test Area the materials are already encapsulated so the apparel they used are not like in the Assembly Area. Texas Instruments are making Chips that we are probably using today."
good,"For me, its been fun and challenging that I work on this company. My job takes me to different areas and different responsibilities which gives me more interest and focus to my job. Also I did not feel boring since my responsibilities keeps changing. The only thing that makes me sad on this company is the incentives and salary. As time passed, some incentives are removed and the salary for the technicians become unfair."
good,A typical work day starts with checking the mails analyzing the assigned IMS Requests and complete the task sent URL to the client for initial review then based on inputs from the product owners make changes again sent the updated page URL for the final review.
good,"Hardest part of the job is not having much support from the client (Texas Instruments) when needed. Some people act like we are still in High School (talking behind other people's back but act nice to them when they are around that same person they talk bad about). This is a business and should be conducted in such a manner."
good,One of the leading companies in the semiconductor market. The work environment promotes innovation and growth. Cutting edge technology and some of the brightest minds in the industry.
good,Entreprise qui était intéressante par la variété de ses métiers et de ses projets.
good,"This was a great place to work an overnight shift.  I was able to concentrate more at night which help me progress and develop my troubleshooting skills.  Had the pleasure to work with a few good managers and some great co-workers.  The job itself was easy I had no difficulties performing any operations. Training new comers to operate machinery was probably the hardest part of my job, but I really enjoyed the process of training others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie between me and my co workers. Some of us still keep in touch to this day."
good,A typical work day is as dynamic as the technology industry. Each day has new challenges and tends to never be the same from day to day.
good,"Texas instruments is a good company to work for I have been their for 3 years, the only thing is they have a lot of layoffs. But if you are a good worker that is something you don't have to worry about"
good,"Since I was a summer intern, I was handled a project which involved robust work by just changing some parameters and running the simulations. The other part of my work involved presenting the results and suggesting the best parameters to be included into the design. Typical work will have a couple of meetings and a lot of play. They a separate building for sports and recreational activities. It is really good. I spent a lot of time at table tennis and basket ball court."
good,Internationales Unternehmen mit gutem kollegialen Umfeld
good,"The group I support is great.  Very friendly people and open to new ideas.  Impressed that there is a diverse workforce and that employees stay for a long time. There are opportunities to move around in different roles within same group and even outside of your group. On the flip side (similar to other companies), some managers get nervous of change and losing their ""best performer"" -- stifling employee development and growth."
good,"This is a great place to obtain and polish up on many different skills. The different paths you can take at Texas Instruments is pretty impressive, and there's a good network of people there."
good,Good place to work. Very good benefits and pay. Was not satisfied with Volt manager. Did not handle situations very well.
good,A great place to get started in the industry but it can sometimes move a bit too slowly.
good,"Worked as an Android developer in their products.In Application, framework and middleware layer."
good,"Worked on the night shift a typical day at work was to monitor the wafers in the Fab and make sure that the mix was flowing properly. I learned that what the Fab produces in numbers per one wafer is tremendous and what they are used for. I experienced working under a couple of different managers , overall the management team was average . Co-workers here were outstanding and very  helpful group of people . The hardest part was the night shift and 12 hour shifts . The most enjoyable part was that the work was very easy to learn and because of the process  you had to stay awake to get the job done, this place is 24 hour 7 days a week."
good,"Long and challenging day to day role"
good,"I started my carer at TI. This is place where anybody can grow his career, learn a lot of things and start taking initiatives from the day 1 of your career."

good,"Started in inventory control transferred to Secirity for seven years."
good,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS has a good management and enjoyed working with my co-workers
good,"A typical day primarily involved heavy customer service interaction for a multitude of accounts."
good,"Very technical, always learning something new.  It has been said that TI stands for the ""training institute""."
good,It was a great job. Not much overtime was needed because I worked on government projects. Co-workers were great and professional. The hardest part of the job is to stay technically updated and to come up with great ideas to improve the job. The most enjoyable part of the job back then was to tell people that I worked for TI.
good,"Overall a good company to work for, plenty room to excel. Very casual working environment, do not need to dress up. Co-workers are nice."
good,"Great work life balance & focus on employee safety. Excellent fringe benefits such as educational reimbursement, employee discounts, etc"
good,"working 12 hrs shifts aren't for everyone ,but you can get used to it. The more processes you learn the more responsibility they give you. Most of the days are very busy and productive. The job required you to stand for hours on your feet."
good,i plan my first day at work by means of convincing myself that GOD was always there at my side to guide me and give me strength.
good,"Very stable and competitive company."
good,im just ojt in this company but i enjoy work here because my co-worker are friendly they help you on your machine when you have a lot of output.they cheer you up
good,"you need to coordinate your work with headquarter, so it less flexibility if you are working here, not in Dallas. Plus  more bureaucracy for any new proposal or movement"
good,They had actively activites for staff.Enviroment were healthy and safely to work.They really strict for disipline and sop but a little lack in management
good,Need to thinking out of the box and require more knowledge. Have to be fast-learner with minimum supervisor.Environment of work was friendly with the help from Supervisor
good,TI has the best security and cleanliness. The work area alone benefits the employees a lot because of the ambiance the people and the work ethics they comply in. the work/ duties are easy to adapt with patience and learning.
good,Great place to work with amazing people that are willing to help you grow. I enjoyed working with people from different background. I also learnt a lot from my mentor.
good,"benifits is ok but work is so hard due to 1cluster consist  30 machines  only 1 person repairing and isolating 2 clusters. Also salary incress they base in youre performance in future projects , if you dont have a project you cant get a high incress of youre salry"

good,Neat clean work environment. Friendly and helpful work staff. Goals are set and met every year. Supportive counterparts in a team oriented environment. Incentives for performance are provided.
good,I enjoying a lot while we are  in post test area and inspecting units. But sometimes people are not friendly. They easily mad but not all people who worked there is like that. Mostly I encountered friendly people of course.
good,"It is very good place to learn technically and be productive and to apply what we've learn from experiences."
good,Ti has a very nicely organized internship program which helps fresh college graduates to gain skills from industry experts. My mentor and manager helped me a lot.
good,"The workplace and people are very friendly. For me it was always fun to work with them. I learned a lot of things not just work related, but related to personal and professional life, work ethics. TI employee's inputs helps improve every aspect of work life balance. Only tough thing was to cope with zero tolerance towards wrongdoings."
good,TI is a great and safe company to work for. However the size of it is daunting and they aren't as much focused on design. The team I was working on cut part of their design down because they didn't think there was room for more innovation in the area.
good,A good company for beginner to start their career as intensive training will be provided and  fully support from other departments to achieve the objective.
good,"The day starts with answering emails and providing proper disposition on lots with issues. "
good,"in the factory it is important to have a discipline in the premises of the company in order to manage your time and make productive in the workplace,also the area is so clean and the machines are very useful for ic production"
good,"The company left the Czech Republic."
good,"Great benefits, safe workplace environment, opportunity for education and advancement.  Management practiced open door policy and welcomed employee feedback.  I was also treated fairly by TI and was satisfied with compensation. Opportunity to build a good retirement through 401K.  I retired after 30 years of service, but in retrospect wish I had worked another 10-15 years. Great company that has survived so many years by the hard work of innovative employees."
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Texas Instruments more than that with any other company.  The company expected performance but also provide the environment and opportunity to succeed."
good,"Authored project and technical process documentation for pioneering real-time digital money transfer network. Oversaw documentation library, bookshelf, page help, version control, and change management."
good,TI was a good place to work. During that time period the market for semiconductor memory chips was very competitive and the market fluctuated a lot. There were always risks of lay-offs.
good,I worked for ti for a long time. Ir was a good company. I designed analog and mixed-signal circuits for many various applications and for many different customers.
good,It was a decent place to work as I was checking in and welcoming the members of the fitness facility. I would maintain the facility and the programs we had planned for the month.
good,the environment was very collaborative and a great place to learn your trade.. we were making military products so there was great pride in what we did to get it right the first time.
good,"great projects"
good,"I was only working for Texas Instruments because they bought the Santa Cruz, CA Fab from Silicon Systems where i was working at the time. 12 hour shifts were doable because break time was spent at the oceans edge! Enjoyed constant cross training opportunities 12 hour compressed work weeks gave you 3 alternate 4 days off a week. Excellent benefits and profit sharing."
good,"Texas Instruments was not my first vocation choice. I came out of college wanting to teach. I took the job because I was interested in the technology and various writing techniques. The entire time I worked for TI I worked as an adjunct instructor at variously colleges in Dallas. "
good,"good company to work, good environment, good training and career development."
good,worked a compressed shift and all the overtime i could handle. Learned up semiconductor manufacturing. The management was good. Enjoyed my time at TI it allwas good
good,My overall review regarding TI is that it is a company that helps its employees grow with the company. I learned how to go out of my comfort zone because the management helped me discover my other skills that I never knew I had.
good,"Very fast paced.  Lack of support in laboratory work groups in order to prepare for next generation needs.  The manufacturing areas generate money and understandably receive upgraded equipment, but laboratories need upgrades every few years as well and they are many times overlooked."
good,good work place but pay is not good for what you are asked to do.   good place to get experience don't hang around to long the prize for working 25 years is a gold watch
good,I hired on to TI as a young man just out of tech school. I worked in the Sherman fab as a tech and was king of the fab for several years. I was given a great project and was successful in designing and implementing a modification to a tool that greatly improved its operation. Unfortunately I was seduced by another company for more money and I have never been as happy as I was at TI years ago.
good,"I worked mainly on their servers running UNIX. I also took care of the legacy running DX10 and DNOS. TI's home grown operating system."
good,"I spent 16 years working for this company, and I would do it again. There were plenty of job opportunities internally and there was also challenging and rewarding work available."
good,"Good work life balance, however getting raises are difficult. The corporate environment is collaborative and almost everyone is willing to help you achieve your projects."
good,"In my last role I ended up working in a very stressful position with poor management, but in my other roles at Texas instruments I found the company fabulous. They really took care of me and provided amazing benefits. The company makes a big point to retain its employees for the remainder of their career."
good,Batch auditing and filing.  Research stock adjustments. Self-directed work place. Given job scope and latitude to complete work.  Management very supportive of career goals.
good,great place to work.   management was very good.   goals were spelled out clearly.  lots of training for employees with regards to technical issues.    it was highly encouraged for employees to take advantage of training programs.   lots of good interaction between all engineering groups.
good,There's always a culture of continuing growth and productivity. The management are always in continuing alert and awareness for the organizational growth and complacency is not permitted. Challenges on the job is when there's an urgent issue on quality from the production's output. As when the business is in good swing it entails bonuses and other extra premiums.
good,"The people I worked with were all great to work with, but working anywhere but the HQ in Dallas seems isolating and doesn't present many opportunities to advance or take on a different role."
good,It is a place where you work on exciting new technologies and where the growth is in your hands. The work culture is extremenly open and your view is respected.
good,It was new and enticing in a clean room operation with the smacks i was the depot department lead making sure all the start up chips was done working 3 days in and 4 days out and 4 days in and 3 days out
good,"Texas Instruments provided good benefits and was great about 401K, stock purchase, insurance; etc.  However, work atmosphere was difficult to adjust to."

good,great place to work. twelve hour shifts take some getting used to but you get three days off one week and four days off the next. it is a good job for those looking for fab work.
good,"This was my first experience working in the semiconductor industry when I graduated from ITT, this was an excellent starting point for my career.  Met a lot of interesting people from all over the country and from around the world."
good,"A day at work will start by checking emails, then followed by debrief of the previous day and objectives for the day. I learned how to be an active communicator, and how to manage and work with people of different cultures. The company engages its employees in decision making and empowered them in doing their job. The hardest part of the job was to deal with the frequent changes on how to do things. The most enjoyable, was how easy it was to get along with team members and work has a team."
good,Nice place to work. Get to learn many new things each day. Nice enjoyable work atmosphere. Good compensation. Hard part is that they expect a lot from you. It gets a little too stressful sometimes.

good,"Over the past sixteen years, I worked with some great managers, co-workers and customers. When you have a great team to work with, the problems are easier to resolve and no obstacle is too large to tackle."
good,The Texas Instruments Philippines team was a great experience. This semiconductor site was a great place to start training as an Electronics Engineer because they trained and taught us about each and every process the site contained. Every team of TIPI were upfront with any kind of information within their prospective areas. The engineers knew how and what to do if anything happened.
good,"Loading trucks and filling barrels. I use to label the barrels as well."

good,"Decent Job, decent pay to say the least. If you are someone who is comfortable in one area for years than this is the job for you."
good,Responsible for performing technical tests and experiments for engineering in the wafer fabrication area of semiconductor manufacturers.
good,"Basically, my work depends on the job being requested by the clients. Say for example they need my research first before my analysis so , I have to be flexible in dealing with the deadlines and in dealing with priorities. My timetable is being monitored all the time. I have learned to be focused on time, always looking for the best way to meet deadlines with the best results I could give. The management were also very helpful in giving us the helpful facts in access with the said research and analysis. My co-workers doesn't mind my own work since they have different topics and research to accomplish, yet eventhough it is the situation, they are willing to lend a hand if I need one. The hardest part of the job is when deadlines were at the same time so pressure is on. Need to be calm at all times. And also, the shifting of schedules will likely have an effect on the deadlines set. The most enjoyable part is that the enjoyment and achievement it gives to me as a professional and of course handling pressure all the way."

good,we work in shifting schedule....
good,"I work the walk up help desk, take phone calls, and and work a ticketing system."
good,working @ TI each day is filled with new problems to find and fix. i have learned that you do not know all about problems with tools and have a lot to learn each and every day. managment is some one like you and they learn about you as you learn about them. co workers are good people and help as the day goes on. finding out you did something wrong and need to pass it on to other shifts when you leave for the day. also finding that you found the problem with a tool and it is up to production and running.
good,"Wenn sie bei texas instruments arbeiten, wird von ihnen sehr viel erwartet. Es gibt viele strickte Deadlines die eingehalten werden müssen aber trotz allem wird man nie überfordert. "
good,"Great place to work for a steady income, and great team work. Shifts are for 12 hours at a time, but you only work 3-4 days a week, and each week it switches between the two. Overtime is often available to those who would like it."

good,This company provides amazing benefits to its employees and room to advance. The work is a little repetitive though and the 12-hour shifts can seem very long. The swing shifts offer opportunity to balance work and life and the tuition reimbursement perk is great!
good,Started my engineering career here and it was a good ace to learn from great engineers.  Pay was good relative to the cost of living but career advancement was limited.
good,"Management is organized in the group I worked. There was accountability and I was trusted as a contractor and treated as an employee. That is invaluable! I had fun while I worked, highly intelligent people who love what they do. The pay was lower than market value but it was worth it, to enjoy going to work. the work life balance was always great and they were very understanding of situations that required time off."
good,Collaborative culture fosters a team atmosphere across disciplines and Product lines.Everyone is available to help brainstorm issues or provide technical support.
good,"The company has great benefits time off allowances. The work was sometimes challenging but mostly routine. The only drawbacks were that although they push safety, don't ever bring a concern to your supervisor or you'll be labeled as a trouble instigator. The other is that you won't be disciplined for not carrying your weight or doing a quality job. The management doesn't want conflict."
good,TI provided many opportunities for career growth through upward mobility and varied positions throughout the company.  It was possible to move across multiple business units.
good,"it helps us to live a stable life "
good,"In this job, I had been assigned to take care of WNC. During my time there, thanks to TI, I developed my soft skills to able to communicate to all different levels of the organization, not just to engineers to improve my soft skills."

good,"As an intern with Texas Instruments, I was allowed access to just about everything on the campus. There was a lot of safety classes as well as other opportunities to interact with other interns and full-time employee's. However, my direct supervisor was very busy and i do not think that he knew as much as i think he should have when it came to my tasks. There was a lack of communication i felt like on his part."
good,Technically advance and good working experience. Global operations makes it more challenging to get work and products build. Many opportunity for advancement if you are ready to move overseas
good,"As I guess it is in most financial teams in big companies, this job had a lot of administrative aspects to it. A typical day involved matching cash inflows with credit receivables accounts on record (i.e. Cash Application) along providing assistance to clients with any inquieries they might have with their payments. On some days, a financial analysis of companies is done, where it is assesed whether a credit limit of the client should be changed. "

good,A great place to work for electrical engineers. Limited growth opportunities for other functional areas.
good,"TI is a very solid/profitable/conservative semiconductor company, and a good place to start one's career right out of college where fundamental engineering skills can be acquired/mastered. It is also a good place to work through mid career and beyond if one is satisfied with being in the main stream of technological evolution. However, if one would prefer to be involved in leading-edge/disruptive development, including access to the latest IC fabrication processes, access to the latest system-level modeling techniques and tools, etc., then there are other semiconductor companies that one may want to consider."
good,"Semi-conductors are not my passion. If they were, this place would be perfect. They take great care of their employees, pay great, and overall do a great job of keeping you happy by most standards. I just don't feel inspired or enjoy Dallas."
good,The job was both interesting and important.  Working on automotive semiconductors means a zero-defect attitude is a plus.  The compressed shift had me working 12 hour days but only 3 days one week and 4 days the next.

good,Over all day as an Inspector/Production Operator began with Pass-on meetings then with Supervisor and to start with prioritizing the work load for the day .  The flow of you day starts their and how you manage the work load. We learned to multi- task we also learned while doing several job we had to continue to follow all safety rules and continue to produce quality control. The best part for me was working shipping and handling.  Communicating with different fab and other work related areas.
good,"TI is a great place to start a career or end a career once you've already got experience with other companies and know what you really want. If you do start there, it will benefit you to move on once you've got a little experience and try some other companies."
good,"A typical day would be that you're always on the move whether you're in business meetings, working on the floor, or getting help on projects from mentors.

I believe being at a satellite location help my progress back during my first years.  Much more favoritism and not as much opportunity but when I moved to the main site in Dallas that changed.  The current management at TI is focused on growth and meets the targets set by the CEO.  The workplace culture is generally friendly and supportive.

Every day there was a ""pass down"" of information on the problematic machines before and after each shift. The documentation of repairs was always entered into the computers to track the machines performance and work times. It was such a great experience working with the company. The most difficult part of the job was trying to be sure the machines would work properly and getting them up quickly. There was a certain level of balancing repairs vs down-time. I loved being able to fix the machines and get them back to producing silicon wafers. I learned so much about how the tiny microchips that go into everything are made."

good,Productive and fun place to work generally. The atmosphere is generally laid back with optional incentives to help the company be successful. When the company makes money the employees make money in the end at profit sharing. The hardest part of the job is the not knowing and the lack of communication from upper management of things to come. Generally learn more from the news stations about layoffs than from the management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with. Most employees have a sense of pride in their work.

Its weakest points lie in middle management effectiveness, with a goal of organization , middle management tends to throw floor workers in a loop to make presentations look better. The strong points are in the companies dedication to safety, reasonable job training, and manageable expectations of new hires. Overall a solid choice but nothing groundbreaking."

good,TI has the most state of the art technology of any companies that I have worked for. Their compensation and benefits are very good. Projects come and go and unfortunately so do the jobs in the areas I worked for. If you want to learn from the best and contribute your best then Texas Instruments will surely satisfy those needs. Job security as mentioned depends on the j\the job or project you are working on. It is no better or worse at TI when comparing to other like electronic industries.

The workload I experience there is heavy because I worked as a quality engineer of the bottleneck process of the whole company. I experience several customer returns and brings report back within specific number of days, influenced other people and driving  group of people whose mindset should focus more on quality. The management seems to be fair but sometimes, they don't know how to manage all their commands to their engineers that is why workload becomes tough whenever your are becomes problematic. But at the end of the day, what's more rewarding is when they distinguished your effort being part of the team."

We all have virtues of solving it, nevertheless, the factors sometimes lacking its influence to transform initiatives. You know, ""other duties as assigned,"" either because someone else doesn't feel like doing it, or you have unique skills that make you the best for the job. Changing is tough and sometimes do creating a problem with a little agreement. Yet, despite with this mixed opinions, we learned how  to grow stronger and using it as a weapon to shield these negative circumstances. We debate and accept each strength and weaknesses.
