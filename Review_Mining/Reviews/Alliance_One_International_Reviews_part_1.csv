rating,review
bad,Not enough pay and not enough training. Workers are over worked and under paid. Not fully equipped with materials to perform job duties. Requires to many duties.
bad,"Horrible place to work, management is not very professional. Managers dating employees. Unfair to some employees of they aren’t  cool with you. The pay unless the managers are giving you good accounts are awful. Over all I’m glad I left and wouldn’t recommend anyone going to work there unless they want to work in a high school setting. With managers acting like children and treating people unfairly."
bad,After you’ve been there a month you’ll ask yourself is this worth my time it’s super stressful the supervisor are rude and inconsiderate but the Boss is a wonderful lady she is truly the sweetest person I’ve ever met but it’s not worth the stress!
bad,"No one here was happy to be at work - everyone was perpetually miserable."
bad,"I hated I quite my job for this job. The manager who called and interview made the job sound amazing and guarantee me if I left my job I would make more money than I did at my last job, that was not the case I made less and when I needed help to understand how there company operated far as pay and bonuses my manager was very rude towards me then to make matters worst they fired me after five months and I had to start my career path over. I left a job I was at for almost four years for them and they showed me no love nor loyalty like they said they would in my interview. I would never  recommend them to any one ever"
bad,"The drama in the workplace was horrible here. The supervisors had their own little cliques with the employees that were their favorites. Upper management never handled problems that were brought to their attention but instead would let it be known to everyone what issue you had and with whom the issue was with. Especially if you had an issue with your supervisor, it was always that they would ""throw you under the bus"" which would obviously make things worse for yourself so it was always better to just not say anything at all. I would never recommend working for this company and I was not fired, I put in my two week notice and left the company after working there for almost seven years."
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"The Eglinton, Toronto Branch is nothing to write home about. The level of discrimination and segregation is extremely high. Working with Scotia Bank Collections under AllianceOne made me experience first hand discrimination. "
bad,"AllianceOne is an organization for kids right out of high school. or for the summer  There are no ladders to success much like a sweatshop.  Sit down make the calls and no conversation with anyone.  If the employee is not liked their production, KPI numbers and corrective action are altered until either that person quits or gets terminated.  Bonuses are a joke but the supervisor and management continued to receive them monthly.  The hourly wage is 10.50 per hour and will never change. The worse place to work ever and is highly not recommended."
bad,I really have nothing to say that it is good in regards to employment here other than the PTO is great. Some of the employees made it worthwhile that is for sure.
bad,"In training they don't tell you that on one of the teams, the fees are different. You find out in the floor or if you meet or get to know people that work there during training. They expect you to collect high balances and pay really low fee based commision."
bad,"No support, cut throat dishonest environment. Promise the moon and don't deliver. Disrespectful managers. Nepotism runs amok. If you kiss up you might make more money. Lousy job. You're going to make more money @ fast food than you do here!"
bad,"AllianceOne in maumee Ohio needs to wipe out management & completely start over. Supervisors play favorites & discrimate against employees for race, medical problems, pregnancy, poverty; basically everything. If you make a complaint, they make your work environment miserable or fire you for job performance and they dont even try to hide it, theyll gossip with their favorite employees and humiliate you. Besides the poor management the bonus' are rigged. Youll meet every requirement but they find a loophole to keep your money, for their own personal benefit. Prosper needs to reevaulate their contract & consider taking it somewhere else that would benefit them. Youll never make more then 10.50 so go somewhere that will advance your career & show your worth!"
bad,"When starting out at this place management was amazing they were there to benefit there employees. All there employees were able to get bonus and make money. I was making almost $45,000 a year. I really enjoyed my job!! But when they got new management they sent our biggest clients out to other collection places. They also made it to where the employee's no longer were making bonus. Without my bonus it took me down close to $20,000 a year. They lost a lot of employees"
bad,little to no chance to get commissions.  very low hourly wage. horrible management that doesn't care about employees.  management harasses employees and is unsupportive.
bad,if you like calling people and bugging them to pay bills that they are never gonna pay every single day 3 times a day then this is the job for you. sucked
bad,"no comments on this company, getting along with my co-workers, was just a fun place to work for and having a company party. Dancing "
bad,Is a job for high school graduates with no advancement or raises if a person is not in the click your job is not secure. Management are able to lie on staff and production numbers are never accurate and that is what drives the bonus at the end of the month as a result only management receives the bonus that is why I left the company
bad,No job security and is very stressful. They will fire you when you less expected and would blink a eye about it. The supervisors there are always on your back and you cannot relax and do your job.
bad,Horrible management and slave like work. I learned how companies rip off their customers this way too. Immature supervisors and strict rules. Negative company to work for.
bad,"Not much training, then put on phones after a few days and wanted you to be a pro in one week.  After a week they let you go if they feel you are not going to cut it. Very very disappointed in Alliance One"
bad,"I would not work here, mind games, long hours, made to feel guilty if I took PTO, no time for personal life"
bad,"This is a terrible place to work, DO NOT WORK HERE!!! They treat you like garbage they make it known that they can get rid of you and find someone else, If you dont make tons of money you will be gone, and after 30 days of hire they are so cheap and they wont pay unployement so they will try and get you to leave, Everything about the job is hard because they never tell you anything good its all bad, and its really shady the managment, So like I said dont work here not a good place to work if you count on a job."
bad,"Small paychecks, no commission, poor staff. They'll hire anyone and the turn over is horrible."
bad,"I entered the collections business because IT sales were in a slump. AllianceOne provided a good pay check, but they offered no advancement. They are constantly at odds with government regulations and blame and often fine the collections staff for violations. Production and quotas are broken down into daily stats and even hourly stats. It's high stress and very competitive. I like the competition, but if you have an off day or month, management is relentless."
bad,"I had to fight for over a week to get my first paycheck from them. I was moved into the next orientation class after coming down with a sickness and having a medical note. After I went to go back to work, I was told that since I was gone longer than ten days, I would have to restart the entire hiring process."
bad,The workplace is very clcky. If you dont fit in. You will be an outcast.And poditions will pass you by. I felt very lonely in a room full of people. Being ostrisized was very demaning.
bad,"They said nothing about me being bullied, ain the legal department! It was humiliating and disrespectful and hopefully one day they change the leadership because it’s a lawsuit waiting to happen.... Unless they go out of business."
bad,"Inbound /outbound calls.  Collection on court/toll accounts. Take payment via online credit card/made payment arrigne. Phone, mailing,faxing,data entry"
bad,"I have been working at AllianceOne full-time (More than a year)"
bad,"just a boring day . it was only part time . the day dragged the people were friendly though , its good for younger people though . I worked only four hours a day ,"
bad,"I learned that supervisors encourage employees to under sell the approved settlements on account. Also when laws changed the information did not make it to all the collectors in a timely manner. I was not properly informed that we could not state that payment arrangements would have to be reviewed and that the amount would need to increase. example has a balance of $1250 and the customer setup payments of only $10 a month. I was trained by this company to state payment arrangements would have to increase due to the low monthly payments and was fined for doing just that. I had been off for an extend period  of time and was never given any refresher or updates about the changes, But they fined me and was told that it was my responsibility to learn the changes not the supervisor to tell me."
bad,This company has got to be the worst by far. Managent does nothing about concerns or request regarding anyone below upper management. They have no respect for anyone below mangement
bad,"Laid off without warning even though management knew it was going to happen almost a week before it happened. Direct supervisors are amazing, however everybody above that including Assistant Call center managers and Call center manager hide details that make it difficult to get bonus’s and find ways to make sure you can’t advance. All of these good reviews are because the office lady makes cups that she gives to employees if you give a good review. You are just flesh sitting in a seat until they can find someone else to take your spot. If you are wanting job security, look elsewhere. If you are ok with just being an employee number on a badge, then maybe this is the right job for you. The people you work with are the reasons you stay and continue to come in everyday."
bad,the hardest part if the job was having to use the bathroom and knowing it was going to be people smoking all in there as a non smoker it definitely was one of the worst jobs i worked at
bad,No way to make any overtime what so ever. Not leaving enough people in the office or outside in the warehouses to accomplish all of the work needed to be done.
bad,When I worked at alliance one I was never assure my position as agent I never felt comfortable everything was always changing for the worse with every change that was made in the two years I spent with the company from the way the employee was treated the befits and rewards to the lack of work company started loosing clients and couldn't afford the staff and had to let go of employees no one ever felt secure or  relax. Everyday was a hustle you had to do your 100% everyday to make it through each  month
bad,"If a person makes one mistake they are gone, management doesn't know how to talk to agents. Constantly being yelled at by clients because you are trying to collect on debts but that is the job. There are some rewarding times."
bad,no raises or anything to show youre appreciated as an employee. management is scattered and you can never get a straight answer or told how to do something. very shady business.
bad,"The work environment was clique except for orientation. The orientation trainers were great and extremely helpful, however the supervisors on the floor were mean and rude. They will only give positive interaction if you are making them money on the phones."
bad,"I worked at their gig harbor location back in 2013. Although not much has changed since then. They put you through a 2 week classroom based training on collections and how to use their outdated collection software system which is a text-based interface that requires so many commands to memorize."
bad,"My interview in no way prepared me for the worst work experience of my entire life. Even training had some tall super professional guy. When it cme time to go to the floor- the agents weren't accepting of new faces or willing to help. Everyone was in their own groupies. The absolute worst part of my experience was the poor management. The lack of maturity, discernment, and management decisions were made clear in my short time employed there. I would have done everything under the sun to keep my job, the negative calls wasn't anything for me. I could deal with upset people. I could accept that I didnt make my goal and that I needed time. But management was unwilling to allow me the time to grow and perform better. Even HR and the floor manager did nothing to solve the issues with mangement there. I was in absolute shock that this kind of disrespect, even for newbies was allowed here. It was a joke to see new training classes come in, due to the poor management, and turnover, all I could see was higher turnover. Its great pay and great commission- IF and only if you get on the right team. One team makes less commission and is the team expected to collect the higher balances. And they will not switch you teams to atleast show you can perform well on a team that has an attainable goal. The debt collection part had to have been the least stressful. Along with being able to take lunch and break when you want. But management, how do you forgive poor decisions causing division on a team? Im suprised with all the talk of how well people hit and make their goal there isn't more nice cars"
bad,"I was able to learn some computor skills. my supervisors were great. i worked with a lot a wonderful people. the hardest part of the job was being cursed at daily by people not wanting to pay there debts. the best part was helping people that wanted to get there debts paid in a timely manner, with some discounts we were able to give."
bad,"It was a good experience, but it just wasn't professional enough for me. I did'nt like that we had to reach a certain amount each month to keep your job."
bad,"Worked for the company for 91 days exactly, left after I found out I was being fired for going to court for my daughter and a doctors appointment, after giving them 2+ weeks and was told by my supervisor that I am clear to have those days, suddenly they changed once I saw I accumulated points. First they don’t offer sick days, and at the same time don’t take doctors notes. HR said ‘we only need bodies here’. No compassion for employees but have to go through training to be compassionate to our clients."
bad,"The main call center manager is rude and racist. They are always changing your supervisors and cubicals. The training is crammed. When it comes to your ""commission"" pay it is a joke. I loved my job there at first til i realized how unorganized they are. Are they are worried about is your ""numbers"". And the Secretary there is so rude and annoying. She acts like shes a hall monitor at a highschool."
bad,"With them for almost 90 days at the Anderson Indiana Call Center. Previously with XEROX for 5 years. Xerox was awful. Didn't take long before this place begun to be Xerox Part 2. They heard all the hearsay that started at Xerox and intentionally started doing the same thing to me there. Mind games and overall just lying in general.  They went through my personal items I left at my desk. My coat. They knew it was mine. Acted like they didn't know. They saw I had a pocket knife in it. And fired me a month before my son was due. A month before Christmas as well. Before that they stated I was getting a warning. But when I got home. I received a call from the Manager of the site stating ""She wished me well and that I was fired"". The site manager was dishonest. And she blew up the pocket knife as a weapon. ""What do you do with a knife like that?"" ""Why would you carry it?"""
bad,Company had very high turnover rate. Unprofessional work environment. The threat of losing your job was constant. No room for advancement.
bad,"A typical day at work This is basically the fast food of desk jobs it was three weeks training with an overwhelming amount of information to try to learn and process. Even with the most amazing trainer and even studying night and day could never fully prepare you for how out of depth you are when they throw you on the floor your fourth week of so call nesting aka the  Boiler Room if you ever seen the movie this is basically it but with debtors."
bad,"if you like to bother people about bills they arent gonna pay then go ahead and apply"
bad,"At my previous job it was fun working with others or as a team, there comes a time when situations gets difficult but by the end of the day we put out all the effort to have the issue resolved. I'm very easy to socialize with also as a jovial personality which makes it easy to  get along with others. Enjoy helping customer cause without them there wouldst be a company.Customer service as always been my passion and all my work experience and training is in this area of work."
bad,"If you suck at customer service and don't care about hounding people every other day, this jobs for you. You'll need to be able to live off a pittance. Very cut throat environment."
bad,Not a good healthy working environment very strong and dusty need better mask for ventilation . Supervisors not considerate of family problems or we ur health
bad,"If you are a top performer you are left alone and at time fed accounts to ""keep up"" your numbers. If you are a top performer and have a bad month well you are pretty much ignored at that point. Upper management is arrogant."
bad,Call people on the phone and collect money and once get to your goal you can earn commission.
bad,The management teams here like to micro manage and we’re discriminatory against myself and other fellow co workers causing a lot of people to seek other employment
bad,Going out of business due to lack of business. Theay are closing 12/31/2018.  They struggled to keep the accounts they had and made the decision to close.
bad,"Nice break ROOM , game room exercise room  quiet room to relax lockers for personal belongings and after certain tenure your own packing space pretty cool"
bad,"If you enjoy micromanagement, constant criticism, and a manager at your neck just waiting for you to make a mistake, then apply right away. Benefits are good, but not great."
bad,Generally poor management; little to no concern for life/work balance; stressed bottom line over all considerations; required micromanaging/“training” of employees
bad,"At first I really liked working at alliance one, we got paid to sit in a classroom and I now have a great understanding in the car business. I now know how to read a contract before buying a car, and tons of payment options, towards the end of my job at alliance one I was called a derogatory name due solely because of my race, and I feel as though nothing was done about it. Later when I put it down as my reason for leaving I was harassed by management and HR on several occasions to change my statement which made me more uncomfortable working there"
bad,"Allianceone had the potential to be a great place to work. However, management often choose to promote people who they liked best vs best qualified. Big Mistake. We lost a major client because the business was mismanaged."
bad,The employees are either high or drunk at work. Management does not care about you what so ever. The company appears to be going under. There are way more empty seat then in the office then full ones. Even when you hit your goals you get very little commission. The micro management there is unheard of. There has been a number of office people leaving  there jobs. I am not sure if they know something we don't or not.
bad,"I worked there for a while and was one of the most knowledgeable agents on my team. After the company lost a bigger client they had to get rid of people from all departments and move some people around. They had put people in a ranking system to decide who to keep and let go based on performance, attendance etc. I ended up being let go because I went on medical leave a few months prior and they counted that against me when they did the ranking system which put me towards the bottom and kept people who did not do their job, still could not work the system or note accounts correctly and had very little knowledge on basic everyday tasks after being there for quite some time. Management definitely played favoritism with a lot of people and the gossip about the employees coming from management was constant and extremely unprofessional."
bad,It can be fun at times but I wish upper management would treat us with more respect talk to us with more respect and give us the raises we are owed and listen and be there every time we need help
bad,"processed payments"
bad,"No job stability, some managers didn't know how to talk to their employees, pay wasnt that good and the commission was hard to come by."
bad,"I worked in collections for several years so I knew what kind of job I was getting into when I was hired at Alliance One."
bad,"Num dia típico de trabalho, basicamente no início, aprendi a tirar temperatura de caixas prontas para distribuição.. meus colegas foram fundamentais para meu aprendizado. A parte mais difícil será, neste ano, acordar cedo, estudar à noite e trabalhar o dia todo de pé, na maioria das vezes..."
bad,This job requires a very thick skin as the people you have contact with do not want to be contacted
bad,Its a normal call center was ok nothing to brag about. Few good managers. Computers froze frequently and to many write ups on quality if you miss 1 word or 1 statement
bad,"On one hand, it's a pretty easy collections job, with decent pay, cool coworkers, and a nice environment."
bad,"High turnover as most call centers.  Lots of illicit happening among coworkers.  Management was sued for harassment of a female manager while I was there, resulting in a 6 figure settlement."
bad,"Management doesnt know what they are doing"
bad,"Too much micro manage and no communication with employees.  "
bad,The best thing about this job was commission which is what kept me there for so long my co worker I enjoyed for the most part management can use a lot of work the hardest part of the job is loosing client and them not being replaced and you still have the same goal to meet as when you had those clients also know that if you don't maintain a certain % you will loose your job and not have management support the most enjoyable part about this job was the commission
bad,Typical tobacco factory. Relaxed atmosphere. Good job for those who just want a paycheck. Very little room for advancement. Extremely dusty!! You might as well smoke 2 packs of cigarettes per day. Work can be overwhelming at times depending on the grade of tobacco being processed. You can end up doing constant physical work with little or nor time to catch your breath. Factory setting so...no A/C!
bad,"management was not good an d if you were not liked or confident in yourself, they made sure to do things that would diminish that. they gave praise to people that were not deserving of the awards and they did not show appreciate to those that worked hard for them, had excellent customer service and showed up early, on time, well dressed, ready for work."
bad,"It was ok, I guess this was the hardest work year for he company by losing one of the major clients made it a little stressful  having to let go over 40 team member. Overall I did enjoy working the company just wanted more job security"
bad,"By far the most unprofessional place i worked at. As a collections agent my overall experiance was bad. After a two week of a very insufficient training which you can not take any picture of the powerpoint presentations to make practice nor get the presentetion itself but can take notes on your notebook. ( Why i can't take the ppt presentations while i can write down the whole thing? Isn't that both illogical and time consuming?)  Anyway even the during the training the management made visits to class and told that the training teaches basically nothing compared to what you learn on the floor actively doing the job. But you get no realtime supervisions nor regular coaching when you go on the floor. Only other agents who have some compassion and  get that you are struggling would try to assist and help you out as much as they can ( they have their job to do as well)  but that's pretty much it.  All the supervisors say that you can ask them about anything anytime but when you do  they bounce you off one  another. Not willing to answer as they are busy doing their 'job' on thier laptops. Oh and there is the occasional shout-outs on the floor by NAME about the afterwork/ lunch/ break times of agents. The whole place is like a jungle. There are sinister snakes, roaring bears, silent birds, hunters and preys ( Some agents taking other agent's high amouth payment arrangements when  they bump into them on the collections system to earn a higher commission etc. you can picture the competative environment. Making people work on minimum wage making them needy for those commissions thus"
bad,"You'll learn a lot of useful skills like how to work in a high volume call center, how to take notes and answer calls, how to use a DOS centered program, how to deescalate, and how to work within strict bounds of a call script. "
bad,"Staff not properly managed for some time. The staff managed themselves, and it was done poorly by most. The language used towards management and by staff was the highest level of unprofessionalism I've ever seen in a workplace - real or theatrical."
bad,"I told management during the recruiting process that I'd need extra training. I asked weekly after we got on the floor. My supervisor was all about numbers and never bothered to help. There no excused absences either. "
bad,"gt yelled at by the management staff and employees "
bad,Poor management constantly changes managers dont no how to speak to employees or handle situations.Big overturn in hiring employers no raises. Not professional bad dress code.
bad,"môi trường thân thiện, mọi người giúp đỡ nhau."
bad,"The job is very stressful, must meet quota or you'll be let go like another number, not very friendly or understanding in regards to life happening, constantly micromanaging when micromanagement isn't needed, blink wrong and you're being written up for it."
bad,"Managed a group of call center agents in a very fast paced call center environment. Monitored, and motivated these individuals daily and offered coaching tips periodically. Held team meetings to discuss performance goals."
bad,"The environment of this company is like many other collections companies. The work you do is not fulfilling, however it does provide you with a better understanding of credit reporting."
bad,This company is horrible. It was run like a slave ship. People would not let you have a break.
bad,A skilled leader with valuable work ethics contributed to achieving success and progress in the work environment with multiple projects and challenging deadlines.
good,"A typical day at work entailed working on outdated operating systems.  Management seemed to be fair at best, but the overall culture was unhealthy.  They did however have a game room."
good,The job was very relaxed. I never received any type of vacation time or paid time off. I constantly got laid off for the 6 years that I was employed at Alliance One.
good,I worked at this company for 9 years and there customer service department was centralized to Pennsylvania and no more job opportunity for me.
good,We made an average of 150 calls a day to customers who owed debts to various companies. Everyday we worked hard to meet our quota. I enjoyed working hard to make extra commission. I was a mentor to new employees as well because I was always a consistently good collector.
good,Go in and be at your work station from the start of your shift to the end of it. You get a 1 hr lunch and two 15 min breaks. The weekends were closed and every major holiday was also closed so we had off all that time.
good,A typical day at work is making atleast 320 dials per day. Management is okay but some supervisors need to not be supervisors as there is favoritism and down talking about agents to other agents.
good,Poor management. Deceptive practices. Trainers lie to keep applicants on board. Favoritism run rampant. If you have given up then A1 is for you
good,I believe that professionalism and proper working equipment are key elements to a positive working environment.  Team Leaders as well as managers should be mandated to take refresher courses on conflict resolution and social and cultural diversity.
good,This is a hard company to get fair and equitable pay from. An environment where departments are pitted against one another and management has no experience
good,"Managers were too pushy, inconsiderate. The most enjoyable is guaranteed base pay whether you hit your quota or not. Its a great place to start and get situated."
good,Met great friends while working there but didn't like the management as well as the way things were ran. Not professional to me. But good luck to anyone else
good,"Great core staff , met some really great people . I really enjoyed my tenure there and honed my negotiation skills ."
good,"Unbeknownst to the employees, we were unexpectedly hit with a lay off. Team Leads & Supervisors do not want to take Escalation calls. They stand over you to tel you what to say to the customer instead of taking the call. They also stand in groups & talk about the agents."
good,"a typical day at work would be very stressful because of all the changes within the company. I learned a lot over the years from handling calls to dealing with irate consumers. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the different laws for each state, and knowing when and when not to talk to a spouse. I enjoyed most was the convenience of the location and my co-workers."
good,". a typical day at work would include clocking in on time (anytime after including a second late from scheduled time is considered late) working for approx. 2 hrs then receiving a break. 2hrs then lunch 2hrs then break again. "
good,Working as a 3rd party company is a job in itself.  Having to work a the courthouse and my company is actually out of state is tough. Having to answer to both companies with different ideas on how to run our business is a task in itself.  
good,I worked here for over a year and was top collector for 6 months straight. But if you don't suck up to people and kiss butt then you won't make it. Judged by what you wear or how you live your life versus the work you do and what you bring to the company.
good,could be a fun place to work at times loved co-workers. management could have been better. Insurance package could have been better also and there is  not allot of room for growth.
good,A typical day involved making approx 400-500 dials a day trying to secure payments for past due credit card bills. I would make outbound calls and take inbound calls. The team I was on was great.
good,"It is a great company to work for , however it was very difficult to advance. There was very little opportunity for you to grow. "
good,I love all my co-workers but the job it self I do not like to much. I feel that there is no room for Advancment at this company. I have learned alot by learning about HIPPA Federal Privacy Act. and learned how to do patient accounts the harderst thing about the job is having very angry patients that do not say very nice things at times. I really enjoy handling the paitent accounts though and knowing that i helped someone in need.
good,"Working at AllianceOne was great, the people are wonderful for the most part, and theres always room to move up. A typical day at work was sitting at my desk answering calls, helping customers. The hardest park was when customers got angry and I had to get them to calm down. The most enjoyable part was that everyone in the office worked so well together."
good,"This place is great if you don’t mind taking a pay cut. I love what I do and my coworkers, but I (and every coworker I have spoken to about it) feel like I don’t get paid near what my daily work experience should suggest."
good,"You have to work really hard to receive bonuses but for just a bi weekly paycheck it's easy work and not bad money, don't get to personal or involved in others drama just do you work and go home."
good,"I rarely received an enjoyable feeling after talking with debtors, due to the nature of my work. Sometimes, people expressed gratitude in helping them take care of their debt issue, when making monthly payment arrangements or taking a payment in full. It was difficult to talk to elderly patients who were on a fixed income, who usually tried to make very small monthly payments. We were taught people under-estimated their income and over-estimated their debt, when trying to determine payment options, as again, we were trained to take the most amount of money in the least amount of time."
good,Debt Collecting is stressful on a whole is stressful not to mention the stipulations surrounds you getting a commission from the company makes it even worst.
good,"Place for temporary solution. So many security rules that make no sense at all... No recognition, no annual reviews, no budget even for a X-mass dinner,.."
good,Good place too eat . Very fun with lots of different options. Not very expensive but worth the money you spend . Very respectful
good,Staggered scheduling along with hundreds of cold calls daily. Many nice people and commission is nice if you can meet your goals.
good,Sit at a desk and make collections calls to collect medical bad debt accounts.
good,"A little dusty, but time flew by. I learned how to operate machines, feed in tabocca threw a feeder machine and keep a cleaning workspace. The hardest part about alliance one is cleaning out the machines and clean up the dust. The most enjoyable part of alliance one is sometimes they have special events."
good,Alliance One was a great job far a pay they gave raises like they were suppose to. It was a very hot plant to work in but half of the time they b short of help that make the job stressful when u have to do your job and somebody else job.
good,It was a good place to work. The work environment was exceptional. Busy most of the time.  No time for play.  It is a great place to learn something new everyday.
good,AllianceOne is a great place to work if you comfortable with no advancement or pay raise. Management takes their jobs seriously and does a great job. I've learned to be patient with others.
good,I'm always looking to grow within the company and this one wasn't very supportive on it. Did not provide any other benefit for the employees at all.
good,not very rewarding as far as pay goes no raises hard to move up. great attendance policy. laid back environment. fun. nice bosses
good,"They start you off as a transfer agent. Basically you just take inbound calls all day. The software they use is old and really tedious and difficult. Pay is only 9.50. For the amount of work and stress they put you through, they ought to pay you much higher. This is not an easy job for the low pay."
good,"The title says it all, if you're not on commission it feels like you could get your walking papers at any given time for any given reason. Upper management wasn't that great either. What kept me there was the opportunity for commission and working with great co-workers"
good,This was a seasonal job which we were laid off for a certain period of time. I worked in a warehouse where there were limited access to foods and vending machines unless you walked across the parking lot and building for breaks. Hours were distant. Pay was not up to par as it should have been
good,Alliance one was an incredibly difficult job. I was verbally attacked on a  daily bases. The quota's set for you were very high and unattainable. The manager's were not very supportive.
good,"Working at alliance One has provided me the ability to rely on my self and become more forward thinking, to be able to get the tasks done at work."
good,The call setting environment is not professional at all. Management staff attempts to make it a friendly place to work and tend to forget about maintaining a professional setting for all workers. The hours are good and they allow plenty of time for lunch.
good,"I manage up to 14 agents so it's very important to get to work an hour earlier than my agents.  I pull the necessary reports and have them on my agents desk so when they get in we can get the day going.  The next 8 hours consists of me following up with agents after calls, attending meetings to see where we are progressing against our competitors and pulling hourly reports to see agents production.  "
good,Great management team. Need to be available to work swing shifts.
good,"A 200 calls per hour expectation and management with little or no care for your outside life.  Live to work.  Pay is okay but not worth the price you pay out to be employed there.  A relatively ghetto-fabulous environment with little concern for professional appearances in regard to their employees.  It is a light hearted atmosphere with nice people, but it is also cut-throat.  The seating situation leaves a lot to be desired as you are cheek to cheek with your co-workers.  There is little to no privacy and your desk space is minimal.  Basically just a computer and a phone."
good,"In a typical day I would make 100+ calls, I collected on past due medical debts. I learned how to pull and read a credit report. Management was ok. Not a lot of time to talk to co-workers with all the calls that had to be made."
good,I was working at there cleaning my area n other Rooms as well  sometimes over time it was seasoner that's the only thing I didn't like about the job other then that it's was ok
good,"The  management was awful, the environment was depressing and there was no job security there or room for advancement. The company has gone out of business as of 2018"
good,"removed debris and other damaged materials from using a variety of hand held tools,performed general cleaning by sweeping and removing any tobacco that feel on the floor."
good,I enjoy what I do. It is a decent place to be a part of. I don't understand the purpose of me completing this if I am looking for other employment opportunities.
good,Key information correct and paperwork is in good standing with their Bill of Lading and the supervisor is doing their Job correct also and I love what I was doing.
good,Can be interesting with the many people you interact with. Get to pick up many skills and knowledge. Helps you to understand and resolve life situations.
good,Pay is low for the work we do drama and favoritism all around the company hard work for low pay again need a better enviroment to assist workers and better employees
good,A typical day at Alliance one would be coming right in ready to smile and dial. I would log into my phone and get ready to receive call from customers all across America and help them with payment arrangements and other needs.
good,"Face pace, collection, working under pressure, meeting deadlines and monthly goals."
good,"Always flexible, good opportunity to make money. Bad management., if it would have been ran differently by the higher ups, this company will be successful."
good,making calls and answering calls for payments of her car loans student loans house loans . collecting money. telling them when there due dates are. making so many calls a day
good,"The job involved outbound calls. Most of the day was spent leaving messages on voicemail for customers. The days were very slow, and the coworkers were never friendly."
good,"Call customer on unpaid debt, setting up service plans. I learned that you have to real know how to sell to get people to pay there bills. Management was forever changing. Work place culture was diverse and fast pace. This was more sales and not so much collecting. The most enjoyable part of the job was making goal each week."
good,Success in debt collections is all based on how hard you work. Days went quick with the phone constantly ringing. Supervisors were supportive and made the office fun.
good,"take inbound and make outbound calls"
good,this is a good place to work just don't be late ever even if u been there for 40 yrs they will fire you. I've seen it happen to a lot of people so be on time.
good,"I am a former employee. I enjoyed working at AllianceOne, mostly for the commission check once a month. Management could be better, but it wasn't the worst. The supervisors aren't very responsive when you have a question, but they are very supportive when it comes to personal issues at home. The work environment itself can be fun, but you can also be made to feel like a number. They do push very hard about your urgency payments, which can be disheartening if you feel as though you are doing well for the month. The monthly meetings are fun and free breakfast is never a bad thing. The attendance policy is pretty lax, and they do allow a lot of leg room."
good,"Easy work for decent pay, great benefits. Would have been a great place to work with more experienced management. The atmosphere is stressful at times and they do not take that into consideration."
good,Great company overall. They are all about growth and expansion. Would recommend this company to any looking for growth opportunity. They work around your school schedule if that applies to you. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The work environment is healthy and safe. Great people.
good,It can be a very fun place to work and depending on the commission structure your on you can make pretty a good income.  The management has an open door policy which helps a lot.  The hardest part of the job is the base pay especially for an experienced agent.
good,nice working environment. open door policy that allows the collectors to be heard and willing to look at the possibilities in implementing their ideas
good,Being a collections agent has its perks with commission and bonuses but this job wears you down fast mentally. They company wants you to work 6 months to a year before even think about applying for another position to move up.
good,"seemed as if people came to work just for a paycheck. no one ever seemed happy to be at work. "
good,No meu dia-a-dia de trabalho consegui aprender muitas técnicas que posso utilizar até hoje. Os meus colegas de trabalho eram bem dispostos a ajudar e ensinar.
good,my co workers were helpful and the job itself was easy to adapt to.
good,"-good co workers"
good,"This company was very friendly, and caring towards employees and they tried to work with personal life issues on scheduled."
good,I would call customers about a delinquent bill. Most would try to resolve after updating their information. Some would refuse to make arrangements. Others I would have to try and track down to see if I could get ahold of them. Sometimes I might have to update with an attorney about the condition of the delinquency. The hardest art of the job was when the clients started to make decisions on how we could collect the money.
good,You either enjoy it or you dont.
good,"8 hour day, Daily HR duties, perform weekly payroll"
good,you would never know what to expect when you come in to work. whether it was a machine down or a change in the order. it was very dusty and hot. but it was laid back as long as you got your job done.
good,Good work life. The hardest part of the job is dealing with coworkers. Need better benefits. Cafeteria in the building. The most enjoyable part of the job is the bonus checks.
good,never know what expect on a day to day basis. Sometimes you wouldn't know what to expect from consumers about paying bills.
good,"Creating, uploading, downloading dialer campaigns"
good,"lots of turnover this job is not for everyone, patience and negotiation are key to making it in this job. real money can be made for the right person"
good,You are to meet daily quotes every day and if you didnt you would get coached. You get paid hourly plus commission IF you make your monthly goal. Once you switch accounts and progress with them it gets very difficult in making them.
good,"Managment is minimal, you always feel like you are going to get fired even if you do your best. If your not doing amazing on your project or your ""production"" is low they make you feel like you are going to get fired. The workers are friendly for  most part and you can talk in between dialing numbers and consistently listen to 105.5. You get 8 points (a point falls off after 90 days) and the points are for some stupid reasons. You can't come in early on morning shift because they only open the doors 5 min before the time you have to start so plan to sit in your car if you are responsible. Wouldn't recommend this job to someone who actually cares about doing your job well. They make the job sound a lot better in training."
good,I typical work day is taking inbounds calls and making outbound calls. There are select management that are willing to help you succeed. Its more of an independent type work. The most enjoyable part of working there are the people I work with. The hardest part of the job is not being paid what you feel you are worth. The culture is very upbeat and warming.
good,"There is no room for advancement at this company. No raises, no overtime. Management is very set in their ways and strict. On the plus side, very steady hours with okay pay. Strict management does ensure that you always know exactly what you should be doing and how to do it. Overall, this is not a career."
good,In your face interaction all day lone @ alliance 1 the value is held in how many call one makes per day this is the key to success
good,Was to go in get all the equipment that u neex for today and get started i learn how to operate the machines in different sections of the plant management was good made sure u was on task and around your area at all times The hardest was throwing out the tobbacco it was hot in the machines And the most enjoyable when we come together to get on job done
good,i made boxes and clean up my work area i picked up paper that was on the floor after alll the boxes was made i took the plat and stacked the togetgher and then the man on the forklift came with more for me to make
good,"It was a nice place to work, loved my hours,the ppl there were amazing. The only thing I did not was how they were not willing to work with me when my son became extremely ill, I called off a lot because I am a single parent so I had to be there."
good,paid very low wages if compared to other employers in area. Cents above minimum wage They provide an adequate work environment but need to compare with other employers in the area the hourly rate they pay their employees
good,Job purpose hard and difficult. However good work environment that makes labor less harsh. With great benefits and continuous coaching as well as a management team that shows great support for better achievement.
good,I enjoyed the months I worked at Alliance One.I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in the customer service field and I enjoyed the warm and friendly staff. The atmosphere there was a great one. I administered various professions in the call center field.
good,"usually goals will be put on board at the beginning of the day, and as collections come in get adjusted. "
good,"Atypical day at work is collecting payments for durable medical equipment, Learned how to navigate systems take payments, resolve issues, de escalate payment issues, great management, great people to work with, hardest part of job was getting cussed out every day, the most enjoyable part was learning."
good,None much a good plant to start off at especially when you have bills and taking care of your family it was easy pay was on a every week thing nd i got everything
good,"Alliance One was a fun place to work as far as my co-workers, but the stress from being required to hit a monthly quota became overwhelming."
good,"As an employee at A1 for almost a decade, I can sincerely say it has been a pleasure simply because of some of my co-workers. We have been through so much together. But I am looking forward to a new beginning in a new company in a near future."
good,A typical day at work was ok ...customers may get harsh but situations were handled in the best manner. My co-workers were great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was customers being rude over the phone and its as if they can never be pleased no matter what u do .....but my only enjoyment was making them happy
good,sitting and calling customers who never answer the phone very boring but i made good money
good,"The wages are low and not much opportunity for advancement or pay increases.  Even though the work load increase or the office size, you are still expected to work for the same wages"
good,"I've worked with the company for several months.  I feel secure in my position so long as I perform the work in which I was hired for.  I have a set work schedule and I never have to go home because there is no work.  I work with minimal supervision.  There are always a lot of fun activities.  The dress is casual-jeans.  The hardest part of the job is when customers do not want to talk to you, which is to be expected.  Benefits are good and the PTO is nice. Agent pay is fair in the Toledo area.  Incentives are achievable.  There are a lot of 'clickish' supervisors and manager.  I really enjoy my coworkers.   I would recommend the job for anyone who is willing to work, the job is not hard.  It seems harder in the interview than when you are actually doing it.  The people who have been fired have been people who do not come to work or do their job."
good,Uma empresa ñ muito boa de se trabalha por motivos cheiro muito forte de tabaco
good,"Alliance one is not a bad place to work but they need more supervisors and the supervisors need to improve on helping the agents, and they need to stop all the drug use and selling drugs that goes on there."
good,You're working in a call center. Not much room for advancement. Management plays favorites. Co-workers are usually pleasant. Turn over is terrible. Most employees quit/terminated within 6-8 weeks. Hard to obtain bonus and bonus isn't that great anyways.
good,"overall decent company, usually adhere to needs, most of the supervisors are pretty attentive and are willing to help you, you can choose your breaks and scheduling"
good,"I enjoyed my job, responsibilities that I was assigned to  do, my accouts were worked professionally, I enjoyed talking and helping the consumer to get their accounts or payment plans done in a timely manner.    This is a call center setting sometimes was hard to stay on track when on the phone and others buzzing around but always managed my accounts professionally."
good,"to work towards monthly goals and ensuring agents are successful. this is a great part in teaching people how to do the job and watching them succeed month over month"
good,Very compliant company that keeps there employees up to date on rules and regulations both Federal and State Laws. Benefits and pay scale very fair and very much earned.
good,AOI offers flexible scheduling in the Anderson office for hourly employees.  The only issue was the lack of honest communication from the corporate level.  As a smaller office Anderson was often overlooked at the corporate level.  The Anderson office has great employees that offer many skills in customer service and account management.
good,"good company to work for, good training for the jobs.I have had a lot of jobs that had a UK parent company.  this company also had that and along with this influence the company really cared about the balance of personal well being and work life."
good,"I have been very hard working and punctual. Always producing"
good,"I work in a team related environment. Taking inbound or making outbound calls to consumers to work with them on resolving their debts. We focus on integrity, respect, professionalism and showing the consumer a path forward. Weekly meetings are organized to ensure any changes that may take place regarding changes in FDCPA laws or company policy. Skip trace tools are used to locate consumers at a current place of residence or telephone number. Third party contact and pumping for information is also a utilized tool of skip trace. We focus on pure customer service rather than collections as we build rapport with the consumers making them feel as they have control of their own lives and situations while still maintaining the enthusiasm and persuasiveness to move them in the right direction. We are monitored closely on our quality assurance throughout the work day. I would say the hardest part of the job would be working through the struggling seasons such as summertime and holidays. I enjoy working with people and being involved in bonus related incentives."
good,"Call people daily and try and get them to pay their bills."
good,Through excelled communication i work with people to help them progress through the situations to find a resolution to problem at hand
good,Inbound and outbound calls... about 300 daily. Set up payment options for consumers.
good,"Different dept require different  goals. Typical call center with room to grow. My first call center"
good,good place to work nice place to work good people who work there .... you get enough brake time ... you get good benafits. really layed back place to work
good,"The day starts with getting on phone talking to consumers setting them up to pay for the balance they owe or setting up a payment arrangement for them until the work day ends. There was constant training and went the extra mile to provide knowledge to the employees. I learned how to convince people to pay the bills that they may not want to pay. While operating in the guidelines of the FDCPA. Management lacked leadership and common sense at times, but improved before my departure. My co-workers were excellent and made working there very enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was when consumers didn't answer the phone.  The most enjoyable part of working there was the workplace atomsphere."
good,A lot of people ask me why I've worked for this company so long. My answer is simple It's a job. They are hard to come by and I dislike transitioning jobs.
good,Collections...Not a bad job for a collections job. Management is real nice and will work with you. Alot better than I expected.
good,Great co-workers make this a bearable place to be employed.  Management needs more personal skills and there needs to be more employees to handle the daily workloads.
good,"Management was always busy, not always available.  Just started in collections, it was a new and interesting experience.  Collections through insurance and patients.  It was easier to collect from insurance then patients.  There was lots of employees celebrations.  Promotes employees involvement."
good,Really enjoyed working for this company. It was a fun but challenging environment.
good,I normally work a 8 hour day at alliance one. The work environment is easy to adapt to and understand. the supervisors are easy to understand with everyday life and problems. there are plenty chances to move up and make a lot of money.
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for, but as a manager you have to be able to work as many hours as needed.  I ran one of the busiest stores in the district and spent at least 13 hours a day there on average.  Once we were expecting a visit from corporate and because I needed a day off when they ""might"" be there I worked a 23 hour shift!!  About an hour after I got home my boss called my cell phone to ask a question about a cash register that any of my employees could have answered!!  We didn't end up getting that corporate visit after all."
good,Gary Varney was great to work for. This company was always fast paced and very busy. Nice staff to work with.
good,"I loved this placed. I loved the people, the atmosphere, the job. It was great. But being laid off, was not. Definitely not cool, and it’s was just sad."
good,I just started working here and so far its been great. I've been in training and they really want you to know what your doing before you make your 1st call. I've felt very comfortable with my co-workers and supervisors and can ask them questions without feeling awkward.
good,"I got the opportunity to experience being in a call center environment. It had a versatile culture, no discrimination, management was ok, overall it was a good experience."
good,"Had nice workout room, could be stressful, management was helpful, hardest part of the job was meeting with all the team members and staying on task when they implemented the new program."
good,"I loved working for this company, they took care of their employees, ie:benefits, free flying, great gatherings...Ultimate customer service."
good,"I loved working there until the new supervisor changed everything.My co workers and I always helped each other on accts or to call ins. companies for each other then it was changes to just one girl doing ins, one girl doing  financial assistance and the rest of us were required to be on outbound calls and demanding 300 a day. Well if you ever worked in medical collections you know you have to talk longer than 2 minutes with people to let them know this was a bill after insurance paid and if this was a co pay , ded, or no ins payment at all. But you did feel good when you could resolve an acct within that 2 minutes."
good,Decent place to work.  Had a good base rate of pay and opportunity for bonuses as long as goals were met.  Good management.  Only negative was that if you didn't meet goal you didn't have a job.
good,"This company was very well managed.  However, there was not a lot of focus on client satisfaction.  The company was also conflicted on the host software in use."
good,I never had issues at work but they need more Spanish speakers. I only left because debt collection wasn’t for me. Our training was all paid for just as advertised. Hours are always the same.
good,This is a productive workplace. This is a strong company that value their employees. There are hardworking people here. They are family oriented as well.
good,I learned a lot while I was at the company.  Very hands on training for employees and growth opportunity to advance within the company and be regonized for your hard work.
good,Slow paced work environment with steady work flow. Varying work tasks from day to day. Opportunity that called for consistent change in job duties daily.
good,"Enjoyable place. They teach you everything you need to know while you learn from the experience. If you have the want to understand, it can be something fun for you!"
good,"I have worked with the company for over a year and overall like my job. The work environment is good and the company does offer some incentives throughout the month, but overall hourly pay is a little under what i believe the hourly pay should be. There is some communication issues between upper management and the agents, but like my job anyways."
good,"It's A Very Tedious Job But Once You Learn How To Do It It Is Very Easy And Fun  Especially When You Start Collecting, This Is My Favorite Place I Worked So Far And It's Me First Job Out Of The Food Industry ! But It Is Still About Customer Service 😊"
good,Good place to work . There is always different ways to make extra cash on top of the hourly and commission pay. Keep to youself and do your job duties and there will be no issues. Management is nice
good,"llianceOne is an organization for kids right out of high school. or for the summer There are no ladders to success much like a sweatshop. Sit down make the calls and no conversation with anyone. If the employee is not liked their production, KPI numbers and corrective action are altered until either that person quits or gets terminated. Bonuses are a joke but the supervisor and management continued to receive them monthly."
good,"ping pong,, free lunches, friendly people, dealing with all types of situations over the phone  manager very friendly if you need help someone is always available for you"
good,"sometimes fast paced, other times slow placed. take calls for payments for toll road bills, and toll tag customer payments. do updates to tolltag accounts. open tolltag accountsl"
good,Alliance One was fast  pace environment that thought me to be flexible and how to function well under pressure. This organisation also helped to improve my computer skills.
good,"Everyday was pretty much repetition. Managers were nice, but it is extremely slow paced. you aren't allowed to have paper or your phones or pens/pencils on the floor for security purposes so it gets boring extremely fast. you wait for calls to come in so sometimes you just sit there 10 minutes doing nothing but staring at a screen"
good,"I learned customer service.hardest part of the job was hitting a quota for the month.Typical day at work was fun,everyone helped one another and management was very nice"
good,A good environment to work in. The management was great and a typical day consisted of assisting clients with delinquent status accounts and to bring them to a current status.
good,"I say if you don't mind sitting at a desk, taking and making phone calls all day, noting accounts and providing customer service for patients who owe money, taking payments, escalating, etc..... Then you would like express scripts. I didn't like the whole call center work, but the company itself was very respectful."
good,time will fly at this job.  management  and co-worker are good at teaching you your job. good benfits. lots of cash prizes. never will be bored. flex work weeks no sat/sun
good,Alliance One is a great place to work. The atmosphere is very team based and you want to see others succeed as well. I would recommend Alliance One to anyone. Great Place
good,"With any work place, Brown has it's good and not so good qualities. I enjoyed everyone from Management to co-workers, to the Residents."
good,At AllianceOne you learn respect of co-workers and the public which is important to success.  Management works with all to help ensure everyone reach their goals.
good,"Great place to work with a large diversity of employees. Fast paced and fun. Learn the steps of how traffic violations are to be handled before resulting in collections. Great management to work with open and very helpful and comprehensive in hearing you comments and concerns. my co-workers consists of 7 employees that help the court with daily tasks to help court team members. The hardest part of the job is having people understand the consequences of the urgency in paying their traffic violations. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the court staff who are very helpful and friendly to the court support staff, we all work as a team in a very fast paced environment and help the public get back to their daily work routine."
good,"Good work place, it was energetic and great place to work. The collections side was nice to work for and had good benefits."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me performing a combination of duties while consecutively satisfying clients in a third party collection atmosphere. I've learned how to juggle multiple clients from auto deficiency, mortgage, medical and credit cards. My managemen was very helpful , I worked directly under management staff to help lead and set examples while consecutively maintaining a file and meeting goals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an angry difficult customer, and the most enjoyable part was resolving the customers problem and satisfiying them"
good,I love working for AllianceOne.  Everyone is really nice and the PTO is great.  The atmosphere is relaxed  and accepting.  They have very extensive training as well.
good,"its was very much self explanatory, lots of packing, lots of sweeping. the management was good I just hated the tobacco smell. there wasn't a hard part to me"
good,"Called individuals to collect debts owed to various banks."
good,I also loved being a collection supervisor. My best quality in the position was training. When you have been in the business for as long as I have then it becomes second nature to you. A friendly helpful collector is what has always worked for me and that is the way I trained. The collectors I trained would all become quite successful also and would branch out in the company. It was great satisfaction.
good,"AllianceOne is a subsidiary of Teleperformance, and therefore has the benefit of capitalizing on the global presence the company has built throughout the years."
good,"fun place to work, you have to remember its just a job and not take your work home with you. this is a collection agency so you have to thick skinned."
good,Great place to work but not very good at advancement .  Very competitive. Not ideal if you have a social life. Very high pressure and stressful. Constantly on the phone negotiating and answering questions from customers.
good,"I enjoyed this job. Like other jobs, I moved up quickly. However, I had to leave due to me not having childcare. The management was nice and fair for the most part. The job description was easy to catch on to. I also enjoyed mentoring the new hires, because I made them become as good as of collector as I was."
good,It was very fun working for teleperformance didn't know much when I started but after the training it was much easier for me easy to work with the employees
good,"Working for AllianceOne is not just an 8 to 5 job. Yes, with the nature of the business is always associated with ""always on a deadline"". Regardless of its nature, it is fun! There is an open door policy that makes it easier for the employees to discuss things with the management. Employees are friendly and willing to help you out if anyone is having difficulty with their system or simply chat."
good,Maintaining a 40 call average skip tracing accounts stay current on F.D.C.P.A. guidelines and procedures. I've learned through multiple challenging calls how to overcome certain stalls and situations that required me to think outside the box. The hardest part of the job  to me would have to be accounts that aren't properly worked and require me to do more work then had to be done. The most enjoyable part of my job would be learning how to multitask and problem solve while interacting with people on a daily basis. My co-workers help create an atmosphere that makes you feel like everyone is family but also competitive with one another.
good,"I really enjoyed my job at AllianceOne, unfortunately had family and personal issues to deal with at the time so I had to leave. Managers are very helpful and courteous to employees and make work fun, which is crucial working in collections."
good,"As a collections agent its a learning process every day, but I have learned to multitasking and communicate well with my customers. the management was poor but I have learned to cope with it and assist my customers through out that time. My fellow co-workers have manage to make my day, as I got along well with them with the best of my ability. even though we had tough days, my biggest challenge is the task of getting them to make their payments, but its most enjoyable time is when I'm getting them to make the payments and there is a smile on their face."
good,"Alliance One, LLC. is a very professional, beneficial and friendly company. The staff works hard and well on their accounts and will go the extra mile"
good,I liked working for them. It was a temporary job. I feel like if they were a full time and more than seasonal then I would have stayed there but I’m looking for a job that offers more money and hours.
good,"I have been an employee here for a little over a year now. The work environment is energetic and challenging, but also very rewarding. Management is encouraging and have open-door policies. Overall great place to work."
good,"Very fast paced work environment, operate forkilifts, needs to be able to withstand dusty work areas, production line, tobacco warehouse, seasonal work"
good,"The office that I worked at is now closed. It was a great place to work. I learned great customer service skills, time management, and furthered my experience in using Microsoft Office."
good,I learned a lot at this company. I also had the opportunity to train others in my field. My supervisor helped me to advance.
good,I liked working at AllianceOne because it was a very stable job. Your hours were set which is a great thing when you have kids. Even though it was a commission job you still received a base pay so no matter what you knew you were getting something after 2 weeks.
good,The pay and benefits are very good - especially as you put in the time. Senior management is very positive and encouraging and the corporate culture is very generous
good,I loved my job and I loved my co workers everyday was a positive out come I always made sure my work area was cleaned and the job wasn’t hard work I caught on my first day
good,I collected third-party debt it was hard at first due to the economy.
good,The workplace is very friendly with minimum supervision. Working culture is ideal for both graduates and experienced professionals. Equal opportunity.
good,It was fun working there learning new things about Tobacco and learning how to operate the machine . It was hard but it wast easy  something I can get used too.
good,"I love getting to work everyday and the staff and everyone was like family to be around."
good,"Love this company, Fun to work for. Easy going and friendly."
good,"learned alot about collections,met alot of people in the industry"
good,"Not enough work time only four months. Cleaner environment, better equipment to work with. Being more organized would help. Parking lot needs to be larger. More Time clocks in designated areas. More opportunities for new employees instead of sonority first. Stick with scheduled dates and less overtime days and nights. Four ten hours days a week period. But more or less its a great place to work."
good,leadership experience with excellent communication and interpersonal  abilities to work on a team or independently to achieve desired result willingness to learn new skills with flexibility to adapt to changes
good,"A day on the job is great for a driven individual collector who stays on the phone and seeks quick resolution. I learned to sell the responsibility of validated debt."
good,"I LOVED working for this company. I was super sad when it had to shut down due to not bringing in enough profit. I learned alot with this company on how to work with a small, close knit team. The management was fabulous as well as my co-workers, every single one of us got along great."
good,"I like it, it’s not to much but it’s not to little either. I feel there is better in the world for me.In that since of mind I find like I could be the best addition to/for any job."
good,"Was a family oriented company that created opportunity for both young and already experienced minds, fully equipped with work tool to get the job done.
