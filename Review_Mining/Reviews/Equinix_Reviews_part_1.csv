bad,"If you are on the wrong team your life could be miserable. There is a work culture which does not appreciate employees, and vindictive management. They don’t kno how to get out of their own way"
bad,Experiencia muy mala malos managers fue una pesadilla trabajar ahi
bad,"Mostly people are Uneducated."
bad,"A fast pace, never happy, and stressful. You will not last more than a year without losing stressing out. They do not respect the technician but they love engineers."
bad,"Functional manager's logic  "
bad,toxic work place! stay away! very demanding and stressful when they need coverage and if you say no its a big problem. you are just a number to them to fill the post and they have no problem replacing you.reliefs have no consideration for getting to work on time usually late. hardest part of the job was their out dated and complicated programs that always have issues. pay should be higher and the benefits are horrible. management loves to micro manage you in every way possible they also love to condescend you any chance they get. shaming you for petty errors becomes the everyday norm. they love to do petty monthly training's that do not have to do with day to day job duties.a job is a job but when the average person last at a site for a few months at some point you have to ask yourself why is the turn over rate so high.they need an undercover boss to witness the day to day operations of how each guard is treated.
bad,"Going back approximately two years ago management was different should I call it normal.  Equinix brought in new directors who brought in their people.  One after another was promoted, engineers with no NOC experience coming in at higher pay rates than others.  My typical interaction with my new managers was brief maybe 5 minutes at the most at the start of my shift.  There is no workplace culture instead there was lots of bitterness from the majority of NOC personnel.  The hardest part of the job was just trying to make management accept me as a person rather than trash as I was treated.  The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the friendships I developed during the 9 years of employment with Equinix."
bad,"they hire a lot of contractors with fake resumes. And most of full time employee were converted from contractors, that means, from fake resumes. this company is lack of genius."
bad,"Culture is cancerous and management doesn't see to value their employees. Their is no work life balance, which is what they sell you on. They force you to work a 12hr schedule and make you come in on days off. This is not a great place to work, which is why I am no longer there."
bad,"At the time I was employed with Equinix, there was no work life balance.  Management was atrocious there was no opportunity for advancement based on individual performance and dedication and motivation."
bad,"tracked all the time, and lot of staf tearn over, and yearly bones not garanted, even though in intervew it is, a lot of online paperwork, the pay is ok but not a well payed as some data centre's."
bad,"Equinix is a good place to work but the managers is poor and managers promote if your in their circle. Some Managers at Equinix in Dallas is racists. They don't like African Americans to succeed especially with a college degree obtained. I got fired from Equinix cause I was outspoken and managers don't like outgoing/outspoken individuals. What Managers says it goes without any discussion. Managers at Equinix in Dallas, texas area isn't team players. The Managers sits at a desk all day and take long lunches while the Tech's do all of the work."
bad,"The company it self is a great company with the best Benifits. All of the management in Dallas is not held accountable and blame other for their mistakes . The employee turn around is very high in this location. All other locations are very good to work for except Dallas."
bad,I was overworked. I learned how not to run a company. Management was inefficient. Workplace culture was asocial. Got carpal tunnel syndrome from working there due to my workload.
bad,"Too much politics in the company."
bad,"The environment at Equinix has always been fast paced and demanding. Over the last year the company has made some poor choices in acquisitions and appointment of executive management. While these choices have not yet significantly impacted the company's reputation for reliability, many of the new changes going into effect will have a significant negative impact over the coming years. It is a paycheck, but the passion has been leached."
bad,"Tends to be cliquey, growth rate is extreme but does not mirror advancement. You need to know your job very well, prior experience in several areas would be beneficial. Need to be a self starter, it is not for beginners."
bad,"On paper, it’s a great company."
bad,"Although a relaxed atmosphere, there is little direction given and my experience is given little credence."
bad,"Lots of back stabbing and in house fighting.   Lack to training and assistance from management.  If you don't belong to the pack, they will run you out like a dog.   Everyone wants to sit back, watch you work and criticize.  Never any kinds words.    Stay away!!!"
bad,I was here temporarily to assist with their Year end close.  Assisted in their accounting department scrubbing taxes and data in time for the annual year end W2's.
bad,"This company has an extraordinary organizational policy, and offers excellent benefits, but regarding applying to practice what is on the paper it's another story. Management (at least where I worked) don't regard much teamwork, nor they want to do teamwork and straighten what is not according to policy."
bad,"Other departments are helpful, not very much room to grow. Definitely understand if you have a doctor appointment.  People are willing to lend a hand."
bad,Management was the only thing that made this job not enjoyable. At first it was good. It was enjoyable. It was fun. Then management made the productivity / enjoyment way out of balance. Was a big turn off.
good,"Things move fast, they take on a lot, stuff falls apart and you have to fix it and put it back together. Damage control is the main job. If we would slow down we could avoid a lot of the mistakes, but that's not going to happen."
good,Equinix came and bought us a year and a half ago and we are still trying to learn their processes and management style. Their structure as a company is good and gives employees flexibility.
good,Long days and little recognition. Promotion and advancement does not seem to be based on merit. Although they have a good community outreach program. Maybe you will have better luck
good,"I admire the way the company grasps new and emerging technologies and they have good potential for future growth, however, the way they treat contractors is counter productive. Contractors are not included in staff meetings or given access to critical daily activities that creates duplication of effort on many levels and hinders forward progress. The moment you ask for help, contractors are penalized for not being mind readers, and looked down upon."
good,Company is good - growing fast; Leadership has no clue what's going on the ground. Product Software Architecture & Engineering group managers are techies with no management skills - poor management leading to dysfunctional org culture; management by fear is the practice here.
good,"This is a tough place to work.  Constant work with little support.  If you find your self in a thankless job, you can be stuck there for a while. Many people stay becuase the stock is performing but it is a slave gallery."
good,"No career growth, but the work flow is consistent which is good. Don't expect a pay raise unless you are best friends with the boss. If you work in HQ, I am sorry."
good,"Typical day will be working for 10 hours or more"
good,"There were a number of capable people there, however management was disorganized and not willing to utilize skills of employees and properly allocate resources. This led to some people not being able to advance their careers as they wanted (many left), and unnecessary hires (rather than discussing issues openly with the team and more effectively utilizing available resources."
good,"Equinix's strength lies in the organization that runs their data and colocation centers (""Operations"").  That organization is great.  The rest of the organizations are so-so."
good,"I worked in a satellite sales office where there was hardly anyone ever there, including my boss. I learned a lot, but it was not a good fit for me. I would not recommend this role to anyone. The company itself is outstanding."
good,Company is rapidly growing which has changed the overall culture.  This has caused a great deal of stress throughout the employees.  Once the company finds itself it will once again be a great place to work. To maintain the expected work/life balance is extremely difficult to achieve.
good,"Alot of flexibility given (depending on who your reporting boss is)"
good,"Nice place to work but lack of good growth options."
good,Equinix was a great place to work and I made life long friends.  Work place culture was very collaborative.  I learned a lot working there.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,Supporting my operational teams with their compliance needs. Assuring compliance with all regulations for which my company is subject to.
good,The company has strong revenues and stock price. They achieved their cost control goals by freezing hiring and overworking their existing employees. Often times setting unrealistic expectations and grinding good people until they can't continue. Lot's of praise given to sales and customer functions. Little if any credit given to the teams that keep the business running despite extreme budget restraints and non-backfilled attrition.
good,"Nice place to work, advancement limited in my department. Overall I like the company and people. I have learned alot from the management at Equinix, they are always willing to assist"
good,"Our shift schedule set up as 12 hr 7PM to 7:30AM ( ( Graveyard ) "
good,It was a good company but the managers hired from HP have made an absolute mess of the company within the sales organization.   It was a wonderful place to work at one time but those days are long gone.
good,"Equinix has a strong and positive work culture, but the management is very weak. There is not much room to grow and they always complain about budget. Work/Life balance can vary. You work 60 hours a week, and they don't want to pay you over time. Or you 40 hours a week and they question if you are working or not."
good,"Company has many project going on which means long hours for many people, and alot of changes happening. "
good,"Hard to get a promotion other then that it's a okay place to work."
good,Overall Equinix is an ok place to work. The pay is not commiserate with the level of work that is expected for salary based employees. Equinix will readily promote from within because it ends up saving them thousands of dollars. I was promoted to salary doing the exact same job making about 20k less due to loss of overtime compensation. I was lead to believe that this difference would be made up through off cycle raises that never came to fruition. With the amount of Data Centers in the Ashburn area I would recommend going somewhere else that will pay you better for the same amount of work.
good,The co-workers are great people. You do learn a lot and have ample training. The supervisors are all pretty good guys. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and working every other weekend. Free lunch on Fridays.
good,Maintained an environment where specialists are motivated and empowered to create exceptional customer service.
good,"• It had a nice balance for telecommuting and being in the office."
good,"Good work with Exhaustive changes some times."
good,"A empresa possui setores maravilhosos. "
good,"worked a product manager on some of the key applications, which generated $10 million revenue. has been part of some challenging projects. learned a lot about B2B applications."
good,"Door de vele overnames in de afgelopen jaren zijn het werk en de mensen een grote diversiteit. Soms leuk, maar niet altijd efficiënt en/of effectief."
good,"They way that they treat the contract employees is terrible, I was at this company for more than 27 months but they isolated the contract employees and don't involve them in the daily activities which sometimes is a must for the progress of the work."
good,The OPS manager here in Atlanta is out of his league. He has no idea of what we do. He also lies about different things to different people and he tells everybodies personal situations
good,Great benefits. Very poor management training. Management is very self centered and only interested in their own advancement. no lower level advancement or training is promoted.
good,The company has great solutions and was in demand with all Indian SI's but the resources and structure needed to support the endeavour was missing and this caused in huge effort from self to support the various asks coming from various SI's and to support their need single-handedly.
good,"the best data center company. work environment also good."
good,Great place to work. Exciting sector to be in with the immense growth in data centers. Work life balance is great and people are really nice. Recommend it highly.
good,Fun and friendly work environment.  Growing and fast paced company.  Lots of perks like free drinks and hot breakfast.  Company is very focused on giving back to the community as well and sponsors several charity events a year as well as blood drives.
good,"It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English"
good,The management is really motivated to try to improve processes and make sure that each team member is getting the attention they need to succeed. The culture is relaxed and fun.
good,"I learned a lot working for this company. One has to be vigilent and learn how to cope under stressful conditions especially when dealing with rude customers. A typical day at is mainly responding to emails, answering phone calls, signing customers and visitors in and out of the building."
good,"Market leader in their space. Very disciplined about market position."
good,"Good to work with Equinix. The work culture is encouraging & Positive."
good,"I worked with Equinix as a vendor."
good,Ok place to work. management is not so good. they do not hire from within.
good,"It is a very relaxed culture but at the same time very hardworking"
good,"Manage projects involving customer equipment, capital improvements, and computerized preventive"
good,"- Great Group of Analysts"
good,"Overall, a great place to work and wonderful career potential.  Growing fast and love to see the continued growth.  "
good,"Atender ligações,  responder e-mails, controle de crachás, funcionários, visitantes!"
good,"I have had the unique opportunity to work in a company that was literally a start-up and is now a 2 billion dollar company. Having supported many of our strategic customers and participating in a new program, I have traveled through-out Asia and North America. This has been a ""roll-up-your-sleeves and lets-get-it-done"" environment with very special and unique people. Sometimes the days were long, but the challenge and end result made it all worth while. The company environment is changing and unfortunately, its time to move on."
good,"Great and fun company to work for - they do a lot of things to try to give back to the community and make the work experience a positive one. Lots of access to upper management - most people are probably on a first name basis with the CEO and CFO, which is amazing for a $B+ company."
good,"Worked there during a major corporate overhaul. Lots of turmoil and leadership change. Drastic strategy changes meant reorgs and layoffs. Not an IT company, mainly a sales org. Software is terrible and change is slow to implement."
good,"I'm writing this review so that I may continue on with the application process for a position. "
good,"I enjoyed several great years at Equinix. It was a vibrant and agile company, and top management were great leaders. One layer below, the management became fractured with a LOT of abrupt changes, and many employees lost key responsibilities, as well as lost contact with *and respect from* their leader, who inevitably wanted to bring in their own people from the outside, at a huge expense."
good,"In the product and marketing side you are very much at the demand of sales - the industry itself is cut throat with sales turning over pretty quickly. Equinix is the industry leader so its more stable - however don't expect to coast. It is a great company, demanding but fun - make sure to maintain face-time with core team members and functional colleagues around the globe"
good,"The corporate position is very strong and it has been a solid growth company for several years.  As I've seen with other growth companies the leadership needs to evolve with the size.  This was not happening well in my department which left much to be desired but in other departments you can grow with the company instead of being marginalized."
good,Typical day involves facilities operations of critical cooling equipment and electrical equipment to insure 100% customer uptime. Most enjoyable part of job is being part of a company that plays such a big role in modern technology.
good,"Liaise with various vendors on hardware & software roadmaps, certifications and problem resolutions"

good,"growth of company was too fast for them to keep up with good hires,  This is a waste of my time why do i have to write all of this for you it's not going to help[."
good,"Equinix is a pleasure to work at, for the time I have been with them (7 months at present). They are considerate of personal life needs, when applicable."
good,"I learnt a lot everyday, different issues you face on a daily basis, the culture of the company is really good and the pay is fair. The sales oriented management culture is not good."
good,"not too happy with the company, the hours are not that good. it is somewhat beneficial since you work 12 hours shifts and you rotate, but sometimes they don't let you."
good,Equinix is ever-growing. Dealing with management can be challenging and effecting change can be slow but the people make all the difference. Benefits are good.
good,Good Company to work for. Good Managemnet. i liked working there. Though it was a small stint but management and team members were quite supportive and helpful.
good,"Super Team, "

good,"I have never worked for a company that dealt with so many companies in the top 100 world wide. It gives a sense of security and purpose, the pay was great and the employees were the best support you could ever want, if you love working in an environment that require special attention to powerful companies then this is the place for you."
good,"Great company, great people and very committed to customer service"
good,"I have a wonderful team members ."
good,"Very immature employees, discussed with Manager about on job harassment and he actually laughed at me. Co-wokers continually made fun of my accent and un-cotrollable hand tremors which never prevented me from doing my job. Other workers refused to share educational training "

They were in Oracle 11 and everything was manual. We sent Fed Ex packages of invoices back and forth across the country for signature approvals. Then they upgraded to Oracle R12 which added in invoice scanning with workflow approval, and these new modules were added;  I-Expense, I-Procurement and Payment Manager. This allowed the company to go almost completely paperless and streamlined approval processes. The only reason I had to resign my position with Equinix was to care for my mother-in-law while she went through cancer treatment, otherwise I'd still be working there."
