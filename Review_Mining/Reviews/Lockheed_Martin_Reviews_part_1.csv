rating,review
bad,It is a ok for a woman to bother or arrested men co-worker and the manager were 100% believed her. I was refused to work with her. I want to work in a friendly place.
bad,"I have worked for Lockheed for 8 years, unless you are in a certain clique and friendly with the right people you will be treated ufairly, you will miss out on promotions and opportunities. Good as a graduate as they put all their effort and money into given graduates oppirtunities anyone above that level will be treated terribly."
bad,"Lack of respect for employees. "
bad,Management could care less.  Absolutely terrible.  Treat new hires and level 1s terribly.  If you wanna work here be prepared to ask a question and no one will care.
bad,"Orlando location, very poor management your job has no security, if they don’t like you you’re fired and if you plan on getting discriminated and profile, harassed this is the place for you, I would not recommend here to anyone large corporation without no values just talk to brainwashed you. WARNING BEWARE"
bad,terrible. they are for the company. they dont care about you at all! got hurt on the job and i am still hurt butt they dont care they only care about what they can get out of someone you are only a number that they will work to death!!
bad,"Management only look out for each other. Too much micro management. Managers must be one of the good ole boys/girls. Extremely limited career growth. To get a good performance review, an individual must highly liked by his/her management."
bad,"The supervisor was so impressed with my ability to organize and fix the electronics. After several months I was laid off because it we das a union job. A year or so later I got called back to work for them. I was put in a different job where the people around me would not even try to introduce me to the new work, and felt abandon. One supervisor just handed me a book with work to be done and said, do this, and I had no idea where this problem existed. I felt left without knowing what or where the work had to be done."
bad,Lockheed Martin is the worst company to ever work for. It seems none of the management know how to do their jobs. They do not promote a good work place environment. The Facilities are the nastiest. The security has the intelligence of a preschool. I would not recommend Lockheed and honestly if it was up to me Northrup Grumman should buy Lockheed martin and get rid of the company.
bad,"We ""never forget who were working for""....the stockholder.   Lickeeed at the C-level are a slew of liars and decievers....but only half as bad as raytheon."
bad,"Poor management. Only worried about making a profit and not employees. Several of my peers went to work for Raytheon, Dyncorp and Boeing. Would never work for this company again."
bad,"Promised one pay to get you to work then changed it when they hired everyone. Was told too top out pay was doable in "
bad,"My experience here was one of the worst of my career as an Engineer . Management was lazy, complacent, and lacks direction to improve the SOPs.  Those of us in the the trenches were expected to work 24 x 7 - even at home. You were branded if you resisted. Management here preaches that they want feedback and communication, but that could not be farther from the truth. The more you ask questions, the more you are targeted as a trouble maker, lied about, and shut down. Middle Management wants to keep making their 100K and they want you to just work until you exhaust yourself. You are disposable. Sadly, the reputation of this place is getting around and no one wants to work there. Thus, why they had to hold a job fair in 2019. Young, bright, highly talented young people come to work at LM with expectations that they are working for the most progressive technological company (as LM advertises), but in fact this is not the case at all. They leave usually within a year, after being abused with more work piled on their shoulders than they could possibly handle. Pay is not competitive with other companies and when you factor in working 24 x 7 it is very low. They just added the Level 3's to the bonus after shunning them for years in hopes to keep the workers they have."
bad,"It was not a DBA position, it was a business analyst position.  They treated the staff as replaceable.  "
bad,"That was a supper positive experience , great management  and great place to grow very large company with great people to work with. Good Benefits and opportunity for advancement."
bad,Get ahead by any reason.  The inclusion of Loral personnel brought down the level of quality personnel at the site.  Most managers would step on your throat to get ahead.
bad,You can work as hard and as excellent as possible! You will never win or excel in this company if you are not in the good 'ole boy network! The place is trash at best!
bad,"Worked intel contracts with LM at Fort Meade, MD and quickly realized I was just a number. There was no clear direction with my work and filled a seat for too many days."
bad,I worked for the company for a while and must say that my experience was horrible. The PM that I worked for was a sexist!  He treated the employees with such disrespect and it was a bad experience all around.
bad,Meeting Different People. Easy Work. Moving and and entering Airplane Parts In The Computer and finding Parts and make sure it get to the right place.
bad,"I worked with one individual who acted like a thug. He constantly chastised me and even went so far as to try to start a physical fight with me over a simple data input error. Coworkers only care about themselves, and will throw you under a bus the first chance they get. I was let go after New Years was over. No warning, No nothing. I went to work, logged on, and found out my user account was expired. I was a contractor. I was told by hiring manager that the contract was for 1 year. I was kicked out after 6 months. I believe it was because of the thug who tried to start a physical fight with me. He has been there for quite some time. He should be fired."
bad,"As a woman working at Lockheed Martin, you were looked down upon as inferior by the men, especially the Program Managers. The pay as a sub-contractor was epismal at best. We worked extremely hard and the days were very long but we received no recognition or benefits for it. I was so excited for the opportunity to work there but quickly learned that it was a ""man's world"" and it almost felt like a 1950's culture there where the men were ""thee men"" and women were treated as inferior and much less intelligent. It was very disappointing to say the least."
bad,Wayyyyyy toooo many people with a very large percentage really doing nothing all the time. Seems to be lots of upper level program people way too cozy with foreign suppliers. Company is ripe for a whistle blower to put them in their place.
bad,Human Resource is not very good. Any complaints are used to later attack the employee. Best to run away for working for this company. Worked three years and never received a raised.
bad,There were a number of co workers who to good work with to make good decisions.   The company provides strong support to work with to make good descisions
bad,Lockheed Martin is not in business anymore.  Another company took them over.  I only worked there one year and stuff but have enough time to review this company.
bad,"All this company cares about is profit margin - they claim to support the military but actually discourage Reservists from serving their country.  Also one of the lowest paying defense contractors.  They leverage their name and reputation to attract talent, but can't retain employees due to competitors offering higher wages and better benefits."
bad,"Management does not care about you, you are a statistic and they will throw you under the bus at the easiest opportunity.  Workplace culture expects you to go out of your way to break their own ethics training surrounding doing work without pay.  No overtime paid on multiple programs despite being forced to work 80+ hour weeks.  Management does not listen to their employees until there's problems, and all of the problems experienced are typically preventable things that management could have avoided had they just listened to employees."
bad,Lockheed Martin provided achievable challenges and provides a very rewarding work atmosphere.  The work is interesting and provides for a variety of assignments.
bad,"This is not a company that is about producing value or innovation. You exist to charge the federal government as many billable hours as possible and will be forced to work in the most innefficient way possible isolated based on whoevers fiefdom you happen to fall in. Aweful culture, adversarial, and just plain dumb. Stay away!"
bad,"management are the worst you will ever find, imcompetent bullies.  they lie to perms, contractors and customers.  A culture of bodging to do things on the cheap."
bad,i did ot like working for the company hence the reason i left. I would not recommend anyone to the company. My current company is much better and has better advancement routes.
bad,"Lockheed Martin is a poor place to work.  Management is more interested in replacing the experienced workers with college hires than they are with being able to meet deadlines and put out a quality product.  Just look at JSF.  The experience that made programs like the F-16 so successful was laid off in order to replace them with college grads who have no loyalty to the company or what was being done.  The new kids would be leaving after a couple of years just to go after the higher paying job.  "
bad,"Just your average big defense company. Large bureaucracy. Out of touch management. Process heavy, rule heavy. You have no real say in how the place is run or about your job assignment, Just a typical large defense company,"
bad,"Management is horrible. Benefits offered are not alluring. Expect work, work, work with nothing in return. Does not value it employees. Does not treat their employees with respect."
bad,Great Place to Work. Very Diversified. Flex time for family matters. Good Benefits. Decent retirement plan. Varied and diverse work projects. I recommend
bad,"not a nice place to be. especially for contract staff."
bad,"Nothing to say"
bad,"Employed in last year of contract, all support staff and supervisors were engaged on winning the next contract. They didn't care about anything but he next contract. Which they lost. Most employees rebadged with the winning company. So what was the point."
bad,"If you want to work for an incompetent hustler this is the place to be. If your a technician be prepared to work with people who sabotage their own work so they can get paid overtime to fix it.  Apparently the management accepts this as a cost of doing business.  Of coarse the only customer they have is the Federal government, so the tax payers are paying for this."
bad,"This job was a contract to the government, so when the government was off, so were you. When you were off, you didn't get paid and you got no government benefits."
bad,"this was way too long to remember. They loved me as usual because I was a wonderfully competetant employee. They went out of business though."
bad,Senior always blaming to other people around at job and neever made communication to people. ended up leaving his job and all work came on me! such worst management not seen in my career. Never ever work for IS and GS.
bad,I really enjoyed the work atmosphere and it was a great company to work for.  The pay was within the market range and the benefits were also within the range of the market.
bad,"I thought that this would be a great company to work for, so not the case. Position basically handles retirement benefits for pension, heath and wellness, and life insurance. Huge volume of cases per day then until benefits are set up/paid you will handle that case all the way thru. Typically around 200 cases is a normal inbox. For people who do not understand how to work an inbox, up to 1,000 cases. That amount is clearly unmanageable. Took position thinking that hard work will be noticed and compensated for, never happened. Management is a joke. Never changes what clearly doesn't work. Just wants to make excuses as to why things done a certain way. Always willing to make accommodations for employees who clearly demonstrate that they are unable to handle work load. You get what you pay for, unskilled and un-trainable employees who will not take direction but complain to HR. No one moves ahead or received compensation for their work unless someone leaves the company. Once you are able to advance for one of those two reasons, then they want to pay you so nominal a difference it won't even cover a tank of gas every two weeks. Never had so much work or responsibility to have it not be rewarded. Horrible culture and environment. Would never work for them again. Would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"I have been working at Lockheed full-time (More than a year)"
bad,"Good company to work. Good compensation, Personal growth is better. "
bad,"management did not support their employees "
bad,If you enjoy getting involved with politics this is the job for you.  Advancement opportunities are often decided by who you know and your ability to convince others that you are better then the rest.  Compensation varies greatly from location to location.
bad,Racial discrimination was apparent and deep especially the Union that was suppose to protect the employees. Their were more snakes than genuine people which made it a very contagious environment for conflicts.
bad,working with engineering of setting up equipment for the L1011 aircraft project to be shipped to the California faculity fro pre flight.
bad,"Corrupt and culture of protectionism. Look Elsewhere. If you have another opportunity, take it!"
bad,"I was a 2 year contractor through Personnel Resources. I worked underneath the General Manager, who is longer located in Troy. The GM promised me a full-time permanent position but decided to take a job within the company up North, which left me out of a job because he did not keep me on as promised."
bad,"Incredible, worked foreign military sales, Traveled the world building and selling Lockheed Martin Products,  Met numerous cultures and learned a lot.  All work ethics are different and Spain;s is the best"
bad,"great experience working there. the training being able to work on all aspects of aviation. structual, electrical. assembly. always enjoy'ed working there."
bad,Reviewing daily access and reviewing access in the Antarticatic access for government access.  Creating reports to demonstrate the number of users and access.
bad,Supportive Management and job security.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleague and learning from them.
bad,"LMCO is interested only in money."
bad,"Small team supporting over a 8,000 users, the work is never ending and they over work you. You can go above and beyond and it doesn't matter. No room for advancement or growth. IT dept is very disorganized."
bad,"I would never recommend this company even to my worst enemy. How they make money, no more importently, how they don't get people killed is beyond me. The culture is cutthroat from management to employee and employee to employee, I fully expect to read about workplace violence anyday. There are way better companies to gain work experience from, any of them are better than this black hole of negativity."
bad,"There are so many acts of unethical behavior, despite the government programs in place to prevent such acts, that decorum prevents me from listing them here."
bad,"Daily Outlook use"
bad,I Got hire last year as a helicopter mechanic . My first day off work they had change our managers . Second day of work I star find out that most of the employees were not experience at all as they enforced on their requirements. I got harassment  buy the manager few times and to top it off I found out he was not a certified helicopter mechanic . So I got injured at home really bad my doctor put me out off work for a week then company calls me I'm fire because I fail my drug test so I got a attorney and before I got to file for court they call me that it was all a mistake . I really have a bad experience with this people idk how a big company like this can have a contract with a federal agency . Guess who takes decision on aircraft to fly or not a manager that don't even has a idea how to track and balance . All he did was fly in the military . I feel bad for the people that they are flying these aircraft . They should have a manager that he certified mechanic not a pilot that runs maintenance department.
bad,My work was very rewarding and I was happy in the environment I worked
bad,"Interesting place to work but company ethics only apply when is suits them.  Employment contracts have little value."
bad,"I was Injurd on the Job an all they wanted me to do more work.Like I said it was Hell to work there.Every one wanted to get your JOB .the Back stabers.New company do more work for less pay,work overtime all the time."
bad,"Do not ever apply for or accept a job at Lockheed Martin unless you want your career to end. Lockheed hires top talent and then places these individuals into positions where they have limited responsibility. They boast having numerous programs and initiatives to grow talent, but those offerings are just for show. After spending several years at an LM institution, you will become institutionalized into how they do things. No other company operates like them and you will have a hard time finding employment beyond LM, much less competeing in the job market."
bad,"I enjoy the people I work with, but the work atmosphere that was brought in by Lockheed Martin, has made it difficult to enjoy the job. Keeping customers happy is not what we strive for and management doesn't seem to value the employees opinions. I would like to work in an environment where I feel valuable and needed. The working conditions with the extremely old buildings also add to an unenjoyable working environment."
bad,"Too many hours required to satisfy the employer. Substandard equiptment, bad managers, Uncomfortable working conditions. Having to communicate with supervisors was extremely stressful. the best part of the job was going home every day."
bad,Usually busy pulling tools or putting away inventory learned different aspects of aerospace local management was ok but lacked direction from upper management co-workers were great to work with hardest part of job is the announcement of our closing
bad,"Lockheed was a very good place to work. They took very good care of me, in my career there. The only reason I was layed-off in 2001, was because of my poor additude. My mistaske"
bad,Lockheed Martin has many contracts and the contract I worked on (FS2100) FAA contract was very poorly planned and managed. They were cutting corners and laying off people left and right because of poor management and foresight.
bad,"Horrible company to work for, company hires managers that have no idea how to lead, and decided to move everything to Mississippi, leaving 40+ employees unemployed"
bad,"The company promotes the values of accountability and an open / flexible work environment while ignoring workplace harassments.  You will have multiple people trying to micromanage you and management teams are basically ""talking out of both sides of the mouth."""
bad,"More, better, faster, NOW!  Your best is never good enough, and there is not enough time or budget to do the work correctly.  You are expected to come in early, stay late, and work weekends even though there is no budget to charge hours to, so you are basically working for free.The morale is absolutely awful and they actually (in writing) DISCOURAGE you from taking time off that you are entitled to.  HR Business Partner provides no support or interest in conflict resolution.  I absolutely, positively would not work there again even if they doubled my pay rate."
bad,"The company is all about getting rid of longtime employees and outsourcing their jobs. Many of these contractors have far worse benefits than Lockheed."
bad,"Worst employment experience ever by far. Many many unethical practices and outright fraudulent and illegal practices done on daily basis, while preaching ethics constantly. Avoid at all costs, 13 year almost killed me, as I was stuck due to wife’s medical needs . Worst experience ever after 30 years in aerospace!"
bad,I was hired as a structures mechanic although I applied for a final assembly/flight line position and was told by my recruiter that’s where I would go. Once you sign the paper agreeing to the position they assign you to you are stuck there for at least a year. You can put in for all the requests you want and they will fall on deaf ears and filed in the trash. The one month orientation was challenging at times but easy enough.
bad,"Too much pressure on daily requirements."
bad,You might get hired but you won't be doing what you were hired for. Management is horable and doesn't understand the job you perform everyday. Just a job.
bad,This is the worst place of employment I have ever worked at. The management is a joke. They don’t care about employee at all. They have a mind set everyone is replaceable.
bad,"I was denied interviewing for a salary Security Administrator position after I got into an argument with LM Human Resources about their unethical practices. I filed an EEO complaint because they give preference to females. Less than two weeks later, I was ""laid off"" because they did away with my position (despite having funding for it until next year). At the time of being laid off, they had 4 open Security Administrator positions available. I was already doing the job of a security administrator in order to pick up the slack from everyone jumping ship from LM. Simply put, management there sucks, and the human resources people are unethical. This company is only about filling their own pockets and doesn't care about its employees."
bad,"Very very few people who work the floor or are in management have any aircraft construction, production, maintenance experience.  As my supervisor ""informed"" me my first day of work.  ""If you can think and act like a monkey, you'll do fine here at Lockheed""."
bad,"At first you are promised amazing pay and benefits, but after becoming a Lockheed employee I was flat out lied to. The pay isn't even close for someone with a family or even trying to have a family. you given long hours of what has become slave work I've even been talked done to by my manager because I didn't work Saturday and Sunday because I have personal stuff to handle. I'm sure other location might not be like that but Clearwater is for sure a sinking ship."
bad,The majority is populated by life-time managers and employees unaware of other ways to do business and lacking skills outside of the company. White-collar welfare PowerPoint production house.
bad,"LM Space:"
bad,Lockheed used to be a great place to work.  They have all but mitigated any reason to work there other than a paycheck.  If you have any skill at all don't come work for this company they will work you until you hate your job.  They do not provide mandatory training and expect you to do it on your own time and on your own dime.
bad,"Overall the company was very unorganized and not a fun place to work out, it could be very stressful and the workload itself at times could be thrown at you and you did not know where to start."
bad,"The management style is at best Draconian. They only care about numbers and people are not even on the list of concerns. If you accomplish x amount of work within a given time frame, then you are expected to be able to double that amount within the same time frame on the next project, and then double it again on the next, etc., etc. The work expectations are at best unrealistic and can be best described as delusional. If you are a masochist, then you will be right at home!"
bad,This job has taught me a lot as far as customer service goes that no matter how bad your day maybe you can not let it be reflected in your voice having an upbeat tone matters to the callers and to the bosses. The hardest part of this job is getting time off for emergencies and funerals. They don't care if it's not an immediate member of the family.
bad,"I spent 3 years doing software work and eventually was laid off."
bad,"I worked in a specific department that was lead by poor management.  I was a contractor and treated horribly.  I was there for almost a year and never felt like part of the team.  I found a better opportunity at the time, gave 3 weeks notice and trained my replacement not a thank you or anything the day I left.  "
bad,Upper management can't run a lemonade stand. Always trying to find a way to stick employees in the back. Don't trust a thing said
bad,POOR MANAGEMENT AND ETHICAL ISSUES. After addressing issues with upper management issues were not addressed and remained the same and made the situation uncomfortable and made my health decline.
bad,"I considered it to be a terrible place to work!!! I thought that the majority of the management staff directly associated with manufacturing was pretty incompetent. A large segment of the management staff obtained their positions based on who they knew, and normally possess zero leadership competencies. In addition, I discovered that there exist numerous manufacturing related middle managers that had not attained any secondary education (most have a high school diploma, and many of the upper level management (directors, etc.) has associate degrees. I could not adequately identify any real functional continuous improvement program. I did observe that extensive efforts are devoted to cleaning up the plant (dog & pony show), when VIP (upper level government officials, high ranking military personnel, etc.) visits the plant. The company professes to support lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma, however, after numerous years of superficially supporting these particular process optimization programs, the facility did not seem to have a functional 5S program. Furthermore, I felt that the annual performance appraisals were completely based on subjective characteristics (not data based) and the dominant theme entails rather or not your manager likes you or not during the performance appraisal year."
bad,It’s very bad due to local management staff in the area. Overall the company was a good place to work but the PM and local managers made it so bad. This maybe an isolated situation in my job location
bad,LM expects you to keep your head down and only do work. Don't expect any fun extra curricular activities.  It gets depressing because you know that when you come to work it's guaranteed to not be fun.
bad,"The culture is cut throat, with a management that says is ""making changes."" Most managers are from the ""fear and intimidation"" era - most  have been in their roles more than 25 years and it shows. Extremely political environment. Their technology is antiquated and it takes forever to scan a simple document - they still have not implemented the proper use of a badge to accomplish simple tasks.  A fire drill took place and the system failed, did they learn? An actual fire took place in a container and it moved rapidly because the fire extinguishers did not work. People look and, most of them are miserable, due to their unhealthy culture.  Most people go there, add the experience to their resume, and leave.  They tell you they care, but when you encounter a catastrophic personal issue, they are not interested and count it against you, but they know how to cover their tracks so they are not taken to court.  Overall, a very disappointed experience. I used to admire Lockheed Martin, and then I went to work for them - - glad I am out of there. Will never recommend it."
bad,Depict themselves as a collaborative and flexible work place but really not so much.  Treat college grads and interns great but if you are a little older  forget getting anywhere unless you plan on moving in and developing esp.  Very little communication and management goes out of their way to throw you under the bus if you question anything or apply foranother job
bad,"This company is not willing to work with the employees and current workers are highly intimidating. My trainers was focus on work than training me. Need professional trainers that will watch you building skills, drilling, and modifications of the aircraft aluminum"
bad,"- Your going to bounce from program to program and each one uses different application tools and programming languages."
bad,"Worked in Gaithersburg and Rockville Md. for 3 years.  In Rockville I kept being denied software development work and at one point applied for a job I was over-qualified for with a $20K cut in pay.  No response.  I decided to visit the posting manager at his office. I asked him to be considered for the posted position and, looking at me with a cold stare, motioned me to leave his office.  I then went to the top floor ot the building where development was done and all I saw were young people in their 20's and 30's.   That answered my suspicion, being 54 at the time."
bad,"I was putting labels on Chinese made cables for $19/hr."
bad,People who work here do so for the money and that’s it. Leadership only helps you if they like you. Pay is good but you have no support and have to follow rigid ridiculous micromanagement rules. Nothing good here. I did make wonderful friends.
bad,"If you are gung-ho about government contracting, then maybe this place is for you. But if you want affordable health care, a stable work environment, and a job that doesn't treat you as instantly replaceable, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
bad,"Managment is horrible. Absolutely no organization. No skilled workers. This place is a complete mess from the top all the way down. Zero job training or support of any kind. Forced to work long hours and weekends. They consistently make bad parts and lie to government on audits. If you have any self respect or quality in your work, DO NOT APPLY HERE!!! If you do not join the union your work will be sabatoged by union members...."
bad,"Poor management, period.  Individuals part of their LDP program will get advanced before you even without real work experience.  They drive out good talent..people are just toured of it.  Managers get their promotions whether they have done the job or not...way political.  The work environment in Manassas is every man for him/herself."
bad,"Don't ever get a serious illness that requires constantly leaving work for treatment or you'll be accused of ""mischarging"" your hours, get laid off, and months or years later get a collections notice in the mail for hundreds of dollars you never imagined in your wildest nightmares you would receive. And I am a 50% disabled veteran that developed epileptic seizures while I was an employee, however was accused of leaving too often so I was let go with absolutely no chance to explain my situation. The only thing I would recommend about a Lockheed Martin is to either run the other direction or work there every day with a deep fear that you are absolutely expendable and mean less to corporate executives than dirt on their shoes."
bad,"At other companies I excelled, often scoring 5 our of 5 on reviews, over-achiever, loved to do anything for my companies and was rewarded with multiple promotions, quickly moving through the ranks and loved by all... this place.. definitely not that.. no one cares about your passions, career, or your life in general. You could come up with an award winning idea (5 patents and counting) and Executives, Directors, Managers, won't care, only care about themselves, not who works for them. Culture here at Sikorsky EXTREMELY toxic. There is a revolving door of people coming in and out of this place like I have never seen before."
bad,"Training department does not actually train  you for your working position. Once on the floor, the competition between senior staff and new hires is horrible. Senior level staff deliberately direct you to do the work wrong, thus, you get into trouble for not working correctly. Causing your supervisor to not be sensitive to you as a new hire."
bad,"35 year employee. Every year another benefit or perk removed. Oh and they try and tell you it is better for the employee. They pile on way too much work. When people retire or move on, no replacement is hired the work is just dispersed to others who already are overloaded. When that happens no or very little training provided."
bad,We were purchased by LM and it was a nightmare from day 1. Finally left 3 years later and have not regretted it since.  Job satisfaction and security were the absolute lowest I have ever encountered.
bad,Too PC.  No longer concerned about experience and job knowledge.  Hiring young people with no product knowledge or knowledge of federal law and regulation.
bad,No support from management. Some of the worst managers I have ever worked for. Lack of experience of managers brings failure to trying to do your job.
bad,"LM bought out the company I worked for and tore it to a million shreds.  We were once a proud bunch of employees who supported the VA customer, and one quick motion of LM taking over, that went out the door. "
bad,"Invaluable skills learned in the military that shaped me as a person, and enabled me to move on to bigger and better things. Would not be where i am today if it wasn't for the military."
bad,"Awful work environment, management intimidation and retaliation. Management would never provide all information needed to complete projects. They prefer for you to work blind seem to fear staff knowing more they do. Insurance not all that great."
bad,"The majority of management acts as though they are elitists.  The work is filtered down to the lower levels through a fire hose with little instruction and background information.  Senior management takes little action on middle management and middle management usually runs wild, treating employees as objects vice people.  The compensation package is decent, however, you don't see most of that compensation in your pay check.  It reflects in the benefit package they provide.  HR seems to make an effort to help you with issues with management but it is pretty much a waste of time to go to HR because ultimately nothing will happen as a result.  But it's been documented, so thank heavens for that."
bad,"The TSA HRAccess program and Lockheed Martin are a complete joke! I'm so disheartened with Lockheed Martin and with this program, I've never been treated so unprofessionally and with such disrespect in my working career. You couldn't have convinced me prior to working on this program that it's as bad as it really is, but it's really bad! As they say, don't quit your day job to work on this contract, you'll be sorry!"
bad,"Poorest example on how to provide contracted services to a government agency."
bad,"Third time I worked for them. Were bent on having a useless Security clearance. Sat on most Of The time. I opted out Of The union, so maybe they could not handle It."
bad,we set up 2 assy. lines saved about 500 jobs then they laid us off 3 weeks before we were vested..
bad,"To much useless management, Company has become so large it is disfunctional"
bad,This company provides limited advancement opportunities. The management structure provides low feedback and often does littles to help the employees advance.
bad,"Genuinely a mess. Contract IT changed hands multiple times in 2 years. Turnover due to inconsiderate and incompetent management is out of this world. Bottom dollar pay for grueling field tech conditions in a huge facility. Every department is understaffed yet expected to support almost 15,000 employees. Avoid like the plague unless you're going to be a direct hire."
bad,"Lockheed no longer cares about there employees, all about the money.  The culture has changed over the years, use to be about building a quality product, now its about how much can take from the government."
bad,"They really hyped me up to think they are a great organization. Turns out there is no structure, little to no training, zero development opportunities and only way to advance is to really suck up to the higher ups. The only good thing was the pay but compared to their competitors it is low and not worth the stress. Was extremely disappointed in this company. It's amazing how good they are at covering up discrimination here."
bad,"I would not recommend my worst enemy to work with the current management aboard MCAS, Yuma. The work itself was great, providing support to our American war-fighters was outstanding. The problem lies with the Site Security Manager."
bad,"Dont bother if your a veteran. They put you in with dead weight in the form of coaching which is useless. The old people that work there are afraid that one of us combat vets are gonna take their jobs so they lie about us to the ""management"" I use that term loosely most of them cant find their butts with both hands let alone lead from the front."
bad,Since I have not worked there for over 30-years there is not much I can say that is relevant to current conditions.  At the time I worked their the company was extremely political with internal politics driving many people to behave in ways that would not be tolerated today
bad,Management is ancient and has no life. This needs no further review. There is no growth and everyone becomes robotic. Pressure for no reason to preform a job that is simple.
bad,Work environment was uncertain and there was little support from management. There was significant uncertainty regarding job security. Felt like there was always a threat of layoff.
bad,Working in the help desk is equivalent to working in a call center. It's slave labor. You can get fired for simply not answering your phone or not being in your seat.
bad,"Lockheed Martin is a shareholder company. Expect high levels of returns on the company stock in exchange for constant layoff cycles and outsourcing. Many low performers with bad attitudes try to discourage high performers."
bad,bad place due to Idiotic managers who are racists & can't think for them selves- they hate people who are smarter than them. They do not even plow lot when it snows. they do not appreciate you.
bad,"Too many managers that don't do much and they are less than likely to help you along the way, PrimaDonnas. The managers are protected of their team and not contract employees."
bad,"If your idea of a career is filling out paperwork and working for backstabbing management, then Lockheed is the place for you!  A once proud and excellent engineering company is now nothing more than a paperwork factory run by people who have no idea how to make a product."
bad,"Tough financial times in the world of government contract awards."
bad,"Honestly, Lockheed is fine.  My opinion of DISA would get me flagged and banned from the inter webs.  Just don't do it kids."
bad,"I truly thought this job would be my perfect fit. However, everyone I ever knew that worked there said it was the worst job they'd ever had. Since it is a government contract, they have to meet the agreed terms, which is difficult. You are not really meant to help people, so much as get them off the phone and to the next call. They are paid per call. Things were so tight they could not even afford office supplies. Illness is not tolerated. One minute late is a write-up. Weekly negative feedback, even for the best employees. The hours sucked."
bad,"The company focuses on money and the bottom line instead of producing for the customer. The managment does not align with company values of work/life balance, and mentoring."
bad,"Took the job with a lot of hope for the possibilites and the direction they were heading, left a short while later after being fired with a group of others while the company maintained they were just laying us off due to the economy. The reality was quite different but no one wanted to hear about it because the economy is/was suffering in alot of other places. This company stands behind their ethics as if they are above reproach and then pulls off a stunt that completely alters the lives of many employees and not even an eye is batted for a place that gets the large majority of their profits from the federal government contracts they acquire."
bad,"Management is concerned with the bottom line, not with supporting the customer. The hardest part is the lack of true leadership and the textbook children who think they know how to deploy a system."
bad,"LM is bloated with managers who lack technical skills, so they micro-manage the people doing the real work.  They request status multiple times per day (they have nothing else to do) and they take credit for the accomplishments of the people doing the real work.  Then they get promoted and/or move on to some other program they know nothing about.  I know that sounds like a harsh exaggeration, but sadly it is not."
bad,"Culture of dishonesty,hatred for outsiders. Mgt. supports this culture.Outside professionals booted out or run.Avoid Troy division and Fla. corporate."
bad,"Repetitive, felt like I was back in High school again with all the gossiping that goes on. Support staff treats general population of workforce like they don't know what they are talking about because they don't have college degrees."
bad,"No room for advancement. They had favorites. The hardest part of the job was not leaving your station. Management was the worst."
bad,"If you don't mind to be let go every time, this is a company for you."
bad,"LM creates great products. However, in their fight to capture and lead the market, it is a culture of piranhas. The top leadership lead the pack in being cutthroat, judgmental, and rigid. Do not be confused or distracted by the polish. They are brutal and people are expendable. New people are used to lead the majority of initiatives.  Not because new people bring new ideas or capabilities, but because new people are expendable; there's been no major investment in them. If their initiatives succeed, great. If not, who cares? They'll get another one. The days are endless, tools and technology are decades behind, and the facilities are filled with termites, rats, raccoons, and cats. Holiday weekends are the worst. The executives drop a hot issue at the end of the day just before the weekend starts. The assigned person is required to provide  updates throughout the weekend so everyone can be briefed on the outcome when they return. I was once called while on vacation and told to return that day because someone else in another department couldn't complete an assignment, but they knew I could. You'd think the company would be in jeopardy to demand something like that. They weren't. It's just that they wanted to roll out the initiative right away and the other person was holding it up. The ethics process is a joke. Long-term employees use it to torment people. They literally create stories, write anonymous letters about the stories, and then corroborate them to the investigators. It's insane, but effective at managing people out that the old guard doesn't like. You might wonder why"
bad,"Where careers go to die!  Union shop where work ethic is frowned upon, technology is ancient and ethics are not required.  Code that was pilot critical was forced through to production when it was not ready due to bonuses over the testing departments objection"
bad,I was on contract with a great company that Lockheed acquired and ruined.  As my profit margin was significantly above Lockheed requirements I immediately became a target.  I resigned but the client hated my replacement and Lockheed asked me to stay an additional three months to train a successor.
bad,"Management is not helpful at all. They play favoritism. The Pay rate is good only because they are a union shop, other wise they would be paying minimum wage. In the area I worked in, supervision was never in the room, they would text you to give you the work direction for the day. There are back stabbing people working in the area I worked in. Very volatile place to work."
bad,"The Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory is a location where employees are constantly pulled between excess internal compliance and demands for productivity.  Many hours of unpaid overtime a week is the unspoken expectation for professional level employees.  Failure to deliver on overtime results in poor ratings and little or no salary increases.  When increases do occur, they barely keep up with inflation.  Employees have suffered on-the-job nervous breakdowns and heart attacks."
bad,This is one of the leading companies for members of the military are able to continue using their skill sets to meet the mission of the company. The job is an excellent place to work.
bad,"First of all it was a sub contract to General dynamics. Which we trained those guys who made 10-15k more than we did. The contract was taken over from a company called FGS and it was one big cluster. The higher ups had no clue what went on in the feild. Everything always looked better on paper. You were expected to know way to much in a short period of time this being that LM bit off more than they could chew on this deal, and the technicians suffered from that. Long story short I would rather pick p-nuts out of human waist with boxing gloves.........."
bad,"Great place for those looking to retire or never advance. Everyone gets inflation based raises and that's all. No one gets promoted, no one gets fired. Bad employees are just pushed to the side and more work is given to the good employees while everyone makes the same pay."
bad,"Not a company that is advancement friendly, Especially if the person is over 40. i would not refer anybody to this company."
bad,"no management"
bad,"Great potential, poor execution"
bad,Great compensation plan. Poor management. Unpleasant work environment to include workplace bullying. Great opportunity to receive cross training for front and back office.
bad,"Lockheed Martin was a good place to work. I leaned a lot about the manufacturing and maintenance operations through supply chain, supply support, fabrication, and working side by side with labor union personnel. The part of the job I liked most was that I contributed to the war fighter ."
bad,"In 2011, Lockheed low balled the training contract for the U.S. Coast Guard. In doing that, they reduced the salaries of the previous contractor's employees by 30 %, and Lockheed's  benefits package poor as well.  I'm sure that permanent Lockheed employees get bettter pay and benefits, but since we're Contractors, treat you as second rate employees."
bad,"The work was interesting, but this was not the right fit for me."
bad,"Defense Industry is taking a hit. Lockheed is the target.Customer want satellites at half price. Hence, cheaper personnel are being kept and experienced people are being released."
bad,"Don't know what to say, but too many chiefs not enough Indians."
bad,"The company has serious problems.  Make sure you ask about the employee furlough program when they make an offer.  Your actual pay will be thousands less than any offer.  They also have an age discrimination problem."
bad,Was good place of employment. training and jobs duties were good experience to  grow on in the aerospace industry.    
bad,A Manager that was not a tester did not see the value of test tools such as a spreadsheet connection to the Test Management Tool (Quality Center). Entire contract staff laid off when they had openings in other departments.
bad,"The last program I worked with Lockheed/Martin in Iraq was the worst experience ever. Bad to no management desisions. Ignoring discrimination,work place herassment and management directly lyeing to their employees. Lockheed/Martin as a whole is a great company but this division was terrible and should be ashamed. I still gave 100% to my job but only because I have a good work ethic. I almost quit 3 times because of the way they handled things. Strongly recommend staying clear of the Melbourne,Fl. office and the BETSS-C/RAID program. I don't judge Lockheed.Martin as a whole because of this office though."
bad,Dont work for Lockheed Martin it a company that doesn't look after it people and the culture is undesirable. The recruitment process requires revamping as it is very long winded and you as a candidate end up chasing all the references.
bad,Diversity and inclusion are choking the company. Unless you fall into a category that requires special attention you will be seen as abnormal. 2 + 2 = 5.
bad,"Lack of inclusion"
bad,I will never work for Lockheed Martin again. I liked my manager on a personal level. But the overall culture is cut throat. There is a general atmosphere of turf wars and simply ugly attitudes that go unaddressed.
bad,"This is a very big company that moves very slow. As an exempt, salaried employee you have to record your time daily. Management is full of leaders who don't know how to lead."
bad,"Lockheed Martin Co overall seems to be good.  However, the management from Owego, NY for this site is a disaster.   The local site is full of bullies.  The recognition works in reverse.  I.e. The incompetent are promoted while the effective, hardworking are not recognized"
bad,"Expected to work seven day a week thirteen hours daily. With this type of requirement, say's a lot about how they fell about there employees and there well being."
bad,"My group was disorganized and had a backstabbing culture which I did not appreciate as I don't do that. I like a more cooperative environment. "
bad,"Lockheed Martin / Leidos"
bad,"Management is horrible. You have to be a ""brown noser"" to move up in this company. Management plays favorites. You are expected to work like a dog with no recognization."
bad,"Contract was not stable, always felt like you would be next person to lose your job. Worked with some talented people that I still keep in contact with."
bad,"It is a matrix organization. You will have about five bosses that change often. It amazed me that I was able to get things done there, but then again it was with people from outside of my group. Why the government awards them contracts just blows my mind. Find another place to work, especially if you are looking at the Orlando office."
bad,"Took the job with a lot of hope for the possibilites and the direction they were heading, left a short while later after being fired with a group of others while the company maintained they were just laying us off due to the economy. The reality was quite different but no one wanted to hear about it because the economy is/was suffering in alot of other places. This company stands behind their ethics as if they are above reproach and then pulls off a stunt that completely alters the lives of many employees and not even an eye is batted for a place that gets the large majority of their profits from the federal government contracts they acquire."
bad,i had 8 different positions during my three years. They were all fun but it was necessary for me to move around to advance. I learned a little about every security discipline. I was mostly bored and underpaid.
bad,The management at Lockheed Martin is sub-par to say the least.
bad,Zero to no training and easily thrown under the bus by management to cover their own job. Brain wash you into thinking if you don't work your 5 free hours each week then you aren't a team player. Who wants to work for free? Lower level management is a joke. 
bad,"Its one of the only places that is unionized in florida, and the people in the union work hard to make sure everyone is treated equally. For some reason people seek to destroy that and will stab you in the back for absolutely no gain. If you become involved with the union you either have to sell out other employees or get blackballed for promotions or future jobs. The managment is vindictive and nobody has a clue to what they are doing."
bad,"Quality works for manufacturing. I was expected to rubber stamp issues to keep production going. When there was not a procedure, I, instead of a production planner, was expected to prepare the document. Not a problem if that is what I had been trained to do."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was trying to convince the program team to do the right thing. I brought multiple issues to management and they did not do anything to attempt to resolve the technical issues. It was almost impossible for me to my job in an efficient and a professional way due to management and the lack of technical knowledge of their staff level engineers. Therefore this made for a very toxic working environment."
bad,"If you are new to the 9/80 schedule, or aerospace in general, then brace yourself!"
bad,"I found out after I left as a contractor my lead did not like me for being a gay male, was given the worst assignments because of it. Was given the impression this was a support role but was a glorified labor job. Upper management did not communicate at all and did not seem to care. One of the leads expressed homophobia."
bad,"As the site lead, I was the on-site person to ensure the contract was going smoothly and the requirements were being fulfilled. Instead, I had to deal with incompetence and lack of character in my co-workers and an HR person who wanted my scalp."
bad,I enjoyed working for the company. Many opportunities for potential growth. My only issue occurred when the business unit was sold to Leidos. Then our group was terminated
bad,"Work not challenging, surf the internet all day due to lack of work, lack of respect in workplace, company sells products and technology to foreign countries that may not be our ally, all about the $$"
bad,"LM preaches ethics, but nobody including HR practices it. The organization operated on a buddy system. People who were no good for the company continued to get promoted, which lead to the lost of contracts. My manager was an ghetto, unprofessional, uneducated bird that had no business being in such a position. HR was more concerned about friends and would protect those who should have been fired. People got away with using their positions to bully those they didn't like. People were expected to do the jobs of five other people or play management roles and not get promoted or properly compensated."
bad,Job tasks change so about every five years you are re-inventing yourself.  Great environment for technical growth.  Management is stilted at times.  Lots of corporate support.  VERY high ethics; I was proud to work there
bad,"I know that on this it says I have worked there less than 2 yrs, but in total I have worked there 15 yrs. It has gone down hill for awhile now. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Management has been blaming everything on the workers such as having bad attitudes it os just kaotic management it seems as if they have no idea what they are doing and it's hard to explain how this place operates or how we even still have jobs. If it wasn't for it being a government contract it would have failed years ago and has laid off alot of people. I have tried moving up here and so has a few other people that was more than qualified for the jobs and we always get passed over. What I have seen here if you are in the in crowd you move up if not well you stay where you are. I left and had to come back because of family, but I am looking to leave when I find a better job. If you do come here keep looking for jobs believe me you will want to. One other thing the health care is extremely expensive like 12,000 a year it will take most of your check to have it."
bad,"No room for advancement, too many old people sleeping at their work areas at the top of their pay grade doing nothing.  You will work yourself to death trying to make a living.  You have to put in 20+ hours of OT a week if you want to get a promotion.  If you're under 50 years old you will be entry level for at least 10 years.  The constant fear of losing your job is the nature of the beast out here, everyone that has worked here for more than 5 years has been divorced at least once because it changes you.  Good luck to all who get through the doors, looks good on a resume but that's about it."
bad,Employees stay off work for three days and come in on overtime and sit on their butts and do nothing. The few good employees suffers.
bad,"I wasn't a direct employee of Lockheed Martin, but I was told  all the negatives by employees. I knew many employees who would leave for health reasons because of the amount of stress they were under. Employees who would regularly work over 40 hours, and would still be behind. Employees who would work their butts off, over time constantly and still be let go expectantly when there wasn't enough work. Lockheed is like all the big corporations. No care for the individual employee, and will just take and take what you'll give and never giving back."
bad,I was an intern and they really just wanted me to do the left over work that nobody else wanted to do. I figured if I worked hard enough they would have to put me on something more meaningful but it never materialized.
bad,"A typical work day is dry and boring. The workplace is spooky. People are afraid to communicate with each other. There is no team culture. Management is not there to help team members to succeed.  The hardest part of the job is finding new projects. When one project ends, finding a new job is a nightmare. The internal job posting does not work. You apply for a job and you never get a call from a manager. The only way to find new work is through work place colleagues."
bad,"Work was easy enough, but replacement parts were inaccessible due to lax expediters. Waiting on a single replacement part sometime took weeks. Lack of communication."
bad,"not a good workplace. No leadership, poor management and poor communication. Large staff turnover."
bad,"There are a few smart people in the Orlando, FL, campus that give a good name to this company.  The culture, however, is 100% TOXIC and cut throat, which explains why no one smiles.  They produce weapons that kill our enemies, while their culture kills the thinking and human spirit.  Unless you are part of the upper echelons, you DON'T matter; their pay is also below average.  Reverse discrimination is WIDELY practiced, but people are afraid to speak up."
bad,It was a stressful experience for me.  I don't know how i lasted almost 6 months there.  I'm out of there and i don't want to talk about the place.  I didn't have a good experience.  Ask somebody else.
bad,"Slow paced work environment.  "
bad,i wouldn't work for that company again and i would not tell anyone to work for therm the management there was very horrible and there was not respect there you had to be a uncle tom  kisser to be working for them the people that didn't know how to respect each other and at time no matter what problem you may have to deal with they didn't care at all
bad,"When deception and SABOTAGE is a part of your daily work life, yes, I said SABOTAGE, suffice to say,this wasn't the place for me. Or, for that matter, anyone else considering the sensitive position I was in."
bad,"There is some good management but there you are just a number. Lot of resources to use but make sure your covered, they don't care about a work and home life balance."
bad,"This site has a bad reputation. I didn’t want to hear it but it was true. I had positive experiences at bigger sites before, but I didn’t expect to have a such as poor experience at this small site being Lockheed."
bad,A bunch of hicks from the sticks won a contract. They treated previous MDC employees like criminals offered very little in benefits and beat us like tent pegs when we asked for overtime. Which was all the time because management was horrible and we were always working to straighten out there messes.
bad,The rich get richer and the technicians are living pay check to pay check. Even with college degrees. Very poor planning. Always reworking someone else's jobs and or work.
bad,"The paint mgr. (2nd shift) just happens to be married to the 1st shift Supervisor's sister. He didn't know what a paper machine was for the painting process, With no product knowledge Sikorsky allows these people to run the show. Most everyone in the paint shop is looking for a way out.       Ps.  Most employees are contractors only a hand full of direct employees."
bad,Work closely with Program Managers daily.  Responsible for administration of major subcontracts to support NASA.
bad,Co-workers use offensive language and stereotypical remarks
bad,"Worked  with other Operations team members and other development teams to deploy Company applications into a standardized, robust, dynamic, well-documented, and manageable HP/UX infrastructure.Supported operations, services, needs and goals of management; and their program and the organizations served, and related customer’s functions, resources, and users."
bad,Have to deal with time lines with every task you work on. I'm more knowledgable about the equipment I'm working on.Better communication between co-workers and management.An example is that one boss tell you one thing and other boss tell you something different.I get along with coworkers.Timelines are the greatest challenge and the hardest part of the job. I enjoy the set work schedule..
bad,A fulfilling career to pursue however security in this field is hard to find.
bad,this company is alright if you can get passed the unethical work culture. the pay and benefits good but the actual employees and management had no clue has to how to do the job or how to be ethical and professional in the work place all in all did not like and would never work there again.
bad,"Corruption and disrespect to policy came to fruition. My ""immediate"" Lockheed Management and team became very corrupt;  Good Ole Boy System. Once again my immediate Lockheed Martin team chose career enhancement and money over our customer and military regulation policies to enhance themselves and contracts.  I do not belong in a corrupt group of personal, nor do I want to."
bad,"Loved working for Lockeed/Leidos, the work was great and management was very good.  The problem is with the company as a whole.  When your contract is over, as in my case I was given 3 months notice, then you are on your own.  The company tells you they will help you in finding a new position with the company which is a lie. You are on your own.   They will send you to their internal TELEO site where you get to apply to jobs just like anyone else outside of the company.  They are not and will not be your advocate, no matter how well you performed on you last project.  I applied to numerous positions that I was more than qualified for in the company and was rejected each time, I could not even get an interview.   Leidos has become  like every other beltway bandit company now.  Employees are just token to make them money and can be discarded as needed."
bad,A typical day at my job included interacting with various people and doing what I enjoyed most...working on vehicles. I learned overall at this job that working on military equipment was a very satisfying and rewarding job. The hardest part of my job was learning how to work on new equipment and the most enjoyable part was being a part of a job that is my passion.
bad,"Excellent work and learning environment within the QA organization.  A challenging atmosphere that encourages continuous learning, continuous improvement, and continuous commitment and diversity and inclusion."
bad,The Clearfield/Ogden warehouse was a nightmare. The management was underqualified and literally told me multiple times that he had no idea what he was doing. I worked 40+ hours a week and wasn't told there was a certain timeframe to get insurance. The organization was nonexistent and the warehouse manager stayed in her office and had no knowledge of what went on out on the floor. The workers were fun to work with but there was A LOT of drama!
bad,"the employees were pleasant to work with but the management was lacking in certain areas which made for an unpleasant job, They seem to be to young to be put in the positions they were in"
bad,"As the title states, this was just another contracting position with no opportunity for advancement or increase in pay.  I arrived at work, busted my stuff to be the best and help others."
bad,Bad environment.  Management threw me in the fire with out any kind of training. They would not work with scheduling.
bad,"Hard work,little advancement almost doing time.Very confined and close knit structure."
bad,The night crew is the best we all do our own thing when we need to work together we do it with no hesitation everyone is very approachable. Management always working with you.
bad,"Company is a what can you do for me type attitude, Motto is one team one fight, but they are the people standing behind you pushing you to do more, while holding a knife to your back."
bad,"The management at the location I worked at was incompetent, worked people like they were in the military, and didn't care to lay us all off when they failed to get another contract."
bad,"Under appreciated and over worked."
bad,The company is reducing its Sunnyvale footprint and increasing the cost for Medical benefit.  It is no longer a place to go for training unless you are single and looking for a couple years of experience but get out fast.
bad,"Aside from the fact that the starting salary I received (being lower than any other lvl1 engineer even though I'm in grad school and almost have my Masters in EE), the work (in my specific program) is incredibly dull.  Pretty much nothing I do is engineering oriented and is all paperwork.  That being said, the people are the only positive thing about where I work, and if the people weren't great to work with I would've left within the first month."
bad,"Loved the work, didn't care for the management. Very chauvinistic and encouraged harassment. Still proved to them that a woman was just as good if not better as a mechanic ;)"
bad,"There are so many Lockheed Martin offices spread out over the DC area it's hard to tell where you fit in org chart. For example, my work was in Virginia, but I had to report to Lockheed's office near Baltimore. No coordination.  It's a behemoth."
bad,"Worked for LMC for many years and the smaller components that were merged into to LMC continued with the same management and their culture followed.  The management personnel needs to be shaken up... need to bring in totally new blood to break up the 'good ole boy' and 'golden kid' mentality.  Provide opportunity for other personnel that are not in with the ""in crowd"".  There is no room for advancement when one is not from the original management chain and the raises and awards always go to the same people or their friends.  It is so unfair it is unbelievable.  Employees that work at their customer facilities were somewhat lucky - but they could never get ahead."
bad,Had the potential to be a great company but to much back stabbing and clueless managers who haven't got a clue about the industry. When you talk to some of the workers who have been there a while they all say the same thing its all about how many S-92 helicopters they can get out the door the quality end of it is gone. Trust me think long hard about going up in one if you get a chance.To meet end of year goals they stole serial numbered parts of the finished helicopters that customers were waiting on and put them on the last 2 helicopters of 2012 to meet gold standard and upper management could receive large bonus.
bad,poor management staff could care less about how the job was done just push stuff through the system even though they need it was flawed. Management's poor work ethic caused us to lose a major portion of our work load from the customer causing 75% of the team getting laid off except them of coarse.
bad,"Supervisors, are clueless, no room to move up, they do not want to promote from within so your stuck. they love bringing in outside people who also have no idea what they are doing and end up relying on the workers to tell them how to fix it..."
bad,"Big Mistake  "
bad,"Low pay. Benefits are nothing special. No chance for advancement, regardless of experience. Lockheed is just hiring people to fill their numbers. Management has no control over the production floor."
bad,Management has no idea how operate a steam plant everything is fix by a portable swamp cooler.Supervisor does not understand combustion .Workplace culture hostile the supervisor allows it two of the personal refuse to work nothing done about it.HR and Ethics department does nothing about it. Takes two months to get holiday pay.
bad,"This use to be a place where you could get a lot of work done and have a great time with your coworkers while doing it. The difference in just the past 3-5 years is mind boggling. Management has changed their priorities to focus on disciplining people for every little thing, so now no one feels comfortable being themselves there anymore. They are so worried about watching the employees every second that they hired supervisors for the supervisors to make sure the supervisors are disciplining people properly. The support from salary is so non-existent, that nothing can actually get done. The hourly employees can't get the stuff they need to do their job and nobody is on the same page, it's no wonder the facility is doing so poor. Nobody is happy there anymore and the managements response to this is ""If you're not happy, then leave."" Well that's exactly what people are doing which is why they can't keep quality people there. The place is a stepping stone for people because there is no chance of promotion/raise in pay or job ranks. Also all of the upper management there are snakes that will lie and smile to your face while doing shady things behind your back. You could probably count the trustworthy people in management on one hand. Another big issue is the time off earned. You earn a whole day off each month, so please don't get sick, especially if you're new because you earn even less. And that's both sick time and vacation combined. It actually takes a full three months to earn a single day of sick time."
bad,"This is for the OWEGO, NY Facility. "
bad,Poor management is driving individuals from this company.  Employees ' opinions and ideas are not considered part of the decision making process. Recognition is not timely for accomplishments by employees. Flexible work schedule is a good benefit that works.
bad,My experience there was not good. The turnover rate for young people there is high. Pretty much everyone that was there when I started left before I did. It was a stressful environment at that time (2010-2013) and the culture was not good. Not sure how it is nowadays.
bad,Top heavy with limited advancement opportunities to get into Management or higher level positions. Pay is low and based on poor annual commitment system. The employees are too comfortable in their cozy jobs. Merit is overlooked by years of experience.
bad,Terrible Management...absolute worst. There are some good entities bit there are twice as many bad ones.  Management seems to be all about their careers and couldn't care less about others.
bad,"Bought by Lockheed-Martin last year, they immediately announce  $150M cost savings goal followed by a 1500 Reduction In Force, so much for keeping talent"
bad,They had me sit through training for 3 months for a six month position with an other women for the same position who's cousin was in charge of the project.  after the three months they let me go but she continued to work for them.
bad,"The job with HRAccess is thankless, difficult and has very few rewards.  I do not recommend it to anyone except as a last resort."
bad,"Every action requires a job code -- discourages innovation, long range strategic planning,  so very risk adverse"
bad,"I enjoyed working for this company for the most part. Unfortunately management is lacking in many aspects. There is lack of communication, trust, and teamwork. As soon as the government budget changes, you are out regardless of your hard work. The review process is disingenous to say the least - that comes with the lack of communication and the backroom dealings that go on without your knowledge."
bad,"a dismal place to work, people droning about with their what seems like chores, only there to make a paycheck. The pay was decent but I was at the bottom of the totem pole. The graphics department will have you design minimally creative things, such as business cards and letterheads that have pre-designed templates.. occasionally you'll get an interesting poster to design."
bad,Not a positive experience. Do well to continue searching especially working with ISGS and MEGA programs specifically CTFC. Client and few LM created a difficult time.
bad,Do not use their employees in the best positions for their talents.
bad,"The culture is toxic. The team I'm on is not really a team because sit in different buildings. Management lacks compassion. They just want a body at the desk, doesnt matter who is sitting there. Culture is not inclusive."
bad,Manager is clueless along with upper level management. No planning to avoid problems. Only reacts when problems arise and then doesn't address root causes. Moral is low and we've lost over 25 percent of our employees due to low moral and low pay. We are expected to work overtime and not be compensated for it. Our SOW shows a clear separation of duties but we are expected to perform the duties pf higher paid positions for lower pay.
bad,"The work is fine, and the coworkers are great for the most part. Management doesn’t support the work force. There is a very weak union, out of 160 hourly employees only about 40 are in the union."
bad,"Lockheed at Crestview doesn't care about its employees, just inefficiently delivering aircraft. If you want to work for the company in NW FL, do so at Ft.Walton Beach, Eglin AFB, etc. They say they are a family, but they are really a good 'ole boy network. Constantly changing shifts (working hours) and strategies every several weeks because management cannot stick to a plan and make it successful. If you have a family you want to spend time with, don't come here. They will make sure not to listen to your concerns for your/family needs which would only make you a more productive and effective employee. The medical plan is relatively inexpensive, but has high deductibles. Co-workers for the most part are great, but management plays favorites, even if you have seniority over them!  (Union shop)"
bad,A lot of lazy people work here they  work harder finding ways to get out of doing their work. The management just turns a blind eye to it and wonders way the work never gets done. Problem is fixable but they don't want to fix it just complain about it.
bad,You will be treated differently...mgmnt will verbally abuse you and lie to  you.  I was intimidated much of the time.  But their s/w development was the best I've ever seen and there was a lot of it.
bad,"You can't say anything to anyone for fear of offending them. They will terminate you just on an accusation. "
bad,"The position I was hired for, was hastily arrainged, with no fore-thought.  The contractual obligations I operated under were incredibly vague and I had no guidance or support from Team headquarters"
bad,"I’m at Lockheed for the benefits. The money isn’t enough but it’s hard to find higher pay elsewhere. The people at Lockheed are inappropriate and child-like, very much people I do not like being around and would advise everyone not to speak about their personal lives around anyone at Lockheed Martin because rumors are created and run rampant. Very much like a middle or high school group of people, yet they’re much much older."
bad,"I worked for a small business that was purchased by Lockheed Martin.  The work culture was toxic, unskilled managers and no work/life balance.  Benefits were poor."
bad,"Well it really wasn't that great, to work there."
bad,"LM does little in the way of developing company loyalty. This, in combination with an ever-shrinking benefits package, creates low morale. Because of the prominence of the name, salaries are lower than what one might encounter at a smaller firm."
bad,"Great Job if you like  liars.  Management lied to me from day one to the point that they couldn't even remember the lies or the promises they made.  Then when questioned about it denied saying anything."
bad,"Different rules for different people/ departments, Favoritism,  Ethics and Diveristy are proclaimed but not practiced, Unfair wages amongst males and females,  Retaliation for people who speak up."
bad,"If you are an entry level employee (just graduating from college/university), this would be one place to check out.  Depending on the location you work, you might get to share an office versus having a cubicle.  Pay could be better and so could the management.  Important things, such as letting employees know when the client's contract is about to end, is kept a secret by management until the last minute."
bad,"Coming in with no experience was a great job at first. But lack of advancement/Training opportunities, and lackluster benefits are forcing me to move on."
bad,"Good pay, low benefits. Contract not good for stability. Work culture toxic, don't expect to feel like a valued employee. Good people but turn over high and management interaction is low."
bad,"Average work, but leadership is re-active rather than pro-active. I learned some new skills. But there is no room to advance. Worked with some fantastic people."
bad,"LM is a fine place to begin working, but ultimately, all that they have to offer are jobs, not high paying long term careers. I recommend staying for four to five years at a maximum before moving on."
bad,looking for other opportunities. The product is starting to slip and it is all management driven. We are trying to build aircraft we are proud of and the company isn't letting us do it.
bad,"This is a career that provided great potential, however, the company has made this job something that anyone with a drive to improve and improvise get beaten down over time.  If you are looking for a job to come in and be encouraged to not go above and beyond, then look no further, however, if you are trying to really take control and go above and beyond, do not look with Lockheed Martin."
bad,"For a Fortune 500 company Lockheed leaves a little to be desired.  You want to feel like a number, work here."
bad,"Benefits are market driven.  Each contract is different, so the review is dependent on the management of the individual contracts.  I've been on excellent contracts, and very, very bad contracts."
bad,"A large number of young people think it will be cool to work at Lockheed Martin when they graduate. The reality is you get hired, they give you a little training, and then you get your cubicle. You will be in that cubicle a long time, because they don't want you to better yourself by applying for other jobs. No joke, they keep employees there and will try to block you and hold you back. It takes a long  time to get promoted also. They got rid of the pension and the good medical plan. Go for another job if you can."
bad,"Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company benefited from the talent and energy of Silicon Valley more than it contributed to that talent. The corporate structure hindered creativity and creative problem-solving. ""Good enough for government work"" was a frequent saying. My manager tried to foster group cohesion, but most people worked to live, not the other way around. That said, work/life balance was something to struggle for. Work hard, play hard (but not often) was more like it."
bad,"I have held two positions with the company. Structural Mod in Georgia and Structural Assembly in Texas. I relocated for both and was laid off with in nine months then five months. My background is flightline, flight line operations and maintenance. The production side of aviation was my week side and guided my decision to take the position."
bad,"Sikorsky pays well, but expects alot from you. Expect to work lots of overtime, management is schedule oriented and does not seem to make logical choices. 100% contract driven, and prone to layoffs. Labor union shop which makes it very difficult to get anything done."
bad,You are just a number here and the focus isn't on the employees well being or advancement.
bad,"It may just be program related, but when you are going through a lay off and LM management asks employees for their resumes to pass them throughout the company to other managers to find people positions in other locations and don't follow through, its hard to give a good rating. The company as a whole i don't think is bad. But from day one until the end, it seemed that LM was more worried about employees taking repetitive online training courses, that 85% of the time, was the same material you saw the previous year. When a manager pulls you from your task and has you take these pointless training courses, it doesn't say to me that they care about customer satisfaction, although they may say otherwise."
bad,"This company preaches many things, but fails to execute due to managers who are stuck in their ways. The saying ""that's the way we've done it for years"" runs rampant in the workplace. Their inability to listen to employees will hinder the company's employee retention."
bad,Employees concentrate more on degrading others to get ahead. Managment advances those that are favored.  Not much opportunity for growth. Must work silently in order to avoid words being used against you.
bad,They advertise the F-16 program if you apply you will be contacted by a third party recruiter.Management is clueless logistics team schedules work.  Production has to adjust work flow because of the scheduling by logistics. Exiting the security gate every day and entering the next day without an issue is the best part of the job.
bad,"You need to connect with someone on the organization if you are to be successful. The culture is one of many silos that only look out for themselves. It is also a culture of placing blame on others for failures. Most people learn to keep their heads low. The union also runs the show at this company. They strongly influence all the major decisional directions, not necessarily well.."
bad,"It has 8 hours of work. Depending on the duty you are assigned to. Sometimes, we have to work for 16 hours since PPA has limited number of guards. I learned a lot. I can cope up with the environment. It's goo. It's good."
bad,"Lie, broken promises. Can't speak the truth, no one listen, no organization. Things change daily at managements whim. Want you to work 7 days a week. No thanks or recognition for jobs done well or above and beyond. Very poor management.."
bad,Worked hard and diligently preparing a briefing for a international customer. At last minute a manager said he would brief my material even though this person has no background nor understood assumptions of the work. Must be about the frequent miles. Shared this with US Govt and they could not believe this was taking place.
bad,Amazing company but leadership / staff play favorites...not a good environment. I wish they wouldve recognuze my 25 tear militray career and my graduate degree. They had me working with level 1.  It is who you jnow and they will move you up.
bad,"Easier to move up if you leave and come back.  Rehires promote faster than the loyal. Management did not lead well, nor had a good grasp on what was happening in their department."
bad,very un organized and terrible management. no communication. dont follow the rules with the union and the union did not help me keep my job when management did not do their job
bad,"I had a really horrible experience at Lockheed Martin. Every experience is different. Because of its reputation as a company of excellence, after working there for six years I was positioned  for career advancement outside of the company."
bad,Its okay. Its hard to move around and you have to switch departments to get promoted. The best part is the flex schedule but you are asked to work overtime often
bad,"Just short and to the point, Its not all sunshine and rainbows. Lockheed is in no way based off what you know it is all about who you know. The management all have degrees but no real experience in actually leading people."
bad,"Cons"
bad,"constant blame game"
bad,this company is very relaxed and low key to work at. People are very friendly and management is decent. Pay wages are very low and not a good career choice.
bad,"The expectation is to live at work, you're undervalued, with no career advancement opportunity. Military personnel are treated with little to no value. Management gets trained once, then never again throughout the rest of their career."
bad,"My perception of this company is that it is extremely top heavy. There are too many managers, assistant managers, vice presidents and other non-productive positions to afford a well paid production staff."
bad,"Old mentality company with old employees from a previous bankrupted company. Bought by Lockheed Martin but nothing changed: same faces, same mindset. This is a time bomb just waiting to explode."
bad,"After Sikorsky was bought out by lockheed, we just seemed to be just a number instead of an employee.  I guess because its such a large company.  Culture changed soooooo much"
bad,"was a good place to work but there was a problem with the management and because of this there was a high turnover of staff HR was aware but did not do enough so the problem continued and is still continuing now."
bad,Management likes to gossip and chit chat instead of focusing on their employees and helping the staff with getting the job done.  Consistently there were times when you were reminded that you were the little guy.  They would continue to load you up with work and then bad mouthed you when their unrealistic expectations were not met.
bad,"LM is death for a good engineer. Every project is severely over-budget and behind schedule. Management is poor, as management is given too many tasks and too many employees to manage. The corporate, DoD air induces a special kind of stress and block-headedness that is difficult to muster day after day. The environment is also rather s3x-ist..."
bad,"Ran from a business perspective well which means totem poling reviews, zero common sense, and rely mostly on a renewable manufacturing team instead of long term experience professionals. Stock is doing well."
bad,The union in this shop has made it impossible to work. You have to wait for other people to do or not do there jobs and maybe you get to work but more then not you don't. I was givin a heads up about this place and he was spot on. If you like your sanity then don't apply here.
bad,"Program was relocating so there was not much room for growth. Manager left a week after I got onboarded for maternity leave. Deported manager didn't really manage me much and half the time I didn't know what I was doing. Culture is very depressing, team were not welcoming and people aren't very helpful. Dumped a lot of ""busy"" work on intern."
bad,"Decent place to work if you don't like advancing in your career. Too much chiefs, not enough Indians. Liable to be laid off due to constant changes in production programs."
bad,"Seriously, as long as you do not commit fraud or become violent, you can not be fired. This leads to a large amount of your coworkers being incompetent or lazy since there is no incentive to work hard or produce anything other than the bare minimum. If you want somewhere with great job security and little to no effort needed, Lockheed is great. If you want to work hard and be rewarded then this is not the company for you. You will be underpaid and you will not get recognition if you do good work."
bad,"Typical day contains repetitive work, you do the same thing everyday. If your looking for a job this is the place, but if your looking for a career don't make this permanent."
bad,"lousy upper management they could care less unless of course it means more money for them personally. They think they know it all but in reality  what goes on, on  a daily basis they have not a clue as how to do thing right."
bad,Long working hours.  The environment is filled with politics and clicks (the good old boys network).  Micromanagement and hypocrites are plenty.  The company squeezed every penny from the employees where they can.
bad,"Management is very unorganized, non-supportive of employees and reactive versus proactive. This severely and negatively impacts employees work/life balance in the area in which I work. The good compensation is not worth repeatedly having vacations and planned days off cancelled or having to work 24 hours straight. Management continues to ignore or even exacerbate this issue showing a distinct lack of concern or respect for employees."
bad,"This place was not a place i enjoyed working at. If you dont kiss managements feet, they werent interested in keeping you. They move you from your normal job to somewhere that you had no idea what to do."
bad,Expected to work a minimum of 6 hours overtime weekly to get a decent evaluation and on an average of 20 hours to get recognition.
bad,"Typical work day seems involved with worrying about where you spend your time or what charge code that work is going to."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work for. I worked there was almost 2 years. I was terminated due to me reporting allegation against my supervisor for harassment. The pay could be better for the work we do, however the benefits are great."
bad,"Lockheed Martins way of approaching problems is left to be desired. They have too much management that in many ways does not talk to each other. I don't think it is a corporate wide problem, that it's only the managers that are put in those positions."
bad,"refused to promote anybody over 45 yrs old, It's a crime they can get away with violating the LAW!!!  Very suspicious in their honesty dealing with all customers.  Union is overbearing & has far too much power. Product quality is subject based on all aforementioned issues."
bad,"OMG what have they done  bad management spoils this job, they need to hire new skilled people.    bad management.   This new contract is failing"
bad,"I signed a non-disclosure agreement and will not discuss. The job was demanding, but worthy as I knew my efforts were in support of the US Military and our war-fighter,"
bad,High stress and unpredictable. You're always insecure about your position with the company. Advancement is difficult.
bad,"Lockheed Martin is great as a corporation. I found an impressive library of process for nearly every aspect of my job - but the local management team was about as dysfunctional as they could get. Fortunately, most of those problems have been weeded out.  Your mileage may vary."
bad,"Work environment varies widely by manager. HR fails to keep young talent because of poor compensation. IT doesn't seem to care about quality, but rather making sure they hit deadlines. Poor management seem to progress in the company while technical roles are pigeon-holed."
bad,"I had nine years at company and there was a lot of pressure to perform error free.  This is a company that has a ""Golden Children"" within each project sector, these individuals get all the credit and those outside of the club are not rewarded for their efforts or given a lot of respect."
bad,"Helping customers"
bad,"really good coworker, but management not what I expected, had higher expectation of management,"
bad,"I would not recommend this as a career choice, and I am grateful for the experience, as the things I have learned will help me in a future job."
bad,Work involved building bombs. Major issue with the company is the local cliques within the plant. Nothing further to add.
bad,Company offers no benefits to employees. There is no job security. Continous layoffs. No pay raises for over 4 years.
bad,This is a good place to start a career if you get lucky and join one of the rare high performing teams. Skunk works lost that little piece of magic it had many years ago.
bad,Utilize a variety of equipment such as forklifts and hand carts to transport
bad,you get 6 months if your lucky. Mega paper work just to complete a job and you are timed on each job number.
bad,"Constant Layoff Warnings, Slow to Promote, Behind in the Time"
bad,"I enjoyed my time with Lockheed Martin but from day 1 of the new program manager he showed no interest in keeping me due to my close relationship with the customer, there at the program and abroad. I was blackballed by this individual, until it was inevitable that I was not part of his group. He went as far as to have me accused of taking materials home  to have me released from my position as Sr Training/Qualification Manager for the program at Lockheed Martin. He and our Customer had knowledge of this practice that I had since 2008 (countless emails and communication records for proof of activity and their knowledge of this activity) due to creating a new training/qualification program for the MK48 demands, meeting with our customer abroad, pentagon officers, Naval Training facilities and at various locations traveling with this material. I was resolved of any wrong doing by the State of Hawaii but he action has caused me and my family a great deal of anguish, even to this day in moving forward. A person of this type regardless of their job performance, should never be in a management position and especially a Program Manager. I to this day hold Lockheed Martin accountable for all this grief. From their HR Department to their Security Department, they all know how wrong this was for me but could not turn back once started. Not very professional on all levels."
bad,"No growth opportunities, no leadership present, terrible conditions. Worked on a six-month contract. Good pay, not so good benefits. Management gives little to no advise on work and expects difficult tasks to be accomplished without collaboration, coordination, or direction."
bad,"When I first joined LMCO (at the time it was Martin Marietta), it was truly exciting.  I looked forward to going to work every day.  Working over 40hrs was a bonus because you never wanted to leave."
bad,"Lots of favoritism, not much advancement, no loyalty. I would not work here again. This is no longer a company that cares for it's employees. The benefits are horrible and they take take take from those that work for them."
bad,"Overly stressful and management doesn't recognize hard work.  Work life balance is not respected, it is loathed.  Advancement is offered to some within their current jobs while others are expected to move to other departments to advance."
bad,Since this will be public information I decline to make any comments at this time.  They are a large corporation with some of the typical issues that accompany a large and disjointed culture.
bad,Lot of sub culture. This company doesn't know what an ideal work environment. Lacks big time servant leadership model mostly command control. Doesn't know how to use the resources well. All kids are taking leadership.
bad,"I don't care if I make $100K a year - when I leave work, I want to leave it. Period. Instead, I had to take my laptop home with me for remote connection, working nights, weekends, holidays and being on call during vacation time off. I resigned with immediate effect, and they're not back-filling the position. I've also learned that the General Counsel (Legal department) is trying to dis-band the entire Trade Compliance group as worthless. Black Widow mentality - glad I got out when I did. Others in the department suffered similarly, one just got demoted for causing ""chaos"" in dealings with Business Development team. For her sake, I hope she finds something else soon. The stress got to me, I'm sure it's getting to her."
bad,"Lockheed Martin in the Tri-Cities is an okay place to work. It was decent place for a while till the layoffs came around the corner. Not much to report, this was a 9 to 5 job and nothing beyond that."
bad,"Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, is a company with no other interest rather the making a profit.  Instead of concentrating their efforts in the individual's they have hired to the job.  They rather treat them as expendable items and contract outside agencies or companies.  So, the investment they have made.  Is essentially wasted, and no longer considering the employees as an good investment with great experiences.  They rather contract outside to avoid all Medical Insurance, Benefits, Taxes, Union, or many other issues.  So, therefore the hired Contract Companies can deal with those issues.  The bottom line is Lockheed Martin is downsizing their actual employees and contracting outside agencies to eliminate all Union, Governmental, and State constraints."
bad,"the working pattern is a very attractive  benefit of working at LM, but the hardest part of the job is working with in a slow paced business which is driven by working with the customer of MOD."
bad,"Lockheed Martin is a huge company with multiple departments; therefore, LM as a whole does not know nor care about the level of dysfunctionality of some of those departments. They are only concerned about the corporate footprint and bullet points that make it onto their marketing materials. You can be a fly on the wall and just work there forever, forgotten, yet taking home a pretty good salary. But if you are unlucky enough to have a bad manager, you won't get any help from human resources or from corporate. Bad managers do not get fired at Lockheed; they just get reassigned.  The work ethic of those in charge is not like in a smaller company that is hungry for work and must be better to beat the competition. Their standards are very low because ...well, it's Lockheed Martin. The level of waste and inefficiency is appalling. In my almost 10 years there, I learned less than I did at a smaller firm for which I previously only worked for 4 years. They are not cutting edge although they like to think they are."
bad,Terrible. Too many clicks for upper management to even consider dealing with. many employees have been there eighteen years and have never moved up. Sad place to work.
bad,I am not about to write a bad review about my previous employer.  I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers.  The rest I could do without............
bad,"was made a leader only to get fired. was given a job in pearl harbor, then fired over night. I was thrown out to dry, was treated like a number. Gave my best for seven years, made employee of the quarter, the promoted to team lead, fired a month later..."
bad,"if you work hard, you get to stay and do more work.  if you pay attention, you will learn new skills.  if you work hard and get your work done, you will be ok."
bad,"I start my day filling ice for the soda Machines, and the coffee Machines, as well as getting the Salad Bars and deli up and running. also checked my drawer at the cash register."
bad,I was a contractor and made sure that they hit there savings goal as 2/3rd's of the programs savings and was the lowest paid person of the program. They hired multiple people for me to train as sales people and paid them more money when they had less skills. I would never work for them again. The call me when they fire someone and ask me to come back Then hire others again have me train them then they no longer need me as a contractor.
bad,"I will say it's a great company to get on your resume but not a good company to stay of for the long term. "
bad,You show up. You get paid. You go home. Then you do it all over again. That's it. Not a ton of room for advancement. I did enjoy a majority of my coworkers.
bad,"This company is clearly interested in protecting retired military officers, specifically, Colonels and above.  Regardless of their incompetencies they are continually promoted"
bad,"Lockheed is a very large company with a variety of jobs. If one is a rocket scientist, they would be most happy to have a job at Lockheed. If not, one would most likely prefer to work anywhere but Lockheed as it is really a government job with none of the benefits."
bad,"Overall, it is not terrible. There are a lot of introvert people so the comradery is not very good. The work is challenging though, and when you see you projects flying in orbit there is an enormous sense of pride that you will feel."
bad,"Not a lot of activity in this role most of time was spet checking over vehicles , management wasn't th greatest to work for alwayshad their favourite to do the jobs, and always gave the craps jobs to those they never liked."
bad,"-No growth potential for employees"
bad,Everyday is different and always challenging.  Be prepared to work long hours in support of the customer both internal and external.
bad,"Beware , 7 yrs ago it was a pleasant place to work......now , there are sharks.................looking to bite you.....its all about work instead of people"
bad,"I have been an LM employee for several  decades and have witnessed it's severe decline, which seems to be accelerating lately. Employees are lied to about telecommuting opportunities when power hungry local area managers refuse to allow it. We no longer care about producing airplanes in Marietta, diversity and political correctness is our sole overriding concern. We are currently losing our best employees with an unsustainable turn over rate. There is no morale left and most people are there strictly for the paycheck. The young ones are leaving in droves and the older ones are taken for granted and can't wait to retire. Something will have to change soon or the Marietta site will cease to be viable."
bad,Travel to government locations throughout the USA. Install and educate workers on how to operate and maintain the machinery. Very rewarding and really enjoyed the professionalism of the Lockheed Martin Staff.
bad,"The company is very bureaucratic and very slow moving. It can't get out of it's own way, and does not offer meaningful advancement opportunities to top performers. It has a turnover crisis, which managers are aware of, but because sales have been bad, is too preoccupied to fix the human capital issues."
bad,You are just a number to them. Management is horrible and so are there values. Laid off after promised our job was safe. Took a pay cut after they bought our contract and we were treated very badly.
bad,"Job pays the bills and good place to put on your resume but no advancement, managers no available at all times, no raises and the workforce always fighting with each other to look good for advancement."
bad,"Ca't tell you the truth, for fear of loosing my job. The job itself rocks, but the management and supervisors are the worst I have ever encountered in 30 years of work.DO NOT take a job with LM."
bad,"LMAL was a great organisation to work for. However if one did not fit into the mould of the perfect employee then they were singled out and made it hard for the employee to do their job with confidence and without stress."
bad,"Didn't enjoy my time at this company at all.  My work assignment was totally different than what was explained during the interview.  I went through several different managers over the course of a single year and ended up getting let go during a ""restructuring"" by a manager I hadn't even met yet.  Most people I know there have either left or are looking for new jobs.  Not recommended."
bad,Like most large corporations today there is a lot of talk about the employee being the most import part of the daily business focus. Unfortunately its a lot of hype and talk and for the most part nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing gets in the way of making the almighty dollar.
bad,"Overall, Lockheed Martin is a good company for someone looking for a stable job working a 9 to 5 and is looking to retire.  Lockheed Martin is an excellent manufacturing company that deals with technologies within the manufactured products.  The company was not a good fit for me because I was an innovative thinker towards technologies that was not towards their manufactured products.  I would not want to work for Lockheed Martin but I would be open to working with Lockheed Martin or any other defense contractor."
bad,"Understaffed, stressed workforce, little benefits and poor wages for hourly employees, advancement is nonexistent, unless you have a relative that is management with the company or you are fresh out of college. Experience counts for nothing."
bad,its was a great place to work and don't know if the will have a contract next year. that is scary management inst great but willing to work with your schedule
bad,Working on rockets is an amazing experience. World Class facility surrounded by toxic work culture. This company has some major growing pains to work through and needs to figure out how to maintain the younger generation of talent through better reward and incentive.
bad,Very fast paced environment. Must be able to multi task and travel at any given moment.
bad,Lockheed has a tendency to stick the employee into a cubbyhole/niche that is hard to move out of. In order to advance your career or obtain new experience/skills you have to leave the job and go elsewhere. Management is sorely inadequate (no true leadership) - there is either poor communication leaving the employee second guessing what his/her manager really wants or there is no communication at all. Lockheed in its infinite wisdom has decided that the employee needs to have at a minimum 3 managers which can lead to high levels of frustration. You are caught between managers trying to determine whose goals/expectations must be met. Some managers do not take bad news well such as unrealistic deadlines will not be met. The pay is very good and that is what keeps the employee with the company. This is what is known as the ''golden cuffs syndrome'' - hate the job but stay because the pay is good.  Job security is non-existent and the benefits used to be very good but that has changed as well.
bad,"Challenging experiences were not provided, culture is negative instead of promoting and engaging."
bad,"large company unions, management, cables.  practiced all day with no exact job duties"
bad,"Reviewing engineering drawings"
bad,It a great place to work where there is a great need of improvement can be done to make work place and living condition of employees  better
bad,"The work is easy, fun, and the people are really nice. I don't have a lot to say"
bad,They are more worried about the bottom dollar than they are about the employees!
bad,"The union has completely wrecked the manufacturing side of this business. Until the union is out, the company will never reach its full potential. The management isn't perfect but they are powerless against the union workers."
bad,Great opportunities to make a difference working with the government but the local Lockheed Martin managers do little to allow for your advancement.
bad,The best thing about Lockheed Martin was the overtime hours but the amount of contractors they hired was a very poor decision. When hired i didn't work for almost two weeks and didn't have scheduled times of coming to work or leaving work. Nothing was organized which made everything confusing to the other contractors and I.
bad,"slow paced, flexible hours work place that have you worry every time the contract ends. Salary below average."
bad,The Management at the location where I worked was not great. Many of them were fired because of complaints.
bad,Contracts are bid to win and not realistically - Employees then suffer to make up the difference - Is abusive to work there in almost all cases.
bad,"Very large company. Very behind the times, too many lay-offs"
bad,I work in very technical environment that I enjoy and really like all the people I work with. They do have a union and that is a big draw back of the job because it limits your opportunities because it protects people that have been there and not necessarily your skill level. The hardest part of the job is sometimes it can be long hours in in climate weather. The most enjoyable part of the job building something and then watching it work.
bad,"If you don’t have a college degree then you’re screwed. They don’t favor you for military service because it’s a private company , so none of your work experience matters to them."
bad,So long as you do everything the LM way you will do OK. Do not think about what the customer wants or how the customer wants it done. Do it the LM way and you will be rewarded.
bad,"Its awful...... I've heard that other LM locations are much better environments to work in but not so in Lexington. It dirty, full of live pests, and they treat people so disrespectfully. Never in my 19 years of working have a I felt like less of a real person than I do here."
bad,"I worked at LMT from 1999-2012. "
bad,"Good security but hard to advance. As expected in a company that supports the DOD there is a lot of bureacracy and paperwork. Its a very large company. Some managers are good, some are terrible. Some functional managers are detached and have a poor grasp on what the people that report to them do."
bad,"It's such a large company that there are probably better experiences to be had on the commercial side, but my time on the defense side was extremely demoralizing."
bad,Has became a horrible company over the past 4 or five years. It is completely cut throat and will do anything to save a dollar. Even if they have to out source a life long career employee.
bad,"Culture: ex-military older white males are the majority which in and of itself is not bad... what is bad is the lack of career growth due to many of those people not retiring and LM's rigid standards of who gets promoted vs. not.  Also, many people are very outspoken/belligerent regarding politics which is tolerated if not encouraged.  "
bad,"I was promised to get some sort of assistance to relocate my family after I got back from a deployment.  I decided to move to Cannon AFB, NM after a friend said I was welcome to move in with him for a bit. Lockheed changed their mind and I quit... moved back home with my family."
bad,If you are in Talent Acquisition stay far far away. A bunch of Microsoft folks rolled through here on the upper management side a few years back and it hasn't been good since.
bad,"Lockheed was just like any other job.  I don't know what more you want me to tell you. "
bad,I learned a lot.  I worked with some good people and some not so good people.  I always got along with everyone and the supervisors were pretty good.  I think a lot of stuff could be improved.
bad,"Typical"
bad,Everyone is a hard worker and very skilled and knowledgeable at their job. Hourly employees have great benefits. Lockheed tries to make the culture as positive as possible.
bad,"Don't ever question Sr. Managers.  Egos are bigger than the company.  Sr. Management staff egos are crazy.  The longer they have been there the worse it is.  My unknown Sr. Manager was lazy.  I say unknown because after a year, I never met with her once."
bad,"I go to work do my job and go home. Some people at work I am friends some not. The way they work things there, if you are not the supervisors best friend your job is in jepordy. Does not matter how good you are. There it is who you know not what you know. too many rules are bent there to satisfy there little cliques. not wanting to work there again if the same managers are there."
bad,People are highly motivated to deliver customer capability. Undeveloped strategic vendor management. Poor programme management team environment and support
bad,"Management is pretty much absent during the week. Pay is low for the task preformed. "
bad,"Lockheed Martin Discriminates against older workers, they prefer to lay them off in lieu of young cheaper work force. But they are part of the ""Good old Boys: network so the government still gives them some contracts."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"A strong #4 on worst managed companies I have been associated with.  Consistently mislead their customer base on deliveries of spare parts.  Always looking for a scapegoat for late deliveries.  They have been sold out of the parent company since my employment.  Quite possibly the new company owners will fix the culture."
bad,A lot of micro-management. The benefits plan is expensive and only covers annual screenings and checkups until you meet your deductible. Very chaotic and stressful work environment
bad,"Unless your an idiot who wants a few smart people to employ you.  Don't go to Orlando."
bad,"My personal opinion is that LM got into uncharted waters and got in over their head when they bid on the US Army RASM-C Contract. From all that's been said and written, they are figuratively losing their shorts, and that of course is being felt most at the hourly employee level. "
bad,"This is a great job for someone with limited ambition, because you will never get promoted, regardless of your job performance."
bad,As an entry level employee it is very difficult to move up the ladder. Management was very poor. Day to Day functions are not really established leaving employees all feeling very frustrated.
bad,"Typical day was well paced in the beginning, but as people were laid off the remaining employees were assuming the responsibilities without any additional compensation. Most enjoyable aspect of the job was the product being manufactured and knowing we were supporting the WF."
bad,Its hard to believe that one of the largest manufactures of military aircraft allows complete mayhem and chaos from the assembly line works drug uses and violence to managements fraudulent billing and time control.
bad,"Company is overwhelmed with political correctness, diversity and bureaucracy. Promotions are few and far between. Salary and benefits are better than average."
bad,"Log into contracting system, read/respond to high priority emails.  Review calendar. "
bad,"Mangement is a term thats just thrown around here. Benefits are completely un affordable with a wife and one child even at 20 dollars an hour. Hard to believe, but 1700 a month is legalized extortion."
bad,"The biggest problem with this company is management. Communication with middle and lower management is nearly non-existent and decisions are often not made in time to make deadlines.  This may be due to managers being located in multiple states and time zones. Decisions and courses of action change hour by hour causing confusion throughout the ranks. They also understaff production areas and assign multiple rolls to managers to save money on payroll.  This means many areas get ignored until there is an emergency."
bad,working on user problems and call in co-worker did not like me because they would drink on duty and I did not
bad,Reconciliations and various duties and responsibilities daily
bad,"The site is a slow sinking ship with the work and quality of rewarding work decreasing over the last 8 years & with it the staff as well.  There is no rhyme or reason to who and from what department gets laid off and survivorship is based on who you know, what clique you belong to, or who your related to.  The morale was lackluster when starting here at this has steadily gotten worse. The loss of contracts, morale, and quality of work are all interconnected issues which management does not want to address.  Job advancement: Wait for someone to quit, retire, or die before a position opens up to favoritism.  There hasn't been any real company growth or contract gains in years at this site so no new positions are being created. Work life balance: the company offers a 40 hr flex schedule but it's up to the disgression of the supervisor.  I found the disgression was more based on the mood of the individual supervisor vs the actual work flow.   "
bad,"Very poor organized company. Health benefits were poor and management was not really present most of the time. I started out here after retirement, Would not ever want to work for this company again"
bad,"Too big on the shoulders of fear."
bad,"Company is downsizing due to contract delays from the US Government. "
bad,"As of recently, new ""leadership"" has caused low morale in certain departments/sections of the company. Immediate management listens and responds well to needs, and does their best to ""shield"" their employees from the overwork (without compensation) atmosphere that higher-level management pushes down. At first training was abundant and encouraged, and I was able to capture much of the knowledge that was tossed my way. Overall, co-workers are respectful and professional and may possibly be the best part of the organization."
bad,Company more concerned with numbers in stead of customer service
bad,"I'm very disappointed with Lockheed Martin, because I feel they are not in touch with the employees like they used to be. I was in my own way at one time a walking advertising billboard for Lockheed Martin. They have forgotten the people to some degree and make a lot of money but pay very little money to the employees who get the job done. To many clicks with management if you could call them management."
bad,"the benefits are very good, no question there."
bad,"Work comes and goes in ups and downs. We are really packed where we have to much to do or we have little to none. I learned a lot to do with solar cells and space crafts, also learned forklifts overhead cranes and how to drive PALD's. coworkers there only watched out for them selves and never like to teach anyone anything."
bad,Not enough work to support current employee base. Several resources have left this year.
bad,"The company is okay generally speaking, however, the Management is top heavy. There is not a sense of consistency with there ERP system across the company."
bad,Good people at the lower levels but senior management were clueless and it shows as they haven't won a significant defence contract in years and the ones they do currently run are a debacle to work on.
bad,"I was hired through a staffing agency to be a pc refresh technician for Lockheed Martins Missile and Fire Control location in Grand Prairie, and while I learned quite a bit and was recognized for my hard work, and even given the position as “data technician”, I was sent on temporary unpaid leave once they found out that I was pregnant and stated that, “there was no work available for me while 6 months” I was later told that I could return after the birth of my baby and they never responded to me. All in all, the company put me in a really hard place in life but I would recommend them to anyone who is NOT EXPECTING!"
bad,If you do get hired make sure that you have a back up plan. If they lose a contract they will keep sub contractors on and get rid of the actual LM employees. And subs get paid better for doing same work.
bad,"all benefits are great with this company, some of the people are fantastic and others are the typical union represented members who want to make you have the worse day possible. "
bad,"Stay away. Company culture was rampant when I left. Meaning there was no clear dress code, no clear advancement path, etc. Management was so swept up in staying PC that many skills and employee attributes were overlooked, and many tasks were incomplete. (I believe the customer was seeing this too)."
bad,When lockheed martin finds out you have a skill set that is now added to your job description with no addition compensation. In California they are a union so fellow employees can do the absolute minimum with no repercussions. This company takes joy in letting you know that you can be replaced at any point in time so if you are no happy the door is right over there. I was with this company for 6 years at Edwards AFB on the F-35 program and would not go back to work for them to save my life... Basically if you get a job here you can do little to no work take 2 hours for lunch and you will be fine as long as you clock in on time.
bad,Bloated upper management and bureaucracy prevents real life decision making at lower levels. Unrealistic one-size-fits all approach passed down. Disconnect despite the programs designed to prevent the disconnect.
bad,Worked as both a calibration and avionics technician. It is union work and shows. A bid problem with salary versus hourly. Hourly workers are union and not really treated as part of the team.
bad,"Culture, management and career advancement are necessities of any company. Lockheed is lacking in those fields tremendously. Management is pressured which goes down the line.  All the people that work there have egos and it's tough to really speak out."
bad,Worst company culture you could ever imagine. Picture the most depressing and boring work environment. There are no windows. You are in a cubical all day with very little human interaction- great for introverts.
bad,"I worked there for almost 10 years and while I was there, everything kept getting worse...raises, benefits, etc. The only thing that kept me there was the work/life balance. We worked 9/80s meaning we worked 9 hours a day and got every other Friday off."
bad,"Management did not care about the employees, the only thing that management cared about was the company's stock and how it performed so the bigwigs at the top can get there bonus."
bad,Many rules and regulations.  Rules are different at each place.  Govt contractors for the most part.  Performace and Quality are very much kept track of.  Job advanement depends a lot on furthering education.
bad,I have been with Lockheed Martin for about 3 years and the work environment has been spiraling downwards since my arrival. They keep cutting employee benefits year after year.
bad,Management does not communicate with employees unless there is a problem.  During eight years one person in an office of 50-100 was actually promoted and given a pay raise.
bad,Lockheed Martin's full spectrum leadership provides a great structure and training curriculum. The Program Management leadership is solid. Work life balance is a challenge.
bad,"I had a great tenure at Lockheed Marietta as an Engineer.  In recent years, working at Lockheed Marietta has deteriorated.  Many people aren't happy with the company.  They have eliminated pensions and raised the cost of benefits significantly.  People don't trust management.  They are eliminating many of the older experienced engineers and hiring unexperienced people.  Many people believe that the Marietta plant might not be around much longer, not sure about that."
bad,"Good experience. Direct managers are very helpful and educated. Good Pay. Work from home opportunity."
bad,"- Great/hard co-workers"
bad,"Provided you are willing to do as you're told, you'll be fine. If you have your own ideas and are willing to stand up for them, you'll be ostracized and downplayed."
bad,a typical day at work is very stressful and management causes most of the stress. It is a exciting place to work if there was so much politics involved to do your job
bad,Good company if you want to work for a federal contractor.  Great benefits.  Customer is always right which is a challenge when trying to please the government.
bad,"* No telling what you will be doing"
bad,see previous review. did not feel appreciated.  there isn't more to tell that I didn't already say in my previous review
bad,"Material Consumption Redesign March 2014"
bad,"I've worked here for a number of years and boy have things changed.  When I was with Sytex I Loved, Loved, Loved it...but when we got acquired by Lockheed Martin we fell into the corporate rut and it was downhill from there...they have soo many young fresh out of college managers that don't know the real meaning of being a manager...the favortism that is just thrown in employees faces is insulting.  Pile the work on the employees that don't work directly for the customer but don't recognize them for the work that they do in any form of bonuses or cash awards...morale is very low on the support staff...it feels like all you do is go to an assembly line and punch the clock....but the day never ends."
bad,"Lockheed Martin use to be a great company with excellent benefits.  However with the dwindling defense budgets, Lockheed Martin has cut staff, benefits, and morale to the bare bone.  Constantly increasing pressure to do more with less.  Layoffs EVERY year for the past 6 or 7 years.  Expected to assist co-workers meanwhile you are ranked against co-workers.  Lockheed Martin use a curve to rank employees meaning someone WILL be in the lowest category no matter how good a job he or she does."
bad,HRIS is no longer what it used to be at Lockheed Martin and is no longer a fun place to work.  There is also no room for advancement.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would include the following activities:"
bad,"A good place to work with good benefits, lot of politics"
bad,Once hired at MFC OCALA one cannot get transferred to another business unit without quitting first.
bad,Overall happy with my career here. I have had many oppertunities for advancement
bad,"I began my career at Lockheed with the hopes of achieving job gratification and a challenging position. What I discovered was a very disconnected management team, that was standoffish and very resistant to change and could not seem to break out of their current business model to accommodate a new business."
bad,no opinion at this time. I spent many years there and noticed several changes in the management levels. The last manager in my group was not a peoples person. It was his way at all times......not good.
bad,"Days were always pack with things to do. You learned how to multi task as soon as you walk in the door. Management will provide some guidance, but for the most part you need to make your own decision. The culture is very strong and at time overwhelming. Most enjoyable part of the job is all the new things you see and learn."
bad,"Unorganized and chaotic. As a contractor, I reported a theft of government property containing classified data by a federal employee for whom I supported. There was no investigation done."
bad,"Great Place to Work!  West Palm Beach, FL is absolutely beautiful."
bad,"I love what I do and the customers I do the work for are the absolute best. I wish I could stay doing this the rest of my career however the company is driving me away. There is no respect for the work you put in and how great you make them look, only an email bloating how much money you have made them each quarter. I have been here over 7 years and have never received any sort of recognition or bonus, while the same time management and above soak up profits into bonuses for themselves. "
bad,"This company used to be a great place for every level of career. the benefits were amazing, Managers seemed to understand what their subordinates were doing, very competitive pay. Ever since the New CEO took over there has been a major shift with regards to pay, benefits, and promotions. You will not get a promotion so get whatever you can on your way in. Very important to keep in mind. "
bad,"If you're looking for a place to retire, Lockheed is great. If you're young and looking for innovation, look elsewhere. The development process is extremely slow, and you can get by doing barely any work for years. No one really gets anything done, and you never get to see your work being used by anyone. There are a few dedicated people who make it all worth it, but without them it'd be hard. 10+ people have quit in the past 6 months."
bad,"Lockheed Martin earns money by billing hours, not by innovating.  If you like to shut up and color, you'll love this place.  Lots of vertical silos.  If you hire in as a new grad, you may be lucky enough to be placed on a rotation program.  This way you can experience an extra two yeas of being an intern and having senior engineers dump grunt work on you before working on a real program."
bad,"Great group of people to work with, exciting work and decent pay."
bad,"Managed the operational aspects of ongoing projects and served as liaison between the TSA projects and project management, training, project teams, and  Airport management."
bad,There is significant opportunity for logistical movement if indiidual is prone to wanting to relocate. Good opportunity for interns just starting their career.
bad,Management lies to customer. Forces employees to lie or employees are taken off project and blackballed. Keep proof of all you do for your own protection.
bad,Low paid technicians don't get paid enough for hours put in. Can barely afford the cost of living. Higher paid employees get bonuses.
bad,"Little recognition, poor HR."
bad,"Not the greatest places to work if commitment to values or the client are a high priority. Senior management pushes values that the  middle and lower managment doesn't enact or believe in. Employee's are punished for championing the client's needs and doing work the right way since it will impact the profit margin. "
bad,"A typical work day begins with a meeting, researching documents and developing a plan."
bad,"If you want something very stable, great place to work. If you want challenging tasks, opportunity for advancement, etc look elsewhere."
bad,Takes too long to achieve objections despite (or because of) onerous systems in place. Disconnect between teams leading to a reduction in collabration opportunities
bad,The manager I worked for is great. The worker have issues with working as a team. The company is in the dark ages and needs to get up to date with the equipment to do their job efficiently.
bad,40% of the workers do 100% of the work and management does not seem to care.  They get paid by the government by the person.  There is no accountability for each persons quality of workmanship.
bad,5 Mangers in 2 years not good at all you can’t please all of them also you sit at work station for weeks at a time waiting for work.and when you are on computer you get in trouble for using it.
bad,"While the science that goes into missile production is fascinating, the actual application is impossible to deny. Unsurprisingly building missiles every day leads to a globally insensitive culture."
bad,I am wanting to leave because with my qualifications the pay is low. Little room to advance and younger employees get a free pass while older employees are held back.
bad,"I work in a company sub-contacted by Lockheed Martin and they give me the opportunity to work in there and i learn to be a leader, to be fast.  but they were not organize at all."
bad,"A typical day at Lockheed as a Software Engineer is a 9 hour struggle with very little fulfilling work to do. Get up early so you have somewhere to park, show up and walk down the stairs into the dungeon. From this point on you will not see the sun for 9 more hours, so make sure you take a good long look. Once at work unless you are in ADP, you will write code about 2 weeks out of any 3 month period. The rest of the time you will be doing tasks that any office worker could do. Additionally upper management makes it painfully clear that they do not care about retaining their new hires. Collectively as a group, we new hires have time and time again voiced our frustrations to them and we have received no response. To give you a good idea, I started with 11 others, and only 3 are not currently active in the job market looking for another position. In your actual work environment you will be subject to a culture of negativity, that is unfortunately, very justified. My advice, stay away."
bad,Working for LM could be fun and challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge to deal with and trying to figure out how to do things the right way; It could be fun and challenging.
bad,"Working at Lockheed Martin, I was able to work on a wide range of products.  Due to the size of the company there was not room for advancement."
bad,"Please be aware that you will be waiting for a clearance that could take up to 5 years! Sometimes it comes in as fast a month, but on average I believe it is 6 months. I waited 2 years just to find out I was declined. I wish I could get those 2 years back. So if you are willing to gamble a little then go ahead and accept the offer."
bad,On going lay offs for 8 years due to sequestration and congressional budget cuts has taken it's toll on the company culture and morale.  Not a fun place to be.
bad,"A typical work day was very productive and busy. I learned how to scan, name and upload documents. Management was not good, fair about pay increases and handling employees that would go around creating problems for others. The hardest part was meeting deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the work day was over."
bad,"Review, Proccess and Approve all visitors comimg to site. approximately 75 visitors a day. Send clearances and travel orders to other agencies for Military, Government and contractors that permanently resided at site. Cutomer service, included but not limited to, answering all incoming calls for the Personnel Security office. scheduled appointments for all government officials. Replying to all incoming emails for site visits. a typical day would be around 75 e-mails. this office is a very fast paced environment with lots of last minute demands. I learned how to write a continuity book, create new hire training manuals, worked with several security clearance data base, I was part of the site FSLS innovations team. This was a team of about 15 we collected information from all agencies/companies. I loved my job and what I did for the customers. I enjoy helping others and the fast paced environment. It makes me feel like there is never a wasted day of work."

bad,This is the best place to work for work/life balance; reviews are poorly managed and based solely on the Team Leader/Manager as to how your review will be used regardless of all the good/excellent report from other employees.
bad,"I found that I did not enjoy the engineering lifestyle. Requirements and test procedures are pointless when it all gets rewritten within a few months. The culture itself was nice, as the employees are wonderful, but engineering is not my forte."
bad,"Usually did not need to take work home with me, in fact, working from home is highly discouraged. However, having every other Friday off was a great benefit."
bad,"Great salary, great work schedule. "
bad,After being hired on at Lockheed there was really no training.  I started in Supplier Quality but not really allowed to go out to suppliers to help them. Was not able to perform my job functions.
bad,No chance for advancement. You are pretty much stuck where they put you. Manager did not know what he was doing. There is little to no increase in pay.
bad,"The culture is broken and the divide between salary and hourly is cumbersome.  There is definately a ""good ol boys"" mentality and all inclusive is a catch phrase more than truth.  Like anything else, its all what you make of what you have to work with.  There's more people employed on the salary side then hourly, in Fort Worth and it shows. "
bad,"If you're new to the workforce, this is a great place to get your feet wet in a safe professional environment.  This company's been around for 100 years so don't expect the new startup oriented gimmicky things.  Instead it'll be slower and more structured, but you'll definitely be around talented communicators, be exposed to great benefits and live in one of the better cities in Texas."
bad,"Not a place for innovation. Innovative ideas are flushed away as they go up management chain because of ""how things have been done"". Everything revolves around budget and when no one wants to pay for it, nothing changes. Lockheed is operating in the 90's still while we live 30 years in the future. Management does nothing to change it because all they care about is their own pension and they don't want to take on the risks of change because they might lose their job if something goes wrong."
bad,All of my positions were very slow paced and unexciting. Low pay for the high cost of living in a major city. Upper management is rarely open to new ideas or ways of doing things.
bad,"The job was simple, but management made it difficult. If it weren't for the pay and benefits no one would work there. Laziness, incompetence, and spinelessness were the main factors that made management poor."
bad,such a short duration of time here so its hard to judge. The work on cable harnesses and controllers was good and educational. I work with a good group of people
bad,"I worked on D5 missile assembly program for the U.S. Navy....got to travel to Florida to see a launching of space shuttle......met a lot nice people at Lockheed in Sunnyvale CA. I was one of 3 female techs in our department...had to work hard to show the male techs we were qualified to work on assembly and enviornmental testing. There were cuts in defense spending and as a result,....I was layed off in 1991."
bad,I would rather not say  this is not an option at this time I will not say anything incriminating  I will not stipulate any uncertain terms about this review not now but possible in person.
bad,"The proverbial glass ceiling, not so much as for me, as my subordinates. They were the lowest-cost bidder; hence, what I could offer my employees as incentives."
bad,"If you're a good worker you get punished with other people's jobs that are lazy, very repetitive and hard on your body over time, there's no appreciation for good employees management has no clue on what needs to be done, micro managing makes it almost impossible to do your job on top of all the new processes they add to your job"
bad,"I elect not to review this company due to having worked on classified programs I am not at liberty to expound upon.  In addition, discussion of company sensitive information of a proprietary nature would violate the confidentiality agreement I signed."
bad,"They care more about pleasing the customer versus their employees. I contacted the Ethics Department on a whistle-blower situation with the customer and upper management, and the Ethics Department never called me back to close the case. They swept it under the rug hoping it would just disappear. "
bad,"Good Career Starter out of college, but nothing else.  This is a place to get your feet wet and that's it. Management is horrible. Coworkers are ok. Upwards movement is based on time not skill."
bad,"Assisting client to seek employment, providing supportive service to enable to search for work. Tracking clients participation of activities that have been assigned."
bad,"The company has mostly specialized engineers, and top secret security programs are dominate.  High stress job for the most part, but purposeful."
bad,My typical day always starts with getting my group together and discussing pending tickets or other projects. I then reviw all the E-mails and tickets that needs my attention. I work with my co-workers  to resolve issues and help them learn to resolve. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with people.
bad,"As a seasonal employee, immediate managers were not flexible when it came to family emergencies, etc."
bad,"Always busy."
bad,we worked very hard as  contractors and the directs did not do very much. S76 was a nightmare.
bad,A rewarding career experience until it ended....................
bad,"Typical Day: Most of the guys were professional, which made us working as a team much easier.  Typical day is hang with the guys a bit, check what needed to be done for the day, gathered the resources needed to complete the task(s), and started work."
bad,With all the government cut backs about to come down the pike they will probably have many cut backs
bad,I am not happy with LM as a past employee the pay was what you can start at a local grocery store then be my guest. But unless you have a college education I suggest someplace else because someone who just starts with little or no education what so ever will be the most expendable employee there. Take it from me
bad,Lockheed Martin can make it a comfortable place to work for but they don't have a placement program when a contract is terminated.
bad,Nothing more than a contract company. Once contract is up you are left out to dry.
bad,"The job was good. The people that I worked with were great. But this company is all about making money, the cheapest means possible. So you might not be offered a livable wage."
bad,"It was a great company to work for. They paid very well. The unfortunate thing working for company was they did not recognized anyone for their skills. It was too much politics, It was all about who you brown nosed in order to keep your job. The only good thing about working for them was how much they compensated. It was all contract work."
bad,"I quit Lockheed due to poor ethics by their management and the heavy handed approach they took with me.  The job was insanely boring and I rarely had enough work to fill my day.  Areas I have great skills in, they could not place me in.  I always ended up doing things I had no background in at all.  For example I went to school for Databases and they have me doing electrical engineering.  A great skill to have but a poor fit for my skillsets.  Great people there, and great work life balance with minimal travel but the compensation and overall challenge of the job combined with the management forced me out of there.  While I would work for LM again, at the time leaving was the best career change I ever made."
bad,"Lockheed  Martin won the GSM-O contract and went from a time and material to a fixed firm price contract. Unfortunately that ment cuts in personnel and in salary. Current environment is overworked, underpaid and of course the result is a rather large turn over in personnel. I'm happy to be employed but lockheed's priority is it's bottom dollar and thats blatantly obvious with the GSM-O contract."
bad,Good Honest Work. It was a great starting point in my career. Without this job I wouldn't have the clearances I needed to branch out and travel.
bad,I was an intern at Lockheed. The people I worked with were wonderful but the work itself and structure is not very progressive. Often worked alone and not very collaborative as an intern. There is not a set structure to their intern program. They kind of just put you there and set you on something to keep you busy while they work on their own projects.
bad,Good company that gave me a solid start once I left the military. Learned many things from fellow co-workers. Work/ life was a little hectic but I can only speak of being deployed and working overseas for Lockheed.
bad,"A typical day at work is busy busy busy."
bad,"Good pay ,good employees . Company provided training on vehicle that was required to work on. Management handle personal problems in a timely manner.being away from my family,working with soldiers"
good,"Work was interesting and  challenging from the beginning to the end of my contract. Get to where many hats, laying out boards, fabrication drawings, ecr's. Mechanical drawings."
good,"Good place to work "
good,"I worked for Sikorsky for 2 years as a temp and they couldn't see their way to hire me as a full time employee."
good,"I learn working at this job that the management staff need training. The staff was very rude, I did not enjoy working at this company."
good,"A typical day at work involves meetings, planning projects, high visibility initiatives that engage multiple organizations."
good,Got a 25% raise when I left here for Shared Medical Systems.
good,No diversity or opportunity for minority’s or women to grow and develop for career path. Very discouraging as many jobs are based on government contract renewals
good,"it was a grueling experience"
good,"LM hires numerous contractors for various reasons, but the only reason I've seen is so they can have cheaper labor and fire you at the front gates on your way into work.  There's a constant need for overtime because they're unwilling to hire more help.  Few contractors get hired on as actual LM employees after their contract is up, despite being constantly assured that there's a position available for everyone that sticks it out."
good,I would rather not comment. The assignment was a one year project that was delayed before it started so making milestones was not possible. The PM team should have been more realistic with their planning.
good,NO comment. I was raised to not say anything at all if there is nothing good to say. Therefore I say no comment. Besides where ever you go it will be totally different.
good,"A typical day at work involves me doing meaningless tasks, which don't allow for much challenge. Thus hinders my ability to grow and be promoted to another level."
good,"It is a corporation so always keep that in mind. Most people are hired as contractors so there is little to no advancement for them. While they discuss helping to encourage a healthy lifestyle it is not enforced and most people are jammed in their desks from early in the morning to late at night. Of course, this is all contingent on which program you are in and can vary in that way, but definitely not the happiest place to be."
good,"Not a good company to work for. Poor management, nepotism,and unethical."
good,Work hard and then work harder. Always trying to improve upon what is learned. Wish there was more of a work life balance.
good,"LM tries hard to promote their mission at the top level, but it gets watered down by the time it reaches the lower level employees. Employees often take work home, so there is zero balance between work and personal life.  Pressures to meet Program cost and schedule often blurs and compromises the Company’s core ethics."
good,"This company has. a lot of work opportunities. however, it's primarily depending on your position within the company whether you'll be able to move up."
good,"If you apply go directly through company for full benefits. I wish that I would have applied directly through the Lockheed martin aeronautics company. We went in with false intentions and outrageous expectations, Work had for a third of the money others are making."
good,being a contract employee with no benefits and worrying about whether you are going to have a job from one day to the next is very stressful. no paid holidays either make it stressful also
good,"Greenville, SC site seems to be the step child of LM. It is non union, unlike the rest of them. There are quite a few people that have been there for over 25 years. The workforce there is a skeleton crew for such a large facility."
good,the health and wellness pay was deceiving.  This is only a benefit if you do not obtain the insurance. This created a salary expectation of less than i budgeted
good,"I did urgent care and Occupational Health for 450 employees."
good,I had a good time working at Lockheed but management was very poor
good,"Typical defense contractor, big company. Reorgs every 2 years like a shell game."
good,Fresh out of college create place but if you are an experienced individual it is not a great place for growth or stability.
good,"I worked in Coatesville from July 5th of 2011 until December 16th of the same year. I went up on their $9,800 bonus program. I took a total of four days off, including weekends, the whole time I was up there. Ten hour days during the week and then at least six hours on Saturday and Sunday. I busted it for them only to get laid off twice in that period! I got let go two weeks before I was set to receive the final payment of my bonus. I would never work for these people as they just use contractors. Don't pass the entrance exam and you're not hired, no travel, no nothing! I wouldn't recomend working at this facility to my worst enemy."
good,A very small facility in Lockheed . Training on software for receiving dept. was poor. Training on other departments were worse. Direct supervisor and manager were tops . Below them did not provide even work establishment.
good,"people don't know their jobs, they move around so much that no one gets proficient in one area. most people are guessing on how to do their jobs on the floor."
good,"I came to Lockheed after working at other circuit board and Flex companies.  I was disappointed as to how things had changed.  Promotions are not given on experience or education, but on who you know that has influence.  If they don't approve of someone, they will never be advanced .  The pay is below what competitors pay. They prefer servicemen and women to apply. They prefer a bachelors degree, not an associate or a masters, a bachelors. The harbor bullies, rather than dismissing  them."
good,"If you are not from the Airforce, they will try to run you out. Most of the managers are horrible people in General. I would not recommend this job unless you are current Airforce."
good,"A typical work day started at 7am. I sat at a desk and took phone calls at a help desk and created IT related tickets. "
good,"While I appreciated and supported Lockheed's emphasis on quality the focus was so much on what was wrong you would be ""talked to"" even when failures you caught were with items and tools that were acknowledged by engineering to be undependable.  This created an environment where everyone was stressed what negative comments they would be getting."
good,"Disorganized and ill-equipped to provide a valuable internship. When I arrived on site, after going through the security clearance process and all, they discovered that they didn't have funding. I sat and did homework in the main office for my entire internship because there was no technical team locally that could offer and pay for an internship. Fortunately for me, I had a contract for 12 wks with a fixed salary and they were legally bound to pay. I got nothing of value from this experience."
good,If you work here don’t ever extend yourself financially. One hiccup in the contract and you are out on the street. You aviation licenses mean nothing to them.
good,"It's a great job if you want to get up on your feet as a first time Full-time position. But long term wise, this is the worse place ever to just be an entry level operator. If you end up liking this kind of work, get your degree immediately and go up the pipeline. But you're going to have to constantly watch your back and TRUST NO ONE. KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN!"
good,"Lockheed was an excellent employer, it was management that was not up to par, many relatives and friends working there in the same department with positions of authority.  Definitely about who you knew and how well you played the game."
good,Not able to disclose the nature of the job due to security reasons. No difficulty with the job because of my background and the qualifications of my experience.
good,Management to busy in meetings patting themselves.  The have no clue what people really do.  Assign leads that are buddies but do no work.  Managers not leaders
good,Good old boys network. People are provided opportunity based on who they know not what they know. Blackballing employees from positions occur on a regular basis.
good,"I was harassed by a certain individual and when I went through the proper channels with management, nothing was done to rectify the situation and I ended up leaving when my contract was up.  I was extremely disappointed in the NON-handling of the situation."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a typical corporation and is thus concerned mostly with next quarter's shareholder returns.  Employees are generally treated as replaceable and expendable and no real effort is made to make them feel wanted or needed."
good,Transitioning from the military to Lockheed Martin can be challenging. Benefits are good but expensive. Workers are stressed and management is over worked but if you take care of yourself you will be fine. Very competitive.
good,"Management changes every few months, no clear vision, zero guidance and career development; I would not recommend working here.  Job description and duties change without any awareness."
good,"High paced environment. Represented hourly workforce. Meet your dates, make your budget, keep quality high. Growing and evolving company culture."
good,The Job is hard as expected.  Great teams that work very hard to complete the task.  No planning fire fighting.  This is my view of the situation.
good,"This is a smaller facility and every person will perform one or two tasks that may be related to a different area. "
good,corporate conjunctivitis. lazy union people getting paid way too much to do too little and complaining the entire time
good,Interesting experience working with the military.  I worked closely with internal and external customers to provide software updates to the Air Force.
good,"I was with Lockheed Martin division that handled federal contacts for 20 years.  Five of those years were with Martin Marietta before the merger with Lockheed.  The five years with Martin Marietta were awesome.  Great pay, benefits, management, and co-workers.  You new the company cared about their employees.  After the merger with Lockheed, it was like entering the twilight zone.  Overworked, underpaid, a disconnection between management and employees.  Frequent layoff of employees."
good,"On a typical day at work I work with a diverse number and type of people. It may range from as many as 30 to as few as two. I deal primarily with the security of the systems that I am responsible for and the people that use them. I check clearance information process access and verify need-to-know for the people that are being on boarded to my systems. I work to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the classified information that is my responsibility."
good,"Management has no ""vision"".  Everything operates on a day to day deliveries with very few comprehensive plans for future growth."
good,On paper one of the most compliant and bestest places in the whole wide world to work. In reality - wear body armor to defend from the back stabbing and get everything in writing. This is the place that invented barely legal operations and covering everything up by discrediting any and all complaints. Where the millions made by the worker bees go to line the nests of the corporate execs who dontr give a rip about anything but the bottom line.
good,Contractor to USAF. Fixed cost contract no raises or adjustment in 3 years.
good,I would show to work and go the cafe to eat breakfast or lunch on time. The managers were nice aswell as the people.
good,Very top heavy as far as management goes. Payscale is not what it could be if it wasn't so top heavy. Management seems to make good but the blue collar worker isn't compensated with the industry average.
good,"the work environment is a little standoffish, there are a few long time employees that get to do whatever they want because they are related to one of the managers or engineers and if you call anyone out on it you are they one sent to HR for disrupting the work place. these same people get to make rules for the  floor like no whistling, you cant chew gum or talk to loud or laugh without upsetting one of the old employees. and you are the one who will receive corrective actions for harassing another employee for laughing. it is one of the most ridiculous places i have worked for."
good,"I worked with them for 16 years, the last 4 saw the poorest choices of leadership who's dedication to poor decisions led to the Company's decision to outsource the entire department."
good,"There's no need to go into much detail about this. The title speaks for itself. Just know that many programs at LM Space are run by micromanagers and you'll end up working many nights and weekends. Also, overtime pay was eliminated in 2018."
good,"Lockheed Martin carries a very strong reputation. I was shocked when I came on board with this company to learn of  their minimal vacation/sick time allowance. The holidays are paid for and are used as floating holidays. However, you are not allowed to use the alotted hours for holiday anywhere else unless you choose to work 4 - 10hr shifts. Management and HR are extremely unreliable. The management I have experienced is flawed, typically talking in circles or giving direction, only to reprimand you for following that direction stating that it must have been misunderstood by the employee. The salary is not competitive and is below average compared to other companies. In my personal opinion, this is not a company I would work for in the future."
good,"Allowed flexibility to work on multiple areas of critical importance including program management, proposal writing, computer software design, marketing strategy development, operational procedure design and assessment, training, and program design and implementation."
good,"As an employee, Lockheed was a great place to work, but since I was contracted out to a Federal facility, we were treated like trash and management did nothing.  Also, since we were federal contractors, an increase was based on Fed, which never came."
good,"Was really excited to start working here, but they've worn me down so much. Although it's not ""required"", you'll definitely be blacklisted if you choose not to work every weekend."
good,"When I first started the job it's was awesome. Fun company, they had luncheon employee activities. They quickly changed a lot over time. Now I just look forward to payday that barely pays bills. Hard to move up. They're benefits are awful, $3200 deductible don't cover anything!"
good,"Company is fairly informal at the local level and very easy to talk to anyone. The problem is they have the wrong business units owning the wrong positions.  The annual review is based on the senior managers committments which alot do not apply to most of the work accomplished by the employees where I work."
good,Nothing good happens quick. Management makes big decisions without understanding how it affects people then make no effort to fix them. The company is very reactive instead of proactive. Honestly i don't know how they got to be the biggest DOD contractor on the planet. Assed backward and management heavy is no way to continue into the future. And depending on what part of lockheed is how you will treated and compensated. They love to wave the go team go banner until its time to hand out the benefits.
good,Employees were subjective to performance reviews that were set up to fail the employee.This allow the manager to use their own unfair  discretions and opinions on how they personally felt about the employee when calculating job performance scores.  This kept employees from gaining deserved pay increases that they worked for and deserved.  Human Resource and Ethics were apart of this scandalous unethical practice against employee growth and increase as well and they would always fall in favor of managers.
good,"Executive leaders have little regard or appreciation for the employees in the trenches.  The CEO sent an email several years ago acknowledging failures with the performance management process as it related to minority employees and pledged to offer financial compensation to heal the wrong doing.   Nothing has happened, and I doubt anything will.  Just more deception and dishonesty from the leadership."
good,Felt mislead about this job. The [ay was good but they were selling out and didn't let everyone know the details of the deal until it was too late. I left a job of 8 years for this job but they sold out.
good,"Lockheed direct full time people didn't let me fit in."
good,"Was told by senior management after moving for a grossly misrepresented position that they sold me what they had to sell to get a qualified engineer. Organization lacks standard operating procedures and has zero ability to make repeatable process on important systems, constantly jumping through hoops last minute to appease a very unprofessional management team that lacks the experience and technical talent to be in the management role they are in."
good,Very difficult to get things done. Projects are grossly under estimated with highly aggressive timelines. Business conditions over years has created a culture that is extremely demanding and stressful leaving very little work life balance.
good,"Can not speak across the board but in Ms the above is true. I worked for 2 different divisions of LM in Ms., and dealt with the same issues with both divisions. Hiring and promotions had gotten to the point where if you were not related to, or were friends with leadership, you were not able to advance with the company. Total of 20 years with this company, 30 plus awards and recognition's, and a grand total of 1 promotion in all that time."
good,"Lockheed Martin Sunnyvale is a great company to work for new college graduates.  However, the company's culture does not promote training or promote professional growth.  There is a constant feeling the company is saving money.  New people feel as though they were offered a job and then they switched the job on them--bate and switch feeling for new employees.  "
good,"Some of the most advanced technology in the world under this roof, which is exciting.  But with government contracts comes endless constraints, which can slow productivity to an unexciting pace."
good,"LM closed almost all operations in WA, and turned everything over to an incompetent local company. My boss, who hf worked there for 40 year, was laid off also. They will not be missed."
good,"Be forewarned. If you have a family with young children that have medical issues, they do not care. They expect you to work even if hates freezes over. 4 days of sick time a year and 8 days of vacation. Good luck. Management is more worried about scheduling over quality. The usual. Layoffs happen often too and sometimes only a day warning."
good,"When assigned project with a government agency stalled, LM made very little effort to reassign me with other openings they had on other government contracts."
good,"Worst ever management teams in my dept, the last four didn't have a clue to the business needs and requirements.  Sad that they could get a better team in place"
good,worst ever in a large company.  change at times was very bad for the people working there.  Lots of oncall and phone calls.  Customer was hard to deal with.
good,It is a great place to work but you cannot expect any career progression here. Work day is challenging at times and gives me a sense of accomplishment. I enjoy figuring out issues for my customers and how to make things better.
good,"This was a very hard company to work for,short breaks with a small cafeteria that had to many people to feed,also we as contractors had to park in a satellite parking area and be bused to the job ,,working with their QA department was very difficult."
good,"I drive 70 miles, one way to get to work everyday."
good,work was great loved workng on jet engines. people were a different story nobody got along supervisors had favorites and if you were not one you were done.
good,If work in administration not a work/life balance organization. Looking for something that has a little more of you are part of the company feeling.  Right now most feel as if we aren't part of the one company one team.
good,"Contract with NIH. This rating is based only on NIH rating.  Lockheed Martin experience was good.  However, I could not give a good rating working with NIH as a contractor.  Practice was very unfair, emails all hours of the night asking why we are not responding to our after hours email."
good,Very diversified English and American culture and majority religions suffer.
good,"At my current job, My duties are to troubleshoot and try and resolve any issues that a user is having when it comes to the software side of things. There is a separate group that handles the hardware aspect. The current ticketing system we use is Remedy. The day to day problems I run into vary from the user's system crashing,Issues with the encryption software, Java related problems to issues with Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer or something not working with the company's software.I also do some light trouble shooting with the hardware or network related issues to determine what type problem the end user is having so I can eliminate that it's not a  software issue and that everything has been ruled out before i pass the ticket onto the proper group."
good,This company is a one contract company. Once the contract is over they release you and tell you that they will keep your resume and apply it to future contracts. I never heard from them when my contract ended. When  I went online and saw the jobs available and the contracts won by Lockheed Martin yet they never called me. POOR!!!
good,"I learned allot at this company, especially coming into the healthcare field. You will get exposed to both medical administration and some clinical/ case management work."
good,"There are numerous meetings to ensure team members are work towards same goal.  It is critical that you are have a firm understanding of FAR and DFAR requirements in order to make sound business decisions on contractual matters.  Chairing meetings and guiding proposal teams to achieve program objectives are a daily requirement.  Providing leadership and mentorship to peers helping strengthen team cohesion, professionalism, and contracting knowledge is also a daily task."
good,A very hard environment to supervise crews and get things done most days.  (Union)
good,"Many long-service employees"
good,Not the company it used to be.  Very much headed downhill. They are looking to lower rates to stay competitive. Product quality always suffers. They expect more from there workforce but continue to give less in a variety of manners.  I would not work there or advise anyone else to.
good,"Hardest part of job is using all of the vacation that you accrue, double edged sword. Most people wind up having to donate or lose vacation."
good,Worst supervision ever. Lazy co-workers. Engineers are absent minded.
good,"Busy"
good,Go to work and work on you tasks
good,Management failures and very poor communication with the workforce leaves me no other choice than to give a bad recommendation.
good,To many politics! Unfortunately they use hourly associates as pawns.
good,An average company with a lot of opportunities. Lockheed is the biggest defense contractor and they locations and job opportunities all over the United States.
good,Granted a Lockheed building. This building allows for a seperate work area and break area for all Lockheed employee's in the program.
good,"They'll entice you with a good starting salary and there are a couple of decent entry level incentives, most notably a grad school cohort program. Although they make a 2 year program into a 3 year one and require an additional year of service so really 4 years of your time for 2 years of schooling. Other than that I guess it depends on your program, but there are little opportunities for advancement and year to year salary increases are borderline non-existent. It's a good first and third job but not a place to spend your whole career (anymore)."
good,"The opportunity to make 6 figures is very possible because of the constant demand for overtime. The only drawback to this job is the management. The chief of security is nothing less than a dictator. He runs that place with an iron fist. The only problem is, he doesnt know what he is doing AT ALL! He just does what the company says with out questioning their logic. The shift captains are just his ""yes men"" and they couldn't lead a line to the bathroom."
good,I was working as contractor for fifteen months. Company policy with contract job that I  had to wait for three months before I could work again. Department manager told me I would have to wait for three months grace period before returning. Never received a call back for work
good,"Most of the team I worked with were fairly competent. The main issue were frequent changes in the direction of projects with little-to-no explanation as to why, only for those same changes to be reversed several times"
good,"The site itself is trying so hard to be better, but it just can't. It is stunted by being a big corporation. There is too much political games being played to advance. The only way to advance is to move to a new location. It's a good location for older people who aren't looking for anything other than stability. Not very good for advancing careers."
good,Very political driven company that moves extremely slow in getting important things done and achieving goals until higher ups take interest. Needs to keep focus on values.
good,"LM is difficult to work at as a contractor.  We are barred from so much information, it made it difficult to do our jobs at times. I appreciated the training opportunities, the salary and the opportunity to work from home.  I did not appreciate that my manager said nothing about my work, until they decided to terminate my contract and then said nothing at that point either. Very disappointing."
good,"Unwelcoming atmosphere, no room to grow, low pay. Definitely a contract job with zero benefits. Would not consider hiring full-time though praised for work high work ethic and outstanding work. Cannot get hired on permanently."
good,Benefits and salary were good.  Workplace culture was difficult to navigate.  Too many managers.  Company practiced age discrimination.  Too many senior people doing grunt work.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a prestigious organization to work for that can definitely help open doors to other companies. While the workflow is steady and growing, the management is absolutely terrible. Program managers lack leadership and compassion, but continually force ultimatums and unreasonable quotas on employees. There is no recognition for low-mid level employees and the business culture is extremely demanding and depressing. If Lockheed Martin would focus more on recruiting talented and motivational leadership and management, the company could really shine."
good,"I enjoyed the ability to teach soldiers as often as I able to, however when the contract was in-sourced while I was deployed I was bummed. The company  was great until I could no longer work for them when I returned from Afghanistan, despite being promised I'd be able tol"
good,"I was expected to work 55+ hours per week on salary with no over time. Missing those hours for family was discouraged. Most employees worked from 7-6. If you didn't meet quotas or put in extra work hours, you were given a stern talking to and made to fear your future with the company. Great pay. Not worth giving away your life for."
good,"Lockheed Martin left San Antonio June 2017. For their last 4 years, there were frequent lay offs and the organization ran pretty lean, meaning overworked people with no extra compensation. Days consisted of putting out fires such as addressing is the most crucial issue as directed or misdirected by management. The management was disconnected from their workforce. Typical mentality was us versus (management:production) and often between departments, very siloed environment with tribal culture."
good,If in DC there are lots of opportunities for team members to flex across.  If you are in the field and not many opportunities in your market then you can get cut pretty quickly.  I don't this is different from most places but something to consider when comparing against other companies with a strong presence in your location.
good,process Veterans pay and calculate their benefits. Process complex cases and send then for review by the 2nd tier team to verify payments are correct.
good,"The pay is nice, but they only pay so well because they know no one in their right mind would stay with the work conditions they put us in. Supervisors are required to work every other weekend even when we have very few mechanics coming in to work overtime. Upper management is constantly on us to fix things.. but how can you build a jet and stay on schedule when they constantly can’t get us our parts on time! Then you have your hourly employees that you’re in charge of.. if you ask them what they are working on, they will get upset and say you’re picking on them, or better yet just clock out and go home without any notice. The culture of this place is absolutely ridiculous! Never in my life have I seen anything like it. It’s truly sad because if you started implementing new ground rules and scaled back the union mafia out at Lockheed it really wouldn’t be a bad place. This place will never change as long as the union is still there."
good,"Very interesting group of individuals you get to work with, reminds me of my military days. Always a new day with new events to tackle and solve. great place to be"
good,"LM is a company with a strong legacy of quality world class aircraft.  With this legacy is also history that is more conservative and still behind the ball for a progressive culture of flexibility for teleworking and work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the work you do have real world impact and you see that in the aircraft that support our troops. The hardest part is the ability to grow in leadership and title despite growing in responsibilities. Combined with the evolving needs to do more for less the flexibility to work remotely without medical justification, unfortunately is not yet widely accepted within the corporation."
good,"Lockheed Martin is an amazing company with great people and really good opportunities. However, the excessive hours, low compensation and lack of progression burned me out and forced me to leave the company. The slow, lack of advancement hurt my career early on and delayed me to getting where I am today. I wish I had left sooner. My experience may have been specific to our business unit as I know other coworkers had different experiences depending on their location."
good,0 growth. giant bureaucracy. cordial environment. I don't see a future in this company unless you're fine with being stuck in a cubicle for life which is most likely the career transgressions for the average joe.
good,The men I worked with were always arguing and the manager was unprofessional. The projects were poorly planned and a lot of time was spent doing other tasks while waiting for parts and equipment.  I started on a day shift and then got moved to 3rd shift.
good,"Company went through Divestiture and Acquisitions in 2016 and lost 675 experienced employees because of the way they handled same."
good,"A good company to start out with, but your career will stagnate if you remain here. Software engineers do not work with current tools or design methodologies on most teams, and the SW engineering culture is not one that challenges the individual to excel."
good,"It was hard for an admin to advance and there really was nowhere to go, the days were long and lacked work. Management was not very helpful in providing administrative work on any given day."
good,"Always work to be done in a fast-paced environment, with support from old to new Technology and Equipment.  Wear multiple hats from PC Tech, Printer Tech, Sys Admin, Network troubleshooting, allows continuous improvement in multiple areas of technology"
good,"No positive comments. Management is uncaring, over critical, and expects more than miracles to complete work on time."
good,"If you aren't a scientist or engineer, you aren't made important. sometimes there is layoffs, but the union does try to keep everyone employed by job codes."
good,"Management allowed co-workers to treat each other disrespectfully, they allowed co-workers to control many aspects of the environment.  It became soon after I started one of the most caustic work places I had ever worked in my nearly now 40 years in the work force."
good,"I hated this job I worked so hard to get  it . Was making less money if you are a women. that was not right and everybody was doing some kind of drug, that made it difficult to do my job . The manager was never around,and when they were they what were joking around like they were your friends not your boss . Did have good lunch room.  "
good,"It's an ok place to work.  They do give pay raises every year but it is next to nothing.  Trying to advance within in the company is almost impossible as well,"
good,"Hired on as a junior software developer for a contract management system.  Tasks and day-to-day business were fine and as expected, but frequent clashes between management and customer led to our contract being pulled and given to sub-contractor instead and given sixty days to find a new position.  Shifted to a new role developing a file database system when a better opportunity came along as part of the job search outside of Lockheed."
good,"Nothing good or bad, just generic. You are often asked to do many tasks that are well outside of your spectrum of work, not much of a balance for home life and work life."
good,The company provides some interesting opportunities but there is a distinct lack of communication within the organisation and an unwillingness to invest in its employees.
good,"In the DoD contracting world, you are nothing more than a number to your manager.  The level of bureaucracy is on par with a government service job without the job security."
good,Great work/life balance. Most people have been there since straight out of high school.  A good company but little opportunity for advancement. Great CEO
good,"Very cliquish, union and company strive to divide the employees into groups and play them off against each other.  Programs designed to improve systems are only followed while the executive that started them is around."
good,"Expected to drink the ""koolade"" "
good,"You can probably get some experience here but the nepotism will keep you from really achieving anything great. Promotions are purely political. There are good people to work with, but also some not so good. Management is known for pushing unrealistic goals, employees are known for slacking and then stressing at the last minute because they are not going to meet goal. Pretty bad work/life balance. Sub-contractors get a really bad deal and are treated like a sub-species by Lockheed direct hires. Sometimes the money can be decent, other times you realize how its just not worth it."
good,"Work is challenging and stressful.  Rewarding if in the right workgroup.  Government contractor so, pressures of industry weigh upon the operation daily.  Good company."
good,"Can be a wonderful employer to work for under the right management team.  Had some good years & worked with wonderful colleagues.  However, due to unethical discriminatory behavior of local management teams, the Huntsville campus became a toxic, unethical place to work.  Most employees very unhappy...the ethical ones chose to leave.  The unethical discriminatory ones were promoted & rewarded.  Sad to see so many negative changes in a place I once called my work home.  Heard other company campuses still provide a positive, inclusive ethical work environment."
good,The best part of my job was to be in contact with people from all around the world and within the whole organization which permitted to improve my Customer Service.
good,"Working for Corporate office of Lockheed Martin is a good experience for office professionals.  It is a very conservative, and process driven environment.  The corporate headquarters has a cafeteria and wellness center.  It is a decent place to work."
good,"Day to day schedule architecture of security guidelines to encompass a thorough escorting quota.  Demands would change on a day to day basis, requiring flexibility and perseverance."
good,"Facility maintenance support for SOJTF-A in Kabul Afghanistan, maintaining HVAC-R, Electrical, Generation and various other required needs for maintenance. I set up sats,coms, I ran cat 5, fiber optics, installed and maintained SIPR,NIPR,CENTRX and GIANT, repaired routers, installed / setup sats for television maintained modulators and signal combiners for AFN and foreign television for the base."
good,"Lockheed, like all other huge companies only cares about the bottom line. If you are an excellent ""individual contributor"", move on."
good,"Although the work environment provided a very productive atmosphere, the contract business can be unpredictable.  The leadership at Lockheed Martin does not do a good job of keeping their employees informed of ongoing changes with contract clients."
good,"The current culture has become hostile where management does less and less to advance and develop their employees, nonexistent communication, and very frustrating management."
good,"The average work day was unpredictable, very stressful, and chaotic.  The upper management team always stayed in a reactive state, as opposed to being proactive and well planned.  The COO would actually verbally harass the floor technicians on a daily basis, so image how he treated his direct reports.  We seemed to be in a constant upheaval and everyone was expected to work long days and even weekends, with no end in sight."
good,No comment at this time.  Company Business Unit is being sold from Lockheed Martin and I have no idea what will become of anything I knew previously.
good,"Many of us believe that since this is the initial years on a new contract, Lockheed Martin has been under the ""minimalization"" mindset. No merit raises, promotions only when absolutely required (death, or employees departing), no incentives to producing great work. They only get by with following the minimal pay scale for hourly workers. They cut salaries of everyone when taking over the new contract 4.5 years ago. We've had over a 50% turnover rate in that time because of the negative atmosphere and conditions. One third of the hourly employees were told they were expendable when sequestration hit the government. Wow, what a great feeling that left in our guts! Most of us were in unique billets with DoE ""Q"" and nuclear worker clearances. Expendable??? Maybe the next contract will be better."
good,"Currently the Company in Marietta is in a downturn with limited work available. Management is based in Fort Worth with a great deal of work available. The hands on inspection personnel are the best people to work/communicate with. The hardest part of the job was to witness the downturn of work and the ""back seat"" feeling management invoked on people with great skills had."
good,"Employee for a little over five years. Left contracting side ISGS to join corporate IT, now learning RIFs are imminent. Really thought this would be a long-term engagement, but management is quick to cut costs by whatever means necessary, and that means staff."
good,"Standard services company culture, low pay for standard desktop role"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the weekends. Time away and learning to balance work and life has been an issue. In my current position, weekend overtime has been minimized so I have more opportunities to be at home."
good,LM is an OK place for an engineer if you do not want to be challenged or progress.  It was a good experience as a young engineer but inefficiencies prevent real progress and innovation.
good,"Great company to work for if you hold the highest level security clearness however, if you don't you're the first to go. Noting more to share at this time."
good,"long hours"
good,Lacked work diversity relied heavily on one customer source
good,I had just gotten out of the Navy and did not know any better. I do not think It is LMC's fault that this was such a badly run sector. It seems that the government was content hiring nothing but family members in the 40 year run of this contract in order to my security easy.
good,"	Serve as deputy manager by attending high level manager meetings, program and proposal status meetings, and reviewing and approving subcontract files prior to issuing awards;   "
good,"Good Company but always room for improvement. could be better managed. great group for people work there, and they always work with your personal life schedule to obtain a good balance"
good,"I work 3rd shift."
good,"flexible hours to work"
good,"very bad managment, poor managment, great benefits, not a fun place to work"
good,"OK contract company to work for..."
good,"Keep your resume updated and get as much as you can upfront, because you won't get a paid what the market pays."
good,The benefits and pay were very good. Lots of paid holidays. Overtime every night and every weekend. Management takes care of friends and promotes them. This is in the art department.
good,"Going to offices to fix computers and printers"
good,Work at times can be tedious.  Learned many facets of military documentation.
good,"The work at Lockheed is long and hard, but the feeling of satisfaction from doing a good job is great.  The pay was not very good, and the benefits were lousy at best, but the opportunities were there for growth, and movement."
good,"One of the biggest problems with working at Lockheed Martin is that every time your work on a program winds down, you have to hunt for another job within (or outside of) the company. That means that you have to prepare your resume, search open job reqs and interview for a position. If you don't follow that process you will get laid off, and it doesn't matter how good an employee you are or how loyal to the company you are. "
good,IT department had no SLA procedure in place and didn't have a proper helpdesk solution as it ran from an access database that a software analyst had configured.
good,"Very good job, enjoyed the pay check, Learned a lot, especially about mechanics,"
good,Worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a Document Control Manager in the Quality Control Unit.
good,LM is a major government however job security is always an issue once your contract is over. It's up to you to find your next position within Lockheed Martin or you will be laid off. You are not automatically placed on a new contract like most employers. Good Luck!
good,"Like our team and team members, but not work environment."
good,"Lockheed Martin pushes a work-life balance. Most employees enjoy 9x80 workweeks, meaning that we have every other Friday off. All employees have at least 3 weeks of vacation from the day you begin your career, and there is an employer matching to the 401K plan (LM matches up to 1/2 of the employer contribution, with a maximum LM contribution of 4%)."
good,"A typical day clearing out WRAMC consisted of a lot of free time. I am one comes to work to work. All prior jobs I held had deadlines to meet. Not this one. Management was a bit dizzy being this was the first time LM ever unloaded a hospital before. Medical items were brought down from floors than brought up again. Why? Because the fashion these items were brought down did not appease the one in charge that day. As for my coworkers. I'd say 75 percent were there to milk the clock. And complained the 2 breaks and hour lunch were too short. The hardest part of my job was seeing others not work or sleep during the working hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was being teamed up with the 25 percent that actually worked. The sadness part of my entire experience was I was let on by Lockhead Martin. At the end of my contract I was ""promised"" if I find ANY job to forward that job to the HR department so I'd be first in line for the position. I've been doing this for months and never an e-mail back from HR that I'm one of the possible candidates for the position. Trust me. These were no-brainer positions I've applied for."
good,"When work available, not bad. They will hire almost anyone."
good,"Demanding Schedule, high stress, not great for working mother with kids.  Struggle to keep up with work and also make time for family.  while LM provides a lot of PTO, I find it difficult to use it and keep up with work."
good,"2 months into my jobs i found out they were going to sell my department. They put a hiring freeze on positions of people who left and a transfer freeze for anyone in the department being sold. Also, would not let you sign up for tuition reimbursement, job rotation, and management mentor programs."
good,"Lying in bed at the hospital with my manager on the phone scolding me "
good,"good workplace for transitioning, unmarried veterans, especially with travel and per diem. Sometimes not stable, beware of contracts ending without notice."
good,Lockheed Martin decided to Surplus 52 positions in which my position was one of them and I was forced into retirement because they decided to Outsource all of those positions therefore I lost my job and all of my benefits
good,"As a disabled veteran, the manager doesn't care about the situation of my disability. I made some mistakes due to my medical condition, and they don't hesitate to give me two weeks to find another position inside the company when a normal process takes about two months. So, when I found some managers interested in my experience, one of those managers spoke with my manager and decided done an extensive interview with nine hiring managers at the same time. Most of the questions were for a managerial position, and I'm in the technical mid-level. I felt that I was set up to fail, and because I was unable to secure another job inside the company, they terminate my contract."
good,Laid off right before Christmas. Worked for them off and on over 25 years. Management lost contract. Did over half inspections while favorites did little and got rewarded.
good,"If you are looking to build your resume, Lockheed is impressive. The pay increases, at least in manufacturing, do not even meet the cost of living. If you don't negotiate an acceptable wage going in, you'll never get paid what you are worth."
good,I wish not to divulge any information about my previous employer.  They are a good company to work for.  There is not much room for advancement though.
good,"Always fighting fires on a daily basis.  I'm very busy and it's impossible to satisfy everyone.  I do work through one manager, but report to another manager."
good,Talent management are buzz words used without action taken.  The company does not treat employees fairly and does not manage out poor performers causing a select few good employees to do more work.
good,Mission driven company. Fast paced. Opportunity to work in a large company (100K plus employees). Frequent staffing changes can create some uncertainty for employees.
good,"Poor management.  Lack of engineering experience.  Hourly wages low to start.  More concern on feelings then work ethics."
good,"Management takes an us vs them mentality towards the employees.  Decisions often times are made in a knee-jerk, defensive fashion.  Could do a better job."
good,"If Lockheed Martin would fix the their middle and lower level of management, Lockheed would be a great company to work for. They also need to work on their HR department."
good,"There were a lot of reorganizations, the job overall was fine but the changes to the company structure were stressful.  There were opportunities to go to different parts of the company but not a lot for advancement once you got to a certain level."
good,"Nothing to say - had a bad experience working here, poor management, favoritism to certain employees.  The manager would use language in the call center that was inappropriate"
good,"A typical workday would be 9+ hours for a salary nurse. The type of work was very rewarding and overall, patient care was very good. The ACE program and ratings often takes a front seat to patient care unfortunately. Too many hours and time is dedicated to a program that does not apply to a health center setting, Most of this is busy work that is very time consuming. The management team was very unsupportive and has since changed since I have worked there. So I can not speak to that at this time. I learned a lot about occupational health nursing and enjoyed that part of the job very much. The hardest part of the day was the back stabbing and bullying that occurred among the staff, and lack of support from management. There are fewer but still some bad eggs in the department that now have seniority and probably wont be leaving for a long while. Lunch breaks are a joke, you get 30 minutes total time and it takes that long to get to the cafeteria, wait in line, and get back to your workstation. Coffee and other breaks don't exist for the nurses, only for a select few. Parking is very difficult since the early shifts get most of the spaces, so expect a long walk to get to the medical center."
good,"Lockheed purports to be an inclusive, non-discriminatory workplace, but the reality is that women engineers who aren't ""butch"" enough are not promoted, retained, or supported adequately. If you are pretty, feminine, give birth too many times, or  anything else that lets the guys think of you as an actual woman (rather than a man with a woman's name), then you are much more likely to be treated as if your engineering skills, knowledge, and experience are irrelevant. You won't be offered growth opportunities, and if the program budget gets tight, you are much more likely to be ""downsized"" than the younger, cheaper, less experienced men on your team."
good,"Going from a very fast paced environment to the Lockheed culture has been quite a culture shock.  Endless meetings over the same subject matter with no decisions being made or anyone stepping up to accept responsibility for addressing the issue being reviewed feels like we keep kicking the same can down the road. Culture Of Accountability process has a track record of success but seems to be in neutral here, need an engaged leader that truly sees the value in developing a full team culture that is focused on measurable goals that include not only business metrics but cultural ones as well.  It seems that the senior leadership is very engaged and positive in their interactions with the team(s) onsite, however this dissipates as you move down the leadership structure."
good,"I worked with a company named Guardsmark in which Lockheed Martin was the customer. In working on this contract under Lockheed Martin I found that I had to be alert as my duties required that we kept abreast of faculties, personnel, and security. The management was good and the hardest part of the job was last minute changes and rotating hours so that you could not make plans for anything."
good,"Lockheed was a great place to work for a few years to learn about the DOD contractor industry. "
good,job skills are out of date at the work place; constant layoff at the company; I been in more than 10 layoff in the past 8 years. Employees are not contractors
good,"I’m sure this is mainly where I work and not all of Lockheed, but management has issues and is quick to blame and not take responsibility. When I asked about a raise due to my work load/responsibilities doubling I was literally laughed out of the office. High amount of favoritism."
good,"Employees and Supervisors alike were all disgruntled with issues concerning their FAA Retirement and their working years. Everyone was supposedly an expert, but no one knew nothing. Employees lived everyday of their lives walking on eggshells not knowing if today was going to be their last day at work. Everyone had their noses in the air and in each other's business. Rumors, Gossips, and misinformation was the norm of everyday life.The senior people had this ""air of seniority""."
good,"A lot of hard work following integration of Sikorsky into Lockheed, as with most acquisitions! Once the companies fully merge, it will be a great combination."
good,Admin duties include doing reports on the equipment and security info or classified equipment
good,"Working in a part of the business providing contractor talent to the government, I operated outside the real Lockheed Martin organization. I was a Lockheed Martin employee contracted to work at the Federal Aviation Administration"
good,Very challenging place to work but not compensated well for the expected hours and dedication required to researching innovative concepts. Great work life balance.
good,the corporation is eager to reduce the work force who are approaching retirement and they are the same with contractors such as nurse case managers for the vendor Genex.
good,"I would not recommend working for LM due to the negative job culture and bad management. It is a huge matrix organization that is not well organized. Overall rating, 3."
good,Kept hiring programmers and never documented the the product until it was time to deliver. Then they started to lay off programmers they had just hired.
good,Lets see!!! Ill work there again with the right leadership. And if the company has a fiber optic class to advance my career. I love a job that does has long hours.
good,"Cool place to work. Could’ve been way better. Lack of communication and everything is buddy to buddy! If you’re friends with management or supervisors, you would likely not work or have much work to do"
good,Too many engineers in one product. Lockheed Martin is big company but they don't respect individual. I didn't have security clearance and Aerotek hired me instead Lockheed Martin.
good,"Management has gone downhill over the years but there are still many good people to work with. If you're just starting out you can easily put in a few years here and move on."
good,"This workplace is odd. As a first job out of college, I was optimistic about starting and getting experience. I was given no training and was left out to dry by my first line manager when it was time for reviews. People in this office are awkward and seem friendly at first, but tend to show their true colors with time."
good,They compensate well for contractors but do not for permanent employees. Can get a bit stressful but overall not a bad place to work. They have a large turn over in contractors.
good,"The employees and actual job environment were a non issue. The management on they other hand was a serious issue. Management never dealt with any issue as required, instead just ignored the problem; even retaliated against the person who brought it forward. In addition, they would refuse to advance anyone or give them a deserved raise."
good,"Pretty standard workplace. Boring, but decent benefits. Pay isn't great but the benefits can make up for it. Work culture is a bit cut throat and beware if you're fresh out of college, they will treat you like an idiot."
good,"Benefits have dropped, but even when they were decent you'll likely find employers with better benefits, culture, and compensation. If things improve it would be a decent place to work."
good,"Work environment was good before, but it was stressful in the later years. May be it was lack of new contracts. Managements was cutting Sr. people  with age 50 and up, and replacing with recent grads with half of the salary but no experience."
good,"I never had a real opportunity to work at a Lockheed Martin facility. I was always sent off to work from a customer site. I would have to fight tooth and nail to get a desk and any equipment. "
good,"LM is a good employer the contract company Allied Universal has issues at times, the supervisor at the Lockheed Martin site is not a good communicator and he dose not treat employees fairly across the board."
good,"A program that utilizes all personnel for their skillsets and allows them to work independently.  Travel can be extensive at times, but the growth, knowledge is worth the experience."
good,Lockheed Martin has the smartest and greatest people in the world who work for the world-class programs. You can't find a more compelling reason to come to work everyday.
good,"I currently perform duties of at least two people due to budget cuts.  My daily work load is not of the cookie-cutter variety.  My duties consist of supporting three different areas that have varied requirements.   Procedures and processes require utmost attention to detail.  "
good,"I was on SSA contract, this contract is the worst thing that ever happen to me in my 12 years of working experience. Employees are poorly paid. This has led to very high turnover rate."
good,Good place to work but not as fulfilling as expected. Workplace culture appears diverse but inclusion is an issue. The most enjoyable part of the position was the amount of talent located within.
good,"A typical day until RIF was to visit numerous customer sites and advise, audit and inspect energy solutions for the customer. This was very enjoyable as I felt that I was making a difference in reduction of electrical usage and carbon output.  This helps to facilitate the mandated energy efficiencies set forth by the government agencies. Workplace culture was diverse but could have been better and inclusion isn't always practiced. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upper management staff.  They lost site of customer service and satisfaction."
good,competitive environment with good management. no benefits offered. learned a lot with management being very supportive and teaching employees a lot. learned a lot about contracts negotiation and the hardest part of the job was not having the immediate boss in the same office as the long-distance phone calls made it difficult to learn and ask questions.
good,"LMSC is still operating under the momentum of the 60's and 70's when they were the primary contractor for military aircraft and space systems. Since then, although the technology has changed, the organization has not adapted to the times."
good,"The business entity I worked for within Lockheed Martin has been sold.  The last 8 years or so were very challenging for Defense contractors in general as government funding became more limited.  Those companies like Lockheed with highly skilled and compensated employees, many of whom were baby boomers, had to develop strategies to remain competitive in the market.  Unfortunately, many key managers left the company leaving a tremendous void in some of our key markets.  Simultaneously benefits were reduced and salaries became stagnant.  As a result, the company culture and employee morale was negatively impacted."
good,I like my job but I don't see any way to advance. The work is interesting and the company is growing but if you are looking for a place to grow it is almost impossible. Recently there has been a big shake up in management and things are changing for the better
good,"Too much CYA approach by ""lifers"" that just want a place to retire. Poor assimilation of experienced new hires. Experiences are dismissed unless garnered AT Lockheed. Years of service is the badge of honor...quasi-military like in rank."
good,"Lockheed Martin in Marietta, GA is an ok place to work at. Expect to stay in one work location unless you have a degree. The company favors people with degrees and move those kinds of people where they want and advance the people with degrees."
good,Would never work for this company again. I experienced unequal pay as opposed to my counterparts and did more work.  My manager failed to ensure there was communication with the contract site and unfortunately affected those on the contract negatively.
good,"Daily work life can be difficult due to company push for working lean, to the point if is impacting daily tasks. Company strikes a pretty good work/life balance. Co-workers are enjoyable to work with and have made friends over the years."
good,Solid financials and direction. Some processes render nimbleness in the marketplace a challenge.  Overall an acceptable experience.  Many divisions to which one can migrate within the company.
good,"LM working to rebrand"
good,"I thought I finally found my way honestly, then I found out they had plans the whole time to outsource our jobs, I felt deceived."
good,"Enjoy the 9/80's, however can be tough with small children.  The need to be with your team is essential to working collaboratively."
good,"Lockheed Martin is rich in opportunities, jobs, people, resources, and benefits.  They get their money through contracts and the government.  However, these opportunities and people are not easy to come by.  Some people are ignorant, out of touch, and lack management skills.  They cater to a lot of subcontractors."
good,Pay and job advancement was great but poor work/life balance and very poor management.  I gained a ton of experience there but not through the training department which is also lacking.  The best thing at LM was the paycheck
good,"Business unit couldn't compete needs to revamp the entire business unit. Not there for the employees, only for contract numbers."
good,Building helicopters for the special forces was very cool.  These aircraft are used all around the world on classified missions.  Knowing your building something that changes the way our troops fight is awesome.
good,Not too much to say about working here. Mnagament is out of control. Cutting the workforce. anti-union environment and retaliation.
good,"I am thankful for the work I was given while working for Lockheed. The tasks assigned were intellectually challenging, and the location was Kennedy Space Center (Need I say more?)"
good,"Lockheed Martin IS&GS has more of a technician/integrator culture, so if you are an engineer, you might not like the lack of education and technical expertise present in the company. You'd have to go to Space Systems or Aeronautics for that.  Most management was what I would call typical. Managers are often considered to be higher rated than their employees would say, because there is no 360 review process. Managers are rewarded for keeping the budget on track, which means lower than industry standard wages, strictly controlled overtime pay, ""strongly suggested"" vacation time when the contract is rebid, and potentially layoffs. Other than that, managers will very rarely even interact with their employees and are there to serve the customer. The employee culture was professional but very cutthroat because of this."
good,"-	Use SAP to input data to track cost of tooling, order tooling, and the life expectancy of the tooling"
good,"For every month in the past 2 years, we hear this rumor about we will lose our jobs every day.  "
good,"Field walk in issues"
good,"Great place to develop skills, gain experience.  Excellent training programs, but in recent years harder to access due to budget constraints.  Advancement is not easy, and tends to depend on what programs/locations you happen to be associated with.  Good ""brand"", and a leader in technology and best practices.  Skills will be transferable to other companies/work.  Challenging work/life balance at times, with limited recognition beyond satisfaction of having done a good job."
good,"Large company offering many diverse roles. Work 9/80 shifts, but some overtime required depending on program. Offer assistance for education."
good,LM allowed me to join the CNDSP team.  Enjoying the job and learning a lot.  Very grateful to Lockheed for allowing me to laterally move to the Cyber team.
good,Company had a good culture.The hours were good and management was flexible.
good,"In our department there was no place to advance to.  If you became a Captain it would be for less pay, poor hours and a lot of headaches.  Like many companies in ""Will Work"" states, Lockheed is a bit schizophrenic. In that one half of the company is doing all these wonderful things for the employees...and the other half sees you as having no worth at all.  As one attorney told me about Lockheed, that here in Texas, they can be brutal, ruthless and completely without compassion."
good,"Worked mainly as a corrision mitigation specialest. Union controlled work place, hard to advance."
good,Management is not very informed and does not engage with the workers on contracts.
good,Did not last long enough budget cuts. Great Company to work for.
good,"Duties include ensuring workplaces are OSHA compliant and the required permits and waste handling procedures are implemented. A typical day involves following up with corrective actions for non-compliant findings and providing subject matter expertise for HSE policies, plans, and objectives.  To achieve compliance, interpretation and application of federal, state, and local environmental regulations are done on a day to day basis.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the independent and open work environment.  Individuals are responsible for completing their own work to achieve quarterly goals and given full flexibility to schedule site visits and audits. The position does require extensive travel which can be challenging at times."
good,"great sight seeing by the beach, management only out for them selfs."
good,Assemble wire harness per specs with highest quality possible.
good,"Typical day consisted working in a computer lab creating and debugging code. I learned how to collaborate with other skill areas as well as communicate effectively in hostile environments."
good,"•	Perform integrated logistics duties and responsibilities including order processing, transportation, warehousing and management "
good,This is an okay place to work but can be boring at times. People are stressed and sometimes overworked.
good,"Enjoyed working at Sikorsky for over 22 years. Compensation is decent and benefits are great, especially for education. Only regret is that the company will hang you out to dry if it suits them."
good,Contract employees are not LMCO employees and do not get benefits. There are only rare opportunities to move to management. The policies for attendance and leave are not employee friendly. The environment is diverse but you sit all day and only get a 30 min lunch that counts against you. The best part of the job is that you gain much needed experience.
good,"This industry in general is slowing down. Lean staffing means that fewer people have to do more without much benefit."
good,Diverse learning environment and the ability to work in different HR areas.
good,"First Purchasing experience since earing the BS degree. Performed a lot of medial purchasing functions such as RFQ's, Providing suppliers with schematics & drawings, following up on supplier responses, etc."
good,"Lockheed Martin is the leading global security and aerospace company, solving our customers’ most difficult problems through our employees’ innovation, performance and unmatched integrity."
good,"I was a temp, about to get hired but my company got bought out by Lockheed Martin. Was a great group of people, stress free job, I loved the environment and work load it was great unfortunately, when the company got bought out, we ended up in a whirlwind of firing from upper management."
good,I would start off by saying that my review of this particular branch of Lockheed has nothing to do with the parent company. Turn over rates during my tenure were bad. Compensation was terrible.
good,"Lockheed Martin is the ""place to be"" for engineers and techies alike. However, it is not the most suitable for the other functions, such as communications, HR, accounting, etc."
good,"Editing product proposals and scripts for punctuation, grammar, and formatting."
good,"You learn as much as you can. However given the fact that most of the contracts are from the government, there are always uncertainties every year."
good,Check with manager for any outstanding tasks
good,"My business unit has been dissolved and my position has been eliminated, effective January 8, 2013. Repeated reorganizations are typical."
good,"People are hard working, company is currently reorganizing strategically."
good,Typical work day can be long depending on job that you are working. Just came off Rotating 12 hour swing shift job in Virginia.
good,Smooth morning as always. Just do your job and its cool. Working on a military base is very less stressfull. And a hole lot friendlier. Management dont sweet you as long as you do your job. Making sure you dont make any mistakes. Off holidays very friendly work place
good,Since I have been there I done alot of maintance on aircraft. I have gain alot of experiance.
good,Great benefits and working hours with every other friday off. Union shop rewards mediocrity and will hold back those hard workers with strong advancement drive. Very little vertical movement.
good,Enjoyed the type of work they perform. Working cutting edge technology on defense systems was fun.
good,Lockheed as a whole was a great company to work for. The training was great and the experience was ok.
good,Management does not give any indication that the employees are worthy of any respect. There is very little employee information that is kept confidential. Employees have no where to turn for compliants without retribution. The employee hotline is a joke.
good,"I enjoyed having every other Friday off, but I was under contract for a year. I was never offered a full time job. They did this to all the contractors there. Within that one year, I never miss a day of work or overtime that was provided. My quality of work was good. But after all of that, I was just a number. That is why I left I want a full time job with a company that will appreciate what you can provide for it to become more successful. This company is out for themselves, not to benefit the employee who is there to work hard everyday and become full time employee with benefits, vacation days, and Holidays off with pay. It was pretty much a wasted year!"
good,The company is centered solely on the military customer. There is no management of contractors beyond time sheets. No performance reviews or goal setting. There is also no way to challenge or dispute any decision made by a military supervisor.
good,A typical work day was extremely busy. I learned a lot in the total of ten years working there. Management was poor and needs improvement but the other employee's and customer's made it worthwhile. The hardest part of the job was going to management with questions or concerns and the most enjoyable part of the job was being part of an excellent team.
good,Great company with a lot of programs to choose from. Never a boring day and lots of great people to work with. The training and benefits could be better.
good,Productive job. this is a security cleared job site and I am not in the position to talk about operations at this particular job site. The culture is okay.
good,"Same as above + hard to lose or terminate employees, so if u work with a slacker, most likely you'll be stuck working with a slacker. 401k, depending where you work there's a chance to move to other departments."
good,"The position was part of a team that was half contractors and half customer-employed DBAs.  Due to my experience, the most common type of work I performed on a regular basis was writing ad hoc report queries to generate reports for customer request or data for other analysis.  Other common tasks included regular Oracle patch and security upgrade application, grid control configuration management, tablespace and storage monitoring, and providing on-call, after hours support."
good,"Depending on the contract you work on, it could be a great stepping stone into DoD work.  Some contracts are bigger than others and some managers more helpful at career pathing than others."
good,RMS is not a great organization and they cannot compete with other companies for top talent. They expect people to work nights and weekends and don't do a great job of recognizing top performers
good,"workplace tended towards never taking accountability for mistakes, worrying more about assigning blame than utilizing lessons learned from previous projects"
good,"There was not information about the Corporation being passed down from local management. Project Managers had pet employees, so if you were not on the project managers side you had now chance to get goo reviews and advancement.."
good,"Not good at providing the client or employee correct council"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a large company who is granted Government contracts ofr next generation equipment. I have seen a WASTE in government resources and an abuse of managing skills at this company. If you want to be just a ""number"" this is the place for you. If you want to be valued and trained for progression opposed to being ""in the club"" with supervisors who has their favorites... then find a better fit."
good,I'm sure if you can get in on a permanent basis it could be a good place to work. The did not allow a chance to fix credit rating so a person can be released due to credit score.
good,"You scan Bench Stock Locations for parts and make sure they dont go empty. 40 hours a week with no ot in sight, which can be either good or bad. For the most part the people i work with are pretty good people. the job can be stressful though. you try to give them new ideas and they dont pay it no nevermind and they arent pretty supportive either. they want you to just come to work, do the work, and go home. id rather tell somebody to work in the dallas/fort worth area than work for the okc group."
good,Not a good place to work for persons older than 30. LM went to a high deductable health care plan so as long as you don't go to the doctor you don't need to worry.
good,"The biggest reason why I chose to leave Lockheed Martin was simple: the career trajectory moves slower than mud froze over. Maybe it's just the location where I worked, but opportunities to rise are nonexistent and other opportunities for promotion or recognition (tied to merit or compensation) are also extremely minimal. Benefits were continuously decreasing in quality and increasing in cost, and they got even worse shortly after I left. It's a great company to ""build your resume"" early but not one that will ultimately yield a rewarding career path of learning, development, and compensation. Also, their salaries are just not competitive with the market anymore, and the year that I left the average raise (merit and standard were combined at the time) was 1.8%. "
good,"Great company, but needs a culture upgrade. Not enough work to go around at times. People requested to act busy when light on work. Not supportive of new innovative ideas."
good,"The schedule is fairly consistent unless you are on a traveling team. Leadership at my location did play favorites. "
good,"They hired a world-class team from all over the country to work on a single, turn-key project. Over a period of 4 years, the business development team's strategy failed to secure a single additional contract causing the team to be disbanded."
good,Lots of room to grow if you want to and move around. Its a good place to work if your a vet. It has a lot of upper management. Lots of different divisions and groups. Tons of jobs.
good,I went to work and did my job on a daily basis and I loved talking to my coworkers and the technicians who performed their work well the hrs were great and also the location
good,The company used to be a great place to work for but they expect more and more out of their employees with no benefits for working them to death. The new company director is running the company into the ground.
good,"LM provided a very structured work environment. For example, a person could move from project to project and expect that the policies and procedures were very similar. This allowed the engineers to focus on the product without having a large learning curve on each program."
good,"I think the benefits and employee resources are great, but opportunities for advancement weren't as available at some of the lower levels of the corporation. Not sure of the reasons why? There was also an unwillingness to address potentially hostile clients and work environments. This might have been a function of loyalty to the client, as some of the company's managers served the organization during their military careers."
good,Management deliberately pits union against salary to defend their means even though they deliberately don't follow the union agreement and then claim ignorance and get covered by corporate every time.  It is pitiful and shameful.  outside of inventory personnel are vastly more happy and are significantly better to work with.
good,LM is a great place to work as long as you get in the right group with the right manager. If not some managers will hold you back from advancing your career.
good,LM has many advantages given its size interms of various programs and opportunities. However the trade-off is a very strong corporate atmosphere that at times is counter-productive due to the time it takes to gets approvals and because it tends to inhibut innovation.
good,"9/40 schedule, flex-time, and vacation benefits were the best things about working there."
good,"TARS day can vary day to day or be very repetitive - it will be what you make it. Hard shift schedules, rotating 7 on 7 off 12 hour shift. Union on site, contract renewal normally every 7 years"
good,"Lockheed Martin is struggling to meet the change necessary to make it a great place to work. Leadership has allowed turnover to undermine the company's strength; focusing on one particular group of new recruits. As a whole, LM is a good place to work, it just needs to shake off the emperors, and, remember how to be an employer able to use all of its human capital assets. It is totally different in other places!!!"
good,The company has been going downhill since the migration to Denver started a few years ago. It is difficult to get young employees to stay more than a couple of years. Many of the benefits are gone and the ones remaining are not very good.
good,"Provide every other Friday off with a 9/80 work schedule."
good,Lockheed Martin is very technology driven My work schedule was 5:00 am to 3:00 pm  there were required courses you had to take in your free time . this made it feel like there was no personal time. Zero work life balance.
good,"When it comes to Lockheed Martin, it's not what you know but who you know. I know it's Cliché but it's the truth. Career advancement is super slow, and if you are a technician, then you ceiling is very low"
good,It's a place to work. The current culture is ok.  The management could be better. The employees are great.  The benefits are better than most.  The pay is ok.
good,Every day I am constantly juggling priorities with the fast-paced business. There's a quick turn-around for getting proposals submitted and contracts entered into the system. I have learned a lot about FAR/DFAR's and negotiating terms and conditions. The hardest part of the job is having to wait for someone to approve my work so I can submit it to the customer. I really enjoy working with customers and giving them quality products in a timely manner.
good,Big company so a lot depended on what group you were in. It was very hierarchichal and things move slow. It also loses good people when the economy goes down and they cut across the board.
good,"Good company - doesn't value employees. Ask employees before applying to work there. The system requires that I add more, but there isn't more to say."
good,Products are outstanding and world-renowned. Salaries are high. Day-to-day work environment is extremely poor; full of loose cannons that do NOT reflect company's stated cultural imperatives -- and senior mgmt/HR/Ethics do little if anything to rein them in. Career ladders are non-existent.
good,"I enjoyed working on this contract conducting vulnerability assessments around the United States. The group of people I worked with were not very motivated in their jobs, I felt the section I worked in would be cut due to lack of productivity."
good,"As a contractor, I wasn't always included in the culture or working aspects of the job. I was assigned to late night and overnight hours so frequently had issues due to lack of support personnel."
good,"Lockheed is a decent place to work.  They take care of their upper management and look to benefit their employees as much as they can.  I worked as a sub-contractor and therefore my opinion will be skewed, because all of my true ""bosses"" were through the contracting company and not Lockheed.  However, the Lockheed employees I interacted with were fair and were decent men and women, indicating that as an employer, Lockheed did look for fair and decent people."
good,i was working with a security company by the name of Universal Allied and the company has a large turn over rate. When i first started with the company i was very motivated and the communication was very professional and present. As time and changes of management the turn over rate increased. The company does not recognize those with clearances because the company does not pay any difference for those with or without a clearance. However the job duties and responsibilities have increased for those with a clearance.
good,"Work for LMC for over 10 years and had very little mobility.  I also observed a lot of favoritism over the years, much of it not merited.  Great place to work if you want a relatively low stress job without much mobility.  Also, the pay does not remain competitive over time and benefits have substantially decreased over the decade I have worked for the company."
good,"This job may be of interest to most veterans who either retire from service and have a DoD clearance.  If you are the average 9-5 employee seeking employment with hopes of over 5 years job retention, then this company is not for you.  "
good,Lockheed Martin is a good company with some good benefits.  They treated their employees well.  The company attempts to offer ways to move up but it is not easy.
good,The place has it ups and downs and if they want you gone they will fined a way get out of there. The management do not back their personal. They talk about team and family but what they do to personal a team and family would not do that.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a huge engineering company - that is mainly focused on its upper management.  Too many managers.  "
good,Great job with a ton of autonomy one's daily routine.  Learning curve is steep but once you know the software it is very manageable.  Team work is strong.
good,A typical day was busy all day everyday. I learned a lot.  And found out a lot.  You don't have to be a good Manager to be a Manager at LM. The LM culture archaic. Hardest part of the job was the 9/80 schedule. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the various departments.
good,Good company to work for. Opportunities to move to different divisions.  Interesting products and services. Decent opportunities for advancement.  Been there 15 years.
good,Traditional Company stuck in the pre-modern corporate culture.  Needs to make tremendous strides in diversity and employee development.  Offers very few opportunities for growth and developement.
good,"The pay at Lockheed is rewarding, but you can find yourself stressing to balance your work and life relationship. Management can be tunnel visioned to meet production numbers at your cost, you are just a pair of assembly hands to them. Very hard to move up, even with the college assistance offered. They don't hire from within often enough."
good,"I love Lockheed, I've been a dedicated employee for 17 years. I enjo they my co-workers and my management has never been an issue. We have been through a lot of downsizing at our location which causes constant change. I work in a very small division of LM but people I know that work in other areas enjoy their jobs."
good,Lack of employee gratification.  Low salary and benefits.  Stressful environment. Lack of tools and equipment. Managers not willing to help you obtain proper certifications.
good,"over all great place to work "
good,Very stressful environment filled with people who did not care about the job and people who were unwilling to change 20+ years of old/bad/outdated practices.
good,"I was originally with a different company when LM bought us. Then I applied for LM Aeronautics Company, and got a position at a feeder site. No one is held accountable and leadership needs more experience in being transparent. Also, the lack of knowledge to change with the industry and job roles is frustrating."
good,I enjoyed Lockheed Martin...it paid well but project manager was hands off until someone complained. He didn't want to know what exactly went on and didn't care if the employees were taken care of. if you stayed out of trouble you hardly saw him or heard from the main company personnel.
good,Management team not inductive to productive life.  Always worrying about if job will be there.  Mediocre benefits and pay not above the mean income for the area.
good,"New ideas not needed here.  Some groups are forward thinking, many are stuck in old school fear/intimidation mode of management.  "
good,started out as a great program but seams to have turned in the not so distant past. A lot of politics that take away from the potential of having a great work environment.
good,"This job was a great job, enjoyed it . Working at Ft. Knox is different, new kind of people. All my co-workers were very informative, personnable, made you feel welcome."
good,"My last interaction with anyone at Lockheed Martin specifically was 8 years ago. However, at that time the culture was supportive of creative design and growth opportunities. Moreso than United Launch Alliance, which is where I transferred over to after the merger/acquisition of Lockheed Martin and Boeing was complete."
good,What I did here is build the thrust reversal for small engine aircrafts. We had to log onto time each piece we worked on. We had to stay on track or we would be holding up airplanes being built and that's a nono.
good,The most exciting part of the job was the day-to-day challenges in managing a new systems development process. There was always something new to learn and the opportunity to contribute to producing an innovative product.
good,"good place to start a young career"
good,"Overall working for Lockheed was great; it was the company I was contracted to that suck. My job title is Order Room Clerk. I believe the title was given for this job, so  that I could be paid less. I actually do the job of a Buyer or GS-7."
good,It was a new project.  The project managers had to learn the government requirements so that they could delegate work assignments to all of the employees.  The work was being created as we worked on various assignments. I personally worked with a Professional Engineer and we worked well together.
good,LM is a very large organization that operates much like the federal government.  If you have worked for the federal government you understand the idiosyncrasies that come with large organizations.
good,Enjoyed seeing the different planes come in that we retrofitted.  My process was integral in the success and I exceeded in the quality control of my heat treating of parts.
good,"Hi-Tech Aircraft Company that cared about there product"
good,"Helped maintain the A330 Flight Simulator For Hawaiian Airlines. Small group of folks that were a joy to work with. hardest part of job was dealing with issues that were not in any of the books, or were  limited in the description of the material. Best part of job was getting work at this location and with the people."
good,This company sucks.  They only care about their bottom line and throw their employees to the curb. I would not work for them!
good,"Everyday was pretty much seeing what work load would change from pulling 200 to 1200 tickets ,stocking parts into proper locations and any other issues from cycle counts,bin verifications,etc.Learned SAP inventory system and CRIB-MASTER part of the warehouse inventory system.Worked great with other co-workers.The hardest part of the job was trying to get everybody to work as a team and accomplish goals to get everything to run smoother.Get to broaden my work ethics and Camaraderie with fellow employees."
good,"My experience with Lockheed Martin, was a good one. The only drawback was the long hours and shared accommodations. I did have a bad manager to start with but he was replaced by a much better manager a few months in to my emplyment"
good,"A company with good job security and opportunity for advancement, but a no-frills environment and a culture that doesn't emphasize value on employees."
good,Overworked with a reduced staff with increasing work and stress. Out of touch management. Asking too much from too few workers.
good,"Lockheed Martin has a very high level of integrity in its actions.  However, they do not treat their employees fairly.  Money raised by one branch of the company went to support other branches of the company and no cost of living raises or pay raises came back into the branch making the money and doing the good work."
good,Some mis-management but i have seen that at all large companys. Good co-workers. It is very political. On a positve note Management and the company works with there employs schedules and realizes people have life outside work.
good,"Data entry, quoting, purchasing, dealing with engineers on site at Lockheed Martin. The company was good as a whole but the management were awful."
good,"just do your assigned job and all is well. be honest. If you produce a mistake report asap."
good,Process SF86 for five year update. Also reported to customer such as travel and reportables. Did pre-screen employent checks on new hires. Used JPAS and CI-Net tools at work.
good,"The business unit hierarchy and management structure can be a little confusing. I work as part of a business unit and I am then assigned to provide support to another business unit. I love my job, and the customer I am assigned to support is really great. The customer is considerate and has a understanding of the effort and hard work you put into the job. (I wish I could work directly for them.)"
good,"No real hands on training of the system, even during the two weeks training, to help you adjust to the actual job that you will be performing. You will do side -by-sides for the most part which benefits you more so than the actual training until you actually hit the floor. The majority of your answers to the questions that you would get asked are scripted, which you must copy and paste from the FAQ's you have to read from."
good,It's a great place to start your career some of the people are great to work with.  Everyone works very hard Monday - Friday.
good,"Outdated software development methodologies can leave one pigeonholed if they are not careful.  Luckily job security is high, and work-life balance is quite flexible, even if hours can be high."
good,Managers used profanity very often which made for a hostile atmosphere. I will never work for this company again. Pay was also mediocre.
good,"Ir was a good job that I was already highly qualified to perform, as I did the exact same job in the military. I was a mid level manager and was responsible for training all employees as well as operations and maintenance of the entire facility."
good,"The management is always changing and so is the company.  They pay us fairly well for the ease of work that we do.  The benefits are ok, and the communication stinks"
good,"Revolving door for upper management. Constant changes with each new manager. To reduce costs, management tends to reduce staff rather than streamline practices."
good,I have learned that some of the littlest things that might seem unimportant in the end make a bigger difference than you think. While working at Lockheed I've been able to really appreciate the very small jobs that people do around us because they are the ones who are responsible for how things are maintained and keep the flow of life going.
good,"Service Desk Analyst logging calls into ServiceNow correctly, updating AD account, resetting password, account creations, helping users on telephone. Working in a team providing excellent support, Project/Visio installs, purchasing of consumables, printer queries, creating PO's for adding to stock items."
good,"Lockheed Martin Government Alexandria Virginia"
good,"I did like working at Lockheed good money and benefits and overtime, but no chance of advancement in the long run unless you have a 4yr degree and it was a lot of physical hard labor intensive work everyday in very harsh hazardous conditions."
good,"I can't speak for the whole company, only my section. A total lack of leadership and generally not managed correctly. Lots of travel in less than ideal working and living conditions."
good,"As a young college grad, I want to work on projects that challenge me and force me to learn. At Lockheed Martin, the benefits of working hard and going above and beyond were insignificant. The work did not require me to bring my best and after each day I often left frustrated with how slowly everything moved. More often than not a small easy fix would take the entire week to get through paperwork and process, using my skill inefficiently. Also there was a significant age gap between me and the other employees at the Lockheed Martin facility I was employed at."
good,"I researched and paid invoices every day"
good,"I provided back up paralegal support to the attorneys, accountants and paralegals at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The routine varied but was required extensive knowledge of MS Excel. Although I worked for several teams, I was not part of any specific team."
good,"A typical day at works depends on what you do. There are a lot of different roles at the company. The corporate culture here is quite cut-throat, so be mindful of how you portray yourself to others. The co-workers create cliques and can range from life-long friends to mortal enemies. "
good,Good overall company. Major area of improvement: work\life balance. Compensation is very competitive.
good,Pulled into Test due to old position being terminated to to loss of contract. Manager and benefits were great; work is now slow and staff is in reduction.
good,"A typical day consisted of providing project office support to the Project Manager. In these duties, you were required to brief documents, take minutes from the meeting, facilitated project meetings and travel monthly."
good,"Large company, which is easy to get lost in the mix if supporting a customer away from HQ."
good,fun place to work with good pension and benefits. Very relaxing environment and easy jobs to follow.
good,"My typical day as a buyer is to assign the workload from the night before and then begin working on items that I am responsible for. "
good,Good company but limited opportunities to grow as a professional.
good,"Lockheed is a great place to work, but people don't advance in their careers fast enough there"
good,The work was at a slow pace. Job security was terrible. The day to day was better than a production job.
good,"pay was way too low, was just a job while i was still in high school"
good,Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC) is using its new performance review program called LM Commit to throw away good people that it no longer wants.  My supervisor told me that under the old system I would have been rated well just as I had been done for the last years.  He actually apologized for how LMC used LM Commit to trash me.  So I left LMC for the best next job that I could find.
good,Great benefits no work life balance.  Management was lacking and mostly on your own to figure out how to do your job.
good,"Under staffed in some areas and over staffed on others."
good,6 Month Contract - increased skills and learned about government contracts
good,"Lockheed is a very large organization to work for. Stress level are high and job performance is pushed / demanding. Promotions are promised but never given. The company preaches Ethics but turns a blind eye on complaints. Does not have a good Job Work / Life Balance, the company expects the employee to place the company first at all times and personal family last."
good,"Management needs to understand the leadership qualities of managing a successful team. And taking command when required and being fair, honest and actually listening to their employees."
good,"Lockheed Martin is just okay. As with any large corporation, the pros and cons vary greatly depending on which business unit, team, management chain you belong to."
good,"good people"
good,They compensate well but their management leaves something to be desired.
good,"Be careful, big brother may be watching. Lockheed-Martin had a culture of nepotism and preconceived ideas on worker ability. This made it a difficult place to advance if you were one of the unknown commodities."
good,"Easy work, but easily replaceable."
good,"Maintained and juggled constantly changing calendar meeting notices and conference room bookings. Worked with manager, program employees, Line of Business admins, program admins for various ongoing functions. Booked travel, completed expense reports, scheduled logistics etc."
good,"Where I worked, it was a close knit group.  A bit too close in truth.  Jr management was family (literally) to Sr Project Management.  All friends of said family were left to their own devices while anyone outside that group were strictly held to a different standard.  Benefits however were great and the work week was the ""Ideal"" 7:00 to 3:30 Mon. through Fri.  Beware of crossing management with any ideas not shared by Management or their Good 'ol Boys club...  you will find yourself on a performance improvement plan from which you can not escape."
good,"Coming to this company, was the worst career choice I’ve ever made.  I have been fed lie after lie to fill a hole here in the desert."
good,Complete systems administration tasks on windows operating systems in a VMware virtualized environment.   Perform project management tasks from planning to closing out projects.
good,"A typical day would consist of me coming in checking my classified and unclassified systems.  Looking for potential new projects and emails for leadership.  I always check my email first as of way of seeing how my day will go. Depending on if there are new tasking will then dictate my day.  I look at all my projects to check status' and ensure that we are on time with agreed upon completion date.  Next, I follow up with clients to make sure I give them status updates.  I then prepare slides for the Commander to brief the National Capital Region on Maintenance Task Orders, this briefing takes place every Monday and Thursday.  I enjoy the Management team here because they are flexible with our work hours and allow us to work without being micromanaged.  My co-workers have been helpful and I enjoy working with them.  The most enjoyable part of the day is when I get to close a project that I have been working or closing out a Maintenance Task Order after we are in compliance.  I enjoy the challenges and the fact that it's something new just about everyday which keeps the job from getting boring."
good,"A typical day at work can be a moderate paced building of aircraft.  There is much to be learned if you are an eager to learn person.  Most things will be learned on your own, since there not so many willing to teach.  The hardest part of the job is the setbacks you experience on the production line.  Sometimes it can be difficult to get the ball rolling.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the pride in building and being knowledgeable of such and advanced aircraft."
good,"The people are fun to work with, but government regulations make it hard to be creative."
good,My current position is similar to what I did in the military.  Every day I process requests for military units when they need to order supplies and I also close out receipts for equipment that has been turned in.  In order for the units to receive credit for turned in equipment these receipts must be closed in a timely manner.
good,"I gained much experience and knowledge from this job.  I didn't seek to be a procedure writer, the need found me and I realized that I am quite capable."
good,Pros:
good,I like working with my co-workers. Not to difficult to catch on. all in all its been a good place to work
good,"Above average compensation in return for a usual 10+ hour day; Management is mediocre - a select few are true leaders. Most just follow and give orders as that is what is expected. Very interesting work if you work directly with customers or on a customer program - nothing else like it. Co-workers fall into two categories: one is trying to preserve their job and dodge the ongoing industry-wide headcount reductions and demotions; the other is looking forward, planning their next career move when they leave. Hardest part of job is dealing with the stifling environment - creativity and exploring innovative business and management practices are not generally encouraged, recognized, or rewarded. Predominantly an inward looking management culture."
good,"A Good Company to work for, Management keap everything to themselve."
good,"Benefits packages vary, Corporate Benefits rock, all other packages (6 I think) are fair. The business unit you work in really determines your whole experience with the company. Internal competition is fierce, don't expect life long employment, once your contract is done you're done. As with any risk adverse large company don't expect a lot of innovation and risk taking."
good,Productivity and performance oriented departments.
good,"I joined IBM in 1972. I worked my way up in the commercial division. In 1979, the commercial division decided to pack up and move to Vermont. I did not want to move, so in support of the ""you'll always have a job"" promise, I was transferred to the Federal Systems Division. I worked my way up that division and decided to make a change in careers. They offered the Programmer Retraining program which put me where I am today. I went from designing systems, to programming them. As I have since learned, Gov't contracts come and go... during the 90s, they sold FSD to Loral... some time later, Loral was bought by Lockheed Martin. In 2002, they decided they no longer needed me... I showed them; with 30 years of service, I retired."
good,I have worked for this compnay off and on for 11 years. It's not bad place to a career. Let me tell you about Palmdale site. It's a 360 madness working environment. This is a disfunction place. Bad management from top to bottom. Nobody has a will to accept responsibilities. Fingers pointing and blaming on each other. Promoted workers that they didn't have the qualitification for the job.
good,"My responsibilities were to make copies of,scan and deliver bills to the State Department in Washington DC. I was also required to maintain copies of the bills for the companies records. the main things i learned while working at PAE was how to scan in documents and proof check what was scanned in before putting them on a cd and deliver them to the customer. I worked with a great group of talented people at PAE who also showed me the way when i needed help. i would say the hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the amount of bills coming in that i had to also print out as well as get manager and operations approval signatures. the most enjoyable part of the job was delivering to the customer and their gratitude when bills were delivered before their due date."
good,"that the earlier the job is done out on the line before the sun is high noon because that is the hottest part of the day, mangement was different ,co-workers were not happy so it made the day longer, but still regardless of how the morale of the team when the job was complete it made everone feel better because a task was completed to the best of everyones abilites."
good,"I started here in 2008. I had no job at the time, so of course Iwas excited to be working for a company like Lockheed. I was promised advancement, and learning about web design and graphic design. I have been here almost 4 years now, and the only thing I have gotten are my hours cut because of lack of work coming in. I paid for a graphic design class myself last fall to refresh my skills so that I could start designing here at work. That never happened. Next month I am taking a web design class that I am paying for myself again in hopes that it help me get a better job at a new company. We are behind 2 operating systems and just got the most up to date software after missing the last release."
good,Lockheed Martin offers many locations to work at and encourages moving within the company. Company promotes commitment to ethics and integrity. Average age is pretty high - probably late 40's early 50's.
good,"Lockheed Martin provided me with a solid environment to build the foundation of my skills. I was also given the opportunity to delve into SharePoint which turned into my focus. Being such a large company, however, there were many levels of management and sometimes endless bureaucracy which made some tasks very difficult. There was also an emphasis on meetings that did not seem to concise agendas."
good,Job security is very poor. They are looking to cut back at all levels. Experience means nothing in this company.
good,Work isn't difficult and very non stressed. A very stable position and easy going co workers. Management can improve like any other company. Technologies isn't the most up to date.
good,but working here its ok typical day you'll get no and they'll have you   figure it out  on your own and go from there they have multiple dining areas for you to eat.
good,"Enjoyed working at the company. My trainer, not the best communicator of information. Do not discuss personal information, especially when things are great at home."
good,"Challenging work great people. Work life balance not always priority , In order to advance must be willing to relocate. Overall I enjoyed my 10 years with the company ."
good,Good income and flexible hours. The benefit is you can create your hours if you’re part time and sometimes even when full time. The area that needs work is the management and professionalism for the employees.
good,"Management, union and HR refused to listen to my pleads of being moved locations and refused to reprimand my supervisor who was harassing not only myself but other employees. As far as following us to the bathroom and around the work station. This supervisor would bully us and tried desperately to have us work against each other. After going to management, HR and the union on three separate occasions (and having them only make it worse) I decided to step down from my position. It was a shame because I loved this job and everything they offered but they ignored me when I thought my safety was in question."
good,"Interesting projects if you are friends with the right managers. 90% of teams are not Agile and follow the typical waterfail methodology. Culture is more concerned with making sure gays/lesbians are comfortable than that we're using the latest development frameworks or that engineers have the resource they need to get the job done. Pay was probably higher than average, decent flex time and time off benefits. Every other Friday off is a big plus."
good,People want to work. Some of of processes are a little slow that cause for long days. Overall a decent company. Wish the company would focus a little more on the employees.
good,"The pay did not match the work load or schedule. However, the people made it a really nice place to work. Training was provided and other job opportunities were available"
good,"You feel a sense of pride working for a company that supports our national security, a lot of good people working there but very corrupt, “good ole boy” network of management.  Classic company of “its not what you know, it’s who you know”.  Be careful in this environment, unless you manage up extremely well or are an attractive younger person. Better to keep to yourself. Raises are very minimal, promotions are nearly non-existant unless someone retires or dies, every other Friday off is a benefit."
good,Lockheed is a big corporation environment. Try to figure if that is the culture for you as quick as possible. That can truly make or break the experience of working there. If you are not careful you can get pigeon holed into too specific of a role in a large company.
good,"On a large scale Lockheed Martin is an outstanding company however not everyone's story goes according to plan. I do not fault the company for the lack of communication, however there are several aspects that they could tighten up on there small unit leadership"
good,"They will promise  their employees everything they think they want to hear but, do not deliver. They will give you a position that should require a promotion and/or pay increase but, give you nothing."
good,"My position was a contract position, so take my review with a grain of salt.  The individuals I worked with all seemed like they didn't enjoy their job and were only there for a paycheck.  There were no pay raises or opportunities for advancement because everyone had been in their positions for so long they became entrenched.  When there was an opportunity to move up, someone was usually hand picked to fill the ""promotion.""  I just happened to get lucky because I interviewed well and impressed my management, but overall it was a pretty lacking experience,"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a huge corporation and with that comes lots of opportunities to gain experience. The problem is that with so many candidates for different jobs you are always disposable. And because the supply of engineers is so high, the pay is not great. The benefits absolutely suck, I seriously considered getting Obamacare over company insurance."
good,Good pay for hard work.  part of that was a deployment to overseas location with limited options for local travel.  did know this going in.  Not all jobs necessarily require travel.
good,"What is the point of having an interesting job, if you can't share it with family and friends?  That is pretty much every program I've been on at Lockheed Martin."
good,Not real impressed with my current leadership - there needs to be some coaching to help my current leader.  There's a real power in asking valid questions and listening to how others view things.
good,"Company is more interested in profits than anything else."
good,Was not very good management.and very low rises.workers did not listen to their boss and lost inventory and there was not much training and a place that helped provide for our Government should be run better .
good,great company to start your career in but not to finish. Large companies like Lockheed build your foundation but does not let you be internally promoted without a good mentor-ship.
good,"Good place to learn but that is it."
good,Overall not too bad a place to work. Can be taxing and a little too fast paced at times. This could lead to a negative impact for various things both project and employee related. Management is OK but I believe there are things that should be shared with the team that aren't.
good,Work is right and I learned some things aside from what I know already.Management sometimes does not help a lot like communicating and answers to questions on what we need especially when we are working out of state and country.Workplace is good everybody knows what they are supposed to do.Hardest part of the job is when there are no parts available and we have to stop working and the most enjoyable is when we travel to different places.
good,"Typical day involves showing up on time to work, performing repetitive, monotonous tasks daily. There are weekly production goals that each team strives to meet. The benefits are great and overtime is available."
good,"They have decent benefits however they are slowly ending them. People are friendly and decent. There is a lot of blaming though and everyone is quick to point the finger. Also people like to say something isnt their job even though they can help, not quite a team effort"
good,Diversity inclusive but I feel they are never consistent with the people they hire. There is always change in management and its hard to figure who will deal with.
good,"I was hired while the contract with NASA was being reviewed under protest. It was a temporary job and I was a contractor. Eventually Swales lost the contract as well as its employees to the winning company. However, I was not allowed by my contracting company to switch to tbe winning contractor."
good,"Job tempo and benefits were comfortable as well as pay. Training was sufficient and informative. Management was involved and flexible. "
good,"Disappointed in how they promise to take care of employees, when job was done, no one ask if you are interested in continuing with another job. Again, you had to be in the click."
good,"I've been working on Lockheed's Palmdale facility in different capacities for almost 10 years. In that time I've watched it transition from a company that took care of its people and created an environment that people wanted to work in for 30+ years, to just another job farm that hires people for as little as they can get them, and takes as much as it can. Even though in that time the stock has gone from $80 a share to over $300, they have slashed employee benefits, don't repair dilapidated infrastructure, and refuse to build an onsite cafeteria for its few hundred employees."
good,"If you like the government environment then you will enjoy working for LM.  Though, after many years of thinking it's a role with the company in reality it was the company's culture that drove me away."
good,Production is priority over safety. The current culture is built on the legacy of the past and it is very difficult to change the hearts and minds of those in-charge.
good,LM has a variety of interesting jobs that pay well but advancement is slow. Job stability is not very stable and subject to change with very little notice.
good,This is was a conventional job without many challenges that peaked any interest. Unfortunate trend of unloading more and more work on less and less staff
good,"I had 2 awesome managers at 2 locations an one not so great.  Pay and recognition depends on the manager. I do not call 25 cents an hour a raise, but other managers made sure good work was recognized rewarded. My last LM manager was fantastic!"
good,"Interesting subject material with work that can really matter. Broad range of available jobs with the potential to travel or not travel, depending on what the employee is seeking. Supplied with modern tools for completing the job."
good,Intense work environment
good,"LockheedMartin has changed for the benefit of stockholders and at the expense of employees.. Stressful environments, no career advancement, less work/life balance, absolutely terrible insurance plans starting 2018."
good,Good working environment but low pay.  The benefit package is not that good with high deductible and limited sick days allowed.  Lockheed has high turnover ration among the young professionals due to lack of pension.  Only old timers are sticking around for their pension.
good,"Another company that is growing too fast. Compensation is decent, but they are cutting so many benefits that it is not a very pleasant place to work. Daily work is burdened by excessive policies and procedures. Energetic staff, but bridled by the company atmosphere, culture, and micro-management."
good,"Once you are in, raises are pathetic and after a couple of years they do not keep up with what you would get by taking a job at another company. But that's the way every company does it so you have to play in the system and jump jobs after a few years if you want to be compensated what you are worth. Loyalty is not rewarded. Promotions are also hard to come by if you remain in the same team; again, no reward for job loyalty. And then they wonder why Millennials aren't loyal."
good,Job culture varies by location. Company is good for work-life balance. Strong corporate feel. Work culture is somewhat political. There are pros and cons for working at this company. It comes down to what works for you.
good,"Vey bad management from the top to the bottom. Hard to get promoted, very political and cut throat. Most managers should not be managers. Decent benefits and great paid time off."
good,On a typical day at Lockheed Martin you would show up to work get your equipment for the day and start working I got stuck installing fastener covers for 3 years out of my 5 and you would get in trouble by the union reps if you worked to hard for the day. I however got bumped to 3rd shift after what was called shift equalization. When doing so I came under new management that didn't care what his peoples opinions at all I tried several times to explain faster safer ways of doing tasks and was told I am just a worker not a boss so at that time I realized Lockheed Martin was not where I needed to work.
good,You are required to follow the contract so if you and your spouse works (hardest to the first responder spouses) they will not work with you on odd shifts or any other issues you may have. The common response of management is that you need to figure it out.
good,"Interesting place to work, job security, I can say I had a paycheck every week, 52 weeks per year, For 32 years. Worked on several projects, and worked with many interesting brilliant people."
good,"Cut throat industry, would seek work elsewhere.  Work pace is very slow, hurry up and wait and wait and wait.  I can see why our country is in economic troubles in the defense industry."
good,Lockheed is a beast of a company! There is much politics. This is a big money company. They make some very exclusive products. I've seen too much bad behavior there!
good,Not a company where career progression is likely but pay is good medical is good expect to work around a lot of ex military anyone that served no that can be good and bad. But some people just cant let that era go so sometimes you can get very frustrated dealing with leadership or employees.
good,The main problem was age discrimination. I and others got laid off because it seems we where over 50.  was surprised of the people they kept because of age
good,management is very unorganized and not help full and like to play favorites not friendly and dont like to listen or take the feedback they ask for keeps moral at an all time low
good,"I work on average 10-12 hours a day. Continually rated at the highest performance level possible, but has been 6 years since my last promotion. Management often delegates work to lower level employees but is unwilling to recognize via titles or compensation for work/experience and performance."
good,LM is a large company.  Each Operating Unit is different.  I did not have a good experience in my area.  Women are not equal on pay or career opportunities.
good,"How your success at LM is highly dependent on who your manager is.  Worked for several managers at LM, some are great, will listed and guide your career, other manager are too per-occupied with the management title and lack the actual skill and personalities to be leader."
good,"I enjoyed the work climate. "
good,This is large monolithic place where it's easy for you and your contributions to be lost. The review process is very subjective and sometimes has less to do with your performance than with your job title being compared with others. It can be stressful and definitely skews toward a certain political ideology.
good,Company that works hard and plays hard with a team environment where everyone's opinions and values matter. A diverse company allowing equal opportunity for all to move up and succeed. Ability to make an unlimited salary if you prove yourself.
good,Fair managers. Fair benefits. Cut throat and under skilled co-workers. Out dated equipment. Noisy working environment. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Announcing pay cuts after contract win not right, and hurts a lot of people. co-workers are good, management is inexperienced and unwilling to learn from people who have been here for the entire contract"
good,"Everyone that I worked with was great, but my job at the time had very little direction and I had to take it upon myself to find things to do most of the time. I'm sure it can vary in other departments, but I just didn't feel like I fit in and needed to focus more on school at the time so I left."
good,"LM wants to hire me with a significant pay cut that is why I am looking, the work is great but don't like the salary they are offering. For a huge corporation the pay could be much more desirable. This has forced me to look for another job."
good,"The work culture is an interesting one.  You can flourish and advance your career quickly in operations by putting in extra hours and being passionate about the products built.  But it can be hard to advance at all if you're not all in.  This is especially hard for newer employees, as company loyalty is not as prevalent in recent college grads as the more seasoned employees."
good,"Worked two years at LM as a contractor with the belief I would be made a regular LM employee after two years (with security clearance). After two years, all contractors and some permanents were laid-off due to gov't sequester."
good,"This is a great place for recently separated service members. It will be more money than the military. The veterans who work here are great, the teams have good cohesion as long as they communicate. The leadership has difficulty communicating down to employees and the rumor mill is usually pretty accurate."
good,"The workplace culture was, in my experience, unprofessional and hypocritical.  The culture at this company turned my profession into nothing more than a job, which was unsatisfactory to me."
good,"Very political environment, rewards political correctness not results. Older employees receive poor merit reviews and seemed to be pushed out."
good,"The workplace was mixed with people of all skills and was an interesting place to work.  As it was defence related security was very high and all documentation had to be carefully stored after use."
good,"Job dependent on contracts, ex military in management positions, regardless of qualifications.  Good company, bad experience for me."
good,"same routine everyday, team lead is horrible, love my co-workers, loved the job but management need improvement. Withdrawal from 401K is horrible. HR not available always."
good,"Reasonable place to work with a slant on conservative values, and a cautious venture into new technology.  As an aerospace firm, they are subject to the market and governmental variability in opportunities typical of those companies driven primarily by large government contracts."
good,"I picked up a lot of knowledge of the Production build in almost every area.  Became proficient in a lot of different systems that are required to keep production flowing, while consistently trying to meet cost."
good,"Major benefit of LM is the flex schedule, or the ability to work hours in whatever way necessary to get the required time in each week."
good,Leadership shows major favoritism and you never know where you stand one day to the next. confusing directions on job from day one.
good,"The Lockheed in the Ocala location has great benefits and opportunities to work your way up the company ladder. Outside of that, working here is awful. Management hardly listens to the hourly workers and they can't seem to find enough supervisors for the plant. The only people outside of the hourly workers who seem to know what's going on is the engineers and management doesn't listen to them either."
good,Work week was usually four 10 hour days. Relaxed work setting as long as you were staying on task and not messing around. Overtime was there to those that wanted to work it. The job task weren't always demanding as long as you were paying attention. Everything pretty much came in a box like it was a puzzle that just needed to be tweaked to fit just right.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a very reputable company, but very strict on their hiring practices.  These days, this company requires a Bachelor's Degree for every position, even for an entry-level contract janitor.  Overall, the company gave me some great insight and inspiration to enhance my career.  Most of my relevant IT experience was acquired here."
good,"As an Engineering Intern, the job was 99% in the cubical. Duties included making revisions to technical documents in the CAD program we used. I learned a lot of valuable skills, but I could not imagine working there long term. My manager and peers were nice and overall enjoyable. While I were there, a different department lost a contract, so dozens to hundreds of people were laid off. All departments, including my own, were at risk for getting fired. I suppose that is the nature of a defense contract company."
good,"Lockheed Martin is an extremely large company with extremely large divisions and you can sometimes get lost in the shuffle."
good,"Nothing to add"
good,"The best part of my job is working with Highly Skilled Co-Workers on the newest Fighter Aircraft. Our task is to get the F-35 in a state of readiness for customers i.e. USAF, USN, USMC and all International Joint Strike Fighter partners."
good,Very good company to work for. Lots of work but overall skills and proficiency at the job improve very quickly. Very challenging internship but gets redundant after a while.
good,"I worked for Lockheed Martin over ten years covering a wide spectrum of job duties, including some offsite.  I learned A LOT working here, both good and bad.  I loved working a 4/10 schedule.  It was so worth it to work four 10 hour days to get every Friday off.  It's rough getting used to it at first.  But once you adjust to the hours, the thought of working a normal five day week sounds dreadful.  Unless you work for a specific program or are already a manager, your opportunities for advancement are pretty limited.  I can't tell you how many people who got hired after me, at a lower labor grade, had already made it to at least a labor grade 4 manager because they worked on a program.  People who didn't work on a specific program were called functional because they supported all programs.  In my experience, if you were functional, but not management, you pretty much stalled at a particular labor grade no matter how long you worked there or how much of a subject matter expert you were.  I never met a person who thought their performance assessment method (currently called LMCommit) was truly fair and comparing apples to apples.  No one enjoyed writing their commitments each year.  It wasn't uncommon to see people working for someone who was a lower labor grade than they were.  Oftentimes the only way to get a promotion, or even a decent raise, was to just apply for another job.  Office politics and favoritism is abundant no matter how much you’re told otherwise.  Unless you do something pretty heinous at work, intentionally mischarge your time or commitment an export control"
good,The compensation and benefits were competitive for the industry.  Salary increases were not huge (around 2% each year) but at least they were something.  No room for advancement unless I wanted to relocate.  Work/life balance was different depending on who I worked for.  Prior boss expected a lot of extra hours.  Most recent boss was much more reasonable.  Management in my group  was always looking for ways to cut costs resulting in uncertainty and layoffs.
good,It was nice to work with LM during these 5 years. It was nice to have very flexible hours and open doors with the Boss. I know they will automise the processes in Singapore. It will be a very big plus on process.
good,"Worked armory contract for six months before we were going to get Laid Off. So they can switch from contract employees to GS Pay grade. Issued out weapons, cleaned them, conducted Inventory. "
good,"I worked their for almost 12 years and was laid off along with a number of other older folks."
good,"Lockheed was a strong technical company that valued technical ability over anything else. When it merged with Martin and Lockheed-Martin acquired multiple other companies that culture changed. LM is a modern mega-corporation that is concerned with the bottom line (as a publicly traded company should.) The engineering tools which were cutting edge in the 1980's have been replaced with Microsoft Excel and commercially available codes. The projects are driven by risk adverse customers that result in re-using 30 year old technology. With the latest downturn of the defense industry, LM is consolidating and encouraging its workforce to either move to its new core locations or to leave.  Given the current environment it is difficult to hire and mentor new employees to stay with the company."
good,"We are transitioning from a military to commercial work load. Management harps on quality first, schedule second they then turn around and keep pushing schedule."
good,direct touch labor force are some of the best technicians in the world. upper management is cold aloof and unable to find new work to keep the company viable
good,"Limited parallel opportunities, non technical work, not a very design oriented engineering company, and not a lot of young folk there (so its hard to have any social life that stems from here). But, its a good company, solid job, looks good on your resume coming out of school."
good,"Management is top heavy; hard to move up "
good,"My immediate supervisors and manager were top notch.  The best in the business I would say after being in the field for so long.  They knew how to run a tight ship and what was required.  Above them the managers know how to run people and businesses into the ground.  Setting unrealistic expectations of people and technology and worse, SELLING those expectations to the government.    "
good,Job is demanding and very awarding technically but not fairly compensated.
good,"Being in another country it is like not being part of the team."
good,Last five years were very uncertain in terms of job security. Company has seen many lay-offs and I would expect to continue with defense department cuts.  No notice of impending lay-off with no chance of applying for other positions to lesson impact on family.
good,"Initially there was poor management.  However, current management team is great.  Love getting paid weekly.  hate benefits and tend to pay below the average."
good,"Not for a person who likes to grow and have variety."
good,"Space System line of business is losing business to smaller, cheaper, and more efficient companies.  Space System is too stuck in their ways to change and adapt to the new climate of spacecrafts.  They go after government work that is few and avoid the commercial business and the little commercial work they do, they are over priced because they follow government protocol which is expensive and over kill for most commercial spacecraft."
good,"I've worked at Lockheed for 5 years in a variety of positions and teams.  Overall it's a good company and can be very rewarding depending on the department and management.  Working in production/operations can be very frustrating as issues seem never ending and workforce can be difficult.  Learned a ton over the years, but HR focuses too much on years served when it comes to advancement over ability and knowledge."
good,"Having worked for a small company both before and after my time at Lockheed Martin, I felt more like a number than a person to the corporation."
good,"The work is good and rewarding, but the constant threat of layoff is too much to take sometimes. Combine that with the company politics and you get a place that isn't very fun to work at."
good,"Horrible benefits. Management was great and willing to take care of you. However, had to be willing to work shift hours and most times 12 hour days. Even with enjoying the type of work after a while the long days and lack of benefits took its toll. Co-workers were a definite plus to the job."
good,"A typical day at work is extremely busy--working a three-man job."
good,"New enterprise for Lockheed-Margin. During this period Lockheed-Martin was developing a new enterprise, one in which they had no expertise. The development of new computers and proceeedures was a necessity. Adjustment during this period was required by both management and specialists. By 2008, internal facility training was in full swing and the necessity of keep FAA veterans was no longer requirement."
good,I haven't worked for Lockheed Martin for almost 17 years so my opinion would not be fair or accurate.
good,"But my program is ending. Co workers are great. Good place to learn, over emphasis on a college education."
good,Compensation is not based on performance and is no way competitive with the industry.
good,"Working at Lockheed Martin has enabled me to be a part of some really big projects that have huge impact for the company and our customers. These have included military aircraft, postal service, and space systems. I've been able to work with technologies a lot of smaller shops couldn't afford and really push the envelope of what is possible. I've had 2 great managers and a few that weren't so great in my 8 years with the company. It seems to be less common to have the great managers unfortunately. The co-workers I've had have ranged from extraordinary to below average. At the moment I'm privileged to be on a pretty great team of really smart people, but there have been challenges in finding talent over the years. I think the hardest part of working at this company has to be the total disregard for work/life balance. It's not unusual to work significant and uncompensated overtime for months at a time. The huge emphasis on process and procedure are also tough to live with at times, particularly when they stand in the way of keeping our engineering costs down and remaining agile in a constantly changing market. The best parts of working for the company have been the benefits, such as salary, education reimbursement, and opportunities to work on such great projects. The benefits are starting to be eroded by the search for ways to cut costs though and the company doesn't really feel quite as great as it did 5 or more years ago."
good,Most of my co-workers were intellectual and pleasing to work with.
good,"A typical day with the particular program I was on, consisted of continually making the customer happy, while risking the morale of the contract workers. Even though we were consider Lockheed employees, the reality was the customer paid for the contractual program and the Lockheed Martin employees will complete the job, by any means necessary."
good,Cutting edge R&D problems
good,"Great company to get exposure to a multitude of projects and environments. However, the company, as a whole, is stuck about 10 years in the past...especially when it comes to processes. Due to a heavy military customer base, the company often takes the 'safe' route on projects, designs tend to be proven instead of forward thinking. This process is slow to change."
good,The hardest part about working here is the differences between business units in management methodology.
good,This company could be better overall if all business units had better more effective managers. The company appears to care about employees however it is not fully engaged in following through with many of their values.
good,Sikorsky is a fine Aerospace Company with many opportunities for career development for it's direct employees. Contractors do not enjoy the same. But I'm sure this is the case in any employ with Contract employees.
good,"UTC/Sikorsky offers excellent benefits including 100% tuition reimbursement as well as performance bonuses. High energy, high stress work environment."
good,"I have learned a lot and my co workers were great to work with. The hardest part for me would be, lack of work at times or working with other co workers that don't care to work."
good,There are good and bad things about working for a large company.
good,"•Work as a member of a five person Help Desk team supporting the NMCI Enterprise Tool in a fast paced environment averaging over 1,000 tickets per week."
good,"Doing great work for our Armed Forces. This campus has been bought and sold many times over, Lockheed is the current landlord."
good,"Technologies are extreme. Manufacturing one or two products of a kind requiring over 100 NASA certifications. Use SAP program to specifications. Co-workers are great and top in thier field. Floor management is inexperienced and constantly at odds with staff. The most difficult part of the job is obtaining parts, meeting deadlines with this problem and management not cureing causative issues to delays."
good,Management is not held to the morals and mores that they hold the employees to. Management does not care about the employees.
good,Company is not as diverse as it claims and makes it very difficult to advance when you are qualified for the position. Requires current mgmt. approval in order to interview which is horrible.
good,"Good team but I was a contractor so doesn't count"
good,Most unorganized contract I've ever been on. Everyday they were changing how the project was ran. management had no clue what was going and barely did anything but sit around and talk.
good,"World class company that you can be proud to work for. If you value family time and non stressful environment this is the place to be. "
good,I learned a lot about the inner workings of a company. I was relatively unsupervised for most of my time there which forced me to self-teach and work independently.
good,"Work is always busy and challenging, inspiring to do more, Sometimes its difficult yo get feedback from seniors when requesting for an information. Most enjoyable is that its a friendly environment."
good,I worked as a service desk analyst and found it extremely hard to move over into the internal side of LM. There was a known stigma against the LMSD even though here were competent analysts here but it was nearly impossible to get hired from there to LM internal.
good,"Good job, on site people are friendly. Management was fair due to prior employees there is no room for advancement on the job or in the company. Fair overtime when available"
good,"Experienced some awfulness such as judgement.  Daily work routine is easy, with proper communication. Experienced bullying as well. Great opportunity for people with no mental illness. However, the business is FULL of veterans with PTSD. Chairwoman is great and a people person. Many Executives could use more management training. Overall nice experience. Pay is nice in the beginning; not enough raises and bonuses with increasing daily duties."
good,The starting pay and benefits are great. 120 hours of rollover vacation per year plus 40 hours of sick time per year. Unfortunately the work is very slow. If you want to feel energized while working then this may not be the place for you.
good,"Lockheed Martin has recently sold off a portion of their entertainment efficiency portfolio, the employees were told three weeks prior to the closing of the deal. Not able to adjust nor giving the opportunity to stay with a company they invested years of sweat equity. All were treated as just numbers on a spreadsheet."
good,Good company that I would recommend to all qualified employment seekers. Offers a challenging lifestyle and career options for growth and moving around.
good,"If you don't mind the high pressure or stress then this may be the place to learn and be appreciated."
good,LM is a great place to work at. higher management tries to take good care of the lower level employees. Overall a good place and company to work for. Nothing bad to say.
good,Not a fun place to be in the Bay considering how many dynamic places to work there are. Job security is a guarantee but you often find yourself doing less challenging work for years. Compensation is lower than expected with no tech perks.
good,Excellent company with challenging work with good bennifits. Plenty of ability to move and travel. My location offers the ability to learn a lot more in ship building.
good,"The company is profit driven. "
good,"I loved much of my time at LM.  I had some really great job opportunities,  great technical challenges,  and so many learning experiences.   In the end the culture was changing, and I knew I needed something different.  I felt the quality of some of the leadership had suffered, but with such a large company this can be very localized."
good,"typical of large defense companies with  good work life balance available with 9/80 schedule, interesting technical work, good benefits, fitness center"
good,"Like any other place associated with USG, management pushes hard and fast cause they are scared of their customer. Understaffed for winning so many supposed contracts."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a very sound company with great employees and hard-working individuals. I enjoyed getting to know the other interns I worked with, but did not particularly enjoy the work I was doing. I found it to be very bland and un-intriguing. I found it difficult to find where my work fit in with the large-scale projects Lockheed Martin was working on. I also felt the internship program as a whole was rather unorganized and they did not seem prepared for us."
good,"At Lockheed Martin, you're just another cog in the machine as with most big companies, get promoted every 2-4 years, hard to get fired. Work is slow because that's how the defense industry operates."
good,"Company is definitely large.  Benefits are good, but other companies are starting to catch up and provide even better benefits.  They do a good job of paying for schooling."
good,Lockheed is great because they hire a lot of students fresh out of college. You're able to get a lot of experience quickly as you get dropped into work right away.
good,"This is a great place to work with good managers and work environment that is healthy and fun. Aerospace industry is challenging, fun and lot to learn."
good,big raises and promotions are hard to find - most people leave within 2 years to find a new role or join the competition.  Top management is not in tune with the ranks of the company - middle aged workers with low education perform the majority of the production & labor intensive work --- company prefers to promote EE's based on tenure vs skill and education (sad) - this results in high turnover in many critical roles
good,Lockheed is just a different work environment from what I’m used to in my previous careers don’t knock it until you try it for yourself. The environment is very different and top secretive
good,The workplace was changing from thirty to forty year old employees to college graduates. Workplace culture was very political. Managers did not have management experience. The Lakeland office was not successful in retaining employees and let people go twice a year.
good,Good place fun place good people friendly place close to home save place to work clean place to work  just type till.i get 50 words so not making any since
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. I learned a lot while holding the Cyber Analyst position. The skills attained at this position will stay with me for a lifetime.
good,"Great work Life balance"
good,Good place to work.  Quality of fellow employess and managment was beyond reproach. Some long days and weekends but pay and benefits were solid.  Extenuating circumstances outside of the facilities control are causeing me to pursue alternate career paths.
good,I prefer not to say anything.  We all have different experiences so I do not want to say nor be forced to say something that's not true so please respect my choice.
good,Good people good working hours very interesting work there plant was very interesting place to visit and to see the different jobs available and projects
good,yeah dau in the life is pretty boring. I cannot beleive that it is requireing me to write a minum number of characters. Who does this on a volunteered
good,The people are what make Lockheed the place to work.  Very bright minded people.  The atmosphere was good and the work was challenging.  The only reason I left was due to our group being layed off - the work went away
good,"I did not find upper management very helpful.  However, the last project manager I worked with was great.  One positive thing to note about the company is that they tried hard to promote diversity."
good,"Require with high knowledgeable, serious work ethnic & high security."
good,The good money keeps me there. You are not hassled but the work systems (how things get done) can get to you. The vacation / health insurance / 401K is very good.
good,"I get up in the morning, take care of chores, make lunch.  Then I go to work, put in 8 or 9 hours, and go home.  The next day, repeat. "
good,"Project had  a good mission"
good,"They never give you feedback or walk along side of you.  They will throw you under the bus when it suits them.  ""What have you done for me lately"""
good,It's not bad place to work.. It seem that you need to work for a long time before you can get a promotion. A lot of micromanagement. It also required security clearance
good,Temporary contract position;   no benefits offered;   80/90 flex schedule;   early start and late end;   every other Friday off;  cafeteria on-site;  get to work early to find a decent parking spot!
good,"I don't want to share "
good,"International Business Machines Corporation is an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries"
good,"I really enjoyed working at lockheed, i learned alot about immigration and its diversity . the environment was friendly but i do think there was more room for training about certain subject matters"
good,"Work environment is determined by the government customer of the contracts on which you may be working.  Promotions are hard to come by, salary increases are limited to small increments, bonuses are very limited and stock options almost non-existent.  Benefits have been eroded in recent years."
good,Ok place to work. Typical day is working at a desk updating spreadsheets and presenting data. Learned about project and contract management. The job was not hard.
good,Greater flexibility is needed. A good place to work and management is supportive. Additional training opportunities are needed to help grow the employees.
good,The job was pretty much straight forward.  I made sure to schedule the carriers for transport of military equipment domestically and internationally.I had to make sure it got to their destinations. The job could be stressful but really demanding.
good,Working at LM Aero was a wonderful opportunity.  With such a large company the employees reaslly seemed to collaborate with eachother...  Great Company
good,"Referring specifically to the Australian operation, workign at LMA involved long hours with no appreciable outcome owing to the complexity of the political landscape and the ineffectiveness of senior management."
good,"It was okay, its all about people you know for you to be able to move up. They will preach you all about Safety but in reality they will do whatever it takes to get the job done no matter if you cause problems or break rules."
good,"The culture was largely the same. The work styles vary vastly by department and role. Management is well meaning, but lacks follow through.Roles are very task oriented and career growth is very slow."
good,"Great if you want to be hands on with hardware. Lots of refreshes for demanding employees. Imaging, cabling, dropping network and going to the network closet to bring them live"
good,"Can not really say about culture as I was only there for 6 months before company lost contract."
good,I worked for a subcontractor.  There was little to no security and almost no benefits.  The full-time Lockheed employees seemed to fair better but even that was not any protection when it came time for contract renegotiation.
good,It was a great learning experience and had lots of learning experience ;which was great at the time. I was out of college for 3 years and Lockheed allowed me to continue my eduction and get my MSEE.
good,"I have enjoyed my time here at Lockheed, the culture isnt the greatest, there is a sense of not belonging as well as less friendly work environment. Depending on your position and the level you are, they is somewhat a proper balance of of work life and personal life. Most enjoyable thing about work might be in the Early Career Development Program that i am currently in along with all other new hires and recent college graduates."
good,It was difficult to find work life balance at my prior job with this company. The hours were very long most days in order to get to the long list of projects.
good,Fast pace work environment. Training available. Full benefits for employees. Clean and safe work environment. Management treated employees fair and with respect.
good,"Work-life balance was great, management team was excellent. Work was at a much slower pace than tech companies, I would have like to see management engage with employees and compensation structure revised."
good,"There was little formal training in the finance group.  Most of the training was deskside so you inherited poor work products of your predecessors.  Culture was laid back, not fast paced."
good,Lockheed was an old boys network.  It wasn't bad for me but I am the son of a career military person.  I can imagine it could be different for others who work there.
good,"Management takeover by Ft Worth is killing the Marietta operation.  Upper management is out of touch and can't understand why contrasts are missing their cost bogies"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a company engaged in leading edge technology in a very competitive industry for a challenging customer set.   The work is always varied and interesting and the culture reflects the challenges of the industry and customer set.   There are many ways to advance if you are willing to make the commitment and step up to the challenges.   After a point in advancement, the demands on work/life balance move significantly toward work.   Our customer set is global and the projects we work are collaborative across the company.   If you are up to the challenges, the work is very rewarding."
good,Slow work at the moment and lots off issues with parts and lack off leadership from management but nice clean place to work as take 6s more than fixing production issues
good,"I enjoy my job,so I adapt an have fun,stress free.I also worked in greenville with friends from the past.Lockheed was my first employer in the world of aviation maintenance."
good,I really cannot comment on Lockheed Martin for i am only contracted out with a security company.  I enjoy working with the lockheed employers for they are very friendly and very approachable. I love the  work schedule of Lockheed Martin employes. The schedule allows the workers to have family time or time to take care of needed appointments or etc.
good,"Typical day to develop Cost Analysis for FAA project.  Given a lot of latitude in development. I was able to individually brief FAA senior personnel on estimate, which was accepted as project baseline."
good,I enjoyed my time there but with limited opportunities for growth in New England I took a position with another company.  Working for this company close to a home office would provide better opportunities for advancement
good,It was an fast moving job. It was the hardest job I ever had in my life. Answering the phone calls with ruled people all day was stressful. I haven't work at another call center.
good,"Lack of challenging work assignments and career advancement ultimately led me to leave. The difference between a high performer and an average one ultimately was who was willing to manipulate performance measurements to work in their favor. Management failed to develop talent and many young professionals as result left the company for higher paying, faster growth positions."
good,"It has been so long ago, I am not sure what to write about this position. Worked nights, did not like that. It was with the US Postal Service. We just sat at computers and tried to make un-deliverable mail deliverable ."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Lockheed, They were a good company to work for. Our mission was to support the War fighter and they were really pleased with the contract and the work being performed."
good,"It was a job. Nothing more, nothing less. Full time employees treated like gold. Management needs to be more involved but that's all. People seemed happy."
good,Calls received thorough the day for for member of the government employees to up date ID cards that would allow them to enter government buildings and ports around the United States.
good,"Lockheed Martin hourly employees are union members whether they want to be or not. This is and is not beneficial.  To those workers lacking motivation but waiting more money, it's great because they get paid regardless of their productivity.  For those wanting to do the best work possible and to be rewarded for it, it is very discouraging.  Why work hard for the money when slackers are paid the same wages?????  There's an old joke about Lockheed:  How many people work at Lockheed?  Answer:  Oh, about half of them!"
good,Lockheed Martin has recently acquired Sikorsky Aerospace and therefore it is hard to make an informed assessment on their performance.  I have not seen much in the regards as changes since the takeover but I'm sure at the corporate level they are evident.
good,"LM tries to hard to provide a balance of compensation, benefits, and work/life balance. A typical days is not really governed by LM, but by the customer schedule"
good,A big culture shock when starting to work their. Many people in the company are older and about to retire with a large influx of new graduates with little to no experience.
good,"Consultants are treated well and placed on assignments with the Federal Government at the Social Security Administration. The work is year-to-year as government contracts are funded one year at a time from October through the following September, so never sure from one year to the next."
good,"Sat in at meetings, helped run tests, helped compile data in reports and perform analysis, update tools, and really got a feel for the culture and the team."
good,I learned a lot and was able to work on things based on my supervisors understanding of what I was good at - not something that normally happens in temp positions!  I was treated as a normal employee and enjoyed all the events that I was able to attend with my co-workers.
good,"With a typical workday I received inventory from soldiers returning from deployment.  In a days work one is required to receive inventory, identify, and input back into computer system for redistibution."
good,LM is not successful at boots on ground overseas contracting. The contract was canceled after only two years due to poor site lead management and unwillingness to work with military leadership.
good,"Huge, so lot's of opportunities.  Huge, slow lot's of inertia and slow to adapt."
good,"Job titles can be confusing, I worked for an incredible Security team and learned so much from the Facility Security Office, My supervisior who balanced everyday experience with a positive attitude.  I loved working with the government, providing internal education, being involved in investigations."
good,Work was good and fast pace. Was able to work several programs and learn from each and at times worked as a scheduler and planner at the same time for programs when shortage of employees were low.
good,"I enjoyed working here and the position was challenging and interesting. While here, we had a 9/80 work schedule which is a huge perk.  Enjoyed working with the other staff."
good,Corporate culture of making money for the corporate benefit; more concerned about profits and stock price than providing services to customers. Those ideals came straight from the mouths of the Lockheed Martin corporate talking suits themselves.
good,"I worked at this facility for approximately 10 years however it was  over 30 years ago,  I do not feel I can accurately give a review of the current environment."
good,"Good Company to work for but when you become more experienced and age more than 50 up, most likely replaced by young college graduates for  lesser salary"
good,Merging companies and cultures was difficult and let to great uncertainty. This made for a chaotic work environment and general unhappiness. Eventually all of the work was relocated to California.
good,I feel Lockheed has helped my career growth and I worked with a group of great co-workers at different levels. I learned more about scheduling and planning roles.
good,"Mirror our government customer, work can be slow and held up by red tape. The culture is being worked on and improvements have been seen. Still very siloed between functions."
good,"Lockheed Martin(LM) is a big company with all the tools and resources to become an absolutely fantastic place to work. As with all large companies, there can sometimes develop mixed-messages about professional growth and the implementation of efficiency models. Pay and position can also sometimes get in the way of becoming superb. During my short time at LM, I definitely was able to identify some great opportunities for organizational development and process improvement. I would recommend LM to anyone wanting to become part of a large organization that offers a lot of opportunities for growth and discovery."
good,"Fast paced, challenging but rewarding. The job offered training and a future if positioned well. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn other trades while doing my assigned duties."
good,Lockheed Martin is an incredibly competitive work environment but the skill set on is able to develop there is truly amazing. You will learn everything and anything you need to in order to be successful. The major draw back is your pay (or lack there of) and its difficult to be promoted internally.
good,"Lockheed is a large company and they treat their employees as such. Don't expect a lot of support, communication, or feedback from your manager. You could be disappointed."
good,"I have mixed review as it was family oriented when I started and came under corporate view as time went on. As that happened and with acquisitions, it became less personal and was a toxic environment by the time I left."
good,"Lockheed is a large company trying to change it's culture from a stovepiped collection of groups to an Agile company (like Google) with mixed results. There are pockets of technical excellence intermixed with groups of ""get 'er done"". Not a bad place to work and the pay is usually good."
good,"Pros"
good,The work was very interesting designing a new product for the P7 aircraft on Cadam system using aircraft coordinates system. The job was fun and exciting.
good,"I enjoyed the mission while I was working there.  The benfits were standard, the pay limited by the usual government contract funding constraints.  Would work there again."
good,I was laid off from ATM only 9 months after being hired right out of college.  they are known for their bathtub affect on new hires.  They hire alot and then lay off alot
good,"Company treat you like a number. They don't care who you are and even if you exceeded your goals, they rate you average just to meet quota. The work there is slow and management has no clue what is happening."
good,The job field I worked in at LM is now gone.  So it is impossible to judge it now. LM sold off that entire section of the company to another company (Leidos).
good,"You won't find a more rewarding career than working at Lockheed martin, from the people to the workplace it is an excellent place to work and would recommend to anyone."
good,"Pro....Good pay"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a large government contracting company.  Government contracts are chosen differently every year.  Sometimes for cheapest option, sometimes for best quality product.  I was on a quality based contract.  Higher level managers were not available to most employees and lower level managers always said that they had no power for advancement for lower level employees.  This is obviously ideal for a company so they do not have to promote or give merit increases based on production or value added.  I would not go back to LM unless I was in a bind."
good,Workplace culture is transitioning for the better. A typical day is aprox 9 to 10 hours. You will gain good experience. The most exciting part of the job is the products LM is making.
good,"Everyone works multiple projects each with its own requirements and deadlines; of course, each project is #1 priority. It keeps us on our toes. You better be prepared to perform."
good,"I really don't have much of a review to offer here.  My employment at Lockheed Martin ended many years ago, and I simply don't recall much now.  Sorry about that."
good,"I do not believe this is important, and I will not tell you a story. It has nothing to do with my knowledge or experience. Let's move on, I want a job with a good com"
good,"what are you going say... typical defense contractor with large projects. Good place to learn some skills and get out."
good,"Excellence was the product.  We could do things that astonished our parent company.  It's a shame that the company was ""right-sized"" out of existence in late 1995.  The doors were locked decades ago."
good,I like this position I was able to travel and preform migrations and ugrade computers. I was also put in a leadership position everyone was nice and this was a fun place to work at.
good,"I have no comment about Lockheed Martin. I guess it's just like working any other place, there is good and bad things. In my opinion, it has gotten worse in recent years."
good,"Typical day included preparation for meal, counting the register bank, greeting customers and closing up.  There was really nothing hard.  It only required structure."
good,"Technically interesting and innovative projects. Very rewarding work, good capable management and development team. "
good,"I worked for on a military contract for one of the many Lockheed Martin organization.  Our location was great with employee relations.  And rewarding employees for good work or coming up with time/budget saving ideas. They valued hard work.  There were times when deadlines ran late and employees were required to work long hours and stress were high, the management found ways to make those long hours bearable."
good,The section where I worked was really slow because of the security overhead required by the customer. Most of the time I had to wait for things to get approved before we can start working on it.
good,"Although the people were great, the location was terrible and we were not compensated for it. I tried to move within the company to a new location, but had no helped and felt as if I was purposely being blocked due to the serious retention issues that site has.I will say, I made lifelong friends working there, but it wasn't enough to keep me."
good,Company  culturally is slow and seems to be not willing to make changes for the future. Good Ole boy mentality exists and the company has not dealt in the commercial airplane business for years.
good,It has been a while since I worked at Lockheed Martin. It is same like other workplace. The contracts are extended based on budget every year. LM should retain bright individuals by moving to other projects instead of letting them go.
good,Lockheed is a nice place to work. There are not enough minority mangers and supervisors. Most minorities work on the floor in production areas. There is no room for advancement with this company for me
good,"Good pay but has turned more into a contract type work environment.  No guarantee of job security.  Very limited promotion potential."
good,over 20 years with company and lost for job cuts.  the hours were good and the people i worked directly with were supportive. salary was great too. culture was relaxed
good,Lockheed Martin was a wonderful place to work. The people were helpful and wanted one another to succeed. There were a number of employee resource groups to participate in and increase one's professional network.  Working with this firm enhanced my service to my country.
good,"Lockheed is transitioning from experienced to millennials = Stress"
good,The site where I was assigned is developing and improving their workplace culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customer. Working with the military was a joy.
good,Great place to work. Training on certifications from NASA AMES was also helpful. Took part in training technicians in Government and commercial satellite manufacturing and launch support team.
good,"Lockheed Martin was losing outside contracts, therefore work had gotten really slow. I found another job and left one week before I was going to get laid off."
good,"Probably among the better DoD contractors to be honest, but still your run-of-the-mill cost-plus kind of company. In general you're just a number. It is possible to stand out, but a top-heavy organization leaves little room for advancement."
good,"A typical day may be fill with confusion as the Administrator refuses to work as a team player. This is a very hostile, bulling environment that the company is aware of but refuses to correct."
good,Overall it was a positive experience. Much has since changed or so I am told. The firm was changing constantly. Lockheed got so big. It bid on everything it seemed.
good,Although this is a great company - the work can be stressful and difficult in allowing work life balance. Management was not very supportive of work life balance.
good,Each man for himself. No support from HR or upper management. No understanding of personal issues that may effect work (i.e. health issues of a family member)
good,I enjoyed working for Lockheed Martin for the time I did. It was overseas work and a totally different environment. The contract was only for a short period .
good,"Defense Contractor"
good,"- Is challenging"
good,A very stable job with plenty of work to do. The Management team really focused on mentoring new employees and ensuring the a good future career track. The best part of the job was stability. The worst part of the job was the location
good,Working on this assignment I saw unethical behavior that I did not want to be part of.  I did come to understand how a government contract operates however.
good,Great place to work when thinking of the job at hand.  Supporting the military is a huge sense of pride that you don't get anywhere else. Makes you feel like you are a part of something much bigger.
good,"LM really concentrates on employee development; however, there is no work-life balance and the support departments are not staffed properly for the amount of work."
good,co-workers were awesome. Management was terrible. Disconnect between what drives management and want they want out of us. Have the ability to fex time and work from home.
good,This is a Government Contracting Agency and I cannot comment on this position.  I cannot give any information on this position.  Nice place to work though.
good,This is a good company. Like any other large company it has its mishaps. All in all the company is good for the modification portion that is. Nothing more.
good,"Lockheed Martin was a great place to work but the health care benefits are affordable.  I really liked most of the people I worked with and the duties I had but the benefits are becoming awful.  The upper management seems to be clueless on how to keep staff.  Lockheed Martin is losing people left and right due to poor health care benefits.  (About a $3,000-$10,000 pay cut depending on the size of your family)"
good,"Not always enough work to go around, not enough new business was being won. Constant fear that your program's contract would be up and you would be out of a job at the end of it. "
good,It seems performance assessments are determined by one or two over managers that may not actually know what you do or who you are.  All personnel in same pay grade are graded against each other even though they can be doing very different jobs.
good,Leadership does not care about the workers. Male dominated company. Few managers who care about their workers. If you are a woman do not expect to get paid your worth.
good,Very routine work. I feel I was not given a chance to progress. The company is very flexible when it comes to accommodating the customer but not the employees.
good,A good place to work and contribute to the success of the company. Overall the workplace culture is great. Management is good. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the airplane fly first time successfully.
good,I took 50-80 calls per day regarding identity theft and consumer fraud.Very busy environment. Management was okay but not everyone was on the same page when it came to instructions regarding how to resolve consumer issues. The hardest part of my job was dealing with very angry callers. The most enjoyable part was when I could help them resolve their issues and make them feel relieved.
good,Consisting day time work. You will learn everything dealing with ship board install. Management is fair. The culture is behind.Most likely you will never get laid off
good,"Some projects use current technologies.  Slow to change and adapt as far as understanding what attracts and retains talented people.  Promotions are mainly based on seniority and, rarely, on ability."
good,Company participated in senior design project. Project goal was to build a software tool for company to use in one of its applications. Was a good 'foot in the door' towards working on real world applications.
good,"great organization, all contract work. Great people, "
good,"Good Benefits, management, however they needed more ability to move people around internally. Overall a good company, but only really worried about the bottom line not the employees"
good,"I learned a lot about litigation, prepping for court cases.  Moving evidence from one source to another for attorney's trials. Handling confidential and sensitive information."
good,"A typical day would be traveling to several areas requiring technical support. As a traveling technician, a day would be long and sometimes could be uneventful."
good,"Large company benefits with a small company feel.  Office in Greenville, SC is smaller than most Lockheed offices.  Good work environment and very friendly co-workers."
good,I lasted there eighteen months before i finally got fed up with the arrangement. The original manager on the account screwed me out of my position by taking advantage of a tenuous situation with the client. It was later determined that my actions were appropriate and followed the standard ITIL processes.
good,I worked with many people over my 32 years there! A recent change in direction for my department led to my lay-off earlier this year; still trying to get back into the company!
good,"Thumbs up for LM. Good place to start. LM has a great culture for  interns and the like, but experienced professionals have a harder time getting ahead, but most aviation companies have the same ""Old School"" practices, even today. :-)"
good,LM sold of 1/2 the company. We where put into IT division. We do not do IT. There are no job opportunities anymore and LM will not hire those they sold off
good,"The management style is a bit hierarchical, but most corporate companies are.  You have the opportunity to work on interesting programs that have an impact in the world, although the pay is not a great as other industries."
good,"They are a well balance company to work for. I am located in the Atlanta Ga, area. Supporting the NAVAIDs groups in Southern, Northern and Eastern service centers."
good,"Overall, Lockheed is a good, stable place to work. There are few opportunities for advancement and the management structure is siloed. However, the engineering and production teams are composed of excellent people and the work is interesting."
good,A Great place to work in most of the Washington DC Area as with most of the government services Industry How you are treated varies from contract to contract and customer to customer
good,There are many places to relocate which is a good thing.This is a very large company with a lot of benefits and opportunities. I would work for Lockheed Martin again.
good,This use to be a great company now they are beyond greedy.  Unless you are newly college graduate don't go there and keep looking.  this is a last resort company.
good,"being part of security of airport so challenging and lot of stragle"
good,The position allows exposure to a lot of different products and people.  This is great!  The tools and rules are bureaucratic and makes the job harder than it needs to be.
good,I enjoyed working at this company.  Great benefits good salary with overtime.  Would go back to work for them if I had the chance. Great place to get my electrical hours to advance in my career.
good,"Fast paced environment with eminent overtime, unpaid of course.  Staff genuinely helpful towards each other, but very rank conscience across the corporation.  Benefits are average at best, not nearly as good as expected from a large corporation. No bonuses, at least not for non-management employees, but company provides many opportunities for growth."
good,I worked mid shift and preferred days. I worked at Cheyanne Air Force Station (NORAD).Didn’t care for working inside the mountain. Other than that it was a fun place to work and good people to work with.
good,Bad pay.  No growth or improvement of known issues.  Contractor position which risked not getting renewed.  Great group of people.
good,Good working conditions but a lot of responsibility for a small salary.They forget that we live in the NYC area and take advantage of the poor labor market. A take home of 700 per week when you and three others are responsible for 30 million dollar program makes everyone have to have two jobs just to break even. That is if you can find another job. Everyone in the office is financially stressed and over half the office is looking for another job including our whole team. They outsource projects for what can be done internally at four times our rate but underpay us for what we do
good,"I worked with great people who were focused on safety, quality, and delivery of goods to the customer.  I liked the flexibility and the quality of the folks that i worked with."
good,"LM Sunnyvale was a wreck - unqualified people being promoted and put into positions they were not qualified for.  People were not excited about change."
good,"If you choose to work here, you will have an interesting job, most likely a good boos, and very good pay in some career fields. However, the work life balance is one of the worst of any company. These days 6 hours per month for vacation/sick/snow days are all that is allotted."
good,The management at this facility aren't as involved in the hiring process as they should be. It just makes it harder on individual that commit 110% to accomplish all daily required tasks.
good,Working with the union was a challenging experience. Navigating the union rules and learning to operate in their restrictions was one of the most difficult parts of the job.
good,Short term contract performing basic sheet metal duties such as metal and fiberglass repair.  No defined job purpose.  Worked with military to fill needs.
good,Lockheed Martin is a stable company to work for but the company does not provide for a social environment to build a positive company culture.
good,Good or Bad company culture depends on how you look at it. Lots of benefits but personal growth can be slow. The company is been run by people with old style attitude.
good,"Potential existed for overall changes and structure as new opportunities were evaluated.  Consistent management changes often led to confusion with manufacturing elements. However, a very small procurement department provided support which improved overall turnaround time, measurable inventory status reports, while never exceeding budgetary constraints and meeting governmental compliance standards."
good,I was given great opportunities to expand my knowledge and grow.  I learned alot about different aspects of the work environment.
good,"Good company, in general, to work for.  Merit raises not commensurate with Job Performance Rating. The atmosphere in your particular work area dependent upon group's supervisor. Most co-workers in my group reporting the tiniest of indiscretions to supervisor, making for a toxic work atmosphere in my small work group."
good,"Great place to work everyone is professional and delightful. Management is stellar and very serious at what they do!"
good,"I am an Administrative Assistant for a contractor at LM.  I have busy days as well as some slow ones. It is a big company, many possibilities and a lot of talent.  Good hours with every other Friday off.  Love the people. It is pretty fun to know all that LM does worldwide."
good,It would have been wonderful if it was not a contract position.  Always worried every 6 months if the contract would be extended was very stressful.
good,"Great place to be involved in what happens in the world.  Diverse community, good place to grow with an abundance of opportunity and educational opportunities."
good,The Mission Comes First.  The Budget Comes Second. The Employees Make the First and Second Happen.  I no longer feel valued as a person.  I am just an asset used by Lockheed Martin and will be replaced by the next in line.
good,"lead several tutorial programs to mentor junior high school student in math and science, met some very interesting people that taught me a lot about the corporate structure"
good,This was a decent place to work but not really not in what I wanted to do.  I started out working in the field I wanted but was transferred.
good,There have been several great people that have come and gone over the years. They offer great organizations.  Good company to work for.
good,"Typical day comprised of leading Procurement functions, interpreting prime contract provisions, interfacing with executive leadership and suppliers and teammates, negotiating and problem solving."
good,"A great place to work, but over the last few years with the company there was a decline in the stability of contracts that I worked on."
good,"Great Company"
good,"The most frustrating place I have worked in more than 40 years."
good,"As a systems engineer, the most rewarding part of this job was participating in the successful launching of a satellite."
good,Good place to work where you feel like what you did meant something.  Really grew as a mechanic with all the responsibility given to me.
good,"In a state of reorganization at current time, and negative atmosphere in some business units. Innovative people in a somewhat stale atmosphere."
good,The company has a long standing record for excellence but has room to grow. There is also a comfortable atmosphere to work and collaborate with co-workers.
good,"I thought working on the F-35 production line would be a dream come  true.  I did not like the job as much as I would have expected.  However, at least I had the opportunity to see the F-35 being built."
good,"No room for growth in my department, which leaves a lot to be desired for employees.  If you don't want to do anything for growth then our department will work."
good,I gained experience in a multitude of software in support of DHS. Hardware experience on Dell workstations and laptops also troubleshooting Blackberrys and PIV cards. Was involved in Windows 7 rollout and maintaining the environment. All in all a well rounded experience.
good,"I enjoy working for Lockheed Martin, but their benefits aren't as good as most of my friends and neighbors and their management is all about promoting themselves or shifting people around to suit their needs versus making smart decisions for the business. I've never once witnessed anyone being let go from the company. They just lightly apply feedback and pressure, but never do anything about it. Their usual behavior is to move people to another position and manager if they're having performance issues."
good,"• Cleaned restroom including cleaning toilets, urinals and sinks"
good,There is favoritism and little advancement. The work culture is some what toxic. I would not recommend this position to anyone.
good,"I am a contractor for  Lockheed Martin and I can say that this company is a great company when it comes to its employees.  All the individuals that work at my site location are respectful and have a great sense of team work.  As a contractor, the pay does not match that of a Lockheed Martin permanent hires.  That is the downfall."
good,"A very fast paced place that always keeps you on your toes.  You have plenty of room to advance in the company, which is a very good thing."
good,"Management is distant and often times unaware of employee issues."
good,Lockheed is a good company to work for. Great benefits. You have to be careful with management as they tend to pick favorites for raises.
good,"Every day was a ""new"" day due to the fast pace and customer management necessary to ensure contractual matters where identified and addressed proactively. However, due to variables outside of the program's control, often times workarounds where necessary to keep program efforts on track. The hardest part of the job was the lack of all the moving parts coming together as planned and desired. More times than not, the cause of delay was outside of the program's purview (i.e. customer and or supplier). The most enjoyable part was the team's relentless pursuit to meet the established program objectives in spite of the obstacles due to scope creep, misinterpretations, technical setbacks, challenging funding requirements, etc. Through it all the collective team always did what's right, respected all stakeholders and met every task with excellences! Wow, what an awesome group of individuals to lead!"
good,Over all it is a decent company to work with. There is no job security. Benifits are good. It is really hard to advance in the company.
good,"Tough billable hours environment, very stressful.  Overtime common, but 5 hours a week of it is not compensated.  Working in tightly controlled, secure buildings can feel imprisoning."
good,"Buying in the test tooling dept."
good,"Start with a daily brief of the last shift's activities. Assume the shift and responsibilities. I learned that tasks must be delegated daily/weekly to insure that standards are being met, continually.  Supervisors must listen as well as direct.  Management showed no concern of the welfare or issues of the employee. The hardest thing was dealing with arrogance and no desire to change for the best.  The commute (1.5 hr/65 mile) was difficult for the 12 shift.  I did enjoy the off time and the company provided living."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"It is shift work, for the most part there is no job growth, managers are fair, some co-workers should have retired years ago. The hardest part is getting up at 4:45 every morning to go to work"
good,"The company is currently re-positioning itself for the future. If you are a starting engineer with an interest in Aerospace, this may be a great place to start.  Generally, working here means working on a variety of different projects over your career, there will be opportunity to learn new skills in new areas.  They provide full benefits."
good,The insurance is cheap and they give away three weeks paid vacation per year.  The job is easy.  Plenty of turnover though.
good,"I have worked for Lockheed for eight years.  I no  longer want to work there as it has nothing to do with what I am studying in college.  it is very political and they would never let me move up or around in the company.  Other than the great benefits, I have no reason for staying there anymore."
good,Great learning experience. I have enjoyed the challenge as it has made me a better technician. Learned so much in my few years at Lockheed Martin.
good,Currently awaiting the final adjudication of my clearance to begin working here. Once cleared I am hired to provide part time security and escort at Buckley AFB.
good,"very good place to work at , good coworkers and everyone would help each other out to get the job done , very hard workers and team together"
good,Lockheed Martin was a great place to work.  I work as a temp in the events department.  I also had great benefits and hours.  My supervisors was the best and I wish the temp job didn't end.
good,"The company offered considerable opportunity and a challenging environment. Recent restructuring resulted in facility closure. Prior to the footprint reduction, company offered employees good opportunity."
good,this company is too big to be able to have an issue with an individual. Will need improvement with problem resolution and human resources.
good,Lockheed Martin is getting much leaner. More work less time/less program support. Too many processes. More time spent managing processes than managing program execution
good,"Its a average job. I show up do my work and expect average compensation with average growth potential. All in all, its average."
good,"This is a unique contract within Lockheed.  The role I worked in had a lot of micromanagement with very little flexibility.  "
good,I worked in Karlsruhe Germany as an inspector of the storage equipment of the military. We worked as a team to make sure we made all the deadline a lot of last minute deadlines
good,"Very dynamic work environment that requrires the ability to make independent descions "
good,Excellent training and opportunities to advance. The supervision is overloaded with responsibilities without the authority and support to execute. There is a high demand on supervisor/management personal time yet flexible to accommodate appointments and higher education learning.
good,Good Company to work for was able to move abroad and enjoyed my time while my contract lasted. I Trained Emirate Pilots and Technicians how to proactively learn my skills based on my Air Force career.
good,Nice group of people to work with and will help when they could. Management was a different story.  Racketeering at the highest level at the Flight Service Facility.  Whistle Blowers or anyone challenging their bases of hire or terminate is undermining the policies of corporate integrity.  I can say if you can find a way not to deal with management in this facility then you can be safe until the contract ends.
good,I enjoyed the job very much.  There were many opportunities to learn new skills and room for advancement.
good,The experience was encouraging and nurturing.  The management provided guidance and invested in their employees.
good,"Highly stressful environment with constant demands and no recognition of accomplishments."
good,"Architect , design and  cost estimation for all the activities"
good,"eliminated my job, got laid off not  worth it if you have no aerospace or logistics background. Also some shady practices with advancement and termination of personnel"
good,A typical day at work can fluctuate between very stressful and limited activity.
good,Great place to work. Great opportunity to participate in the full life cycle of the instructional design process.
good,A great on campus project that allows for great experience with Aerospace and Radar Design
good,"A big company that provides the opportunity to experience several aspects of the defense industry. Though I learned very little, due to a reduction in employees and an increase in workload, the management was personable and my co-workers were a joy to work with."
good,Work assignments can be hard and some work assignments can be fun. Some assignments can last for hours.Other assignments last weeks. Some engineering assignments last for months with overtime.
good,"Nice place to work but be prepared to learn quickly."
good,First sheetmetal job. had a lot of help learning about heavy structures on P3.
good,Large Company able to move with in the company to other positions.
good,Great career starter. Training manager was helpful and informative.
good,The years on this jobs is well spent with learning something new almost every day.
good,"A good company to work....promotes work life balance"
good,Working along Marines was a great benefit.  The sense of feeling part of a team and the fact that the Marines relied on your experience made you valuable to them.
good,Ok Company. Not much room for advancement and set raises. Good life/work balance due to lack of motivation to work overtime.
good,"The company as a whole is extremely successful. However, it was extremely difficult to progress and move into other positions."
good,Data management in the area of health informatics; collaborating with internal and external customers.
good,"Lockheed is a great place to work for pay/benefits, but sometimes the stressful nature of the work can be a bit taxing."
good,"Inefficiency seems almost like it is intended. Must play politics and never say anything negative about your manager even if they are not managing you. Culture is very similar to a military ranking system. You may be better, smarter, or more informed but best keep it to yourself if you are outranked by other in your peer group or management as they will make sure you know your place and gladly pass on your work as their own."
good,In the machine shop I had massive flexibility in job role and I was able to incorporate a multitude of my talents to meet common goals for the company.
good,I worked as a contractor for the Government with employment through LM and the corporate LM does not understand the concept of working in the field as a billable FTE.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a wonderful environment for explorations with the latest in technology. The culture at Lockheed was the best collaborative-team effort I ever had the privilege to contribute. There were a number of challenges faced, but the best part of my position was feeling a sense of accomplishment when being able to provide a solution."
good,Updating outdated systems. While convincing management the necessity of keeping current.
good,"-most days 8-5"
good,"Nice place to work, a lot of long term employees. To many company policy to make a great profit."
good,"The employees were like any other mix of people. One group showed up everyday to be productive and earn their paychecks. For others showing up at work was like showing up at a ""popularity contest."""
good,Working here is fine. They pay great. Good atmosphere. It is just that lay offs happen quick. People here do not want to retire because it is a good place to work.
good,"Co-workers are very friends"
good,Somethings have changed and somethings have not changed here.
good,"first, meeting with electrical engineering students "
good,"Great place to work, meaningful and challenging work assignments"
good,Huge defense contractor.  Was there for a short time but loved my job
good,"Focused on testing the Aegis radar system for the US Navy, Japan, Korea, Norway, and Spain. The job was very fast paced and required overtime and weekends to complete."
good,The program consisted of cross function team working together to address the customer constantly changing priorities and fast pace environment. Which required management teams on-call to address and direct teams to support critical events throughout the year. The most satisfying part is the seeing the team work together and overcome obstacle to meet the mission requirements.
good,"Individuals who were ""born and raised"" by Lockheed Martin have a very positive outlook on their ability to continue to grow and excel within the ranks.  Individuals who were part of an organization acquired by Lockheed have a more bleak and uncertain path.  Their knowledge and skills are often overlooked and underestimated."
good,"The work environment was excellent, the pay was great. Management activities by the upper management has contributed to layoffs and loss of production. Unfortunately I moved from having a job to 6 months later being layed-off. As I search online, this is not the first time that this has occurred, Former workers have moved from Marietta, Ga. to Texas only to result in being laid off."
good,"Preparing for and executing satellite operations, launch readiness and training for the team.  Some management flexibility and good co-workers.  Very busy periods at times but worth it for the results"
good,"Great introduction to how contracting jobs flow, I learned a lot about how easy it is to be let go from a contract."
good,Enjoyed working there. I do not believe they are still a company.
good,Good place to work on interesting military and government programs
good,The most recent analyst position was 90% virtual and required exceptional multi tasking skills.  Required working independently with little supervision and very deadline driven with high performance expectations.
good,"In my Personal Training position at Lockheed Martin, it was my goal to gain contract clients, evaluate their personal goals, create a reasonable and manageable program to achieve those goals, and to consistently evaluate progress ensuring final achievement of goal."
good,"Great Team environment and Management and , Good Cross Training."
good,Great place to work for entry level positions and recent college graduates.
good,Large company. Has lots of government contracts.  Rare specialty to stay aboard a very long time
good,"work was interesting and people were nice to work with, but the management sytle was very poor which made working environment very unfriendly and hard to relax at work place."
good,"good place to work. I liked what I did (HVAC filter tech) was busy pretty much all day. I learned many things from the HVAC mechanics that helped my daily job status. Management was happy with my work performance as I was often told. The hardest part of my job was crawling in to small and dirty areas to preform my job, but you get use to it. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers, everybody was very professional."
good,It has been awhile since I worked at Lockheed. I left because of the corporate culture. Seems like the people I talk to these says the same things I was saying when I worked there.
good,"Working with the Occupational Health Clinic provided a unique experience of different areas of the government area.  "
good,"Managers make or break your experience. There are tons of great opportunities, but you have to make it known that you're interested."
good,"Union Workforce. New hires did all the work. Older union employees did a lot of sitting around. This was about 20 years ago, things might have changed by now."
good,"Employees are not ranked by Supervisor, but by higher ups in other cities."
good,"Overall a good place to work with competitive salary for the area. However, the work is often overshadowed by small town politics."
good,"Typical day was staying on computer up to 9 hours and helping customers with problems and requests. Scanning in documents for the library. "
good,was able to grow at a fast past and move around to other departments
good,"At the beginning of the day, I reviewed emails, along with  responses from the previous day's copy submissions.  I made changes as required, consulted with management personnel and graphic designers. I also reviewed my ""to do"" list. Additionally I made calls or sent emails to solicit answers to questions that emerged.  I long ago learned that cooperation and flexibility were the keys to success. I loved the challenge and the interaction with people; the hard part was the ""eye-opening"" deadlines. Yet, I never missed even one."
good,You have the opportunity to learn about the Microsoft Sharepoint collaboration software. Great place to get some IT training.
good,Interesting COCOM experience. Fast moving and changing requirements.
good,"Some opportunities for growth, but it depends on who you know and who you specifically work with. Performance ratings should be rated more on actual performance and not as much on filling a certain percentage quota for each ranking. Good benefits, but not the best compensation. Good work / life balance, with occasional overtime needs."
good,"you are working for a US/Foreign Government supplier, which has its quirks, but overall, it was a good place"
good,"Install, maintain and support all user, server and workstations.  Setup and maintain network connectivity, backup."
good,My group supported the LM application that is used by the members of the Senate and the House of Congress and their staff.
good,"I learned that even when things are going well, those in seniority who are tasked to train newer employees either do not or hold back because they are concerned about job security."
good,"I worked as a Senior Technical Writer on one DoD contract. The best part of my job was being able to work independently and to manage my heavy workload in my own way. The hardest part was that very few people (including management) actually understood the complexity of my daily tasks, and this doesn't work out well when you want to advance your position!"
good,Comapany could have reached out more to their subcontractors.  they  provided security for the most part.
good,I loved my employment at Lockheed Martin. I've learned more working there then I have at any other employer. This is a wonderful company to work for.
good,Lockheed managment has too many layers of non interconneced departments cross team interface. Employees feel isolated where communication suffers. 
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the ability to flow ideas to create a better end product for the sailors. Having a collaborative team is important and being part of that team is great. 
good,Good mix of routine tasks a new challenges each day. Enjoy working with external suppliers and depots as well as matrixed project support team members. 
good,"Overall somewhere you can flourish if you're young, educated and well-suited to corporate environments."
good,Very enthusiastic on 6S and implementing lean manufacturing. High standards for quality.
good,They have all kinds of classes about reporting issues but management does not listen to their employees. Ratings are based upon management that has had several complaints and nothing is done but the accept the rating despite numerous other complaints as well.
good,Productive and good team of people to work with. Great cause to work in CDC
good,Worked diligently in support of the F35 program.
good,Tons of nepotism. Jo Blows nephew strait out of high school could get a job easier than a skilled ex-military.
good,this company pays good but its just so far away. you would need to go thur a temp company to get in.
good,I got my MS in Optical Sciences through a Lockheed program in cooperation with the University of Arizona.
good,Fast paced environment.
good,"Government contracts only. LM aways under bids, so when you start any program, you are already late, and over budget. Management then want you to lie to cover up the incompetence. Production workers do put out a good product, Just never on time. Leads to lots of stress."
good,Senior Administrative Assistant for multiple Directors and Senior Managers teams of Enterprise Business Solutions (EBS) team and Space Systems Company (SSC)
good,Managed cost and budgets for contract portfolio value over $15MM.
good,"It's been an ok place to work. I'm sure the other places have similar bureaucratic annoyances, but such is life in the defense industry. They pride themselves in paying below-market, however, and the company does little to engender loyalty in its employees."
good,Enjoyed working with the many talented and technically proficient people at Sikorsky.
good,"Busy work, with challenging mission. Management/leadership support team members. Great co-workers"
good,"This company is well known world wide, i dont have much to say other than they gave many employees an opportunity to work with their organization. It wasn't bad."
good,Enjoyed most years. Job was exciting and challenging. Hours could be brutal. It did effect my social life to some degree. Money was good and there were numerous opportunities for bonus/promotions
good,"This is a very busy and fast paced department supporting mutliple program areas. There are times where you don't have enough hours in the day to complete adminstrative tasks due to the meeting demands. Multi-tasking can be fun, however has its draw backs. This can be a great team to work for and the great celebrations upon program successes can be the most fulfilling."
good,It is an ok company. Pretty much the only company I've worked for since I graduated from college in 2008.
good,"I worked in this facility for several years and through 5 companies, which include the current Lockheed Martin. The individual members make the company as much as the company makes the individuals. Several waves of excellent management have moved through this facility - but not inclusive of the current. The co-workers are great. They always pull together to complete the mission."
good,Very pressured filled environment. Deadline driven. As a salaried employee worked a great deal of overtime.
good,No bad comments - be a good employee
good,I work 10 hours a day 6 days a week on Naval vessles. I love my coworkers but do not enjoy the travel involved with the job.
good,"Lots of opportunities, lots of products"
good,interesting blue-collar lab environment
good,"Benefits are decent and schedule can be flexible, but the general culture seems to be leaning toward negativeness."
good,"several programs to give back to the community,"
good,rivet brackets to C5C military transport aircraft
good,"Lockheed Martin is a big company. You are a number. You are treated as a number to corporate. Lockheed Martin can low ball you because they can just find someone else to do the job. Raises are meager. Promotions if you get any take a long time and are meager as well. One of the good things about LM are the benefits. They provide tuition reimbursement, good medical benefits, gym Membership reimbursement, a plethora of free training classes, health and daycare reimbursement, etc. Unfortunately, the pay is too low to even out the good benefits. Try and get locked in at a good rate since raises are almost nonexistent."
good,Not a bad place to work. Company has great values but due to the government funding constraints it is hard to get proposals on contract.
good,"A very dynamic and challenging environment that allowed experiences in cross funtional roles, to develop growth skills outside of normal managerial or technical competencies."
good,"Management is good, typical day at work sitting in the booth letting people thur checking there id."
good,Great team of knowledgable and skilled HR colleagues.
good,Great place to gain experience. Flextime. Goal oriented. Family friendly.
good,"This was a company transition. I worked for the Performance Testing group and learned many things about DOE, FBI and Emergency Management at the Y-12 site."
good,consistent
good,"Good benefits, good poeple, themanagement is lacking though"
good,Delivering marketing services for three energy-efficiency contracts
good,"Great place for overall benefits, compensation and flexibility. Large amount of competition for new opportunities on contracts or learning new positions. A lot of politics and nepotism."
good,Typical Defense Contractor. Great planes to work on. Cutting edge technology.
good,"The opportunity to procure items was very limited. The primary function involved Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, and Grants and Cooperative Agreements programs."
good,"My day could consist of launching jets to removing and replacing an engine , to troubleshooting an electrical problem. It could just abount anything aircraft related. Most of our supervisors are good to work with. From there on up into upper management they are almost impossible to work with. My co-workers are great to work with. For the most part we are all very skilled at our jobs and that makes it easier and safer to work.Dealing with a management team that does not care about following paperwork or getting us to proper tools to make the jobs go easier.Working on aircraft, that is what I love to do."
good,The company seems like it wants to do the right thing. They think that they are leading in employee satisfaction and quality place to work. They suffer from group think. Managers are supposed to be the leaders but they follow the tradition in order to stay in place. Some managers are beginning to see the writing on the wall and get more efficient in their productivity but it's a big slow ship and there are many who just don't get it. Cost/benefit analysis rarely sees the light of day in production/quality management.
good,"The work was easy, Customer's were great. The corporate benefits were excellant."
good,The people you work with from staff level down are very knowledgeable. They have the necessary skills and motivation given competent leadership.
good,"Overall the company is a good company to work for but certain divisions in the company are better to work in then others. In my position the biggest upside is the flexable schedule, The biggest downside is opportunities for advacement"
good,Easy to achieve goals due to team effort. Received support from management in resolving customer issues.
good,"This position was difficult because I had 2 bosses in 2 different locations. I physically worked in Ventura, CA but my boss was in Baltimore, MD. We started using a new accounting program and Baltimore accountants had training and I had to learn on my own."
good,flexible hours
good,People were friendly. Pay was good. Unfortunately the government had to make cuts.
good,"Decent place to work, but no place to have a career. Work can be very interesting at times, the workforce is highly intelligent. Many, many managers that have little trust in employees to think/act on their own. No open forum for employee ideas/feedback."
good,There were various challenges at Lockheed. I am now looking to other opportunities.
good,Each division functions like a company in its own right.  Operations Management very different compared to Manufacturing side of the house.  The latter is where the company values its people the most.
good,"Pros: plenty of work to do."
good,Enjoyed the employees and good working conditions. Enjoyed working on the helicopters and got my first experience with them here. My boss was awesome and very knowledgeable.
good,lockhhed martin is a job itpays you what it wants its a good place to work at alot of people in the company people help eachother there its a good place for work
good,"Good to start a career and become familiar with fields you want to learn about. Depending on your team, you can learn a lot both about corporate management and engineering disciplines."
good,"Good Company; lack of job security is an issue. Manager does not always know what she's doing, which makes for confusing leadership. However, great camaraderie, every one pulls together,"
good,"Very Discipline & Challenging, work is classified, cant be difficult but rewarding, they have some really great programs also classified as part of QA we insure perfect product to our customer."
good,"Lockheed Martin was a very good job overall,however I am Pleased to be "
good,"It was a great place to work for most of my career, but I found the last couple of years in King of Prussia very frustrating. Most of the management team I was working with was either laid off or retired off, prior to me being relocated to King Of Prussia."
good,Ability to bid on jobs within company gives one the ability to grow.  Tuition reimbursement is a wonderful way to enhance job skills.  The right mentor can be a wonderful asset.
good,It was a results oriented contract with it's ultimate goal was to reduce its workforce during  the contract period. The contract began with 58 Flight Service Air Traffic Facilities and when I terminated my employment there were 5 remaining.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for however there is always room for improvement.  Things such as promotion within, more team building activities."
good,"Good place to work, very supportive of engineers and innovation.   Excellent programs in place for veterans to learn, grow and succeed.    Very conservative politically, understandable given their customer base."
good,"I enjoy my job, when I have work.  The work flow is either feast or famine.  The pay isn't terrible but the raises are a little below the cost of living increases each year and career advancement is somewhat difficult to achieve.  Management does not always seem to be willing to see things from the point of view of the workers on the floor.  Instead, they seem to make a lot of decisions based off what they feel is best rather than consulting any of the employees that are going to be directly affected by said decision.  Benefits are pretty good, although the medical insurance has seemed to be a little sub par in recent years."
good,Lockheed is a defense contractor with very few if any commercial contacts .Most jobs require an active security clearance to start. They have a competitive 401k for direct employees.
good,"there was no team effort in this position; lack of training - haters not motivators.  Not an ideal place to work.  Very stressful atmosphere, disrespectful toward management."
good,Lockheed Martin is a great start into corporate America. It can be challenging to grow within Lockheed but it’s not impossible. You will work with very intelligent individuals that you can learn from and apply that knowledge during you daily task. The culture at Lockheed Martin is still behind but seems to be getting better. Work-life balance is amazing. Every other Fridays off is a game changer. If you really love Aeronautics and working with the government... this is the place for you.
good,Working for Lockheed allowed me the opportunity to see how a large defense corporation works and performs.  Very demanding of its employment and always trying to win the next contract.
good,"I would pay retired Veterans.  The job considered a lot of information and breakdowns, which required a lot of research.  The staff was very cut throat and just not friendly.  Lockheed Martin ended their contract with DFAS, so unfortunately everyone had to apply for the job that they were already working.  So, a lot of people either left on their own, got laid off and/or reapplied."
good,The job was at a call center in Puerto Rico. My coworkers were great but in Puerto Rico there is no opportunity for advancement as it is a dedicated service desk.
good,"Good people, bad leadership. Horrible R&R policy for overseas worker.  The money is OK but it should be more..  Be ready to be a Warehouseman and not learn your JOB. You never get to learn GCSS-ARMY.  This company does not stand behind there Name, It sounds good but you don't learn anything."
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to work. Just like every job it has it ups and downs. I have learned so much from working at Lockheed Martin I could write a book. Some of the management will treat you great and then some of them won't because its all base on who you are.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fast pasted and exciting. However it appears to be a lack of concern for employees. The work force has been reduced and the work load has increased but the dead lines have remained the same which has resulted in more mishaps."
good,Its a nice place to work. I want to go over seas. I love working in aviation.  Rotor and fixed wing. The company is a good place to work. I just want a change in pace.
good,"the full time security officers get paid more however, we do a lot more work. the job isn't hard nor very demanding but you will be on your feet for most of your shift,"
good,"This has been a great place to work, learn and grow in my 20 year career.  I appreciate the opportunities for training afforded me at Lockheed Martin."
good,It was fine working for LM until they lost the contract I was working on.  There was a very minimal effort to find me another job within the company and no willingness to retain me while one was found after contract end.
good,"The company is very flexible. If you have something last minute arise, they will be understanding. But it may seem as if people are always watching and are ready to tell on you for something minuscule. We don’t always have evaluations so you may never know what you are doing wrong and tomorrow you are fired."
good,The environment at LM has become stressful with benefits on the downhill and pay and job titles very much disconnected with responsibilities. Company knows how to get as much as possible out of a person without giving much back.
good,"I can't say anything too bad about Lockheed.  My responsibilities were clearly defined and I never worried about losing my job to silly politics.  That being said, the company did seem to have a blind spot as to why they had so much new employee turnover at the time (if I recall correctly it was 40% of employees leaving in the first two years). It was obvious to me that in my division at least, it was because the ranked rating system gave measly raises to anyone who hadn't been at the company for 20+ years, regardless of actual output, while at the same time slashing what had been generous pensions and 401K matching.  As a result I was ranked in the lowest quintile and got a raise lower than the rate of inflation, despite doing a great deal more work than some engineers that were basically retired on the job or who only worked part time.  It wasn't my main reason for leaving but it sure made me regret it less when I left for more money somewhere else."
good,"Overall, Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for. That being said, the culture is a little ""dog-eat-dog."" Managers are promoted to positions of high authority with little concern for their qualifications. "
good,Lockheed Martin is a good company to start a career but eventually you will have to relocate if you want to move up. The salaries at Lockheed are very small compared to the amount of work required.
good,During my time at LM the company was the #1 U.S.A. Defense contractor.  Many of the employees were previously employed with the government or military.  Working at LM gives a taste of what it is like to work for the government directly.
good,"Learn new things, culture is not so great. People around nice to work with however. They don't give free coffee. Environment is extremely corporate. Good for starting job."
good,"Introduced new working paradigm with the specific contract.  Difficult for the small project I worked for vs the major project that it fell under."
good,"be a self starter, know one breathing down your neck, minimal supervision. take a break when you feel like it. work at your own pace, not a big work site."
good,"Working at a ""grey badge"" environment, there was a lot of expectation to comply unless illegal.  This was not necessarily Lockheed Martin's position, but as a subcontractor to a primary corporation, it was the normal course of action."
good,"Large teams allow not a lot of pressure if you fail, but also not given a lot of responsibility. I seem invisible. Everyone is very nice though but I am younger and everyone else is 15 years me senior"
good,Opportunity to work on amazing projects. Working with brilliant people and producing unprecedented originally engineered products for the citizens of the USA as well as countries around the world
good,"Very fast paced.  Days can be long.   The work can be satisfying."
good,Amazing products and alot of opportunities to move around the world. F-35 is the future of fighter aircraft and will be around for the next 50 years. Working in same location where they build products is a plus.
good,I was given many responsibilities and was treated with respect by the management Team and my c0-workers.  There was many opportunities for advancement and agreat place to work.
good,As a software engineer there were lots of different opportunities. The benefits are good but are diminishing.  You have to be your own proponent to advance in the company because management is to busy handling technical issues rather than focusing on the individual employee.
good,"The leadership within the Aeronautics business is fragmented.  It is like a feudal kingdom many days.  The culture is slowing changing toward more empowered decision-making at lower levels.  "
good,"The site I worked at is gone, so this review isn't necessarily valid anymore. I enjoyed the pay and the benefits of working for Lockheed, but the work was slow (bogged down by government bureaucracy) and this brought about challenges of being stimulated in your job. The job was great to work as an intern, but I decided in the end not to work there permanently due to the instability of the industry and the slow work-pace."
good,I am thankful for the opportunity to enter the contractor world through Lockheed but I was almost forced to leave due to compensation. It was the best job I'll ever have but I couldn't afford to stay.
good,Very slow based environment as a government contractor.  Older work culture and comp and benefits not on par with other industries.  Can be stagnant at times
good,no comment I do not have a comment on this work place. any further questions can be directed in interview. non applicable
good,"Assembling complex military grade equipment"
good,Shipping Packages warehouse skills and managment was sub par and my co workers were great and the hardest part of the job was communication and the most enjoyable part being around co workers.
good,"Poor training; odds stacked against you."
good,"This company has a wonderful work life balance with a 9 80 work schedule and flex time.  It's nice to be able to control your own schedule when life happens, and not have to notify god and country of needed time off."
good,Management appears to be clueless in my department and seems to do nothing to address any of the issues that keep our department from being successful.  My co-workers are good people but overworked and frustrated that there is little chance to move up.
good,LM has a great mission with great customer. They also offer great career progression if you seek it. Business areas and programs differ amongst the company but work life balance can be great as well.
good,Overall good place to work. Great benefits. Great flexibility in regards to completing your weekly hours. 9/80 work week enabled a person to have every other Friday off which was great.
good,Love the hours. Still trying to move forward into a new paradigm of working. There is still a lot of old school mentality there.
good,"Good job with great benefits, when there's work the company is happy and so are the workers, its a great experience overall."
good,"I've been with LM for 15 years and for the most part it has been a good experience. However LM has a generation gap that inhibits the culture from catching up with Google and others. It is not fast paced like other organizations, but largely due to the history and nature of business."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to start a career, but it is very difficult to advance your career even as a top performer in the company due to the size and the processes that comes along with the size. I have been with the company for nearly 8 years, and have received the top performance ratings year over year, received multiple awards for performance, retention bonuses to stay, but cannot get promoted because I don't fit within a specified range of years needed for service. I have seen many people leave the company for the exact same reasoning. Unfortunately, they do not mind seeing younger talent or talent in general leave because of cost pressures and short term financial objectives."
good,Typical day at work was logging into all of my systems and being ready to get on the phone with all my systems up when candidates called in.  The importance of being prompt and ready to respond when my shift started.  Management was alright but not consistent always. My co-workers were helpful when they were allowed to be. Hardest part of the job was not being able to find the exact information when a candidate called in or thinking you really did give the correct information only to find out several days later that you did not.  Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to wear denim clothing due to no customer contact.
good,"You're just another easily replaced cog in the machine. Some have described it as a ""country club where work is done occasionally when we're bored"" and as ""an adult daycare center""."
good,Solid company. I need to leave due to relocation. They are currently unable to accommodate a position in my location. Pay seems to be less than market in my field.
good,Management poorly communicates expectations. Peer reviews can be damning even if inaccurate. Very abrupt repercussions seemingly out of nowhere.
good,"It was a great place to work, and I have no regrets about working. Management is so-so. The job itself is worth it to learn new skills and appreciate technologies."
good,Flexible schedule. Compensation and title do not accurately reflect level of responsibilities. Limited opportunity for advancement. Unsupportive management and HR.
good,Had a supervisor when worked there that intimidated and verbally harassed employees. Reigned with fear. A second program manager went ballistic over something I did and would not listen to my reasoning. Had some employees there who stepped on people to get to the top.
good,"Not a bad company to work for because it's surprising if people haven't heard the name before.  Lots of nice people and you can develop a sense of familiarity.  It seemed that where I was working, however, that while there was lip service to ""work-life balance"" it was only possible to advance by squeezing life out of work.  In essence: make work your life, or you won't do well."
good,"Issue solicitations"
good,My day to day activities evolve around incident response activities and vulnerability mitigation and detection. As well as using other security tools to improve the security posture of the network. Lockheed is a company that is willing to provide training and education to their employees which is one of the better benefits provided. While working at Lockheed I've learned the importance of good processes and procedures and the pros and cons of having them or not having them. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the  freedom to learn to use many different security tools and share the responsibility of utilizing those tools.
good,Good Pay and Job Benefits. Solid place to work. Management was located in another state. Have to be a self starter and problem solver.
good,The position is great! Coworkers are a fun group. Really dislike the commute due to inability to find a job in the same county I live in. I have been able to take many training classes. Had the opportunity to travel. This particular work group management completely against working virtually even though it would save space that is extremely needed now. Hardest part of job is the commute. Most enjoyable part of the job for me is the day to day duties. I really enjoy the job however my personal work/life balance is terrible and non existent due to the long commute. This is even after trying to start a van pool and looking for a van pool. Current family circumstances does not allow for moving closer at this time.
good,"Government contract with great pay, however, based on company the medical benefits are on par with fast food workers instead of high end salaried employees in my contract.  Job security was not there possible termination of contract yearly.  Biggest issue was over managing.  Too many managers with specialist leaving to where everyone was being micro managed and new requirements coming out with out any guidelines or goals to where nothing made sense."
good,"High paced environment which constant changes and multiple government customers.  Pay is ok, but to advance is hard."
good,"I enjoyed getting to work however, the overnights seemed to never end. I made good money so I stayed for a while."
good,25 years with LM...  Good company...but top mgmt. is hurting with current govt. contract budget cuts...employees are feeling impacts the most...
good,"Great work life balance. Advancement is limited. Enjoy my direct report team. Peer team strengths are not equal. Start at 0545-0600 leave work between 1545-1630. Company is located in a great area especially for kids. Management is very busy, meetings, and more meetings. Overall happy however advancement can be limited depending your department."
good,"Maintain and update project schedules"
good,"Been with the company a decade, and in that time they have been shrinking the employee base.  Older employees are hanging on until retirement because of the pension system, while new employees have little room for growth because most of the attrition is used to reduce head count rather than open opportunities for younger employees."
good,We are the first IT level of support. There's time were you need to support tool that you never heard of without any documentations. You find easy going people but also hard to deal with. Team and management are great.
good,Very challenging jobs in Finance and long hours often times (depending on location/program)
good,"standard large company pros/cons"
good,"This is a highly innovative corporation with product lines that are cutting-edge technologies. Engineering is the backbone of the corporation, and as a result engineers are the leaders of the company. However, within some of the operations-based buisness units, there is an overwhelming process-driven culture with a workforce that is divided between experienced workers of 25+ years and fleeting young talent. In this particular customer-first atmosphere, the government restrictions and bureaucracy are readily apparent, which diminishes creativity/entreprenuership and drives process compliance, not business efficiency or effectiveness. The stability of the company is comforting but sometimes breeds complacency and a stagnant culture. The benefits and support for the employee's needs outside of the workplace are some of the most attractive parts of the company. Family life is respected, and balance is encouraged."
good,Working for a very demanding customer Lockheed Martin makes the best of a difficult situation
good,This was a high-stress job that paid well but with a low daily quality of life atmosphere. Good people put into high pressure to achieve results without many of the necessary tools to achieve success.
good,Sometimes out of sight is out of mind when working at a location different from headquarters.....Good managers made a difference. Room for growth....is about who you know. But great benefits
good,Working at the client's site provides limited opportunities for growth and leadership.
good,Work on client site which was enjoyable. The most difficult part of my job was the long commute
good,"A typical day at work for me is scanning documents into our customers system so they can access them from any location. I have learned how to scan, sort and metadata documents. My co-workers are very friendly and polite everyone gets along we all work together to accomplish one goal."
good,Good place to work flex time customers are friendly management and co-workers like family if a problem accure we all solve quickly most enjoyable part of the job is when we pass 100% on audits.
good,It is a good place to work and begin your career. I learn alot everyday at work. Management is very perceptive. 
good,There is a lot to be proud of regarding the Company's products but the company is huge and this has drawbacks when it comes to promotions and advancement. 
good,"Learned VHDL, .NET, Cadence, Missile Systems"
good,"Have to work hard to stand out - if a big company is for you - Lockheed is a great company to work for. Good processes/procedures in place, but you can tell you are working for a much bigger ""machine"" and you are just one of 130,000!"
good,My day starts at 0600 and ends at 1500 between those hours I sit in a cubicle and wait for incoming calls. When I receive a call I' am queued by a audible tone through my headset. I deliver my opening statement then the client states their issue. Most of the time I have to decipher what the client is trying to say with follow up questions before I can even begin troubleshooting the issue at hand.
good,Depending on the position each job had different challeges each day with work and co workers. Hardest part of the last job was getting leads and coworkers help due to work loads and training each one carried provided them with limited time to assist in my training.
good,"Obviously, this is a corporate job so there will be processes and directions from management that don't make a whole lot of sense at times. But I can say, everybody (98% anyways) who works there is professional, intelligent, and tries to collaborate to get the job done, which is nice. My biggest complaint is how hard it is to get recognized via raises/promotions/etc unless you are into some ongoing self-promotion and networking. If you go in and do a good job, you will be respected, you will keep your job, but don't expect to excel your career for 10+ years. You'll be at the bottom level all that time. It takes years and some gray hair in most cases, to really be established there. It's just a culture thing. There are more and more exceptions to that but there is a lot of ignoring of the young at meetings here, shall i say."
good,"Worked on customer's site as contractor. Little interaction with Lockheed Martin supervisors or management. Contract ended, they cut me loose without any assistance with finding a new position. Received two weeks severance pay and shown the door."
good,Within this company I was given many opportunities to grow. Part of my degree was paid for by this company. I advaced and was provided many classes in which to ensure success.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a very good corporation to work for. The tasks were interesting and everyday something was learned. If you have engineering talent, self-motivation, are socially polished and high standards for the work that you produce than your career will excel. Lockheed had taken over a company that did not participate in upholding the same ethical values. As much as Lockheed had tried to merge the corporate cultures of the two companies, a large portion of the original company members had acted out in organized anarchy. Unfortunately this created an uncomfortable atmosphere, a whirlwind of unnecessary politics and as a result a decrease in product quality. Many changes have been made and hopefully Lockheed will continue to make changes to this particular site. If you are considering a position at this Lockheed site, be aware of the employees that are employed by Lockheed and the employees that continue to hold the values of the original company."
good,"As a Department of Defense contractor, my workplace was located in the customer's facilities. However, there were so many Lockheed employees that it might as well have been a Lockheed facility. The co-workers were easy to work with and, for the most part, everyone worked as a team with minimal stress or conflict."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a large company with many factions throughout representing aerospace, cyber security, technical support, and others."
good,"Nice people, comfortable environment, work is moderate to heavy depending on the time of month"
good,"Lockheed is a good stable place to work, but you won't get rich here unless you're an engineer. If you're in Finance/Accounting like I am, and you'd like to stay here for a long time, you need to start off working on a program. That makes moving around to other positions so much easier. They don't give out bonuses. And their average pay increase for the last 3 years has been 3.5, 2 and 1.5. Other industries are giving out 10% bonuses plus 5 to 8% increase."
good,"As a former Navy Sonar Tech, this job was wonderful."
good,"Benefits have gone up 2X in 5 years, vacation days have gone down, and raises don't keep up with inflation. Meanwhile, dividends and profits are at record highs. What more can I say?"
good,Advancement is achievable with tenure. Working hours were nice with every other Friday being a day off.
good,The biggest part of my day at this company is spent on site at the ship ensuring quality standards are implemented and upheld. I work with the task leader and government representive to review drawings strandards and requirements and to coordinate checkpoints for various tests and inspections.
good,Benefits covered under CBA with Lockheed-Martin. Classroom and simulator instructor training USAF special operations aircrew. Friction between management and union. Very difficult to move up and out of union. Fairly stable and secure job.
good,Classified Work
good,Lockheed Martin is an open door to those fresh out of college with a passion for satellites and the Department of Defense. The Lockheed Martin workforce is an excellent balance of all races and genders.
good,"The flexible work hours foster work-life balance.  It enables people to fit in family time as well as routine responsibilities (like doctor visits, etc.). "
good,"It's an ok place to work but the people I'm charge don't know what they're doing. Always disagreeing, never communicating. Free food and lots of down time."
good,"There is an ongoing feud between salary and hourly workers. It can be a bit tense at times. Not everyone is that way, but just be aware of the power dynamic."
good,"The work is very knowledge base and the pay is competitive.  There are good and helpful people working, but there are inconsiderate people.  There are times where you have nothing to do and times where you are running around trying to solve an issue."
good,Like any big corporation there is too much politics. Advancement within our department is very limited. Essentially you have  move to another department to get ahead. Their yearly reviews are a joke. as far as raises go they don't even keep up with the yearly cost of living increases.
good,"Slow pace compared to traditional commercial companies."
good,Lockheed has more exciting place to see and often to work that i with then any company i every seen .Good employees to work with and manger to work. Good benefit and Good environment
good,The people are very nice there but I feel like it's not a good fit for me. I am not used to working on such a large contract such as this one. For me I would be much more comfortable in a more property based job.
good,Great place to get a start in the industry. The pay isn’t the best starting out but the security and benefits from the company are great. It doesn’t take long to make great money.
good,Provided support for the DoD network infrastructure. Good environment to learn different take on networking and security procedures. Also time to keep up on certifications and learn new technologies.
good,"Greatly depends on what program is worked. Upper management had very little concern/interaction with lower employees on GPSIII, but the work is interesting. Multi million dollar equipment worked on is critical for military use, and very beneficial for civilian."
good,Free health screenings cafeteria on campus self evaluations were geared toward creative writing skills good clean shop newer equipment well maintained safe
good,"Job was easy... job was not challenging.  However, I did get to travel a little bit to places I've never been before.  I would work there again if they were looking for my skills."
good,Your experience will depend on the contract that you work on. If you get a contract that allows work from home then you will rate Lockheed Higher. This contract was a stressful help desk position. Overall i enjoyed working for Lockheed but not the contract.
good,"very great  place to work. pleasant atmosphere and great team. "
good,"Lockheed Martin is full of very talented people that make it an enjoyable experience to work there. The actual ""Intern experience"" that Lockheed put on was decent as well. This experience included brown bag lunches once a week with someone in management giving a lecture. These ranged from how to go up the corporate ladder, how to be a leader, how to build a resume, what are the different aspects of Lockheed Martin, etc. Occasionally they actual had lunch catered. Also since I was in the Colorado Springs office, all the Interns were taken on a day trip to the Lockheed Martin space headquarters. These were all very nice perks centered around trying to make the Interns feel welcome. There is a great chance of recieveing an offer from your manager as an intern since many of the managers treat the internship as an extended interview."
good,"The phrase small fish in a big pond applies well. You can expect a very structured raise schedule and good benefits. Just dont expect a lot of one on one training or management. There are some high profile and high dollar projects that Lockheed is involved with, but the bureaucracy that comes with a large company tends to hinder your direct influence over much."
good,Good Pay with decent benefits. However rumors of surpluses and layoffs tend to keep you worried about your job security. If you have good seniority chances are you will be ok.
good,It was a stressful environment because of the lack of manpower in the support departments. The labor union made it very hard for my department to move forward and to achieve the departmental goals we set. The foolishness that you will encounter is not worth the money they will pay you in my opinion.
good,"Performed compilations cash flow studies and financial planning"
good,Great place to have on your resume and nice benefits but management is lacking and much discrimination occurs there. Lack of promotions and the facility is only nice in one building
good,"Government contractor with a space mission focus.  For someone interested in aeronautical engineering or space system development, this could be a fine place to work."
good,"Lockheed would bid on contracts without a plan in mind to man them, and would have to pull staff out of corporate TDY to fill low level jobs till they could get new hires a clearance which takes for ever to do. "
good,Antiquated work environment will make it hard to keep skilled younger work force. The company is working through difficult decisions on where to move new business based upon long term affordability.
good,"Advancement opportunities are limited in engineering.  There is supposed to be a dual career ladder where engineers can either take the management path or the group technical staff path, but the group technical staff isn't universally available, especially if your manager is in a different engineering discipline."
good,"My program has a healthy, collaborative environment. We work a 9/80 schedule. It's easy to be able to take your vacation time. My coworkers are often open to helping and working together. Corporate management is a bit demoralizing and a lot of processes are still old and clunky."
good,"50 - 60 Hour Weeks "
good,I have worked for several companies and organizations over the years.  I felt the least connected working at Lockheed Martin.  Management was not very accessible.
good,"An extension of Lockheed Martin USA. "
good,Nothing bad to say other than I was only a temporary employee and as such there was a lot of uncertainty when it came to the future. That's all I have to say about that.
good,A place to see and enjoy the beautiful sunset and sunrise. Good people and a family career. I will remember all I learned and got to be part of from day one till today.
good,Its a pretty good job to work at there is a lot of Room for growth in the company and advancement. The building is very big and has alot of areas to work at.
good,"There is much backstabbing among management, very little job security. My department was better than others, but not immune to the problems. I would not work there again."
good,"Create, execute and manage consultant agreements and general service agreements, contracts and subcontracts, as required. Conduct capital expenditures, facilities and hardware procurement roles including development and review of RFQ and Statements of Work; support of on-site technical teams and negotiate existing and new contracts."
good,This company is a great place to develop the foundations of what can go on to be a very strong career in program management and planning. Absorbed everything I could while I was working here.
good,"Best benefit package I have ever had, but as is inherent with consulting, job security is low.  Project that I was assigned to had weak frontline supervision and the team members were less than supportive."
good,"Hire on for as much money as you can, because it is very hard to get a decent raise.  Benefits have declined every year for the last 10 and no sign of getting better.  Most sites offer a 9-80 work schedule for salaried employees, but if you are a higher level employee it is expected that you work a minimum 10% extra (4 hrs per week) unpaid.  Unspoken rule."
good,"This company treats you very well while you are employed with them, good work environment and relaxed atmosphere, my problem is having worked twice for them under government contracts and them losing funding for those jobs. As stated earlier they treat you nice coming in and while you're there, but on exiting this company, both times was treated very poorly and is if I'd done something wrong when the contract concluded or were no longer funded."
good,"I would say that working at Lockheed Martin could be a great place to work, Except there are way to many chiefs. "
good,"When I arrived for my first day of work my direct manager was unaware that he was receiving an intern. During the course of my 3 month internship I never worked with him directly. I was left to find task that I thought would help the company in some way. Overall, it was a lackluster internship."
good,Typical Beltway Bandit with its focus on military contracts.  Because it is such a large company opportunities for advancement exist plus if the contract you are working ends there are usually other openings in the company to be transferred to.
good,"LM is a great company with excellent benefits."
good,"I researched Lockheed for a business class and discovered that they have terrific leadership developing business plans and procedures, but they do a terrible job of decimating those plans down thru the company and many of the people making plans do not really understand how the production process is working or in many cases not working. The production management will just move the work schedule to fit the flow of parts instead of making sure the parts are meeting the production rate, this often means lots of overtime to fight the next fire that develops"
good,"Hardest part of job is Line of Site Tasking.  Customer is on site and sets priority daily. From this, you learn to be flexible and provide a faster turn around time.  But day to day tasks sometimes get pushed aside."
good,Job security is great. Work is interesting if you are on the right project. Sometimes you feel like just a number. Company doesn't often invest in their employees.
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to work. You will be engaged with the customer and also it is all hands on deck to get any problem resolved. A great work environment for entry level and senior level candidates.
good,"A typical day was trying to learn what exactly the client wanted done.  It changed often.  I learned Fastdata, STARS, FMF, FMS funds.  The hardest part of the job was not listening to the arguing that went on often between the co-workers.  there was a lot of opportunities that I wanted to learn but was unable due to contractor/federal rules."
good,"The facility in Owego has a lot of benefits, including an on site gym.  I learned a lot about quality assurance and the workings of mail processing machines.  The location was not the best fit for me."
good,"I don't like to talk bad about jobs to any other jobs. All I will say, is that I willingly put in my notice and left. I couldn't see myself becoming what I saw around me. I will say that I learned a lot about what I could accomplish, since I earned employee of the month 2 times in one year, and was the 1st to earn it on our team."
good,Very flexible schedule.  Every other Friday off.  Not a lot of upward mobility after a certain level.  I'd recommend working here for the experience but not planning on spending your career here.
good,"good work/life balance"
good,"Flexibility with work/home balance was supported. Difficult to promote within department. Enjoyed working there, built many life long friendships. Education assistance program is excellent."
good,"Lockheed Martin provides great benefit options to employees and works on a 9/80 work schedule. This allows you to take every other Friday off, which has been extremely handy to run errands and get caught up in my personal life. My biggest concern with the company is that they don't seem to be concerned with an individuals advancement. There are programs for leadership and to help employees, but even those in the programs don't seem to see a benefit. It appears to be a flawed system that doesn't reward those most deserving. "
good,"I had to ensure the protection of classified documents."
good,Worked 12 hour shifts. People were all professionals. I was able to learn other technologies. I was able to work with other highly educated technicians at my job.
good,The culture is very supportive and receptive of a work/life balance within the company. The only drawback is the salary and compensation.
good,Learned data entry at a fast pace. Enjoyed working with others in a tight worked quiet work space. Never ran out of work. A lot of people working in the room. Management walked around to make sure we were typing at all time. Was a different experience compared to working independently.
good,"Detailed oriented work which required attention to detail and focus on the work at hand. The enjoyable part of the job was working with highly skilled individuals whose main goal was to produce quality product in a timely manner,"
good,"Overall LMCO is a great company to work for, they are very cooperative with work life balance, ethics and overall customer satisfaction are their goals."
good,"Typical work day generally structured by individual employee. Most enjoyable part of the job were technical assignments and interfacing with co-workers. In most cases there is no micro management. Heavy pressure on workers to do quality work, adhere to schedules and control cost. Unfortunately management is very heavily influenced by their political standing and do not adhere to those principles themselves. Organizations are very stove piped leading to very poor and generally uninformed decisions."
good,LM is a decent place to work but there was too much process for me to feel like I was making a difference from an engineering perspective
good,"I've worked for LM for over 10 years. I think it's a solid company to work for - when there is work. However, in the lean times, the company tends to sort of let you figure out your next project on your own."
good,"Being heavily dependent on government contracts the work and culture is very cyclic.  Your experience varies from project to project and the make-up of the management team.  What doesn't vary is the brilliant, dedicated minds you get to meet and work with who truly strive to deliver the best possible products."
good,"A typical day at work keying in address ."
good,"During my sixteen year career at Lockheed, I had several opportunities to advance my career.  The complex problem solving and team work was enjoyable."
good,"the hardest part of the job is the high standards"
good,"I enjoyed the job and pay, but always unsure if we would gain or lose a contract."
good,Good place to work. The defense industry can be a rough place to work because of all the government cut backs.
good,A great place to work with a focus on providing many opportunities for the new engineers and those in their mid carrier
good,"Review work orders completed on second shift.  Review Engineering changes and present to customer,  Attend morning meeting to get status of work being completed and future work,  Review and signoff drawings.  Manage all communication logs are correct and push towards closure.  Visit vendors to inspect incoming parts.  Inspect work being done on aircraft and make sure it is to the drawing.  Do process reviews.  Work any issue that come up during the day that stops production.  Do root cause on non-conformance issues.  Interview mechanic to help solve issues.  Process non-conformance through Material Review Board.  Attend Engineering Review Board meeting.  Present work orders the DCMA for final buyoff.  Assist other Quality personnel with their task."
good,Must have a strong well to work along side the military.  Very demanding and stressful environment.
good,"Very productive environment, learned lot of technical things. Good team to work with."
good,"Pretty good company to work for at one time but salaries are low in comparison to other companies in Northern Virginia.  Very high turnover in personnel - somewhat of a 'clickish' environment."
good,"This is a large corporation, which makes them very impersonal when it comes to it's most valuable asset- it's employees.  Job security is very low, but that is to be expected when your customer is the Government."
good,Free Breakfast and lunch. The people there are very friendly. Also get free tickets to the stock show and state fair every year
good,"Great place to work, I will recomend everyone to work here. The people that work for them are great"
good,Loved woking with the military hardware. The people did a great job. management was fair to all.
good,"A typical day is one of total support to the mechanics, plumbers and electrician in aircraft final assembly.  Departmental supervisor was good to work with but overall company management is very disassociated from the workers.  Most training is OJT and left up to the employee to figure out.  Co-workers were good, helpful and concerned people.  The hardest part of the job was just to keep up with the volume of work and to find time to learn new aspects of the computer systems.  Most enjoyable was the association with the aircraft assembly crews and the sense of contributing to the defense of our country.  And our men and women in the service of our country."
good,"I've worked on my current team for almost 3 years, and the first year and a half was great. Unfortunatly my team leads ego started growing and she became an office bully. My PM is a people pleaser and doesn't really care about the team issues as long as the customer is happy. Since the customer loves the office bully...I just have to deal with the situation.I have had the pleasure of working on other teams. Which were great experiences and shows that it really depends on who you work with. The other team I supported had talented people, and great team lead and a decent PM. "
good,Nice place to start career. Better benefits than most but expect less pay.
good,Good company to work for with some life/work balancing benefits such as flex time and tellecommuting.
good,Good company just going thru changes for adapting to current ecomony crisis
good,Hardest part of job: fear of change from top executives and lack of training
good,good for entry level. little opportunity for promotion. Little recognition
good,Writing dBASEIII software in proividing available supplies and tracking their inventory supplies for our Navy Client.
good,"The hardest was different weather if working outside, but could do it."
good,Good work life balance and there are always works to keep you going.
good,Lockheed Martin offers acceptional benefits to the employees offsetting any health costs deducted from their payroll. The company endorses a family-style environment for their 16K employees at the Ft. Worth plant.
good,"A great professional environment but it was a lacking a decent working culture and value system. The turn over rate was high and seemingly on the rise.I did learn a lot about the prefessional environment as well as invaluable experience in the field of project management,"
good,Overall the is a good company for an opportunity for advancement in the aviation sector..
good,Well managed R&D. Did a lot of independent work. Work was well received.
good,"Opportunity to use skills, developed through the years and various nuclear power plants, was encouraged."
good,"Daily experience focuses on a broad range of responsibilities, Specialize in administrative and purchasing operations with an emphasis on management of accounts. Additionally, I support several off site programs and human resources. Regularly communicates with customers and suppliers."
good,"The job has it's good moments but at the same time the job is about seniority. Unfortunately, the senior personnel at times do not produce leaving a lot of work for those who have little time in service. The union is supposed to help but they work more for the individuals who have a large amount of years in service. There is not age limit of any one working there, which at times causes problems"
good,A typical day at work is very demanding but enjoyable.
good,* very very boring
good,Above average culture. Lower compensation. Location and team flexibility is limited as a SW developer.  Company doesn't promote working from home. Face time seems more important than deliverables.
good,"I was a contractor at Lockheed and being a contractor, the pay was excellent.  I had to drive 1-1/2 each way from and back home.  If I were hired, the salary would have been about a 1/3 of what I was earning."
good,A typical day at work was on your own thinkin on feet dealing with customers needs mission mod work electrical and electronic work soldering and good house cleaning
good,"I was part of a program that required a top secret clearance. They trained for this new position, however once the program was in jeopardy of being lost the work has been postponed and my education level placed me at manufacturing work which I don't care to be in."
good,Typically troubleshoot and repair various equipment down to a component level. I learned to troubleshoot and solder with on the job training. Our Program manager was very short sighted but my direct manager was awesome! The most enjoyable parts of the job were several travel opportunities and working on projects that impact people's lives.
good,A good stepping stone but the promise of promotion fell through.  I was not told in advance that I would have to drive over an hour to a new location if I were to ever want the promotion
good,"Lockheed Martin is a fantastic company. As long as you do not work in IT. They don't market, value, or appreciate their IT department. In my time there any training I received was largely paid for out of my own pocket unless it was specially required for my job (see 8570 certifications). "
good,"Positive cultural changes are happening such as increased ability to telecommute.  Like most everything else at the company, changes and improvement occur at a glacial pace."
good,Worked in a work load varying environment under the SBIRS contract.  Lock Heed Martin is a very Large and acquiring more and more contracts each year in a wide range of fields.
good,"Great place to start your career and have on your resume; however, advancement is limited and the workplace culture is discriminating to women and minorities."
good,"Great company, one that you would want to retire from.  Hated the uncertainities though that came with working on a program that was federally funded.  I was laid off after working with the co for over 8 +yrs due to contract termination.  "
good,"Lockheed Martin is a company engaged in leading edge technology in a very competitive industry for a challenging customer set. The work is always varied and interesting and the culture reflects the challenges of the industry and customer set. There are many ways to advance if you are willing to make the commitment and step up to the challenges. After a point in advancement, the demands on work/life balance move significantly toward work.  If you are up to the challenges, the work is very rewarding."
good,Lockheed used to have a good health care program but it’s recently been changed and is now useless. Might as well not have insurance unless you have a major problem.
good,"Manageble work hours"
good,Lockheed has a great work life balance. I learned a lot about Software engineer during my time spent there. I learned that developing software and software engineering are 2 totally different disciplines. The group I worked for software architecture was well thought out.
good,"Hired for a position that did not exist upon hiring. Eventually laid off."
good,My job is focused on working with other engineering teams to solve problems and to improve the product.  I like learning about the different parts of the aircraft.
good,Great work life balance with 9x80 work schedule and opportunity to telecommute when needed. Need to get with the times and provide more opportunities for growth for young employees.
good,"It is a job in Corporate America. There is nothing particularly bad. "
good,"Ideal company to work for if work life balance is what you seek in your career.  Management is not overbearing with respect to deliverables but occasional 100 hrs will be expected during crush time.  I once worked 27 straight days, 16 hr days to get through single line flow; the OT was fabulous that month."
good,"I was a Security specialist, EMT, Fireman on the facility. I was with NASA and this was rewarding. I felt like the rotating shifts were very hard on me and I went to school and became a RN."
good,Challenging rewarding work but the management structure is bloated.  Even thoug we work with cutting edge technology the management is behind the times.
good,Lockheed Martin is a very well know highly regarded company to work for.  Salary and advancement opportunities are great. Management are knowledgeable
good,"The work atmosphere is great.  Its the management that gives the environment a stale odor.  The case workers love their job.  Management is consistently placing limits of them so that there is too much demands.  Therefore, not allowing sufficient time to provide adequate services for the disadvantaged."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work and also has good benefits."
good,Company does not advance many except Brown noses. Also very cheap. Great people though. Also free lunches from time to time. Will string you along
good,Large DoD contractor with plenty of talent but culture of complacency. Potential for advancement within the company if you're willing to relocate. Company is in transition after leadership changes in the previous few years. Company doesn't offer many employee benefits compared to industry competitors unless you were with the company prior to 5 years ago.
good,"good place to work, the work life balance is great.  because of where I work, advancement is not likely on this program.  I would recommend positions with Lockheed Martin to anyone."
good,Love to work on spacecraft. They don't know how to keep people between contracts but there are a lot of good/nice/decent people working there.
good,"People were great.  Had a great time.  Constant reorganizations.  Management was great.  Salary was good, company training was the best."
good,"A typical day was preparing and executing milestone charts, attending program office meetings.  Worked towards attaining fiscal year goal of $40M in cost reduction budget by monitoring program monthly performance and communicating with Department of Navy customers as well as executive leadership  I learned how contracts are determined and vetted before executed. The management was over worked with long hours so I would offer to assist on special projects that needed timely completion. I got along well with all my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was working around the challenge of budget cuts. The most enjoyable part was identifying performance gaps on certain projects by facilitating structured improvement activities."
good,"Go to work, do your job and go home.  Not a lot of communication like there should be.  No advancement unless your a friend of a friend."
good,I liked the jobs that I did.  Coworkers were ok as-well.  Just needed to advance  within the company after so many years and never got that opportunity to do so.  Decided after last contract was over I would move on.  Now looking for a new job.
good,Enjoyed every minute of it.  Who else gets to work in the space industry?
good,everything about this job was great. and good coworkers fun to work there
good,Extremely poor salary compared to other local defines companies.
good,Great people.  Fufilling work but too far from family so I moved back to MD.
good,"A typical day at work is full of data analysis in Excel and Access, Strategically influencing Leadership decisions. I am learning how to present reporting data in a compelling way to the customer"
good,"Good company, not great, could make a career here, but not for me"
good,"There are no typical days, not that type of environment.  Must compete with other companies on a daily basis to win Govt and Commercial Satellite business.  Must be able to multi-task, have good communication skills; computer skills.  What I learned with dealing with suppliers you must at all cost drive the suppliers to closure and establish rapport.  You must manage the suppliers daily and hold them accountable.  My co-workers I enjoy because we are helpful to each other.  We all have our strenghts and weaknesses but come together as a team to help out and close out tasks.  Negotiating the contracts, nothing is boiler plate, terms and conditions, working with a variety of internal players.  Most enjoyable part is the international suppliers, learnig how they do business, each country is different."
good,Provided a great introduction to real world engineering for new college greaduates.
good,Softworld/Lockheed Martin - Contract position that was not as hands-on as I wanted it to be. Great people to work with but not enough web design/development work to keep my busy mind at ease.
good,"A good, not great company that pays as well as anyone in the D.C. area."
good,The best part of the environment is the opportunity for different types of work.  The place is great for exploring different types of work and the managers work to put people in an area they want to work.
good,"Windows 7 migration. Migrating 50-75 workstations from XP to Win 7 a night. Resolving migration/desktop support issues. "
good,Retaining talent may be the most difficult thing LM has to do.  Advancement and compensation is done with a military-esque approach where time invested outweighs performance.  From my experience (I work in operations on a customer site) this is a perfect job for entry level employees and late career individuals.  I find at times many are under worked and overpaid.  
good,"The culture of the firm is closely related to ones personal values. Highly productive work place, work and fun are mixed together for competitive reasons."
good,"Good place to work but it depends on what program you're supporting. Some programs are run better than others and if you support LM directly, the overall work experience is pretty good."
good,"Great opportunity! I was able to send soldiers to/from Iraq, I was responsible for setting up their insurance(TRICARE), medical tags, dog tags, etc. for in/out processing, cross trained in other HR departments"
good,"Working with a great and talented group of engineers from all kinds of backgrounds. I've worked with software, systems, communications, mechanical engineers."
good,"Sometimes had to displace lunch and break times due to schedule requirements but was always fairly compensated. Most of the management was well organized and prepared, especially my immediate supervisors."
good,"Great company to gain experience, but does not compensate older employees vs the newer employees coming in. Using older technology stack for development, but still follows the agile and newer design ideas. Great experience to interact with a large scale development effort."
good,"I worked as a contractor under Lockheed Martin that was run by us government (USSOCOM) and it was difficult for the team to adapt to the changes because they happened way too often. There was always change in leadership with the military that when you set yourself up to do great things, there would be a change in command and the rules would change and change the ways we conducted our work."
good,This particular job at times consisted of a lot of hurry up and wait.  As site protection officer my main duty was to check ID and assure that no classified material was leaving the building. So between shift changes there was not much to do.
good,I actually worked for Martin Marietta before it merged with Lockheed in 1995. The teamwork among the Executive Secretarial staff was outstanding. The two Assistant Treasurers I supported were good at informing me of what they expected of me and acknowledging me when I performed well. They also handled my errors with understanding and retraining.
good,My position afforded me the opportunity to learn new things and take on and develop skills outside my comfort zone. I had a great immediate supervisor who took good care of me.
good,If you manage to get into a good department then you can do fantastic and have a great time with some fantastic people who are brilliant. The downside of course is a poor compensation package and poor upward mobility.
good,I was working 8 hrs a day. I learned a lot while working with Lockheed Martin. It really improved my translation and interpretation skill. Interpreting in teach back class was the critical part of this job.
good,extremely long hours at times but the people you get to meet and work with are top notch.  meeting every deadline though tough at times made it exciting.
good,"A typical day at work included a lot of time speaking on the phone, emailing or instant messaging customers about their invoices.  I had specific timelines on which invoices had to be submitted to specific customers and the amounts had to be exact.  I typically dealt with millions of dollars of invoices per week, and the volume at times was a lot to handle.  My co-workers were the most enjoyable part of my job. Everyone was extremely friendly and liked to joke with one another, my boss included.  He was very fair and allowed us to take time off if we needed it.  As long as the work was done and done correctly, we were allowed to have a comfortable atmosphere.  The least favorite part of this job was the difficulty of moving up within the company and the constant threat of layoffs looming over everyone's head.  I learned a lot about billing and invoicing and programs such as SAP, Peoplesoft, Microsoft Access, MS Outlook, more things I previously didn't know about Excel, Adobe and Nuance."
good,"If the finances were there , this could have been a very successful business.  Enjoyed training , and achievement."
good,"Under this company I gained experience in document controls.  The pay was exceptional, but job security was a downfall.  Most of their work is contract based from my experience, so as long as there is work, there's a job."
good,"Great work life balance with telecommuting, flex schedule, etc."
good,"Good company to work for, very busy and stressful at times, however lacking a bit in structure and organization in my experience. There seems to be a different ERP system for every location which in tern makes it difficult it is not all uniform. Great people."
good,A very clean and organized company to work for. Most managers had previous experience in aerospace. Good employees. Overtime wasn't forced. Did not have to work a minute over 40 hours if you didn't want to. Plus overtime was double time after 48 hours.
good,"First, I will say that I really liked  a lot of the people I worked with.  Made some good friends there."
good,"Good company with focus on employees with flexible work schedule. Three day off weekends every other weekend and opportunity for overtime, but overtime is offered on a list to make it available to everyone, but it is not required to take it when it is offered."
good,"Unfair expectations within your work requirements. Meetings that waste time. Stress that is unnecessary. Focus on the wrong issues, people that get paid too much and do less."
good,Was a good place to intern. Slow environment and feels like a jail. Did tons of excel for my position. Food was good. Benefits are great. Keeps employees for a while.
good,"Good place to work for regarding benefits. Learned a lot from this company. Very demanding at times, but it balanced out when work flow was slower."
good,Good place to work. The coworkers were nice and very helpful. The supervisors were competent. The company cares about its employees
good,"Very large company, diverse atmosphere, benefits, procedures is basically the same as any other company.  main goal for every employee to keep in mind is team work, and end result is to support the mission."
good,"I started with Lockheed Martin in 1995.  Back then it was a great place to work but like many companies today, they get greedy and start thinking more about money then about their workers that make them the money.  They started getting way too many Managers and not enough workers.  I left on good terms but if things are still managed the same way today, I would not go back."
good,The company is too structured and unwilling to entertain change.
good,"Lockheed Martin was a good place to work and retire from but the old Lockheed Missiles and Space Company was much better and I would have given that company 5 stars across the board. Prior to Lockheed's merger with Martin Marietta, LMSC valued and made use of a wonderful synthesis of people with diverse backgrounds, specifically ex-military with hands-on experience and degreed engineers. After Martin Marietta came into the mix, the old Lockheed was dead and was replaced by a very PC environment that valued a 22 year old kid with a degree in music or basket weaving over an ex-military person with decades of experience dedicated to the defense of the US...this was a shame because along with the devalue of hands-on expertise, there was a significant loss of the esprit de corps and collaboration that was based upon contractor-customer trust; the trust went out the window and pursuit of profits by the corporation became more important that deliverables that reflected a sensible calculus of cost, schedule, and technical performance. I am not a bitter LM retiree but along with others, I saw the change: a really great company devolved into a good company once Martin Marietta's values replaced LMSCs."
good,"Run and print reports, Mail reports, Answer telephone, Input information into IMS system. I learned to used ten key. management were supportive. Co-workers were team players. Hardest part was end of fiscal year. what I enjoyed the most was that we got along."
good,"Smart methods applied to builds,"
good,The company is a very fun and productive workplace to work at! Management works with you in a very highly respectable manner. The co-workers work in team unit one strategy effort to get the work done in a reasonable amount of time. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with all the layoffs. The most enjoyable part of the job was the duration of me being employed with the company.
good,I loved everything about my JOB except the shift(2nd) I was on. I didn't have a life to myself and I hardly had time to spend with my family. Other than that it was AWESOME.
good,"I enjoyed my career with Lockheed martin."
good,"The implementation of logistics support system and the management of an Oracle database required for that process. I learned that the personal and professional resistance to change is common and difficult to overcome. This exists despite the fact that the work of those making the changes will improve the organization. The management was very good. He shared his intentions and his actions were correct on face value. He remains the best manager I have worked for. With the exception of one who maintained a  desire to manipulate others, the remaining co-workers were excellent. Explaining technical issues to those with no technical background. It’s not difficult for those who accept to the changes for the expected value of the new system. For those with very little technical experience rarely listened to an explanation and used it to support more resistance to change. A manager with limited technical background who did not question that my recommendations and decisions were correct."
good,good place to work except job security is always in question
good,"Great location, technological expertise in a multitude of areas from hardware and software components. Great amenities."
good,"Upholding this position gave me mediocre discipline towards my career in the Aviation/Avionics field. Even though it only consisted on dealing with aircraft parts, overall the temporary position was decent."
good,Good Flexibility Work Hours.  The work can be fun and challenging however the company does not appreciate their employees.  The company needs to value their current workforce more.
good,"Overall not a bad call center. Unfortunately this division was sold to another company. I had a wonderful boss. HR and upper management were okay. They didn't take into consideration peoples needs. I got an occurrence  for calling in to go to the emergency room after a car accident. I had photos of my totaled car and paperwork to prove I was at the emergency room. I had bruised ribs and a sprain. Per HR the emergency room was not a valid reason for them to void the occurrence (if you get three occurrences you get fired). My boss even tried to get them to waive it, but they wouldn't."
good,"Working for the Union, it doesn't matter the amount of effort you put in. There are no advancement options, short of senior individuals retiring or dying. If you want to advance through hard work and dedication, the hourly union work at LM is not for you."
good,"The Lockheed Martin facility in San Luis Obispo has a sketchy future and terrible management reporting to Owego, NY and overall disfunction.  I would recommend finding another company with mature organization and brighter future."
good,"It really depends on your team.  in my team I tried to minimize meetings, and just ensure I was available to support the team.  This is not typical.  I found that people seemed to discuss more than do."
good,"A Field Engineer at Lockheed deploys, on average, more than I did as a combat unit Marine.  The job is satisfying, but the work pace is un-nerving.  Overall, if you are single this would be a great opportunity."
good,"It was easy to become stagnant. The work environment was individualized vs. team environment.  No one was willing to share information, even if it was for the good of the company."
good,If you think bigger is better then LMCO is for you.  Good benefits and pay.  Excellent computer systems and facilities.  Great learning experience.
good,"Great company with great potential to be continued leaders of inclusion efforts. However, there are good number of  people leaders who are risk and conflict adverse. Classic example of culture eating strategy alive."
good,"The company is good but the when I was there the Management and big boss were very unprofessional and favored people big time based on race. Now the company has new management that I've heard. Hours worked every day was 9 hours but the scheduling was horrible, you did not have a say in that; it was either work the schedule given or go home. Pay received was $14.00 if worked the full 40 hours per week. Co-workers were very judgemental."
good,"Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is a challenging place to work. During a typical day, there are four to eight meetings to attend, action items to complete a projects to manage. The culture of the Company is undergoing a large transformation using the principles of ""Culture of Accountability"". While the program implementation is  still in its infancy, the direction is promising. The funnest part of the job was working in cross functional teams on process and product improvement initiatives. The hardest part of the job was reporting to an upper management without product knowledge."
good,Only reason I'm leaving is the plant is closing down and my position is moving out of state. I've worked here for 6 years and would have stayed another 10 if I could.
good,The culture is changing and it's a work in progress. There is a good ole boy system in place and it's slowly being chipped away. Management is making great strides thanks to upper management. There is much left to be desired. Professionalism is needed amongst employees.
good,A had a good boss and the others in the group were great as well.
good,I was very pleased with the focus of the company. The attitude to superior product for our customers was very reassuring.
good,"A typical day at work involved starting with an inventory of all issued equipment before taking over as ""Duty Armorer"". After taking over as duty armoer I would issue weapons and ammunition to sailors and DOD Police, accurately recording all equipment issued and returned. After issuing equipment, I would proceed with cleaning and inspecting all assigned weapons for defects. Any defects were reported and the weapons would be returned for repair or replacement."
good,"I was  a consultant contracted by Lockheed Martin to read and evaluate grant applications for the Department of Juvenile Justice.   I believe I  participated in 3 reviews.   Unfortunately the last time I was asked to participate in a peer review I was unable to and have not been contacted  since.  "
good,Looking for an opportunity that is more stable and is local here in the douglasville area that has professional challenges and room for career growth.
good,Opportunities are few if your family isn't in corporate already or friend of family in upper management was very excited to work there at first at about 2 years my 2 year anniversary to be exact I needed to take a day off and left work early may work out better for others you should always try for yourself
good,"No concrete direction from management on a daily occurance at SIKORSKY, 3 supervisors, 6 crewchiefs, 3 managers on the same shift, and everybody had a different understanding of what the objectives were and in what order was the priority,a really confusing environment"
good,Pay was low for location I was located in and management was terrible consistently micromanaged never a dull moment. I’m no longer with Lockheed as we were sold off to another company.
good,Lots of times leadership will address problems without care or do what they can to pacify an employee concern.  When customer makes threats company pretends the employee  doesn't exist.
good,"There are a lot of opportunities - but sadly a large portion of them are only available if you work on the program side of the house and not in functional.  It was VERY common for people who had worked there less than 10, or even 5 years, to have people who had been there decades under them.  Seriously, the only way to make it in this company is to work on a program."
good,LM is a very fast paced and aggressive environment.  There are vast number of opportunities for individuals that are willing to relocate to different areas of the country.
good,Although it was only temporary it was a good experience. Met new people. Worked downtown. Got to help people with customer care from all states in the U.S.
good,Company became very competitive and political in management in recent  years.  Management slow to make decisions and quick to point fingers at each other.  Rarely listen to employee input.  Culture needs some work!
good,"Enjoyed working on Air Craft and the ""getting the job done"" but felt job security and the Pay scale was behind. The promise of a retirement package that never came about was the reason I left to go to work for BMW would have loved to finished out working on Aircraft"
good,"Worked from 6 am to 2:30 pm. Did punch a clock The work was at times interesting, but mostly monotonous. The benefits were very good ( doctors, dentists etc. ) because we had a decent union. Made a lot of good friends."
good,I went to work at LM in Moorestown in 2004 before the economic crash.   Back then it seemed pretty decent with respect to overall quality of life.   It was only a facade that would become more apparent as the economy sours.   The place I worked was extremely insular and inbred with good ole boy politics.  I put up with having my work stolen and rated poorly by the same coworker that put his name on my work.   When I confronted management they said I didn't understand the concept of teamwork.  Seriously.  There was a core group of people that were already there forever and they are going to be protected no matter what.  I was in the latter group and kicked out the door in the earliest layoffs.   The union is a company union that enjoys special perks like guaranteed good reviews and high raises (since raises correlate with the reviews and there's a quota of bad reviews that must be written) every year no matter how much or how little they do.  LM does pay well but be prepared to put everything else in your life on hold in times that they need you to work.   Other than that it was good while it was good.  Have an exit plan.
good,"The work environment was very stressful at times but you work through it and move on. Constant dead lines and working with contractors that you learn from them and really know what to look for in a QA check. I learned to be more responsible, patience also know when to put you foot down and stand by what the documents and standard items inform you."
good,"Work here depends on government contracts. As contracts come and go, people come and go. The management is nice enough. You may be expected to travel overseas, to some not so nice places."
good,"Started in 2006 when it was still Keystone. best place I ever worked .It was still good to work there after Sikorsky took over. but didn't last long . Manager and H/R work hand and hand, leaving  employees with no where to turn with problems, forcing people to leave went you didn't do what they wanted. Like going against others. Very unethical"
good,"The pay is good and steady, my boss is a great guy, but its pretty boring, and its really difficult to get promoted or transfer."
good,Pretty Busy day taking calls 24.7 Typical call center great people to work with. I really did love working at this terrifiic call center.
good,"In Afghanistan on yearly Contract"
good,My typical day is to assemble sheetmetal parts per blueprint specs..  I have learned how to perform daily tasks of repairing and creating parts using various forms of metals and metal component tooling. Management is easy to get along with and flexible with scheduling and scheduling demands. The hardest part of my job is interrupting what tasks need to be performed. Best part of my day is when i complete a task on time and it functions properly beacuse I take pride in my work
good,"Relaxed work environment depending on the manager.  I have learned that you must move around in a company to obtain your highest potiential of promotion.  Have great co workers that are helpful and care about one another.  Hardest part of the Job is contract work , if the contract is lost , there is not much job security.  Most enjoy co-workers and relaxed comfortable work place atmostphere,  Learning new things and new experiences."
good,"Brilliant place to work, but you have primarily ex military in positions they have little or no directly related technical experience."
good,"My typical workday consist of Preventive Maintenance of 35 vehicles to include power generations equipment.  I pretty much manage myself but currently share a work space with 2 other contractor from a separate company.  I have most learned that everyday brings something different and must remain a team effort in order to keep the mission going.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the Bosses convinced of what it is that you do on a daily basis, and the most enjoyable part is getting to serve with the Soldier's, Airman, Sailors and Marines.  Just seeing the smile on their faces when a job is done correct is most satisfying."
good,Overall not a bad place to start a career. It has long hours and sometimes you do work with people that you cant stand. At the end of the week its all worth it for the pay check and life skills.
good,"Guarantees customer, engineering, FAA regulations and LM process specifications are met.Expert in manufacturing functions such as wiring harness build-up, installation, removal, repair and modifications for packaging (wiring and assembly) in-house instrumentation and modified vendor purchased hardware for F-35 platforms. Removed/replaced aircraft engines, engine components, flight controls & pneumatic components.Identified equipment, parts, tools and services required by specialist technicians. Accomplished aircraft jacking, towing, weight and balance, launch and recovery . Qualified in Intake and Exhaust Inspection, Wheel/Tire break down and build up procedures."
good,my co-workers were very enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was wiring and clamping in the tight spaces.
good,"Management too controlling to accept innovation. So, if you end up writing or making new processes, be assured you will get challenged, slowed down, bad mouthed, etc."
good,Company overall good to work for. The benefits are good and quality of life is not bad. There are lots of opportunities to learn and a overall a good mission.
good,The company is stable and unlikely to risk closure but RIFs follow government contacts and career growth is limited due to contract alignment. Salaries are average for the industry but salary growth is predominantly done by job switching.
good,I worked at Lockheed for over 10 years and still wish I did.  My primary complaints are relatively low pay and minimal opportunity for advancement depending on what your job function was.
good,"good people, nice atmosphere, clean and organized work area, short commute, adequate parking, good security measures, and great products and processes."
good,JD was an amazing area manager - but his son wasn't that great.  The customers were super rude and always felt entitled to whatever they wanted just because they worked for Lockheed.  I couldn't tell you how many times I had an angry (usually white) mother up in my face because I kicked her kid off the rides because her kid decided to stand up on them or jump off of them while the ride was going.  But they couldn't understand how much of a health hazard that was.
good,When nasa contract was up you won't have job. That said it was great source of chance to develop new and varied skills.. It was a feel good job because it was on moon shot project.
good,"Notable company with archaic mindset and compensation. With the level of responsibility associated with the position, the salary is not nearly enough to retain talent."
good,"This company provides great benefits, but was laid off and there was no work life balance. It was difficult to work being a parent and different children situations."
good,I had an excellent career for 6 years while at Lockheed Martin. The last year I was there was enough to ruin those 6 good years. It's a shame when someone who has no management experience is placed in a senior management role over such a large department and ruins it.
good,Great company from the outside but internally overworked and they expect you to be grateful just to be part of the company.  Compensation not that great compared to other DoD
good,I went out on work related injury but in may I missed two days cause my tundra lost its brake system and was taken to the dealer and it took two days notified the company and told them I would be in on wed and everything was find injury got worse dr took me out of work in june and got a letter in the of july saing they fired me
good,"Refused personal protective equipment by my supervisor in a toxic environment. Was not allowed a respirator and I got lung cancer from metal inhalation. The company terminated me and refused responsibility for their actions. I pride myself on dedication to my job and strive to succeed with the highest of work ethic. Lockheed Martin of Greenville, South Carolina only cares about military contracts and how to get them even if it costs their employees their health or life."
good,"Good environment to learn HR Executive Assistant work, easy going management, systems not exactly user friendly, co-workers easy going and great to work with."
good,The job was awesome.  The local management team needs to be fixed.  The current benefits package for the services division is less than to be desired for a company of this size and stature in the workforce.
good,Lacks work/life balance.  I do enjoy the fact that the work is very stable along with my job.  The location of the facility is in a nice area.  People for the most part are nice to work with.
good,"There are a serious job culture and everyone is under the gun and need to produce results. Although, one cannot always handle a problem, sometimes an outside consultant from Apple is required to fix them, but need to be careful with emails."
good,"A lot of the workers here have been in place for a long period of time and though the company is aware of this, they overlook success planning with mid-level career types and look to put the youngest stars in leadership roles well be they are ready to be there. They seem to court the youngest in their effort to be ready for a exodus that is not actually occurring by older workers."
good,I thoroughly enjoy working here & have considered myself truly blessed for the past eight years. Opportunities lie within management training & promotions.
good,Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for but they're going through a period of transition. Advancement is slow but offers good work life balance
good,The work was good but to much micro-managers. When you were left to complete jobs it was a good environment.  We completed them on time in most cases.  It became more of a circus at the end of the contract and no one from middle to upper management communicated with the people that did the work.
good,"Great company to work for they pay well, but they do lack leadership.  It is either constantly changing or poor overall.  The campus is improving and being built because they closed the plant in PA down."
good,Lockheed Martin has a very professional work environment and is a great place to grow and learn in your career. They invest in early career growth and make it a safe environment to learn.
good,Good work culture but not much advancement training offered or management potential for advancements within career at Lockheed Martin
good,Job security is bad and management is good to work for employees are good to be around and they work together. Lunches are good
good,"A typical day for me would be to review all escalated problem tickets that have been called in to our Level 1 helpdesk, transferred to Level II and ultimately transferred to Level III for resolution. I prioritize and make contact with the POC (point of contact) to be sure we have all of the updated information correct and begin advanced troubleshooting.  During the week I also work on testing any software changes that we may have to make to our core Operating System Image.  I test the changes in a lab environment, and then submit a formal CCB to our testing group who will make sure there are no conflicts with ALL of the other programs that we use (commercial off the shelf or COTS) and Specialty software written for and by SSA.  Once the approval is met, we implement these changes out into the field by way of Phase in groups, then ultimately into production for the entire WAN."
good,lay off here and there. like any company anymore these days. great work and good people to work with. good bit of overtime and pay pretty good for the area. learn a lot about quality and what a new assy should look like.
good,I would constantly work with a small team building the same part of the aircraft. Management were more concerned to have their area in charge were kept with low to no deficiencies. I basically grew my ability to blueprint reading and using other fine and precision tools.
good,"The department that I worked for gave me an opportunity to learn new concepts and be able to apply then within a short period of time, but due to the nature of the programs the job was not long term, and therefore, all employees starting knew that they were hired on a contractual basis."
good,"Bacause it is a defense contractor, you must be prepared for mass layoffs at a moments notice."
good,"Being the largest DOD contractor means there's a lot of red tape and bureaucracy. Career growth can be like watching paint dry & since the government has had so many cutbacks training is hard to come by, but if you are allowed to grow your knowledge and prove it with highly visible assignments there are career opportunities to be had."
good,My day started out fast paced and you performed steady work all day. We had breaks and lunch.
good,"Great co-workers and compensation."
good,"Great job, just the location and isolation is hard on family being deployed 6 months at a time."
good,Relaxed but productive work environment where I learned hands on international shipping & receiving regulations. Managers and co-workers were very hands on and helpful. The easiest job I ever had and interacting with  co-workers was the most enjoyable part of the job. 
good,Nice place to work. Co-workers are team oriented. Would like to be hired back if an  opportunity come along
good,Great place to work. They need better management training and more understanding of work life balance.
good,"Fast paced work environment, alot of regulations to perform daily job duties, such as signing out every tool from tool boxes everyday, Boxes need 2 person check and stamp before signing out tool. Location where tool is used is also required. Very time consuming."
good,I worked in a stress free work place but very informative and rewarding dealing with all of the customers.
good,I learned alot. I had great bosses and co workers. I restored military vehicles that were left behind and shipped back from combat to fully mission capable status. I enjoyed the challenges of determining what was wrong with the equiptment and getting it back to the unit.
good,"Definitely home of the Good Ole Boy club.  The work isn't that bad and neither are a few of the managers.   Definitely government contract work.  Progress is slow, basically selling ""man-hours"" to the government.   Not a high pressure environment at all.  The only real problem is the management staff.  Little product knowledge,  unrealistic ideas, and lack of respect for mechanics."
good,Could be fun place to work based on the business unit you work for. One of the cons here is that employees' performance rating is based on one person's input.
good,"Its not a bad place to work, but need more managers that are fair and better culture. There is plenty of favoritism and not enough managers looking to help employees grow in their career."
good,"Day consisted of 1-2 flights per day training AF crewmembers, always learned from what things were happening in the field and passed that on to other AF members"
good,Good technical company with traditional defense company view of government contract work. Very silod making it challenging to be collaborative at times.
good,"I left after 10 yrs bc I am looking for a career change and location change. If it wasn't for these 2 reasons, I would stay. But for these reasons, I said good bye. I am looking forward to my future though."
good,A good work environment.  A good place to learn how to deal with customer's needs and how to deal with a load of demand. A place that you can retire from. Overall a good experience.
good,"Good PCs, medium EPDM, manuals are provides with out dated references, some people are hired as Direct and they are sometimes not good employees. Some tell stories and lies about others to advance."
good,I really enjoyed the position. The job provided the  opportunity to learn many new things.  I had a good rapport with our team and the technical folks.  The company work/life balance was not practiced across the board. I new engineers who had worked there 25 plus years and were not given regular time off or paid any over time.
good,"I prefer not to work was good working with Lockheed employees was good. Culture was great "
good,"Great company with a ton going on - ability to move to innovative programs or large old CLS contracts.  I was having a blast in my career until I moved to the larger campus in south Denver - poor, poor culture, I was doing things as a Level 5, that I did at my old campus as a 3.  Plant is comprised of old Newtown folks that survived the plant shut down - but - brought that toxic culture with them.  Needs a management overhaul - VP down need to delegate, hold accountability and empower our junior employees."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my employment with Lockheed Martin, the culture of the workplace was very welcoming. Leadership was very involved and easy to talk to."
good,"Pros: Decent benefits, Room for advancement, Really big on Ethics and Diversity."
good,"working here compared to the company they sold us to was much better. They value employees, more than their competitor but will quickly sell the entire organization unit to the next company if it helps their bottom line. They do not like people jumping ship before they make them walk the plank, so communication on the long term future is lacking"
good,"It was a part time position I have worked for 3 years, It was a totally difference experience . I need my security clearance to work there . Checking cars at the gates and escort contractors entering the building. Great job ."
good,Great place for advancement if no favoritism is present.  There were a lot of different types of projects I was doing. I met a lot of people. Great opportunity.
good,Was a good job. All bench work. Good managers. Liked the people and the area but was away from my home and family and stayed in a hotel that was way to expensive. Left to come home and work. Worked in Kentucky and live in Virginia.
good,Interesting assignments.     Interesting missions.  Leadership development programs.           Benefits.  Good management.  Expect long hours at times.
good,"It's a government contracting company so if the administration changes there are layoffs - that's how i got RIF'd.  If you can live with the changing politics in Washington, it's a great place to work"
good,Building something and see it materialize into something special. Work was most important to have quality always. All the time spent working was a challenge to all. The culture was very nurturing to established processes.
good,The Management at Lockheed Martin Space is chosen by personal relationships and not by merit. This has led to a company that manages with inadequate skill and bad decision processes.
good,A lot of interesting work. Advancement and pay is lower as compared to others in the industry. Management was pretty typical I think. I had some good managers and some not so good ones.
good,This was a good company. The issue was the contract was not signed during the year of government shutdown. Too bad I spent my savings to relocate. Eight months later they laid me off. I was given a few weeks notice and a couple weeks severance.
good,"Good place to work, just operates on a lot of tribal knowledge. They need to have hands on trainers for training in some areas, before letting you loose to  do your assigned task. Some employees don't like training others because they have their own work to do. they take care of their employees in some areas, when it comes to sick days and off days."
good,"Early on was a rewarding place to work and grow skills.  "
good,excellent place to start a career - and relocate once you have gained experience - low cost production - limited advancement - good place for college grads
good,"My immediate supervisor manager was excellent, the higher management was very poor in their support of our facilities needs. difficult to advance or move up."
good,"we would come in and get an update of what was happening that day and if anything from the day before needed to be addressed."
good,They have great pay and offer all the benefits but get ready to fight for it.  Management gets shuffled around very frequently and that makes it hard to develop role continuity.
good,Lockheed Martin was great.  I only left because I wanted to move to Florida once my kids graduated school and it was just me and the dog.  Love the Tampa bay area
good,"big government contractor, with the typical contractor culture and job environment. decent pay, with no chance for new t.echnology."
good,"Lockheed is a good company to work for. "
good,It was a great start to my career and I gained a lot of experience. Management with Datrose was awesome. This was an Administrative contract working amongst other Lockheed Admins and there was a lot of inequality between the two companies.
good,Advancement is difficult.  It seems that hiring managers may be given resumes based on what the recruiters want rather than what the manager wants.  Had multiple internal/external posted jobs where the candidate was not contacted at all.  Verified by other sources that this happens.
good,"There are a ton of opportunities to learn and increase skillset with a variety of engineering disciplines.  There are countless mentors available to gain experience from.  The main downfall with LM is that they don't provide an incentive to retain talent.  Most salaries are far below what the person is worth and the amount of work they do. When people leave the company for better opportunities (which there are plenty), the remaining employees stretch to cover the roles and then that becomes their new norm, without a corresponding increase in pay.  The retention rates are abysmal and the merit increases barely account for inflation, even if you are a top performer."
good,"I would probably still be there if the two Job promotions that I was considered for, I actually had a chance to obtain. They just found temps instead."
good,"Performed risk assessment of CDC websites to determine if content has potentially harmful threat vectors. Provided for the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of CDC proprietary data, personally identifiable information and customer protected health information through the development and deployment of a secure network-computing environment. Maintained privacy impact assessments (PIA) on all CDC systems in accordance with the e-Governmen"
good,This location has talent and types of engineering activity that persons from any age group will enjoy. It was a good time helping others at this location.
good,"From my perspective, LM Aero is currently going through a change where they bring in the younger crowd.  They're expected to work long hours and to be more agile to change.  Their seniors it seems though are not as agile or quick to change.  They are stuck in the ""thats what we've done for this and that"" even when told its wrong by their customer."
good,Lockheed Martin is a decent employer. I have enjoyed working for them for many years. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see the finished product of your hard work doing what its supposed to do and doing it well.
good,"Lockheed Martin holds many government contracts.  I served as an Identity Theft Counselor with the Federal Trade Commission.  Do to the nature of my calls, 99% of my contact were of an adverse nature.  I would not suggest this position for any one that's short tempered."
good,"I enjoyed working with high-tech equipment that kept the ""WAR FIGHTER"" safe. It's a dangerous job but very rewarding. Nothing like helicopter rides at 3 a.m., going out on a repair mission."
good,"For me, the work kept me busy, as I never really knew where I was working.  There was a small group of folks who took lots of personal days, and I would cover where I was needed, sometimes several tasks at once.  I was always on time, ready to work.  I did not feel it was going in a direction that would be good for a career.  Overall a pretty gloomy place to work."
good,"Good projects, Upper Management was pretty bad and afraid to take any risks."
good,"Lockheed Martin has some of the best and kindest employees I have every worked with."
good,".If you began your career working in a main plant where LMCO is producing something, the sky is the limit.  There are plenty of talented and hardworking individuals to work with to have a wonderful career.  Conversely, if you've risen the ranks from the services side, this benefit is not as easily attainable.  The main plants do a great job of grooming their young talent to the detriment of bringing in outsiders to leadership positions."
good,"It a good place to work at, but as a Salary employee it's very difficult to get a raise or bonus, no matter how you saved them. You have to keep changing jobs to get a sufficient raise so you never become the expert at that job unless you stay with little raises. "
good,i enjoyed most of my time and the people i met at lockheed martin and learned alot along the way. the company was great to work for as a whole but my in house management was subpar and held us back alot.
good,"Overall I loved my job, my teammates and my management. The managers that I supported for the most part were great to work with. I learned something new just about everyday. The most challenging part of my job was people going to class as scheduled. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people and feeling like what I did made a difference."
good,I love the company and the hiring managers I worked with. I'd rather not comment on my direct manager. Salary was okay not as significant as I thought it would be.
good,"Worked 72 hour weeks on end, oftentimes virtual.  Work life balance is a great talking point, but difficult to live up to.  I enjoyed working here except for the middle management team."
good,"Work 9 hour days with only a 30 minute break."
good,Very large company so you can get lost with so many employees. But liked working with people from a variety of backgrounds. Very professional company. Very established.
good,The company is not a bad company at all.  I will admit in the beginning it was more of a family oriented company. The current location I worked at lost some contracts and did not pick any new ones up.
good,"I love working for the Customer offices, supporting the different departments as needed, especially the Subcontracts area."
good,High stress job. no work and life balance. Job security is very poor. Overall good company with benefits.No job advancement.
good,"I worked on many military programs and learned much about Systems Engineering.  Management was generally good, but I left after having conflicts with my supervision that wasn't addressed by management until I departed.  The co-workers were good to work with.  I enjoyed working on multiple programs,"
good,Be prepared to change jobs often.  See my statements below.  There are just too many units of this company to make an overall statement.
good,Challenging and aggressive work environment. Highly motivating work ethic.
good,"Greaty Company, many opportunities!  Some Travel needed but they accomodate to what is best for you and your family."
good,Been working computers and networking for 15 years.  Looking to upgrade and improve my talent and study new courses related to computers.
good,"Good place to work. International and domestic travel assignments. Opportunities to learn to repair,modify and maintain many different Sikorsky model Helicopters. The hardest is part of the job is being away from home for three to six months at a time. The management is top notch. The coworkers are helpful and easy to get along with."
good,Assisting Consumer resolve Identity Theft and Consumer complaints.
good,"fast paced environment"
good,"Led teams in multiple areas and disciplines from ground base radar, airborne, and under seas.  Managed assemblers and testers on builds to ensure on time delivery.  Supported all engineering build changes.  Promoted 6S, LEAN and all safety initiatives."
good,"Working with Engineers and other Technician, Learned a lot in designing PCB's and Cable fabricating.  "
good,"A full 12 hour day and seven days a week. What I learned was classified information. Management was as always is, just management. The co-workers were from all walks of life and social levels. The hardest part of the job was being gone oconus for up to 8 months straight. Most enjoyable part of the job was when it was finished."
good,"Create workbooks for operators so they may build the Electrical Harnesses."
good,"The work is very rewarding in many ways.  Lockheed provides a person an opportunity to contribute to ""something great"".  It is a very successful business that keeps its focus on shareholder and customer value."
good,A good place to hang out and use relatively new technology. Gone however are the days when LM (or any similar company for that matter) really does anything significant toward the education or improvement of the people on staff. Several levels of management seem to be examples more of the Peter Principle than of well mentored skill building.
good,Advancement has come to an almost stop. The company as a whole is solid.
good,"The work is easy, and it's a Chill place to work. It just depends on your manager."
good,"I learned to keep a nice clean workspace, enjoyed my co-workers company. Although I'm not working there anymore."
good,I learned who to manage people and conduct a meeting. LM people are the best people to work with.
good,the horseheads MDCC was a good place to work but the powers that be decided that it was not enough of a money maker. we will be closing the doors this dec.
good,Great place to start your career. Learn about the the corporate culture and working environment.
good,We have a great teaming atmosphere and work together to get the job done. Communication is critical. Team members cover for each other to ensure all tasks are completed correctly and on time. The hardest part of the job is the politics and working with external entities where simple tasks become unnecessarily complicated.
good,No ability to work remotely or a real work life balance. Pay was low and and there is limit opportunities for advancement since many midlevel managers ladder block those up and coming leaders.
good,"Good place to start a career out of college. However, the salary not competitive in Bay Area. Would recommend this company to those willing to relocate to other states."
good,"Nice work environment, people are friendly, are for the most part encouraging. Minimum amount of training, will require self determination, so be ready for that type of environment."
good,"A tipical day at work consisted of multiple jobs. Shop floor attendance was necessary every day to corrdinate with managers, supervisors, team leads and production/shop floor personal. I learned how rockets were designed and assembled such as the THAAD missel and Atlas 5 rockets. Management was very easy to to get along with which included workplace culture was very productive and interesting. Was not any hardest part of the job because I turn that into agressive learning and that was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I started this job feeling excited about the potential to learn a new aircraft but there is very little training. You get stuck on an assembly line doing the same jobs over and over."
good,"Friendly, often relaxed atmosphere. No one is ever too busy to help out each other.  Employees are encouraged to undertake further training to benefit their careers.  Flexible working hours with the option to work from home in certain situations.  Senior management are open and honest with employees."
good,Lockheed is a great place to work. My supervisors and managers were great and cared about the people working for them. The benefits are good too. They are not the best I have ever seen but they are still good.
good,"Our Clients at Lockheed provided us with a summer opportunity for Ascertaining how to value intellectual property. The exact nature of the research is confidential, but it was an engaging and fulfilling experience."
good,"fascinating company."
good,"Good company for career development.  At senior levels, life gets interesting.  Domain is awesome, but working for USG is extremely frustrating.    Good people, very mission driven"
good,Senior design collaboration with Lockheed Martin through NAVSEA. Intensive in composite and 3D printing of repair patches for airframes with a focus on minimizing weight and cost.
good,Providing expertise in the areas of track management and modeling in Rhapsody.  Mentoring junior engineers in Design aspects and provide road maps for future designs and functionality
good,"There were some limitations for tenure on contracts (mine was lost)."
good,"Management need to be more communicative,  better interactions with employee with upper management. Human resources well maintained and well informed."
good,"A good place to work, satisfying work, great co-workers, nice cafeteria and work atmosphere. The only issue was it was a Contract position with no job security after 12 to 18 months."
good,"Fun place to work... Team work is very important and have open conversation with managers."
good,There is a lot of potential at Lockheed Martin but it is very hard to move up. They will train you and give tuition reimbursement but you it is very hard to utilize the knowledge and build a career there.
good,"There are several great benefits that the company offers to all employees, including company match for the 401k, discounts to different vendors, and tuition reimbursement. Unfortunately it seems Lockheed Martin is more focused on contracts that perform development work, not so much for the operations and maintenance (O&M) contracts. We rarely receive funding for training, so developing required skills for newly delivered systems is typically done on your own time and money. The company also focuses on management career paths, either business or technical management."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to worked, good people,  pays was really good, lots of over time, its very consistence and you have to  take classes to be certified."
good,A very good place to work with great people and teamwork to complete various tasks. I was able to gain knowledge and share it as well with team members.
good,Considerate management policies with exceptional level of organized work structure. I believe the management could do better if the contract requirements permits.
good,"As good as you make it. quote from Sr. manager ""Don't expect to get rich working here anymore"" "
good,It's like any maintenance career field. it's a lot of work a lot of people you just got to find your play and get to work. It's no better or worse than any other company. At least not on the contractor side of the house.
good,"I worked for Lockheed martin as a consultant through IBM. "
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good place to start a career.  In the initial phases of your career, you are given the opportunity to work in different areas of the company and are extremely well supported."
good,"Spent the majority of time pulling data and sifting the data through Excel models which taught me a lot of live applications which we can apply excel formulas. Furthermore, I learned a considerable amount of Microsoft Visual Basic (VBA) earlier on when writing macros for the Excel models. Would have enjoyed learning more but my team had a lot on their plate (why they hired me) and much of the position required knowing Lockheed specific operations. Keeping expectations realistic I'd say that this is a good first step to take into the working world."
good,"You will be challenged and you will be supported. This is not a place to ""dabble"" in a career - you must be all in. Opportunities for worldwide travel while assisting our warfighters fulfill their mission objectives."
good,Positive and ethical workplace culture. True work life balance and many opportunities for career growth. Lockheed Martin is a really good company to work for.
good,"When I was working for Lockheed Martin on Ft, Bragg it was a good job. The only thing is once child support begin to get taken out. My pay was lowered."
good,I was a contractor but was local to Cincinnati. I enjoyed working for a large company . There is opportunities for advancement and they were generous with pay.
good,"Designed, programmed, and improved the Centralized API Announcement Tool, a web-service email tool"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the job but it has been many years since I worked there.  I guess that overall, the money was good, I had autonomy, but I left to teach...doh!"
good,When you are with a company for 37 years it becomes a marriage not a job.  Its a give and take relationship.  I have many good memories.  Love the people and the product.  I wish the best for Lockheed Martin.  I know they have their struggles... it makes me sad thinking that I am not there to help them anymore.
good,"Società' dinamica, realtà internazionale in forte crescita"
good,"At my location, it was a somewhat small site, so it had to advantages of being a nice, interconnected workplace environment with the resources that come with a large corporation."
good,I enjoyed my actual job at lmco but sometimes it was boring or nothing to do. The actual job culture was negative a lot of bickering among managers and coworkers. Good benefits and opp for advancment but my pay wad l ower than my peers.
good,We had an abusive and out of control manager. HR eventually fired him and installed a new guy who'd been with the company for a long time. LM's philosophy is people make profits and they are intolerant to thugs.  The boost to morale was tremendous and the work force was very grateful to LM for this decision.
good,"Perform analysis of detonations."
good,I worked at Lockheed more than 22 years ago.  I was only in the security education and training for special access programs.  I enjoyed developing briefings and presenting them.  I also wrote and maintained a program for tracking foreign travel.  The F-22 program had some problems with their program and I was put in charge of the program and had great reviews from the customer on the following inspection.
good,"It is a great company to begin your career with and look to advance. LM looks to promote within the company and retain talent. The work life balance could be improved, but the company is very mission driven."
good,"Ship repair required full commitment to fleet service. If you are looking for a competitive environment that requires lots of travel and work to keep you occupied, this is a good place to look."
good,"a typical day at work."
good,Yeah it was a good place to learn. Very fast paced. If you want to know what you want to do after college it is a good place to intern. Other than that it was fine.
good,"Good place to work, but like most big companies they can be a stickler for rules and regs--for instance, my work was held up for days because a 20$ part was stuck in the shipping department!  Other than that, they are good professionals and nice people to work with."
good,"Working with three different programs, I saw a wider picture of WRAF / civil service relationships. Having a clear picture of the C-17 issues and understanding the urgent needs within the Kit Process, I was able to make progress. Within the C-130 Retro Wing Kit, only accomplished a good inventory of Lockheed Martin's kits. Finding very few discrepancy's or exceptions. Loved working with our small team, a group of men and women on limited duty.  I was so proud of their work every day, knowing their disabilities. F-15 Panel group was a strange scope of work, since most of the requistitions were over a year old and difficult to open or close. Seems like to many of these planes were being scrapped. But a great group of folks and we shared a common goal each day."
good,"The business infrasture was dynamic in nature. Somtimes it was difficult in technoloy field due to the contracts/customer demands. It always worked out to design, development and new technoloy to complete the job. I good company to work for becuase of the superviors working out the problem complete the job."
good,"There were 88 guards,  38 full time and 50 part time of which"
good,"Preach work/life balance but to truly meet or exceed expectations, you will have to put in at least 60 hrs per week.  Benefits package got smaller and smaller every year."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for and the work-life balance is great. I worked at a smaller site, but I think the culture is different at larger sites."
good,"Some programs are amazing and interesting. Some programs are a slow, boring nightmare. This company is massive and has a lot of red tape but a lot of opportunities."
good,"Work day was full, productive, informative and challenging..  Management was outstanding... Workplace culture was very friendly.. I learned patient, the value of team work... IT was on time with solving critical PC issues.. I really enjoyed group meeting while interacting with other departments.."
good,If you like American Culture in the workplace then this would suit you.  Lots of back patting and high fives.  9 day fortnight which is great.  Not much opportunity to move on.
good,"Lockheed Martin is not the place work for everyone. If you decide to apply, be careful about the workplace culture. I would agree with the previous review - Boring Culture."
good,"I absolutly loved the job, but the management wasnt up to speed with operations and how things work in 2018. Old school management for a moderen company."
good,"Great Company and good working environment. Progress was fantastic, as I got an internal promotion to London. Always challenging, and working on confidential projects I learnt some valuable skills"
good,"Hardest part of job is keeping up with the fast pace and evolving requirements."
good,"The credo ""work hard – play hard"" applies perfectly here, just be careful that you aren’t so burned out by the time you reach your three-day work weekend that you have no energy to enjoy it. LMCO is at the forefront of many breaking technologies it’s a great time to be an Engineer.  I would like to see them be more balanced into commercial markets and think smarter with their design / test teams, not harder."
good,"Lockheed as a Company is stellar- my brief experience as a Tech at a location in Crestview Fla  was a negative short work stay culture there was cut throat, hostile and negative and disappointment. Communication and Professionalism was Definetly missing at this location and morale was bad and unethical work methods!"
good,"When I first started with LMCO it was great.  I transferred within the company.  I had opportunities to advance, but I was not willing to give up the unpaid time required.  I traveled a lot with the program.  I transferred again within the same business unit/office.  This proved to be a mistake.  The manager was not good.  I had no opportunity for advancement.  My experience is unique.  I would suggest to anyone to work for the company.  As a whole it is great."
good,"Company on a whole I feel is good. It's just at our site Upper management wishes to vend out the maintenance dept. "
good,"Depending on the department, it can be an ok place to work at.  A lot of times, they will lay off the seasoned people, only to bring in a collage grad making 25% of what they did."
good,"they are an ok company to work for. i really don't know what else to say since i haven't worked for them in more than 20 years, but when i was there they were ok."
good,"Good place to grow,education assistance. Working with a union can be challenging. Loots of ot.  Seems like a different place looking from the outside in."
good,"Went into mfg. facilities in Wichita, Ks. ect. and quality source inspected various components to the C-130 and F-16 a/c programs for Lockheed-mARTIN COMPANY."
good,"I love the work that I do. The company, in general, is good. They are very good at having events to help build moral with the employees. The only real issue is that I work for a union and Lockheed seems to treat us differently than they do their normal employees."
good,"Typical day at work is at a good pace, leaning slightly towards the slower side on some days. Coworkers are generally helpful, they are good mentors. Management can be good or bad, really depends on the person. Hardest part of the job is that it can get a little stale at times. Most enjoyable part is the job security."
good,"Lockheed Martin is where I started my career early on. I was not doing what I wanted to do and was not fond of my manager.  I don't think this had anything to do with the company, but more so the role I chose to take out of college."
good,"Pros"
good,Sikorsky was a great company to work for until Lockheed Martin bought the company. They are now laying off 500 employees in west palm beach Florida. The same workers that help keep the Blackhawk orders from falling behind and the same workers that built the new H-92 for the Canadian Navy and the New CH-53K for the Marine Corp. They are moving the remaining work up to Stratford and closing production. We where the best facility Sikorsky had. No Loyalty to their employees.
good,"There was never a dull moment at Lockheed Martin. I totally enjoyed my job....and the best part was helping everyone....from the world class aircraft mechanics to all the managers and the Director.  I was heavily depended upon.  I took calls late at night and would readily login to my laptop to see what I could to do to assist them.  When someone was asked question that they didn't know the answer to....they were told to come see me, that I would probably be better able help them.  So that...will give you a picture of how much I enjoyed my job.  "
good,Every day is a different day with something new to learn. The hardest part of the job is waking up so early. It is a centralized culture with a top-down hierarchy.
good,"Overall a good place to work., if you can survive the ups and downs of the defense aerospace industry. Great benefits an good pay, management is as with most jobs luck of the draw."
good,"The company gave me a busy work day. Some days I would be low on work, but other days I would be extremely busy with work. I wish they gave me more training for my job though. It would have a made a difference in me learning the necessary material I feel."
good,"Lockheed was a great place to work. Some of the people were very enjoyable to be around, very diverse environment. Several opportunities for advancement."
good,"GREAT WORK ENVIRONMENT"
good,"A well organized company that follows it's mission statements. Excellent benefits packages, college reimbursement program. Good leadership and a good place to be employed!"
good,"Pros:"
good,Lockheed is a large aerospace contractor.  The focus on Ethics and doing right by our customers and the American Tax payers is second to none!  Do not  pass on a chance to work for this company especially if your willing to relocate for advancement.
good,Fast paced working environment. Things are always changing working with different governments and contracts.  You have to be able to adapt and overcome.
good,"Great place to coast. If you like government contract type work then this is the best place for it. Slow pace of work, not a lot of real change, and yet a constant threat of the contracts getting pulled if things don't improve. Gotta love the irony. Best thing about working for LM is the PTO, very generous."
good,"the workers were  talented, but the managers had favorites that were promoted because they were exempt with the tasking of everyday duties they had plenty of time to advance their agendas"
good,As lifer individuals get closer to finishing up their careers Lockheed pursues lay off of the seasoned veterans.  Higher Mananagement need replacing by people within the company that truly know processes and Defect Elimination.
good,"High C5 RERP production while maintaining a high quality of work. Early completion of workloads and assisted in other areas. "
good,"Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is still burdened with an outdated culture and a good-ole-boy mentality. Advancement is very limited as most departments have 100 employees and maybe 5 manager positions, while people stay at their desks for 15-20 years. Senior management and the task organization changes almost yearly so your performance reviews have no clear history and no way to demonstrate potential."
good,it was ok they are nice to you if you are white and they dont care about there employees ite i was the only hispanic unless they are white almost every one is white
good,Due to security and proprietary issues I choose not to go into to much detail about about my current company.  There are many things I like about my company but like anywhere there are things I wish I could change.
good,"My experience working at Lockheed Martin left something to be desired. I was not given enough work to keep me busy, and when I requested additional projects, was denied."
good,Easy work if you have all that you need as access to what  you need. Most of the people are very nice and friendly . Very laid back alot of EOC meeting. They have a great break room
good,"A good company to work for. Good benefits with Lockheed Martin. The benefits at Superior are horrible. If you can, try to get on board with Lockheed Martin."
good,"Non-stop work/travel to other LM facilities around the country.  Poor initial basic systems engineering principals applied planning the execution on my program due to lack of good management/leadership.  Absolutely zero work/life balance within my position.  Company laptop goes home with me every night and weekends where I often continue working.  Most if not all engineering solutions are reactionary instead of proactive through proper planning."
good,Culture is slow to change.  Cross training limited. Got to work on multiple programs. Still volunteer with the local aviation museum. Managers were forced to retire and staff was cut.
good,Provided multiple opportunities to expand on my engineering and project leadership skills; reasonable career growth if willing to either wait for the right position or move to another location
good,". Got this job through a contract"
good,"During implementing from one ERP system to another (SAP) there were often stressful times where no consistent lead was given to contractors and employees alike.  However, in defense, while clearly not implementing Change Management as a separate function, the most experienced contractors and employees were able through positive team interaction, to push forward, overcoming backlog and process improvement obstacles."
good,Productive and fun place where we worked as part of a team. I learned to work closely with top management on project goals. The work place included people from many cultures around the world.
good,This is a good place to work overall.  Deadlines can be stressful but there is a lot of good work experience to be gained here with some very knowledgeable colleagues.
good,Good Company to work for.  I learned a lot in the production field.  Management was very helpful and always willing to help.  People i worked for really  made the job hard to leave.
good,Fast paced proposal environment of high tech satellite and ship systems.  Smaller efforts were frequently developed as a quick turnaround response. White papers and other solicitation responses were also developed
good,"flexible time, team work with other partner companies, empower to do the job, depend on the  project dead line other than that the work atmosphere is like other big company, the job and project empower me to  take my  job as my own business."
good,Great local government contractor.  Collaboration between engineers and manufacturing floor.  Nice benefits and work environment.  I enjoyed the business casual attire.
good,"Impressive facility.  Employee engagement and activities are very common.  High tech environment.  Many career opportunities, especially for engineering mindset."
good,I had a long Engineering career supporting the Air Force Satellite Control Network and multiple classified programs.  I maintained an TS/SCI clearance with CI Poly for many years.  I was part of three team special recognition awards and one individual special recognition award for the requirement management team for which I was the technical lead.
good,Lockheed Martin is a good company.  I was constantly learning new things in my job and had the opportunity to partner with many functional areas across the corporation and our Customers.
good,I'm just looking so I can be closer to my home. I have worked here for 20 years and for the majority of the time it has been enjoyable. I would recommend it.
good,The work at Lockheed is hard with long hours. But the work is very interesting. I always felt like I worked with the smartest people in the world. It's fast placed and challenging.
good,"This review is for Conduent (used to be Xerox and before that  Towers Perrin) a 3rd party HR outsourcer.  The company is basically a good one but it does have flaws.  Too many decisions are made and too many things are done as a knee jerk reaction without thinking them through beforehand.  Supervisors and Managers are good but like so many large companies there is no communication and the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  The typical way that Conduent motivates employees is with the carrot on a string approach, ""you work hard in this position we'll have a better one (and maybe a permanent one) for you later and later never comes.  Some employees have been 5 years and longer hoping for that ""permanent"" position which somehow never comes."
good,"longevity, professional, process oriented . Good company to get your feet wet in defense contracting. Folks retiring and the company has been promoting knowledge continuity."
good,"It has been years since I've worked for Lockheed. There are workplace politics everywhere. For a job that hires people with no experience, the pay is good and the benefits are great."
good,"Work varies you can be on a fast paced program (requires Overtime) or regular 40h work weeks, this is completely up to your manager."
good,"Work was good, easy and teammates were great to work with. The F-22 was pretty slow at time, we did not reach full rate production. Great benefits and good working hours."
good,Left there only because I had a much better offer from a different company which also included a move to my home area. Could not resist the temptation.
good,"I would enjoy it more if there was better management at my location. I've heard the management at other locations are a lot better and care a lot more about an individual's career development, but it doesn't feel that way where I am."
good,"Mgnmt very set, does not promote from within often, pay raises are small, slow to come, and finite for job title.  You will never be more than a number at LM.  No amount of company loyalty is considered when looking for advancement or pay increases, or in regards to layoffs or terminations."
good,"Do as you teach people ""ethics"". Only way to advance is to lye, cheat, or kiss but. If you do you job other people get scared that you will make them look bad."
good,"Provides a nice work/life balance. For Software Engineering, some of their technology and processes are a bit dated. Lots of room for growth and improvement."
good,I need 1st shift and currently on 2nd shift..I have 2 teen girls that need my attention at night.  Great people to work for and with and great atmosphere.
good,"Depends on the assignment what a typical day at work is."
good,Lockheed has good work life balance and generally has above average benefits. It is a strong company financially and provides stable employment.  Middle management seems challenged at times.
good,Moving to a high deductible insurance. Not as good to work at as it was years ago. Pension is gone. Salaries are low for non-engineers. Slow to move up career ladder unless you are a twenty-something. They revere youth. Stressful jobs that other companies pay more for.
good,Good place to start after college.  Worked closely with the Air Force so worked with process and procedures.  In the late 1990s defend  contract was going down and networking was going up.
good,"The 2 managers that I have worked with thus far in my 2 years have been excellent. Sometimes hard to get things done with so much bureaucracy, for example getting software installed on a classified server."
good,"I had a great experience working for Lockheed Martin.  I was able to rise quickly into leadership, however, as leadership changed, my opportunity for further advancement stalled."
good,"Production focused company - innovative and performance driven to ensure DoD customer's requirements and contracted stipulations are met.  However, limited and ineffective mentorship and leadership culture."
good,"Provide direction, oversight and leadership to represented workforce in order to accomplish safety, quality, and cost and schedule objectives."
good,"A high safety flight department with international departures and top-tier equipment. Expectations include professional attire, adherence to all federal aviation regulations as they apply under owner-operator corporate aviation flight department."
good,Lockheed Martin overall is similar to the other major aerospace companies.  New Orleans however brought out more characters than I've seen other places.
good,"Nice environment, nice people, but phone calls were bad, and compensation and benefits were poor. Company would provide days of catered food.  Management is good, but too busy.  It was a contracted position with the Dept of Housing and Urban and Developement and must be able to pass several security screenings."
good,This is a nice company. Have work with them through OJP.   They are the contract resource for this project. No complaints their staff is very profession and thorough.
good,"Strong company when LM.  Now that Leidos, still going through merger pains and not the company it once was."
good,"Great place to work if you love aerospace and the rich tradition of the early days.  I worked on some great programs with some great people, but at the end of the day the big company is a hard place to find career advancement, especially when the company is changing rapidly as it was in the 80's & 90's."
good,"I worked for the company in its heyday. At that time it was a busy, rewarding place to work. Since the GE days, and two corporate mergers, it has become less so."
good,This is a good company to work for. I'm not sure how promotion works here as I'm somewhat new. I would like to eventually find a job with increased responsibility
good,"Small environment working mostly with government contracts.  Challenging, collaborative work with Universities and other research facilities.  Varying projects."
good,Government contractor - different way of handling payroll for retirees. Was hired to review how retirees were previously paid - very tiring and tedious work.
good,The work was rewarding knowing that it benefitted the national security. The company benefits were excellent and the people were really great. Work options to transfer and make career progress were very good.
good,I was essentially an intern at the time I was working at Lockheed. There were interesting and challenging projects I worked on. I enjoyed the flexibility in work hours. You can work 40 hours a week how you choose and when I left they were starting to take every other Friday off.
good,worked there designing production systems for military aircraft. job was consistently challenging - I like it that way so don't get bored with what I'm doing.
good,"During the late 90's to early 2000 time frame, Lockheed in Greenville SC was a fast growing engineering group with diverse projects. The work was challenging and technically and also in developing teams."
good,"A typical day was classified work for the government on a day to day."
good,Good place to work for.  I loved the people but did not like the drive for the pay.  If they were closer and paid better would consider.
good,"Great and easy to work for, well looked after and will help you with any difficulties personal or otherwise. Always willing to train up. Progression can be slow."
good,"Not enough accountability for senior management. In my experience with several employees across LM, senior mgt was verbally abusive to the extreme. When the employees reached out to HR for help, their proven complaints fell on deaf ears. HR within LM needs to be completely revamped and reeducated. "
good,"Lockheed Martin is a fair and good company to work for as a contractor. Just like any contract job it is not stable, but they do what they can to renew the contracts and make sure that the contract stays renewable"
good,"Great Place to work with great benefits and experience.  You are kept very busy with usually good variety of tasks, Management is good or at least usual for a big company.  Co-workers tend to work well with each other.  Hardest part is the politics, as usual.  It is good to have many resources to use."
good,"With the administration being transferred from Sunnyvale to Dallas, the job was no longer fun.  I was always treated with respect at the vendors. The travel used to be more fun."
good,Overall good company to work for. Opportunity to develop multiple skills and it has a reasonable work life balance structure.
good,"Nice company to work for , they do not treat contractors as well as they treat their direct hires. It is a sham that they sold the contract that I am on."
good,"Very good company with plenty of friendly colleagues"
good,"No longer in business, but the company still has some marine work going on.  Might be a good place for younger engineers.  Learned a lot about advanced marine vehicles."
good,"Great technical team, but the guy who writes Dilbert must work there.  Flexible hours generally.  Mixed bag of good and incompetent management."
good,Systems Administration can be one of the most difficult and stressful things.  I had a relatively close working (scattered around the country) team.  We supported each other well and worked together to get tasks done.
good,"Can't give much of a review since I only worked for them for two months. Once the job was done, my tenure with them was done. I did enjoy seeing that part of the world for a time and also enjoyed the demolition work. It's fun to tear stuff down."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Always something new to learn in the Traffic/Transportation Logistics Shipping Department; the proper way to file, what carrier to use, what was the most economical way to ship, making sure the bills got paid, and ensured each delivery was made on time. Interfaced with many internal and external customers. Worked with upper management to ensure their specific shipments were processed properly and shipped by the requested date. Met all Government deliverables and made monthly payments on time. Worked with a great team who always looked for cost saving ideas or how to do more with less. The hardest part of the job was not being able to ship something that was not properly inspected before the truck arrived to pick up the shipment. The most enjoyable was being able to meet all the the daily challenges and meeting our  customers goals."
good,"Great company, some bad seeds within the company but you must work there to see what it's like. Overall, great company..."
good,Currently work at Lockheed Martin as a counselor for consumers. I take an average of 60-70 calls a day giving and submitting accurate information into database. Management and co-workers at my current employer are all team players and they all allow me to do my job daily. It can be challenging mentally but it allows me to challenge myself with each difficult task. I like the fact that I can help people are who struggling with specific issues.
good,"Sikorsky is an excellent company to work for. I gained a great deal of knowledge in the administrative, financial analyst, and coordinating fields. My co-workers along with the management team are very helpful and work well together. The job required much multi-tasking and attention to detail. Pro-active and self-initiated time management is a must for working at Sikorsky. The most enjoyable part of the job is the continuous learning."
good,"Overall a great place to work. my team was friendly and knowledgeable. Everyday was a bit different work wise .I worked in the Flight Delivery Center where our primary function was to test fly the aircraft and prepare it for customer delivery at 100%. I learned many things there in reference to rotary flight. Management was fluctuating from week to week and there was no coherence in decision making . My co workers were great .I hated to see a lot of them leave ,weather by choice or not. The hardest part of the job is like anywhere , dealing with the mixed decisions of the upper echelons resulting in duplicate work and rework. Just working in the world of rotary flight! I still work on Helicopters in the PA Nat'l Guard. After two deployments I just would like to find a stable Helicopter company that provides security and longevity. For the past five years Sikorsky has been good to me but this Reduction In Force they have initiated three times since the five years I have been there makes for a difficult work environment ,never knowing if the next day you come to work will be your last. it's very stress full and frustrating."
good,"Each day brought something different. This allows you to stay on your toes."
good,Keeps you on your toes. No two days are the same. Must know an incredible amount of policies and procedures. You're guarding some interesting things here and working with the D.O.D.
good,I've been employed by Lockheed Martin for one year now and other than location and time away from family I'm fairly pleased
good,i spent almost 11 yrs working for them. somedays were long. there really was nothing hard about the job.
good,"Whom I work for at Lockheed Martin was great. And it was a great company when working with the customer who where also great."
good,Building technician assist in the construction of the external tanks for NASA shuttle craft. It gave me the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people.
good,"Large corporation with loads of opportunities.  Mainly in technical/engineering fields. Solid benefits. "
good,"Challenging and intense place to work.  LM has some of the smartest and brightest individuals, just great group of people.  The hardest part of the job is life balance."
good,A historically innovative company often turned to when their customers faced daunting technical challenges. Heavily weighted to defense and space-based technologies.
good,"Mission focus is very tight in my current atmosphere.  Can work long hours, which is not necessarily great for family life (plus there is commute time). Many people make sacrifices in order for the mission to press forward."
good,"Every day brings something new. The job requires fast thinking, and able to multi task. Must deal with customers on a daily basis."
good,"Co-workers were enjoyable, working with government officials provided a different view of getting business completed."
good,"The bright side is that, depending on your position, you can get to work on some very high-tech projects.  The down-side is that management doesn't really ""manage"" and the culture is very lacking."
good,I've been at Lockheed for 10yrs...ready for new challenges.  I'm looking for an exciting young company.  I do enjoy working with my coworkers
good,"Lockheed was a good place to work, however due to government cutbacks budget had to be cut which ended up in a workforce reduction."
good,"three shift work days.  Coworkers are almost all ex military and very friendly.  Lots of experience with aircraft airframe, engine work, fuel tank, and tire maintenance.  must provide all your tools."
good,Great place to work with cutting edge technology and work with a close-knit family.  I learned a lot about defense contracting.
good,Lockheed is a great company with opportunities for career advancement. Good benefits and flexible work schedule are a plus.
good,"Always Busy, learning, room for advancement. Great Company"
good,Not a very excited career path. There are not much room to move up the corporate ladder. Do not recommend to those who have ambition
good,"Work with a diverse team of multiple disciplines while providing support to production operations and manufacturing. Strive for continuous improvement of tooling, process and quality control for all manufacturing builds."
good,"Software generation, testing and validation of various applications utilizing structured techniques"
good,"Responsible for system and software design, test, and integration of the Avionics subsystem of sophisticated airplane."
good,The program I worked for was in it's infancy. There were many growing pains. There were very limited experienced personnel working with me. The company is fantastic but that program was rough.
good,A great team was put together for the military medical contract we supported.  Management has issues interfacing with GSA that caused communication and operational problems.
good,My experience with Lockheed Martin was very positive. The company always provided professional and knowledgeable personnel to help and answer any questions or concerns.
good,There are great people here and this is a great company. You will enjoy supporting the mission of this Org. Definitely enjoy my time here
good,This is a great company to work for. You are in charge of your own career path and you must be self-motivated. You will work with extremely bright individuals on some pretty cool and cutting edge technology.
good,"typical day would be: morning meeting, get assignment. Start assembling aircraft by looking at instructions, schematics, drawings to install wiring and components."
good,"take and assort incoming Mail, FedEx, UPS to different building"
good,Lockheed is not a bad place to work. Its like most companies it has its good days and its bad. The people you work around are pretty great.
good,"Defense is an interesting monster. Up and down depending on the vagaries of who's in charge today."
good,wonderful work environment. they offer many incentives to work here. learning opportunities as well as job promotions if you apply yourself. Management is fair and company offers room for growth.
good,Retired from Lockheed after 30 years. Overall a good place to work most of my career but in the last few years a changing environment has created less of an opportunities for older workers. They are cutting costs and hiring younger less experienced workers to replace the older workers.
good,"Great workplace with a huge amount of supportive colleagues."
good,"I've been given several opportunities to travel, support stretch assignments, provide temporary support and transfer business areas/positions.  This has made me a more well rounded employee."
good,"Defines network communications and designs and implements solutions within existing network. "

good,"•	Typical day at work – setting up schedule for 40 employees, figuring costs and cost goals, ordered supplies, kept material on hand from outside vendors if needed, making sure employees understood what needed to be done"
good,Maintained a working relationship with soldiers to bridge the gap between civilians and soldiers in order to find missing property.
good,I worked contract through Guardsmark...not directly for Lockheed Martin. I was in the lobby of their Procurement/Purchasing Building in the Utica Business Park. I had security clearance for this position. Vendors/clients came to meet with purchasing employees. Secure building. I also supported the shipping department in that building. Typed up informationi for them. Easy job. Started out as part-time and then went to full-time -- 4 ten-hour days.
good,was short lived but due to layoff but i enjoyed the job for the most part. was there for only few months so i cant give a really fair say in this.
good,This is where firefighting meets technology. The flight test environment is a constant race to succeed.  Opportunities to expand your knowledge abound.  There are hands on opportunities to desk bound tasks.  The employee can use his/her discretion as to how best serve the company to reach the collective goals.
good,The deployment schedule for this job required that you were ready to deploy for a mission or mission training on short notice and your mission could be extended for as much as 90 days at a time based on mission requirements.
good,It opened my eyes to the corporate world and to military contract work. I really enjoyed my job and what I learned. I would have liked to see more and do more but because of the nature of the work a person is limited.
good,Interesting projects and great people to work with make for extremely pleasant work days.  It is a great place to start your career.
good,"When i first started working at LM, my children were still in elementary school.  The 9/80 schedule allowed me spend quality time with them during their developmental years.  I also had the ability to work from home 1 say per week and flex out my work schedule."
good,Lockheed is a good company. The pay and benefits are really good. It's just like any other company...everything has it ups and downs. I really enjoyed the people I worked with which were mostly veterans. sometimes info could be passed around a little better.
good,I very much enjoyed this job. I learned how to manage a data closet and troubleshoot and repair fiber optics. I only left due to the company reducing our medical benefits and I was expecting our first child.
good,Great aeronautics company to work for providing great pay and benefits. It is a union environment and the employees are knowledgeable as are my peers.
good,Coding and requirements gathering for customers. Testing new or modified software. correct any job aborts or problems presented by the customer.
good,"Great company with strong purpose. I have learned a lot about the software life cycle, project management and quality practices and principles. The magnitude of the company which is located in just about every state allows the flexibility to move around but staying with the same company."
good,"Great company, but it doesn't offer a position in the career path that I am working toward.  I am interested in the R/M field which is not offered here."
good,"The job offers flexibility in hours and pace, allows individual selection of assignments, but because of its remote location does not provide much advancement potential."
good,Great experience working with Sikorsky ground test team on the CH-53K. Learned a lot from engineering and test mechanics.
good,Installation of security systems.  System was for an Air Force Simulater.
good,"Many well developed processes and capabilities."
good,"Great team to work with, people are very nice. Fun environment both in the lab and in the field.  Only drawback is it's impossible to find out what management is looking for in order to get promoted."
good,The company has a strong backbone and work/life balance is great.
good,"A variety of global security products with locations in 49/50 states."
good,I worked the inventory room in this manufacture plant for Lockheed martin. there were many different items I had to pull for the builders. due to the confidentiality of the job I cant really say to much about what I did or learned.
good,Learned to deal with a variety of tasks and grew my professional knowledge tremendously.
good,"MC-130H instruction to active duty aircrew in systems, operations and procedures in the classroom, simulator and with static aircraft on the flight line. Assist instructional systems designers and subject matter expert in the development of classroom and simulator lessons and student and instructor guides, and other training data."
good,"This job entailed ensuring that facilities were operating under secure procedures, both physically and digitally. Primarily the duties entailed, ensuring that the grounds if the facility were safe and secure. This job was a great spring board into a career."
good,"This was such a challenging organization, each day there was somtehing new to learn.  The people I worked and came into contact with were great.  I worked numerous late nights, weekends, and overnights on many occasions.  Co-workers consisted of the space community within Lockheed, security, maintenance, internal, and external organizations."
good,"I had great assignments during my employment at Lockheed.  I had a great time and proud of it.  We have smart and talent people work for this company. Recently, work force reduction going in effect and the company decisions are unpredictable who job is going to be safe.  Talents vs $$."
good,"Typical day was an 8 hour work day of designing computer programs"
good,Lockheed company is great place to work.  The reason I don't work for the company anymore is the contract with the Government is expired.  I had good times working there.  In fact I won the Lockheed Martin Recognition Award for outstanding performance and commitment to SEC [Security Exchange Commissions] ISS program and on the Spot bones in recognitions of the hard work and dedication.
good,Change is the constant. You have to be flexible and have problem solving skill. Don't expect management to tell you job well done or kudos. Lots of areas to learn from.
good,Great Company. Great benefits. Your opportunities are what you make them to be.
good,"Large organization"
good,"Definitely a large company where you can get lost. However because of the large number of government contracts/projects that Lockheed has, the opportunity to apply from within the company is an added bonus. Work and HR support despite it's size is spot on."
good,"Big company easy to get lost if working off site."
good,"Excellent benefits and an awesome experience builder. My favorite part of the job is, knowing that we were assisting our troops, and watching something you had hand in building fly!"
good,Lockheed Marin is good company to work for. Working in the middle east was very hard at time because of the work site. And it was very hard being away from your family. The company did their best to take care of their people. Thanks
good,"I worked a night shift.  My supervisor was great!  Some co-workers were tough to deal with, but you'll find that anywhere.  The company provided lots of beneficial training and a good benefits package."
good,Continually expanded my experience by being assigned to more and more challenging roles and responsibilities.
good,"As a prime on most of its contracts with the government, LM tended to provide better leadership and protection of its employees than other companies.  Salaries were good though slipping in relationship to its competitors.  Benefits were only average.  The corporate culture in dealing with employees typically came down on the moral side of every issue and one could count on fair treatment."
good,"I have learned a great deal during my employment at Lockheed Martin.  As a Test Technician my responsibilities were to test and troubleshoot electronic assemblies.  These assemblies are essential to the safety of our Military aboard Aircraft Carriers and Submarines, so quality is high priority.  My typical day included testing and troubleshooting Laser Guided Systems for The Air Force, where accuracy is imperative.  Management was great in providing opportunities to learn and better your education.  My co-workers were a great, highly skilled group of people to work with.  Friendly, knowledgeable, people who knew their jobs and did them well."
good,"Good company to work for when it comes to management.  The work as long days, but the management tried to make up for it."
good,"A typical day at Lockheed martin was a very tedious, time consuming day. I had to remain alert and ready to respond to alarms for sensitive classified areas. I ensured that all closed areas were secure because they contained various equipment and weapon systems for the N.A.T.O alliance and equipment and weapon systems that were to be sold to the United States Military. At the end of the day I had to write reports on all daily occurrences."
good,"I enjoyed working with people who have the same goals as myself in relation to the work that I did.The enviroment I was in allowed me to express my ideas on how to improve processes and procedures."
good,"Training for aircraft manufacturing and delivery, working with workforce ranging from no education to highly qualified. Government contracts makes for an uncertain future."
good,"facility closing, but i love working here. going to miss it."
good,"This is a good place to work if you like a challenge, the work that I did was never the same and sometimes it was simple and other times hard, but never impossible. Overall it is really a fun place to work if you keep to yourself."
good,"The work can be slow or fast paced, it varies depending on the projects and their deliveries. The politics are rough and make it difficult sometimes to be heard/seen. I love what I do, but I don't think pay/raises/advancement is merit-based like it should be and makes it difficult and frustrating if you're looking for upward mobility."

good,"Lockheed Martin is a good place to work overall, however, layoffs happen every so often."

Most of the people I work with are former military and have an insight about our work that I haven't seen in other places. There is a lot to do and a lot of ways to do it. Management usually stays out of the way to let the team get things done right."
good,Fun and knowlagable people to work with. Good Company. Nice Jobs.
good,"Managed the master expeditor log to create pick release tickets, update and  schedule order shipments."
good,The 7 years at Sikorsky I learned new tasks weekly. There is always a situation or problem to arise that needed to be solved. I was the lead-man of my crew which I enjoyed.

good,Its a great company to work for but also under very challenging budget pressures since the federal government is its largest customer.
good,This was my first time ever working in a Union shop. I feel that unions are no longer needed. There are so many laws and regulations companies have to abide by that the use for unions are not needed. I feel unions promote laziness and protect employees you can not perform. There was ethical conflicts between upper management and union officials.
good,"Many excellent opportunities, quality personnel.

good,Overall a good place to work
good,"Lockheed/Martin has been a great place to work. Few perks. Flexible workweek, typically 40 - 50 hours per week for salary. Pay is average. Like any defense contractor, you live and die with government budgets."
good,Good company with competitive pay. Learned how to become a successful leader and successfully manage projects that can be delivered on time and within budget.
good,"I was a contracted employee, so I only got a salaried wage. For the most part, my co-workers got along with me well and were helpful. There are some people that are less willing to spend time to help out, but that is understandable as the project I was working on had a lot of budget/time constraints."
good,"A typical day at the Health Unit would have an employee coming into the Unit, asking for or needing some sort of either health advice or Medical help. I was able to teach may different health related topics to many different employees. I also learned to recognize the signs and symptoms of male or female having a MI. I have however only had to preform CPR, and then using an AED on only one patient, while being employed with Lockheed Martin."
good,"UH1, UH60A, OH58 Scheduled Aircraft lubrication and repairs based on date of last lubrication, mileage traveled and urgency of repairs."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place for the right person. They pay well, have great benefits and if you stay relevant you can avoid any layoffs when you see them coming. Layoffs are just the nature of the defense industry. If you enjoy an 8-5 job and are not very ambitious this is the place for you."
good,I did not mind going into work every day. I really enjoyed what i was able to do and the people i worked with on a day to day basis really grew on me. The hardest part of the job was to leave.

good,Great learning experience. Worked on sophisticated equipment. Was allowed to be an important part of the team.

The environment is productive, and conducive to getting work done. Lockheed also shows support to employees by encouraging healthy actions, and supporting employee resource groups."
good,A typical day of work is when the formal testing going on. I have learned to work under tremendous pressure. Management is cooperative. Co-workers share information. The hardest part of the job is short time frame for large scale of testing. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning distributed systems.

good,Saw many different things related to space and defense. Smart and great people to work with.
good,This place was a very busy place and just do your job and you can have fun.
good,"There are a lot of talented people at LM who really make your job enjoyable. They are usually very friendly and easy to work with in teams. It's a great company for lifers. If you are young and want to be challenged and motivated, it can be hard to find the right job and manager to do that. Career development depends on having one or two people in high positions on your side."
good,Learned how to work with different type of people and from there skills.Which make coming to work enjoyable.
good,My experience while working at Lockheed was very fast pace and busy. But the turnover rate was pretty high.

good,Great benefits but the culture is still in the baby boom era. Definitely need spice to keep millenniums. Lots of red tape when you want to do inter-Department activities. Need to encourage engagement between two or more departments.
good,"The hours were great, I found myself having plenty of time off and getting off work with enough time left in the day to have a life during the week. Great schedule. It’s a well structured company. They pay was not bad for what it is. I left because my priorities changed and I wanted to expand my financial future and felt like I was wasting time here, which proved to be correct. Overall the company is good and pretty straight forward. You know what you’re getting into. You can stay for as long as you want as it’s pretty much impossible to get fired ( which I see as a terrible thing) much like the military. If you know people, you may climb a few steps on the ladder, maybe."
good,Productive work place in term of business innovation.  Ability to work with all other discipline engineer.  Allowance to be innovative.  Self directive on project management
good,All right job too many hours put on salary individuals i usually worked 60 +hours a week. And all mechanics were promoted by only length there not experience

good,"Management decision-making process can be excruciatingly slow at times. The 9/80 work schedule is a definite plus. Overall, it is a great environment to work in."
good,"There are many entities within LM, Make sure to review all of them before taking the first one. Make sure it is a mutual good fit for all parties. Don't be afraid to speak up if you have good ideas."
good,"I loved working for Lockheed Martin.  The company as a whole is wonderful.  The people I worked with were great and the benefits were really good compared to other companies.  The main drawback is if you work on a government contract, your job will have an expiration date and it's difficult to find open positions within the company.  The other issue I ran into is the lack of opportunity to advance.  The last not so great thing was the low salary in comparison to other companies but overall it's a great place to work.  I'd love to go back if I could...it's finding an open position that's the problem."
good,"The team is given the room to learn and leverage new found knowledge. It is a good place to develop one profession."
good,"Fast pace"
good,"Entering child support payment amounts from non-custodial parents' personal checks. Work was fairly easy, and one was able to listen to music on their headphones if you brought them in. If not, all you heard was the clicking of multiple keyboards entering in $$ amounts for payments to be disbursed to the custodial parents."
good,Lockheed Martin is a Great place to work and to grow in the field of Electronics if you are just starting off. Management works well with employee's with the Flex Hours that are provided to the employee's at Lockheed Martin.
good,"Its a fun place to work but I don't want to write this review. Please let me go, help. Please. Somebody help. Indeed has trapped me in the room and they won't let me leave..."
good,"Lockheed Martin is an excellent company overall and the work is meaningful; however, the business is cyclic and employees get laid off regularly. Union hourly employees are more protected than leaders. Some leaders are brought into the fold while others are placed on the peripheral.   The company ousted a host of seasoned professionals over the past several years and made a move to elevate less experienced people. This may have been based on cost savings, fresh blood, or a combination of both."
good,Good place to work.  Hard working people with several opportunities for ASVANCEMENT.  aLWAYS TAKING ON NEW PROJECTS AND TRYING TO IMPROVE.  Young talent is everywhere
good,"Great organisation to work for with very professional employees."
good,Hard working team that takes their job seriously. Allow flexibility to work from home when needed.  There can be times when you are expected to work extra when projects require it.
good,"The job was enjoyable and loved going to work everyday. The main problem if you get in lay off status they say they will help finding a job in the company. But, the management will not help no matter how many times you ask. Everyone who got let go in my area went to other companies."
good,"This is one of the best places I've worked.  It isn't perfectly run and i have had major issues with Human Resources. Aside from this, i love working for this company."
good,"Working for Lockheed has been an experience both good and bad."
good,My jobs have varied from fun research Projects to less fun production programs. We have way to many processes which can reduce innovation.   We get every other Friday off which is great.
good,"Very laid back but professional atmosphere  for independent workers and persons that possess good work habits, ethics and not resistant to utilizing technology application in the day-to-day operational processes.  Collaborative when working with team members and open to suggestions when it comes to improvements.  Provide employees with the resources and tools to succeed and excel for high performance."
good,"I was with Lockheed for 7 years, and was laid off when the company decided to move my job to Puerto Rico. The job was often high volume, answering 50 plus calls a day. Most calls were resolved with a service desk ticket. Ability to resolve issues was always very limited. I was never able to advance due to the high number of employees and low number of positions that became available. As a culture Lockheed said it wanted to help you cultivate a career but the practice was very much the opposite."
good,"Challenging position, exciting place to work and learn. Fun and rich culture environmental. Room for processes improvement implemental. "
good,"There is a lot of pressure placed on an individual if they want to advance. You are expected to volunteer for additional work, without pay. Once you have loaded your desk with work that is higher than your actual desk, then you MIGHT be considered for a promotion, but not guaranteed."
good,My personal experience as a contractor is that there is not much promise. I had hoped to become a Lockheed employee in a long-term position. After being a contractor for over 3 years without Health benefits and pay increase it has motivated me to seek other opportunities.
good,"I worked there and would recommend it to folks who would like to work in an engineering type of environement"
good,It is a fun dynamic challenging work environment. Sort of a modern day Lord of the Flies. The hanger are neat and overall clean. Work is varying and sometimes challenging.
good,"I had a good experience working for them, but that doesn't mean everyone did or would.  I credit the contract and the management team I supported for that great experience."
good,"great environment to work at with friendly and respectable people. Good amount of diverse meetings, so they were beneficial to the company and kept people involved."
good,"Good job security, good place to learn how to be a software engineer with a lifetime of reliable work. Good facility with amenities, and treated like a responsible employee with minimal micromanaging."
good,Working at Lockheed Martin was a great experience if you find the right team/management to work with.  Raises are slow coming and bonuses seem to only be giving to management level or higher positions.
good,The company over all is a good company to be employed however being as large as it is there are some areas that are not promising for certain employees.
good,"The company has proven to be a solid, ethical, and fair place to work. It does experience significant limitations as a government contractor and large corporation. Limited perks, stuffy atmosphere, and hard to implement creative ideas."
good,"Great learning place for entry level, but you need to advance the skill set on your own, sometimes you have to look outside. However, it does have a lot IT opportunities in Defense sector."
good,Lockheed to me is a job for someone that likes tp do the same thing over and over again. Although it doe's pay well. Also chance being laid off as I was twice during my employment.
good,"High level of integrity throughout the company, open communications, and sincere interest in doing the right thing. Unfortunately, I need to come up with twenty words of cons. When in reality after 41+ years in IT, I have no cons for Lockheed Martin. They are not perfect, but highly acceptable."
good,No different than any other large organization.  Upward trajectory is difficult to achieve and a lot of time is spent on compliance training among other red tape.
good,It is a very fast paced way of life at Lockheed Martin.  The culture is typical of corporate America.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of direction from management and communication from leadership.
good,"An old company that has stagnated and refuses to evolve."
good,"One thing I liked about Lockheed Martin is that few companies work on cooler technologies and projects.  Since it's government work, your first position might not have you doing what you wanted or expected, but through networking, you can work on something you really care about, with government funding."
good,"There are a lot of great team members here.  People collaborate and there are very few weak links. Upper level management is in Connecticut, so the Huntsville office is often low priority and advancement requires a move to Connecticut unless you jump to Lockheed corporate.  The flexible work schedule is nice and benefits are about average."
good,I loved my manager and the stretch assignments that he tasked me with daily.  I found that I was able to succeed at my own pace and was pushed to learn and develop my skills to the maximum.  I thoroughly enjoyed the community service activities that were offered.  Overall I was proud to work for LMMFC.
good,"Programs are based on government budgets and what they want to pay for. Research & Development, Production, and aircraft upgrades."
good,I was one of the most amazing jobs I have ever had. Being at the south pole was a once in a lifetime opportunity. The work was great some of the people had some mental issues and should not have been in management but that is to be expected.
good,"I learned that your coworkers are essential to a happy work experience. Typical day included 4 am starts with 8 hours of pilot interaction and guidance for them. Management provided a unique experience as this was a union based contract. This provided as well, a unique workplace culture with the interaction between the union and management. The hardest part of the job was the schedule being changed and being seniority based. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with pilots throughout the east coast."
good,"Overall, Lockheed Martin is a cool place to work. I've learned a lot about analog systems that paved the way for the new technologies that are here and in the making!"
good,Solid experience as an intern for approximately 6 months. Internship eventually led to a full-time job offer after graduation. Contract was turned over to Leidos.
good,"I mostly enjoy what I do here. "
good,"I started with Martin Marietta in 1985 as a key punch operator and have had many opportunities to advance.  I was recently laid off due to reorganization. The hardest part of the job is the level of stress.  There is a lot of pressure in the culture of Launching Rockets.  I was generally in Finance for most of my career.  I recently was laid off with retirement.  If you can handle stress well, it is a great place to work.  They have great benefits.  I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is, getting to know the people in many different departments and what they do.  The hardest part is the work.  It's ever changing.  It was a good long ride for me.  I transferred to ULA and back to Lockheed prior to my retirement."
good,Good program with lots of training and educational support. It is recommended for new college graduates. It is also a good venue for networking with peers.
good,"Great company, with a lot of different opportunities, but career growth is often very slow, and the pay is typically lower than other companies within the industry. Senior management seems out of touch with the boots on the ground, and the culture relies heavily on process (rather than people) to get things done. Despite it's shortcomings, Lockheed Martin boasts some very challenging and interesting roles, and an incredible group of intelligent and hardworking people."
good,Very traditional company that is trying to move it's over culture into the present and future. There is a lot a work to do and the environment is very friendly (most the time) but being the type of company we are (defense contractor) things move very slow at times. Best part of the job is that the stress is relatively low. But as with any company there are those who don't pull their weight yet some how mange to keep their jobs.
good,As a material handler I enjoy distruting materials throughout the shop floor for fabrication until completion and delivered to the customer. These fabricated parts are inspected and placed military aircraft
good,"The work was great the 5 plus years I worked with this company, Four of of five years made employee of the month and in the fifth year of employment the team I was assigned we made team of the year which is a great accomplishment with all the great talented team we competed with."
good,"Really a great company to work for (or I would not have been here 21 years). Pay and Benefits are excellent. Management is OK depending on the person."
good,Great place to work. fun fast paced competitive environment but where i was seemed like the industry was failing and drying up. would work here again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,Government contract with Department of  Homeland Security/  Transportation Security Agency for start up training's and management of the Airport security officers.
good,"Many different projects to work on - it helps if managers know you or your work so you can move around.  "
good,Great place to learn. Teams are knowledgable and want to create the best product possible. Quiet office with long work hours. Short deadlines are normal and requirements must be meet on time and flawless.
good,Basic union shop. You can succeed here. It is a union shop which means the environment is laid back as long as you follow instruction and do your job correctly.
good,The environment at Lockheed Martin is good. The benefits were very good for the job. The only negative is that Lockheed Martin has a tendency to lay off employees first when they need to save money.
good,"Relaxed workplace, Hours were good. Utilized my skills effectively. I developed a lot while I worked there. I was promoted quickly to stock clerk from a General Clerk II."
good,"I loved working at Lockheed Martin. I was stationed at Edwards AFB  as part of the F35 program and was immediately overwhelmed with all of the different defense contractors, military, and civilian personnel involved in his project."
good,"Great benefits and work-life balance. Very pigeon-held in the position or program or department, no advancement. Was over qualified and promised advancements."
good,The co-workers were great to work with my whole time at LM.  Work locations were great and working with and training the military was very fulfilling.
good,I learned that you are in control of your own career at LM. The large corporate environment offers a variety of options to advance your career. The culture also supports diversity of thought.
good,I enjoyed working at Lockheed and gained a wealth of knowledge after graduating college.  Lockheed had a true glass ceiling that kept women from moving up the ladder.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of time it took to get approval from NASA to do my job.
good,"good place to work, good pay, don't know how the 9/80 workweek is, was gone before it was implemented, seems workplace environment has changed somewhat in recent years."
good,"Over the last 12 years’ knowledge, skills, and experience has been focused in the following growth areas: Quality Assurance, Program Control, Proposal Management, Project Administration, Project Scheduling, Proposal Capture, Business Process Planning and Improvement, Cross company and small business collaboration, Small Business Strategic Partnering/Relationships Planning, and Operations Administration."
good,Lockheed Martin is a good company in a growing industry.  They have a lot of old and very young workers.  The older workers don't seem to understand the younger workers.
good,"Very good benefits and good work force diversity.  Good opportunity to seek other carrier possibilities."
good,Please see previous response. There is not anymore information that I can add from my previous response. I was never given the opportunity to have a discussion regarding my termination.
good,"I was terminated by my supervisor for ""Unprofessional Conduct"". I was never given any reason from my supervisor or HR as to what I did that was unprofessional. I have a text from my former Program Manager thanking me for my hard work, knowledge and professionalism while on the Iraq contract. My former Site Lead has done nothing but praise my work ethic, knowledge and leadership. I would be more than willing to provide them as references."
good,"Great job security"
good,"Was a new grad when started, learned a lot during the first few years. Not only on engineering skill, but how the overall structure of a traditional large corporation operation/function.  LM is a very structure company with traditional management style and governing rule."
good,"When I joined Lockheed, I was jazzed and there was laughter in the halls every day ... then came the layoffs and morale plummeted overnight. I hear it's still a place where folks are concerned about their future with the company - at least in the division n which I used to work.  That said, I'm proud to have worked for the company and of its products and would encourage folks to apply. I did like my time there - to a point ..."
good,"I ordered the raw material(bar, rod, tubing, sheets) that was needed to complete work on aircraft..Learned just how the planes were made start to finish.. Didn't really have any bad experiences with management..Very good workplace culture.. Really didn't have any hard part of job, very enjoyable place..Seeing aircraft start until it was rolled out as finished product.."
good,"As a contractor, this was an exceptional work environment. There are amenities on the grounds that make working there comfortable and relaxed. I was surprised to see some of the tech choices as they seemed a bit dated, but most web work was for internal sites so they were able to control the display a bit."
good,"A great place to work, get to meet some incredible people with a real passion for what they do. What they do here really matters and saves lives. Great work life balance. Your job here is whatever you want it to be."
good,High security. Worked with some great people taking care of the needs of the government. Dealt with the Blue Books created by the request government officials.
good,High expectations.  At a certain career level it becomes much more difficult to promote with out having to relocate.  The company places high expectations on performance.
good,I would recommend this company to anyone. Very good learning experience and they always deliver a quality product . I enjoy the time spent at Lockheed Martin.
good,They have average compensation/benefits but sacrifice employees job security and salaries in order to win bids on service contracts. The heavy lifters are very replaceable in order ensure their levels of profitability.
good,"The work hours was great.  learned new ideals and ways to safely work on certain vehicles. meet quite a few people sharing new ideals on maintenance.  At time the weather plays a part in completing a job. The flow of maintenance was fair, the parts request was a little slow. management was fair to the personal on hand.  Safety was marginal."
good,Each specific job with Lockheed Martin may have different requirements and job functions so specific information on standard days varies according to position.  LM does focus on developing the skills of the staff and offers ongoing training to allow continuous growth.
good,"The position was unfortunately short lived because they had a budget cut. Overall, I enjoyed having the opportunity to be behind the scenes and able to access different software to complete my job."
good,I like the customer service that I provided for the customer in getting what they needed and having the knowledge to do the job. This was a team effort.
good,Compensation is pretty good. The work is fast paced with tough deadlines. Management has expectations of frequently working overtime in order to meet deadlines.
good,"Depending which company within the corporation you worked for, working for LM could be great or it could be miserable.  Management could be great and be your best cheerleader or be miserable and make fun of you, especially when you were going through hard times and illness.  Overall. I left LM with very negative feelings.  Too much travel (about 70%) was expected by the time I left.  It was about 10% when I started, which is about my limit."
good,"Weekly, continuous work"
good,Company makes many fantastic fighter aircraft. Mechanically and electronically manufacture in house avionics for their fighters.
good,Its not a bad place to work but could always be better in their treatment and priority of workers. Management could be better to actually listen to their employees.
good,"I  have worked for Lockheed Martin the majority of my career since I graduated college, it's been around 13 years but now I'm apart of Leidos with the recent spinoff.  Lockheed has definitely seen a lot of changes throughout the years and they have had their fair share of layoffs, VESPs, etc.  It's been stable for the most part for myself, however; I will say they need to pay more attention to their employees and employee recognition.  I know it's hard to do with a large company like LM but this is the reason most people leave.  I have been fairly happy with LM over the years, however; I think they could pay more attention to their employees/work-life balance, etc."
good,"This was a contract position in a data center.  This particular job was a bit boring since the job involved reporting on server health and conditions on an hourly basis.  The work was tedious and mundane.  Luckily it was only temporary.,"
good,Supported IT needs of US House members and committees.  Great work environment.  An exciting place to work.  Free breakfast every Thursday.  Company is now known as Leidos DSI
good,"Worked mostly in an office by myself.  Work flow varied day to day, sometimes very busy, high paced, other days slow.  Management was great, very accommodating."
good,"Smart people, challenging job environment, poor tools.  Many people have been run through management positions.  Lots of swirl.  Great product, awesome technology!"
good,The hardest part of the job is to keep programs happy while maintaining security which is not always popular.  The job requires flexibility to manage several different problems ranging from minor to major at the same time.
good,"I started working here in 15 years ago, I was able to move up in rank. I have worked here for years and this is a great place to work.  I am looking for something new to try."
good,Lockheed Martin has closed the site that I worked at and has moved the work to another location in another state. I enjoyed working for the site while it was here
good,Micro managing hurt the culture of the work place. Professional advancement can only happen if willing to move out of state. Compensation leaves much to be desired. Detailed review of job descriptions during interview was different than what you end doing daily.
good,"Mid level management is great, a lot of change and turmoil in upper level management. decent pay, flexible schedule, advancement opportunities there, but not incredibly frequent."
good,some people are willing to show you things and some people will not because scared you will take there jobs. got to be in the in crew to move up.
good,Good place to work with many different opportunities as long as you're willing to move or work near one of the company's major site.
good,"I enjoy working for Lockheed Martin.  My work life balance is comparable to other companies.  The best part of my job is working with the people.  The hardest part of my job is working with current management, and I don't have the management direction I once had on the previous program I supported.  However, all in all I have appreciated working for this company."
good,Good challenging workplace although the tendency to get stuck in a narrow field of work. Expecially great working with space systems. Satellites are very exciting projects.
good,"Constant movement of equipment to support military customers. Some customers were considerate of employee workload, others were not."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with the engineers at Lockheed Advanced Technology labs. The work was challenging, the work environment friendly."
good,Worked with many talented people who were dedicated to the job. Long work week-over 60 hours a week. My job involved me in the war against terrorism.
good,"Projects are a bit disorganised, with a willingness to ignore proccedures. Management Rushing jobs going forward only creating problems later, forever stopping one job to start another. Hopefully as project matures this should get less and less. Ive certaily worked in worse places  7 out of 10 at moment  nice canteen facilities though"
good,I'm normally work between three different ships in different phases of testing. Very demanding to keep up with all the tasks. I normally putting in 50 to 60 hours per week.
good,"Working as a part of Lockheed Martin taught me a lot of real world, real life experience that has made me more marketable in a professional setting"
good,"LMCO is a great place to work!  Some difficulty getting promoted, but they do pay for performance.  Benefits have gotten significantly worse over the past 3 or 4 years.  Union environment, which is very counter productive."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a competitive employer that works to push its employees to their maximum potential. Their managers strive to take care of their people before themselves. One team, one fight is our motto in my office and we believe in it. The hardest part of the job is saying goodbye to people but the most enjoyable part is the turnover. Every employee you get to encounter, you learn something new from."
good,Great place to work for.  Company couldn't get work to keep work force employed. Management was interested in quality not quantity.  Wearing proper PPE was a must including being safety oriented.
good,"Lockheed Martin are overall a reasonably good company to work for.  however given the economic down town within Oil and Gas they are struggling somewhat in Aberdeen.  Had the company structure not been so tight they Aberdeen based staff would have been able to cross into other disciplines to sell staff and contracts, but they have been prevented from doing this and jobs have been lost."
good,Good place to work  people need more office space for managers public transpotation was easy work hours were fine telework agreement in place
good,"Supply Chain there is always something different and new to work and problem solve.  Large base of suppliers and multiple commodity areas to explore.  Bureaucratic and procedural based as any company with government contracts.  Supply Chain Management is driven towards metrics and data, which is positive if and when common sense is applied"
good,"Sikorsky was a nice place to work; a lot of good folks there.  The entire SE Group is arrogant and dysfunctional, but the manager is very good.  What really stood out to me was how little concern was given to the Air Force / Customer / Product and how much concern with their own careers; it prompted me to say in a meeting ""Doesn't the SE group even care?""  NO feedback accepted by SE; that part was frustrating as the leads were from Sales and other areas outside SE, did not listen, and thought they 'knew it all'.  The other groups I interacted with were all very good and conscientious.  "
good,"Support multiple networks with various levels of classifications."
good,"I've enjoyed working at Lockheed Martin, if you don't mind a rather long drive and not a lot of opportunity to rise in the company then this is a great job. The pay is decent and I loved working 4 10hr days a week, having every friday off was amazing! Overall good company."
good,"A typical day at work is spent installing electrical and avionics systems on military helicopters. I would still be there, but the contract ended."
good,"Most recent Lockheed Martin, time critical production environment."
good,"When I worked there, Lockheed Martin was a national asset.  I have never worked with a smarter, more dedicated group of people in my life."
good,"A typical day at work starts out with a morning meeting that revolves around the maintenance, parts requirements, and schedule of the day for the aircraft we are currently in possession of.  This is completed by a joint contract with another group.  I will then balance multiple budgets required by our contractual agreements, acquire tooling by the means of purchase orders or borrow from other sites, order parts, chemical (Hazardous Material), and any other support equipment requirements for the daily tasks at hand.  Monitor daily usage of parts stock, and create trends in usage spreadsheets.  Complete daily inspections of prior issues whether they are chemicals, consumables, or aircraft parts.  Maintain a constant view of calibrated equipment as well as cure dated chemical material for stock availability and waste stream management.  The hardest part of my day is finding time to sit down and read through my emails for any other site-specific tasks that will require my support or expertise.  These requirements can be as simple as shipping parts/supplies via carriers systems or maintaining a carrier spreadsheet with monthly or yearly cost and tracking information for price analysis for deliberation.  They may also include conversations with subject matter experts in regards to chemical waste streams and state specific laws and chemical requirements upon the facility in which we work at."
good,"Good employer, however, management has changed policy recently regarding promotions. It is now very difficult to advance past the first 3 salary grades, meaning if you start their early in you career you'll probably have to leave to advance."
good,"Enjoyed my years with Lockheed  Martin. I've been lucky enough to work on several interesting programs. The training programs have varied from project management, IT, help desk and training."
good,"Good pay for good work. Often during inclimate weather and temperatures. Good bunch of guys overall (flight line)."
good,Was on 5-weeks contract assignment while temping at Accountemps. Had good working experiences.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work. The cutting edge technology that we work with on a daily bases makes this a fun place to be. Typically I am responsible for testing of production flight hardware. This involves working with various departments including Engineers to ensure that the work is moving smoothly. My coworkers here are like a 2nd family. Working with the people in my department and getting the chance to work on what I have worked for are definitely  my favorite part of the job. "
good,Great people with alot of experience to share. Lots of opportunity for growth if you work hard.
good,Lockheed Martin is a very professional employer. They take care of their people and do what they say.
good,"Great co-workers, terrible management. Challenging job, worked many hours of overtime as you want to do your part to make your project successful."
good,Great pay...lack of guidance from management on the contract...lack of cohesive direction on designing instruction.
good,"I am employed with Lockheed Martin in a aeronautics plant. We interface with receiving to production for all aircraft parts sent to the F35, C130, F22, AND C5 production lines"
good,"Good work environment and friendly co-workers, safe work place and  good place to grow in this industry."
good,"Good company, bad management. Not a bad work day, but can be boring.  Co-workers are great and its hot!"
good,Nice place to work if you don't mind being a contractor. Fast paced environment.
good,"Interesting work, good benefits, average to lower compensation and retirement."
good,Excellent place to develop new skills and grow.  Especially fresh out of college
good,"A typical day at Lockheed Martin consist of hard work and dedication to the team effort in order to accomplish the main goal. Every day is a learning experience and the managment helps everyone better their future. "
good,"Nice place to work, but over recent years it has been challenging.  Company trying to get cheaper so job security is low."
good,"My typical day includes budget reviews, status checks, customer engagement, and proposal development."
good,"Nearly unmatched in the number and scope of awesome cool missions and programs."
good,Launched my career and learned new processes for multiple construction projects.  Company paid for my MBA.  Gave me the experience to grow.
good,"Good benefits, work-life balance, etc.  Was able to easily rotate around different areas of business operations."
good,"It was an overall good company to work for, not to mention the challenging assignments."
good,It was a good balance of family and work life. the people I work with is what made  a good kitchen.
good,Government contract. Company is subject to the environment of the client. Not very secure.
good,"Challenging and enjoyable work place. I used to look forward to go to work. Management changes are not well coordinated,"
good,"Technical administration including typing, editing, letter transcription, and reports."
good,"Pmc's to start the morning , when people have transportation they happy, yes when something goes wroung, work by myself, easy job, making people happy."
good,"I absolutely loved my job, i get my work done in a timely fashioned, enjoyed my co-workers. I have done mainteince, i love that  as well, I have also done production. Best part of my job, i finish  on time. It makes me feel great at the end of the day."
good,"Installed aircraft plumbing. "
good,"1. This is a very large, diverse corporation, so any opinion must be taken in that context."
good,"I would review proposals, and initiate inter division employee transfers."
good,LockHeed Martin is the great place to work. But Co-workers not so great.
good,Job is excellent and very high quality dedicated workers but management structure seems to be in constant flux and difficult to discern lines of reporting.
good,Working with teams of engineers and technicians. i am able to expand on my current skills learning unimaginable aspects of the Manufacturing process.
good,"Fair and Balanced Company, No chance of advancement as it is contract work."
good,A lot of knowledgeable people willing to teach and cross train. Great mentors.
good,"It was very rewarding to work on the programs, from breaking down the Ground Segment  requirements to Hardware Requirement Specifications.  Then turning those into High Level Designs and Detail Designs into the deliverable product.  Then supporting the full life cycle of Testing and system evaluation."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are a part of defending this countries freedom even if it's just a small part.  Management is fair and competant for the most part.  Job can be stressful at times as it is fast paced and dynamic.
good,"Develop and implement program quality plans, programs, and procedures using statistical quality control statistics, lean manufacturing concepts, and six-sigma tools and analyses. Ensures that performance and quality products conform to established company and regulatory standards. Review, analyze and reports on quality discrepancies related to assembly, process, mechanical, electrical and electro-mechanical systems. Investigates problems and develops disposition and corrective actions for recurring discrepancies. Interfaces with manufacturing, engineering, customer, vendor and subcontractor representatives to ensure requirements are met. Recommends corrective actions, dispositions and modifications."
good,"Sr. accounting specialist, processing of invoices and working customer service and working with the buyers and suppliers. Training to other team members and a huge asset to the company."
good,"Took really good care of getting people on board, and off boarding was really professional. IT tools were antiquated (at least at LM Aero), and the project management team let the airframe get over weight, lost a year to losing the weight, spent resources budgeted for other program uses into ""returning to green.""  LM Aero is infamous for not empowering mid-level managers- we had responsibility without authority. I could not spend any of my project money without going through layers of management. Getting work out on subcontract also was mired in company red tape and lack of prioritization. "
good,"Working for this organization was like working with close friends and family, enjoyable and bittersweet. Close knit groups came together to overcome obstacles and create paths forward to solve problems and initiate innovations."
good,Working is not just financial for me I enjoy accomplishing tasks on a daily basis
good,"Great place to work, decent working environment, better than average opportunity for job enhancement."
good,Company encouraged education and learning. Professionalism and ethical behaviour was emphasized. 
good,I've been with the company for a long time. It's a great place to start your career and the people are great.
good,"Great coworkers and I learned something new every day, working outside every day took some time getting useto. I fell so productive working this job."
good,dated program but still offers opportunity for gaining experience in military aircraft production
good,"Liked working here, but with government cuts, would want to find something with more job security"
good,"Very good company, contracting positions allow little room for advancement"
good,"The customer is never pleased unless you ask them, there is more work than people to do the work."
good,"Very interesting products , full of high tech gadgets a lot to learn."
good,"My work day varied a lot over my 16-year career at Lockheed. A lot of the time was spend in design and implementation of software, but there were times when we were testing and deploying new technologies where work would vary from hardware installation to checkout and running field tests."
good,A typical day working for Lockheed Martin was to support the DoD network. New protocol to troubleshoot and enhance network capabilities. Management was well versed and kept everyone aware of company goals as well as customers expectations and mission statements. The hardest part of the job was the commute to and from work.
good,Challenging position with opportunity to work with state-of-the-art technologies
good,The most challenging piece of this job were the constant chenges in leadership.
good,"Enjoyed the technical challanges, but to really be recognized, one had to be ""in the club""."
good,"Great work. Great projects. Very work focused, not fun like some other environments I have worked in."
good,"Working at Lockheed Martin was a great expereince. My co-worker was great to work with. We work as team, and communicated very well together."
good,Easy to stay busy and let the day go by pretty quick. Co-workers are great but be prepared for the politics.
good,"Work was always challenging, and caused me to learn how to multi-task. I enjoyed the opportunities to learn new systems and the Blackhawk helicopter is one of my favorite all time helicopters."
good,Contractor at this company so didn't get to learn about the company as a whole much.
good,"interesting work, good projects to bad it is so dependant on the budget whims of the government"
good,Lockheed Martin is a great company to work and provide opportunity for advancement
good,Very busy and non-stop moment job. The hardest part of my day is getting everything done in an timely manner. I love my co-workers because they're very supportive group of people. Typical day is me getting to work at 6:30am and production are asking for help. My management team is creative and supportive. The most enjoyable part of the my job is seeing my product flying in the air.
good,"While trying to implement lean and constantly interacted with all levels of employees, from shop mechanics to VP level. I always felt the most at home when I was on the floor. One of things that I really enjoyed was teaching lean exercises to everyone. I felt that not only did my audience learn something about lean, but I learned something something from my audience as well. While I love teaching and preparing efficient layouts perhaps the most difficult challenge is the paradigm shift that is associated with lean."
good,Working in Energy Efficiency especially working with schools was very rewarding. This contract was not renewed there will no loinger be a Portland office.
good,"Overall as a contractor, I enjoy my position here. Most days are slower than I would prefer. I do wish that my position was more challenging; and that I was able to gain more usable skills and/or use those brought from previous positions."
good,Good job great overall company but management at this site has a narrow mind of though and takes lots of credit for lower level mechanics ideas and gives no credit to the original creators of ideas.
good,Nice Company to work for. Good benefits. A typical work day (classified). I have great Co workers. Management needs improvement.
good,"My emediate supervisors were great. Those further up the line I had little contact with, though whenever I needed information, they were quick to respond. Health benefits were great, Work places were very regimented. Parking was a hassle.. Some of my jobs were different and required additional research. A lot of it was repetitive."
good,Work was very challenging
good,I was able to expand my research methodology to include legal terminology and software programs designed specifically for the legal field.
good,"Worked with customer to resolve issues. Worked with co-workers to define issues, check procedures and processes. Worked with upper management for rewrites, and new procedures. Provided audits for various sites of Lockheed Martin."
good,Learned to work with different backgrounds with different job experience. Management is available but not interactive. Liked the most that I was not micromanaged and able to handle my own decisions.
good,several meetings throughout the day based on shortages in supply chain
good,"Typical day would start with crew meeting and job asighnments. Job asighnments would range from the most small touch up to painting the entire plane. I gained a good amount of knowledge about the aircraft industry, and how it works.Management could have been a little better. They were always pushed by deadlines, and most times were a little frazzled. Could not have asked for a better group of guys to work with, we always had each others back. Kind of like an extended family. The job was not that hard, it could be hard, but only if you made it so yourself. Good place to work, great benefits, and family oriented. Good work environment never a dull day. Safety and health of employees always had priority. Over all I would give Lockheed an eight out of ten."
good,"Great job stability for work force, but LM is very poor in providing advancement for their employees."
good,Self paced and free to create and learn. Management can be micro controlling at times but work/life balance is key. This company does well with government contracts.
good,Lockheed Martins is a great company to work for. They are a top of the line company that is always pushing the bounds of what we can do with technology.  The way they work is they use the old things they have done so well and upgraded it so that it is new and improved. Now that being said their culture is in need of an upgrade from the old ways of doing things.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place for junior technical people to get their feet wet in the Aerospace industry. In general, the pay is good and job security is a plus.  Plenty of opportunity for less experienced employees to work for different programs and for mid-career individuals to grow, particularly if they are willing to relocate."
good,"This is the perfect place for new people in the workforce, the disabled, & retired veterans. It's family friendly, easy work till your own retirement."
good,"Typical day at work involves systems viability checks, communications checks, interaction with internal and external customers, and report generation."
good,Follow the rules and you can hide out forever. Job security at its finest. Career advancement is spotty at best. There are paths but they aren't super clear and information is sparse. They are going through a lot of re-organization to gain acceptance by the younger engineer crowd that expects a Google type place of work.
good,"This is a place that people retire from because management is so relaxed and rarely fire anyone in the Machining Operations Center. There were 5 people that have retired in 2019 from this department with over 25 years working here. There are 4 more with over 30 years here. The work is too easy for me to the point that it is boring. I have nothing against this company, just want to be challenged."
good,"Lockeed is a fun and and exciting place to work where we are advancing existing technologies and creating new ones every day. The culture is relaxed, but with an attention to detail that needs to be met. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with."
good,This is a good place to work if you are after a good lifestyle and not money. Further training is available to improve yourself for the position your holding or to work yourself up to leadership positions.
good,As a inspector there was a lot of responsibility but I enjoyed working with some great people. Unfortunately cost of living goes up but not your pay. Benefits were great at the beginning.. Overall Lockheed was a good opportunity for me.
good,"overall it was a good experience high pace need to learn quick and quick turn over. a jack of all trades, master of none type deal and if you do it once then they think you are an  expert in that area."
good,"Lockheed Martin has helped me develop my Engineering skills in Systems Engineering, Integration, and Test.  On some programs I have been able to do very cool things in cool places.  Overall Lockheed is a good place to work if you are on the right program that fits for you."
good,"I have finished multiple degrees working while for Lockheed Martin, and the company doesn't have a program to take advantage of employees that improve their skills and knowledge through continuing education. Working here is a constant learning experience, they are constantly innovating. The company is transitioning to a culture of inclusion and collaboration, yet many legacy employees fight the progress continuous improvement programs provide. This is a good company that could benefit from capitalizing on motivated employees."
good,"Pay is barely enough to survive on, benefits are good. overtime available weekly. advancement is slow and take years to get. Good place to work overall."
good,"Lockheed is nice but they need better health benefits and increase salaries and not pay employees every week and go to bi-weekly.nice company, you are very busy."
good,The company and union do not get along. The union is a union in name only...they do very little to support the employees and have no backbone to stand up to the company.
good,They listen and allow you to be what you are hired to be. I am a man of few words but this site wants me to write more than 150 characters to be able to click the finish button.
good,Just be very careful whom you speak to. Make sure that leadership understands what you are trying to accomplish as it pertains to personal growth. Lastly do your work and go home.
good,"Overall, I think Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for with many opportunities for advancement. Often times, a great company becomes less appealing if everyone isn't working towards the same goal."
good,"During my time working for Lockheed Martin, I learned how to read schematics, find errors in drawings, and assembly/disassembly of radar components. Although the salary was rather low, the job provided me the opportunity to learn important skills and receive certifications in things such as soldering."
good,It was a great experience as a CWEP. THey give a lot of mentorship and you get every other Friday off. Very competitive pay as well great for students going to UCF
good,"Good company to work for. Being a large corporation there are multiple opportunities to look for growth, and opportunities to use corporate program to learn more/advance you knowledge."
good,"If its too good to be true, it probably is. The company as a whole is really good, but I was hired for a job that didn't exist. The managers didn't really care, except for their own advancement."
good,"Lockheed made sure our operations were being done correctly.  Standard Operating Procedures were followed to the letter in most situations; however, they should have been followed in ALL situations."
good,Lockheed Martin is a good place to work with diverse and interesting technical challenges.  The teams are dynamic and friendly to be a part of.  The part of Lockheed Martin that I worked at was using Agile development and the team members participated in planning and scheduling of tasks and story points.
good,top firma mit vielen benefits.und vielen erweitete möglichkeiten
good,"I successfully architect Sharepoint environment and played the role of technical lead for over 9 years. When I came to Lockheed Hits program the SharePoint farm was just picking up. I upgraded the three existing farm to SP2007 service pack 2, Later on I designed, built and upgraded SP2007 to SP2010 using the database attach method. In the subsequent years I managed to move our on premises farm to Azure. Currently I managed a hybrid SP2016 farm with over 14000 users."
good,"Good company to work for, good benifits and had company pension plan. Takes a long time to advance especially from a union position to salary. As a union member there, no flexibility in work schedules, no company sponsored events."
good,.Fun and friendly place to work. Family oriented. Company could improve on training program. I found most new hires were being trained with other new hires. Relaxed environment. Company will recognize employees for hard work and productivity.
good,"Good pay, old school structure, 9 hour workdays for every second Friday off is overrated. Management is alright, company culture is a bit dated in the age of new tech."
good,"There are too many safety protocols. A two hour job takes eight hours to do. These policies are set in place to produce a quality product and avoid accidents. This company is not for you, if you want to get the job done QUICK."
good,Great place to work...Learned  alot while working there. Worked with little supervision. Upper Management was great to work under. Pay was great. Would work for LM again.
good,"No idea on a review, been 20 years since i worked for Lockheed Martin.  Job was fine, pay was so-so based on government wage determination.  Management not so good."
good,"Great company to work at but, there just was limited promotion potential. They had 5 or 6 Supervisor/Team lead slots and a couple slots working with providers; However, there was about 100 Quality Assurance (QA's) personnel competing for those slots."
good,The OJT program could be far more robust in order to make employees more knowledgeable and productive.  If they had a dedicated training program with dedicated teachers the quality of production would be greater and the risk of discrepancies would be reduced.
good,"Started LM Missiles and Fire Control Orlando about 15 years ago (6 years as a PM).  The last 5 years have been a noticeable slide in the overall environment.  More nepotism and a move away from doing the right thing for the customer.  The company pays lip service to memos from the Government asking for improvement in product and to raise the bar utilizing tools (agile is not well implemented), but no real change is forthcoming.  Director level and Sr Manager level are more interested in timelines and cost at the expense of quality.  This leads to overall project failures (repeatedly), overworked team members and a killed moral.  Many people have been retiring as quickly as possible and they all talk about the culture shift.  I hope they can turn it around because there are truly good people and the product does drive passion."
good,I saw a lot of people passed over because they are still old school when it comes to hiring only college degrees and security clearance vs.certification based training.
good,"Very good working culture. Professional people and excellent at what they do. Big complex, good cafeteria, nice area. Overall a more pleasant environment than first thought."
good,"Structured towards Military style aviation programs, meaning many different highly focused facets of aviation maintenance. Lots of experienced personnel."
good,"Work consists of the 9/75 process, one week of 34 hours, the second of 41 hours. "
good,"To much emphasis on degree instead of the applicants vocational skills. If skill or individual is needed the open up the purse strings and get them the necessary clearance to get to work."
good,was hired as an instructor for fire control/ sonar system after retiring from navy that was on its final years. taught last 3 maintenance courses offered by lockheed martin
good,"Productive workplace, unfortunately the worksite was in a very small secluded town."
good,Fast pace work environment which requires you ability to adapt to changes. Friendly work environment with a strong sense of purpose of their customer base.
good,"Fast paced, must be able to multitask.  Lots of meetings but expected to make up up work missed from meetings.  Lots of moving around for select population."
good,"Challenging and fast paced environment. Aircraft technology was complex, but intuitive and made a work day feel accomplished. Facilities were adequate and felt safe."
good,good place for young engineers to work. lot of opportunities. i review drawings. work can get a bit boring. Traveling can get very hectic sometimes...
good,LM is a great place to work.  There are many departments and depending on the department you work in and your managers (usually multiple) will depend on your experience.  I am privileged and glad I worked there.  But it is hard to advance and my department was changing it's philosophy and restructuring.  I chose to leave.
good,"I was the supervisor for the area.  No management supervision was necessary although it was available.  Typical days was busy with various challenges to complete work tasks.  Management had favorites and had no problem showing it.  Friends of managers were advanced quicker than other qualified employees.  These individuals did not know how to do the job they were promoted to but that did not matter to management.  If you were not in the ""fav"" position, you got very little.  I liked my job because I did not have to deal with management.  They also did not want to get involved in our work because they did not know it or want to.  I liked the people that I work with and engineer that we helped.  They were very gracious and kind.  They appreciated the efforts in which it took to complete their requests."
good,"Great place to work, great pay and benefits.  Employees need to plan ahead to ensure that they have future projects to work on or face possibly being caught in a reduction in force or having to relocate to a different area where work is."
good,"I enjoyed my years at LMSC both as a contractor and employee. I was given some very challenging projects and put together a quality design/build team, LMSC team and general contractor team. For this I was the ""go to guy"" for projects that need to be done fast. I was awarded numerous accolades from Corporate and/or division for my work."
good,"Because of flexible time, I used to come early in the morning, it help me resolving the technical problem which I was stuck at the previous evening. I learned to extract design specification from system requirements and implement them by choosing appropriate components, Of-the-Shelf hardware, interface designing with numerous buses in order to satisfy system requirements. I designed them that includes hardware as well as software, in case a program-able logic device is used. simulate them using VHDL or Verilog. When a board needs to be designed because custom or requirement, architecture the board, choose the components, constructed the block diagram and had a design (Peer Review), used electronic system to develop, instructed them to build, tested them, prepared test-plan for verification and validation. Integrated all the pieces of hardware into system"
good,Enjoyed the culture and benefits. Work life balance was great and management was always helpful. Unfortunately many cutbacks due to the industry. Great place to work if you don't mind constant changes.
good,"Management can be disconnected to their employees. Work life good. Enjoyed people I work with. Facilities are old and out dated. Pay is good, and so is benefits"
good,"My day usually consists of updating virus definitions on several machines.  Creating user accounts and resetting passwords.  System administration duties.  Also, assist with software installation updates."
good,LM is a great company to work for and put on your resume. The advancement structure is somewhat antiquated and salary increases are not as generous as others.
good,"I actually came back to Lockheed Martin after working for other companies over the course of a few years."
good,"The work was good and the job was as described in its requisition."
good,"Great place to work! Learned a lot, I also brought a lot to the table. My manger was fantastic and the hardest part of the job was juggling competing contracts!"
good,"Throw you under-the-bus if expedient. How many characters does it take? Benefits were great, but when they needed someone to blame for a corporate mistake, they wasted no time."
good,Always have work to do. Benefits changed and now they are essentially bare minimum according to law. Management doesn't mentor employees or provide feedback unless they are salary. Hourly workers are viewed differently than salary.
good,I enjoyed working for Lockheed Martin. Very good people. If it was closer to home I would of went back. I was there around a year and a half. I received 4 works of severance pay when I was laid off. Still friends with my manager and supervisor.
good,"The value the skills of their employees and look to promote from within when possible."
good,"I was largely left to my own devices, as I worked remotely and coordinated my activities with another office on the east coast. Company benefits were great. Salary was good, it could have been better, but I can't complain. Budgets are shrinking, so I cannot blame the company for that."
good,Lockheed Martin has a long history of big strategic programs and is a dominant player in the markets they reside in.  They often have trouble shifting gears on programs that aren't at the strategic level.
good,"Very fast paced but rewarding, just not a lot of opportunity for advancement in my department. Would love to work here full time, it is a long drive for me and I would like to find something closer to home."
good,"fast-paced work environment  on the leading edge of Space technology"
good,If you want an easy desk job this is not the company for you. But if you want something that will have a new challenge to solve almost every day. Its the job for you.
good,"Lockheed Martin was a great place to work, great benefits, and hard work. Supervisors were very knowledgeable, and showed no favoritism. Would recommend to others to apply"
good,I only work as a subcontractor so I'm not sure of any more of the benefits Lockheed had to offer. I've never had any problems when it came to official documents or payroll.
good,"a typical day at lockheed for me would be clocking in, checking emails, shipping and receiving parts, making sure the engineers and assembler have what they need, assisting my supervisor, on fridays I preform administrative work (file, make copies etc). the management team are okay, they just not very good at communicating. it sometimes screws with my work flow and would have to do things last minute when i'm have a dozen other things to work on. the culture here is okay lol everyone pretty much keeps to themselves and focuses on their work. the hardest part about working here would be... keeping up with the drafters lol the most enjoyable part of working here is the peace and quiet, not having someone over your shoulders constantly, your basically your own boss lol as long as you do you job effectively and proficiently you shouldn't have any problems."
good,I only worked there a short time as we were an employee owned company and Lockheed bought us. They were accommodating as we adjusted to their corporate environment.
good,I liked the job it was just a temporary seasonal job for employees of companies to do benefit enrollment. They bring in like 300 employees and keep like 2 at the end of the 3-4 month mark.
good,Good company. Unfortunately sold our civil IT division. Enjoyed a typical work day. Good opportunity to learn various new skills. Our clients sales and supply domain offered to improve skills from as a developer to change role as a senior business analyst. At time multiple roles as a developer and business analyst
good,"The 9x80 work schedule and flex time are wonderful benefits."
good,Good work life balance. Poor salary and benefits. Slow paced. Difficult to advance. Compete with peers during performance reviews. Many incumbent workers that have been with the company for decades. Dated facility.
good,"new programs coming in, very long days, with lots of bad eggs in  management. Too many meetings, management too political and surrounded by snakes. focus has changed from technology advancement to shareholders profit margin."
good,I liked working with the aircraft and i liked m co-workers. The nature of the aircraft business is cyclic so there are periodic layoffs. I relocated to m home town for a more stable situation.
good,"Culture a little different than the normal corporate world, but not micro-managed and not too much overtime is needed. Pay could be better, but it was a contract to hire position."
good,"Good, learning a new set of skills. The program is old so it is a bit cumbersome but efforts are being made to improve the system. Overall a good place to work with a lot of opportunities."
good,"A lot of opportunities, but did not work with me after I repatriated back from UK to the US. Treated me fine while working overseas for them, but had difficulty being looked at by hiring mangers once I repatriated."
good,"Lockheed is a good company to work for. It is large and there are locations around the world.  It is a little high stress since we ar a government contractor, but overall not bad."
good,Lockheed Martin (LM) is a good company with great benefits. I enjoyed my time at LM but decided to accept a higher paying position with SAIC. I would go back to LM if a position becomes available.
good,It’s fine just like any other large government contractor. It’s a big company I go to work the end. Why do I need to fill this out if I am looking to leave. It’s Lockheed what more need to be said.
good,Challenging work environment. Excellent benefits. Promotes achievement.  Encourages degreed persons & provides incentives to further education. Paid time off. Hourly work force union represented.
good,Good company. MFC is not the best division. Prefer Space Systems or RMS. I recommend working here and they have excellent management and leadership training.
good,"I was a contract employee there for a defined purpose and term."
good,Most people are truly committed to their job and the company.  Ability to work on programs that are unique are available to employees.  The working environments are generally good.  Management can be lack luster at some locations.
good,"Face paced, interactive, technically based atmosphere where groups of individuals come together to further along projects and programs. I learned many new things regarding projects, deliverable schedules and project planning. The atmosphere was intense and very demanding. The most enjoyable part was always working with the people toward a common goal."
good,The company went through changes and sold off  the segment of the business I worked for. This caused some confusion and in the end the contract I was employed with ended. They do a good job at attempting to find another place for those displaced but ultimately I could not wait for that process. Would love to work for them again.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a behemoth of a company with 5 business units spread out worldwide. It is the largest defense contractor in the US. Since it's largest and most important client is DoD,  the day-to-day marketplace does not have an impact on the business. "
good,"I worked for this company for a short time due to contract coming to an end.  Overall, Lockheed-Martin is a great company and is known throughout the IT field as a great company."
good,"Overall, Lockheed is a good company to work for and if you get a relocation packed, it is wroth thinking about and if not, that can be a make or break deal since the cost to relocate yourself can be stressful if you end up losing money that you can not recover."
good,Work environment is good and co-workers are typically nice.  Management tends to be robotic.  There are lots of opportunities for advancement but sometimes managers pre-determine who will fill positions.
good,"Typical day was monitoring network connectivity, addressing PC and network issues, as well as network infrastructure build-outs in new buildings."
good,Lockheed Martin is a very competitive place to work.  At the management level long work hours are to be expected.  The pay is very competitive and there are many opportunities for advancement.  Job security varies and is contract dependent.
good,I have been associated with LM for a considerable amount of time over multiple programs and have been impressed with the product they produce.   That is why I pursued them for post military employment.
good,"The atmosphere was what you might expect. Working in an atmosphere that relies on government contracts - can be stressful. Most employees are very professional.Depending on which section you work in, you may have more job security in some areas more than others."
good,"Working as a contractor it was hard to get the internal management and the contracting company to offer pay raises or job advancement. Job duties were assigned by internal LM managers. Contracting company was never apprised to the increasing levels of duties/responsibilities. I assume as a direct-hire this wouldn't have been a problem."
good,"My internship at Lockheed Martin was very helpful in my career. I learned a lot while working there. My fellow employees were always friendly. Work could be slow at times, but I usually always had something I could pursue. Management was very understanding and guided me throughout my internship."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good place to work and gain some experience.  However, long term employment at the company should be carefully considered.  Most people, especially more senior people, are often not promoted and in some cases they are let go before they're ready for retirement for no apparent reason based upon performance.  If you're a more senior-level professional, get what you want in terms of pay and position going in and have a good 3-5 year backup plan, prior to accepting a position there.  If you're a college new hire, ... it's a good place to start, but don't stop looking for better opportunities when you get there.  3-5 years was typical for most college new hires when I worked there.  Just my advice."
good,"worked on many types of systems, computer, hydraulic, propane and pneumatic systems. preformed preventative maintenance on all these systems. performing all maintenance for Navy trainers."
good,"Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), Affirmative Action (AA), and diversity are terms that are distinctively different, yet closely related. They each play an important role in establishing an equitable, productive, inclusive and diverse work environment and at Lockheed Martin, we are fully committed to ensuring that our workplace incorporates all three. We are also dedicated to providing an environment that is free from threats, violence, bullying and abusive or intimidating conduct."
good,"Securing commercial landing rights and service authorizations, setting up pre-launch strategic partnerships, develop proposals for new market access initiatives, sales & acquisition planning"
good,"At Lockheed you become an integral cog in the wheel. You are definitely held and measured to your job responsibilities by metrics and peer reviews.  Don't be surprised that you'll become a Trainer of younger interns, It's best if you ""Know Your Stuff"" because you can and will be pressed to perform. And, as with all larger companies, keep your head down and ears open. Politic can play an essential role in you daily goings on. The challenges are many and those are where you'll get the most reward."
good,"Typical work day is long yet doable"
good,"Money is good, hours vary depending on company needs. Can get stressful at times but no worse then any other company that has to deal with the dept. of defense"
good,The best part about working at Lockheed Martin was the 9/80 work schedule.  Management could at times be out of touch with their employees.  Work at times can be tedious with all of the rules and regulations a government contractor has to deal with.
good,"My first job is at a electronic lab and it was structured while my last job wasn't to where I didn't exactly know what I would be doing from day to day.  We have a lot of time doing computer based training, which is good in one way. but it takes time away from completing deadline tasks."
good,"Not Available for comment."
good,I do not want to write a review and I resent the fact that you are requiring it.  There for I give you nothing of value in this review.  I have no idea why you require this.
good,"Good people, good work life, stability is an issue due to Govt. contracting and poor management decisions. Depend on work from other Lockheed facilities who dont want to send work to Greenville due to conflicting priorities and union pressure"
good,Layoffs can follow cyclical trends for defense spending.   Pay and benefits are market competitive.   Employees able to achieve work life balance.  Lack of career opportunities.
good,"After working in Facilities for 13 years, I always enjoyed the diverse groups within the team. We were always encouraged to check in with our team to see if they needed our selective talents."
good,"Great place to work.  Many options and paths you can follow.  Make your own way."
good,The area I worked in allowed the flexibility and encouraged one to define their own roles and take on new initiatives and test ideas.  Support of division leadership to offer improvement suggestions that were taken seriously
good,I have had a good career here at Lockheed. I started on the factory floor and advanced while going to college. Lockheed paid for all of my college courses.
good,Fast pace and rewarding duties and responsibilities ... management style was too controlling - not understanding when the numbers was not favorable ... nickel and dime projects/government ...
good,"Lockheed Martin used to be better, but the contracts in the naval area became biddable, and to be competitive, the employee has suffered. "
good,I loved my job and worked for 16 years for a dedicated and loyal company. I provided computer assistance for all DOD and Air Force personnel worldwide.
good,"Good company although I am not a fan of large cubicle areas and the lack of the ability to establish a lab work area. I appreciate working with a team however, when I have my tasks to perform, I prefer to work isolated. This was not always an option in the work environment. I enjoyed having standard practices and policies in place in order to ensure everything was done properly however this also fostered a level of inefficiency that I did not always agree with. A typical day involved  a combination of office/design work, working in a lab environment, status/planning meetings, working with or at outside test labs, or conferencing with customers. No two days were alike and I enjoy that type of atmosphere to an extent."
good,"Good old boy system well established. Management needs more training to keep employees motivated and rewarded for going above and beyond to get job done,"
good,"Good teamwork atmosphere with plenty of help from co-workers and supervisor in areas new to me.  The work environment was usually running at a medium to fast pace with everyone pitching in. Unfortunately, the office was ""joined at the hip"" with another office in Omaha, NE.  Someone there irritated the customer to such a degree that their contract was cancelled with the immediate result that our portion was as well. Our entire office was layed off and no longer exists."
good,"Provide technical and maintenance support to the SOUTHCOM Washington Office.  Performs the installation, testing, and repair of computers, printers, Black Berries and network systems to ensure the accuracy of the equipment.  Assists users in resolving user problems with Microsoft programs, printer operations, and all other user related problems.  Performs preventive maintenance, troubleshooting, modifications, and fault isolation on all equipment maintained at the Washington Office"
good,"I have technical experience with knowledge with fighter aircraft platform interchangeability requirements, drawings and specifications, special technology requirements and standard structural repair on the various flight test programs at Edwards Air Force Base and at Marietta Georgia. I had responsibility for modifications, installations of test articles. I have over 1000 hours of CATIA experience."
good,"I worked for Lockheed at night, we just sat at our desks and did our jobs there was not a lot of conversation with others, we tried to process as many tickets as  we possible could at night."
good,"A typical day will start with getting ready to instruct gathering materials and prepping the room.  You are surrounded by some of the most knowledgeable people in the Aegis combat systems community. It is a constant challenge to keep up to date on the latest changes and incorporate them into the lessons.  The management on-site is demanding and helpful, they want their people to succeed.  The culture of the work place is very inclusive and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is digging through various resources to find information and keeping lesson topics up to date and pertinent.  For me the most enjoyable part of the job is being in front of students and watching them grasp a concept that is difficult or finally realizing that something they thought was hard was able to be accomplished with a little bit of effort."
good,"Overall the company is great to work for. Opportunities to transition between roles, assignments, and functions are an extreme positive. The leadership focus is transforming each organization."
good,"Typical large corporation"
good,"Fast pace, working to get projects completed on time was hard. Planning was a bit to much, a lot of meetings.  Parts at times were hard to get, not helping with project completion."
good,I always exceeded expectation. Enjoyed working with all of my co-workers. The Lockheed company was different but enjoyed working with them while at Fort Knox .
good,Lockheed Martin provides their employees with a positive work environment and working culture. Every employee has a sense of purpose and a form of enjoyment when they go to work everyday.
good,"Workers work people that don't work play on phones all day, workers get talked to to work harder faster, ones on phones and do nothing all day nothing done to them."
good,Observed strong talent development over ten years at this firm. Very strong financial and ethical values and focus on inclusion. Missions are very strategic and leverage high technology
good,Spent too much time getting parts released into their system. This could be done by non-engineer personal. To get parts into their system it required 10-15 sign-offs and the people signing off took way too much time doing so.
good,Good place to work. Great location here in the Low Country of South Carolina. The operations tempo is very high as we are supporting the Marine Corps training squadron VMFAT-501.
good,"Very collegial environment where engineers were given wide latitude to develop products and solutions for projects and customers. Direct management very supportive with resources and flexibility in daily schedules."
good,"Enjoyed working with suppliers and customers."
good,"The work was very satisfying in that I worked on the very latest military and commercial aircraft. I still look up into the sky when a fighter jet flies overhead with a sense of pride."
good,"LM is an excellent engineering and technology company. They do their best to remain agile but unfortunately have a very engrained culture and hierarchy that can be difficult to work through.  Once you get past the usual corporate issues, LM is an excellent place to work with flexible schedules and generus compensation/benefits."
good,Always something to do so your not sitting around. co-workers are very helpful everyone is part of the team. Certain products can be challenging to learn but you can ask for help and someone is right there to answer any questions.
good,Good overall. I really did not appreciate LM fully and have grown to miss it. I think you only get that once. But all in all it was a great place to worl.
good,"Great place to work, lots of smart people. Ability to impact process and change approach. "
good,During my contract as a Delivery IT Business Analyst with LM supporting Royal Mails automated  mail sorting operations I was busy from the day I started to the day I left and enjoyed every minute of it. Worked with a great team and sad to go.
good,it was an enjoyable experience.  friendly people that were willing to share their knowledge.  Management was understanding of personal needs.
good,". Cubicle culture "
good,"I have enjoyed my time with this company. The work/life balance is great, and the compensation is top notch. The culture could use some work, but I'm not too fond of sitting in a cubicle for long periods of time, so maybe I'm"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for but has struggles with the government budget and the ability of its customers to provide consistent work streams.   For that reason, Lockheed Martin is pulling out of the more volatile services contracting where the government often seeks personnel through the contract vehicle and treats them as an extended workforce versus allowing the prime to complete a mission outlined in the contract.  Lockheed Martin will be a great company once it is no longer supporting the poorly managed agencies.  "
good,great place to work the people are great to work with you will learn a lot about the different vehicles we build at this site
good,"this company cares for workers."
good,"Provide comprehensive financial forecast, budget and analysis to executive leaders to help guide in operational decision-making. Skilled in collaborating with all members of the organization to achieve business and financial objectives"
good,"A typical day at work would involve contacting customers, working with other divisions all striving to maintain and grow the business."
good,Lockheed Martin offers a wide variety of jobs that will enable its employees to gain a broad range of skills. There are plenty of opportunities to movie around within the company.
good,"The company has a flex schedule, but it truly depends on the team/project you work on. I have been able to work on several different programs and travel occasionally to meet face-to-face with customers."
good,"Compensation is rewarding however advancement is difficult as you reach higher grade levels.  At times the work expectations can result in a negative impact to home life.  Work is assumed to take a front seat to home life, even during times when your family is in need."
good,Lots of different opportunities at Lockheed Martin.  Management teams are great and really care for their people.  CEO is a great example of leadership.
good,The manufacturing environment is great to work in but the growth opportunities are limited. The benefits are descent. My co-workers are great and we have a teaming environment.
good,"All in all, not a bad place to work. The pay is reasonable, the people are generally great people, and there's plenty of work to be done. The process is a bit overbearing, and some of the products are poorly managed, but generally everything is good."
good,Lockheed Martin provides employees who are just coming out of college a great opportunity to build a broad skill set which gives them a nice foundation to start their career.
good,"Fast paced and interesting work"
good,"LM provides multiple opportunities to diversify your experience through challenging assignments. The key is to be proactive and continuously challenge leadership to enable you to accept new tasks. "
good,"I have mastered my job responsibilities and am looking for a new challenge. "
good,I loved the people there.  I have always liked cleaning I just had to move at the time to a different town. I cleaned offices and breakrooms.
good,"Lockheed Martin has decided to eliminate its Information Systems and Global Solutions business.  The IT services business will be spun off, and the remaining parts involved in technology development will be merged into the Space Systems and Mission Systems and Training business units."
good,Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems ceased to exist in the late 1990s.  It became part of the Information Systems and Global Solutions business unit.
good,Learned to press on.  The hardest part of the job was to slow down and wait for management to catch up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer smile about the work I have completed.
good,"working at a satellite branch Im not sure I got a full taste of the company culture. Co workers were great, no chances for advancement"
good,"Very positive place to work everyone is about they business while working. also great teamwork. Managerment team is the greatest but some of the management team need to be let go,lack of teamwork."
good,"Most of the positions called for an individuals with strong communication with and technical skills. The company also required  knowledge in engineering drawings, and production specifications. It was my pleasure to experience, professionalism, excellent communication, and dedication to ownership."
good,Fun group of engineers and co-workers to work with. Unfortunately non appreciation for contract workers by management. Lack of communication to staff on the front line.
good,"As an Engineering Aide, I worked with a great team to develop the work instructions needed to get the job completed in a timely manner by reviewing the customers requirements along with any outstanding requirements required by the FAA. The Production team members were also involved with any discrepancies that were brought to my attention that required to be fixed for future repairs."
good,Great company with decent benifits. To many people trying to get their hands in the mix and not taking advice from aircraft maintainers with decades of experience.
good,"Learned how to receive in and stock parts."
good,I worked at Lockheed Martin for about a year. The work was interesting but i didn't like the fact that the company was too big. It took almost 6 months to get my internal alignment (with my busines unit) corrected.
good,"Supportive company/managers. Cares about customers and employees. Good benefits, marketable salaries, various work locations."
good,Benefits and culture is sufficient to warrant employment there. Many job opportunities to apply for every day if the current position is not sufficient to you needs.
good,"Lockheed Martin is an excellent engineering firm that places a great emphasis on high standards of work and engineering rigor.  Their commitment to their customer base is apparent in the dedication of their workforce, and this culture is spread across all contracts."
good,Lockheed Martin employees are ethical and believe in their work.  The amazing technologies they design and complex problems they solve is truly inspiring.
good,As an intern this  was a wonderful place to work. Kept a decent watch over what I was doing but not overbearing. Gave decent type of work allowed me to experience new things.
good,"Very aggressive schedules, very flexible. Work remotely when needed. There are many opportunities in this company for advancement. Management is fair. Due to competitive market and lost of contracts, i have to seek employment elsewhere. Overall Lockheed Martin is a very good company."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Lockheed Martin, I learned a lot and there was a fair balance between family and work.  The people for the most part was friendly."
good,"I enjoyed working in the mail room - working with customers, providing the most professional customer service and being highly complimented."
good,"Lockheed is a decent place to work and most of the managers will work with you depending on your needs."
good,I enjoyed working for Lockheed Martin.  Benefits were good and advancement was possible.  Contracted ended and I wasn't able to be placed.
good,A great place to work.  Work life balance and initial training the best.  Typical work day is 8 - 9 hours of rewarding work.  Career advancement is extremely difficult in the Owego location due to many qualified individuals with not enough slots to fill.  Co-workers and peers are the solid foundation of a great place to work.
good,"Lockheed Martin knows how to aggressively bring in business - and they welcome employees showing initiative."
good,Lockheed Martin is an excellent place to work. The work environment is very exceptional and the training and experienced gained is priceless.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lockheed. Although they were extremely professional, they were respectful to all of their employees needs for the company and their personal situations. It was a great place to work especially since the employees have control over their career and destiny for their future endeavors and I learned a lot while being there."
good,"Its important to understand that in the Computer Services section of Lockheed Martin, there is no one company, and no one culture.  Each Program Manger is king/queen of his/her kingdom.  Each contract will have its own physical space, and its own culture."
good,"Lockheed strives to be an industry leader which I agree they are.  I worked for Lockheed as a direct employee for 18 years.  The foundations of my career and skills were a result of the time I was a direct employee at Lockheed."
good,"There really isn't any formal training, so you will learn whatever the person sitting next to you knows."
good,"Run daily checklist of all communications equipment"
good,"A good place to work, very interesting products to be involved with and good people to work with.  However, it can be a stressful place too."
good,"Monitoring,tracking  and loggoing media for CMS community."
good,"The ethos of Lockheed Martin aligned with the military culture I began my professional career with.  "
good,"Overall, I have been treated fairly in terms of salary, raises and special awards for a job well done."
good,Overall a good place to work with the right supervision and co-workers
good,Pleasant atmosphere. My Team Leads/Managers were very helpful and supportive. The hours were long but it paid off every other Friday. There wasn't a dull moment and I loved my co-workers.
good,"Great company, diverse product lines and high-end in every aspect.  Excellent compensation and benefits as well as work envirnoment."
good,"My typical day consist of procuring at least 50 hardware items per day. Being the liaison between the customer and the vendors. Requesting & receiving  several quotes for the customer. Updating several databases. Communicating with customers, vendors, and managers. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to complete all that's needed in a 8 hour work day. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying the needs of a customer."
good,I was assigned a temporary postion at this company for six months. I worked with great people and enjoyed the little time I was there.
good,"As a Principal Member of the Engineering Staff, my day consisted of Project Cost Account management, Project Team Leadership, Design Engineering and program meetings. My program required me to learn and incorporate new thermal design technologies, and risk assessment to incorporate these technologies. In the course of performing my duties I also had to put together a team for support. I was able to select members that were interested in a successful conclusion and not self gratification. The hardest part of the job was attending approximately 25 hours a week of meetings, program cost account management and actual engineering design (this was achieved by working 65 hours a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was the technical advances I was able the design into the project."
good,With this company I started my courier in the Supply field. I also had the opportunity to work in other fields like the CBRN team. I've had a lot of support from coworkers and Supervisors. It was great working on Ft. Stewart.
good,"Only worked for Lockheed MArtin as a Security Officer, Great benefits, great team, but they contracted us out."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for but the Environment, due to the dwindling defense contracts have us all on edge."
good,"Great place to work. "
good,Lockheed Martin has been a great place to work throughout the years.  I've learned alot of skills and work with some of the greatest people who've become long-time friends. My many positions during my time at Lockheed has allow for me to be creative as well as challenged on a daily.
good,"A typical work day would include any tasks assigned to serve the flying public."
good,"Great group of coworkers to work with. Some perks are working from home, on site training, and new technologies being implemented. Management has changed quite a bit with them coming and leaving."
good,"I have been working for them nearly 5 years, and due to the competitiveness of the market, company had to cut back on their staffing.  I was one of the layoffs in 2013. Overall it's a great place to work, but the security is insecure. The knot in my stomach is still there even after i got laid off. :)"
good,"Title says it all.  Good folks, but Government management style"
good,"There is not really a typical day at work.  Everyone is working to resolve issues in order to support our mission.  It is a team environment where we all have to work together to obtain a common goal."
good,Another company heavily dependent on government contracts.
good,Outstanding Personnel Management and Customer interface training.
good,"Worked as a Professional Engineer & had a DOE-Q clearance."
good,Experienced workforce with great products that support the mission of our armed forces.
good,This is a good place to work for they offer excellent benefits and the people I work with are really good at what they do.
good,"Enjoyed the jobs but there were too many layers of middle management.  You had a lead, a team lead, functional manager and overall manager.  It was hard to obtain decisions and you had to rely on chain of command that would not necessarily pass on your message.  Info usually stopped at the middle managers."
good,"A typical day at work seems like everybody is moving, multi tasking work. Learned to be disciple with work changes. Management is rarely seen unless there are issues. Co-workers help the day move smoothly. The hardest part of the job is when a co-worker is not at work for weeks. To bad the contract is going away."
good,"No two day are alike, you get a chance to do challenging and something different each day. Work with some of the most brilliant people in the industry."
good,Great Team...lack of commitment when it came to renewing contract
good,"Work environment is a classical defense organization.  However, many exciting projects to work on."
good,It's good company but one is always subject to layoffs. iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
good,"could have had more experienced management."
good,"Great Benefits, Compensation is fair.  Some good management.  Flex 40 works out great for those with family."
good,"Long time employee, have seen may changes. Strong focus on ethics and integrity, great people to work with."
good,Worked in the Training Department for 13 years and enjoyed every moment. Traveled around the world conducting training for customers of both Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters. Would highly recommend employment at Sikorsky.
good,Decent place to work just outside of Philadelphia in which a normal day would be searching for work to do so you could electronically charge work numbers in order to get paid. There were many soon to be retiring seniors that were afraid of teaching new hires for fear lay offs.
good,"Enjoy working with current co-workers"
good,Great time growing within the company.alot of oportunities to move around.
good,"Managed Materials in aircraft industry"
good,"Days were fast and furious with lots of excitement during the Space Shtuttle days; tend to be a little slower now.  I have had lots of exposure to high technology and learned to understand and appreciate the excitement and passion of the engineers and scientists who support the mission even though their above my intelligence level.  I have gotten to meet many astonauts and have had several as my boss.  Management is easy to work and communicate to and with; relaxed, not demanding.  Co-workers are like extended family; we work and play together.  Hardest part of the job is the current work environment is stagnant and direction for the future is not clear.  Enjoy coming to work every day and greeting my co-workers and being involved in what each day brings.  Love to see them smile when they are recognized for their hard work and significant accomplsments."
good,Lockheed offers a diverse work environment and they claim to promote from within. 
good,Lockheed provides a very stable environment for a diverse number of careers and specialties.
good,"Its a government agency, so job security is questionable at times"
good,My time at Lockheed was probably different from most. I started out as an full time intern and then transitioned into full time position. I enjoyed the lax environment and profited greatly from the level of experience that surrounded me. Very inclusive working environment and some of the best trained managers I ever had the privilege to work for.
good,"There's always something to do.  Whether minor or major, there's never a boring day."
good,"Due to defense cuts Lockheed Martin is in a state of flux. During my time there, I enjoyed working with very capable people in a high tech environment. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the paperwork required by the bean counters and HR. The best part of the job was working directly with a customer to solve a critical problem at hand."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good place to start a career, or to find a job that you plan to stay in for a long time. If you are looking for cutting-edge technology, or the opportunity for promotion or pay raises above the standard cost-of-living amount each year, you need to find a smaller, more agile business."
good,Great place to work and interesting projects to work on. Learned about the technical aspects of service delivery as well as the business side. I have worked in many areas and mastered all of them from :
good,This was a short internship so I had a short glimpse of Lockheed Martin. Managment seemed very willing to work with employees to place them in positions they desired and put them on the right career path.
good,"Working for LM was a great experience. I received very good training and there was support for all aspects of the job readily available. The only downside were regional supervisors did not have the experience needed to truly understand what their employees were responsible for. These managers were also spread very thin and rarely seen. In case of problem at individual site, it would take days to get resolution. Overall a good company, it just couldn't keep the contract for this service."
good,Excellent Program to gain experience in the production of military aircraft.
good,"Over twenty years of implementing purchasing and procurement process to ensure efficiency, cost savings and best practices in the procurement and sourcing departments of organizations,"
good,Competitive wages and satisfying deliverable product.
good,"I've met a lot of very smart, diverse and interesting people while working at Lockheed. You get a very diverse group of individuals from the hardcore software developers to the program office. I enjoy the challenge of working with each group and the opportunities I get to interact with many different groups throughout the company."
good,"Interact with various groups such as Design, Stress, Systems, and Dynamics to monitor and maintain mass properties specs for Missiles, Satellites, and Electronic Packages."
good,"I work in a very fast paced cafeteria, so the day goes by very fast. I have learned alot about safety in the work place, as well as what teamwork is all about. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all that has to get done, due to the fact that so many of my co-workers call in sick all the time, leaving it up to the rest of us to get the job done. Thats when true teamwork kicks in, and we manage to get alot accomplished anyway. I am dependable,and enjoy working with the customers. Making sure they are happy is what it is all about."
good,this was great place to work back in the days would like to work here agin but there is no job security here they have tons of layoffs
good,LM is the world's largest goverment contractor. The company is a great company. When one is hired to move or relocate they are very helpful by paying all moving cost and the company has good ethics.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Lockheed, they gave me some great opportunities. Tuition reimbursement helped a great deal."
good,I was a contractor for Lockheed Martin and worked as a sub-contractor to another agency. The management structure for the prime contracting agency was substandard and needless to say they lost the contract in-turn my position was terminated.
good,"I only worked here two years, however the experience was good. Lockheed Martin is definately a leader in the Aerospace/Defense industry."
good,Performed a variety of electronic or electro-mechanical assembly tasks in support of PTDS
good,"A high level Engineering US Government contractor. In the contracts that are traditionally LM, the company is outstanding(engineering developers). When they venture outside that arena, they tend to struggle and either buy their way into that segment, or trial and error their way thru."
good,As part of the space division there is a great deal of cutting edge technology being developed. I have been able to work on a variety of different projects ranging from space flight to production run lasers.
good,"There are really no typical work days at LMCO. One day could consist of rising as early as 5am to travel to a customer site to perform a system review. The next day may be comprised of several meetings discussing various aspects of your product, assignments or documenting technical changes on a system. Another day may require you to spend several hours in a lab testing or demonstrating a product to the customer."
good,"Began working at Sikorsky in 1994 building scrolls for the 300 helicopter. Continued building fiberglass for a company for the target program. Also I worked in the stock area and inventory area at different times.During my 18 years at the facility I have worked in many areas and have been in wiring for the helicopters, inspection of this also. The past year I have been in Shipping / Receiving area and have accepted items for production."
good,We were treated well and got the support we needed most of the time. The upper management did not work as hard as L3 to maintain the respect and loyalty of our technicians. Lockheed also missed the opportunity to avoid having a union presence by not talking and listening to the workers in another associated work place and demonstrating a Laiz-Faire attitude about the union coming in. I still was very sad to leave my position there.
good,Publicly traded company doing mostly defense contracting. High commitment to being above-board and avoiding legal grey areas. Engineers charge their time to contracts they are working. Company rewards energetic people who put in extra effort. Company is also highly committed to diversity. It can be challenging when the customer changes direction or withdraws funding from a program being actively worked.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for. As with any company, there are certain aspects that could be better or different."
good,"Like many companies, they keep piling more work on fewer people. Travel to Florida can be a plus or minus. Expertiece is mostly in Stratford, but aircraft are often built in West Palm Beach."
good,"Working at Lockheed was a rewarding experience, as the potential to learn new things (pertinent to your project) and be exposed to great opportunities exists. However, unless you're in a mentor program, such knowledge and opportunity is not going to voluntarily find you. The older engineers are not fond of sharing their knowledge with younger engineers new to the company, and they are reluctant to embrace new techniques/products to get their tasks done."
good,Contract voip phone deployment it was a fun job but physically demanding requiring a lot of crouching moving lifting and fine motor functions and quickly lost challengning aspect and became monotmos
good,It was a secure environment
good,Everyday was challenging and rewarding. A good work atmosphere was demonstrated daily by co-workers and ad-visors. Company provided quality tools and need material. The most difficult part of my job was just getting in the facility.
good,"Top-notch work ethic - if you want to work for Lockheed Martin you need to be mission-oriented, have an excellent work ethic and strong customer orientation."
good,Looking for an environment where employees can grow and gain knowledge with experience as well as enhance leadership skills. I would like the work environment to feel like a family. Teamwork is essential to accomplishing day to day goals. I would like to feel part of a team as well as a family.
good,"Again for 2012, LM has been ranked as number 1 in the top 100 technology service providers for the federal government. I enjoy working with the top people, staff, and customers."
good,when get the date the contract is going to end believe that. They do not look to place you anywhere else. You are on your own!
good,Interesting business offerings and customer base. Strict corp value structure. Great visibility into state of business.
good,"Experiences @ Lockheed Martin includes Test certifications: which included test equipment (including ATE)/Test Methodology Acceptance. I worked through the engiineering development phase, then low rate initial production, then full scale production gaining experience in a full spectrum of business from a manufacturing /testing/ and quality perspective.I received monetary compensation for cost saving suggesions that got implemented,Additional experiences acquired included Continuity/Discontinuity/ Insulation Resistance on cables/wired assy's/ relay modules/ display panels/arming and safe-ing mechanism/ component level programming / testing/fault isolation;"
good,"Flexible hour due to training schedule. Doing a job I love as an Instructor Loadmaster. Ensuring our future C-130 aircrews have the best and complete training possible. Good working environment and realistic use of all necessary equipment to successfully complete the mission. Have become a ""mentor"" to many of the students by passing on ""learned"" techniques to make the job safer and easier. Co-workers were of the same attitude towards the training of our students making the environment enjoyable for all. Hardest part of the position is identifying a substandard student and having to return them to their squadron untrained and recommending the student seek a different career field of endeavor."
good,LM MFC is a successful defense industry engineering and production company. It is a union environment for the hourly workers; most are very good at their jobs but some only remain because the union won't let management fire them. They protect their own.
good,They have always took care of me and I have been trying to get back with them ever sense.
good,"Average Management, Not hiring young engineers, difficult to get promoted"
good,The IT area of Lockheed Martin used to be a great place to work but in recent years has eroded to the point that they have let go of too many of their experienced people. This puts them into the position to be prone for making more mistakes.
good,Overall good experience with company. Employee benefits included flex work schedule as well as every other Friday off. Benefits package was decent as well.
good,The work schedule is 4 10 hour days. This isn’t working for me. The job is too physical to work that long shift. I prefer to walk or work straight 8 hour days
good,"A good company to work for. Excellent benefits. The work is very interesting, especially if you work on a classified project. I enjoyed that the most."
good,I've worked at LM for 5 years and learned a lot about my field and the defense industry. The culture at LM is fantastic but leadership is very self-involved and large efforts often go unnoticed.
good,I have enjoyed working at LM for the past 7 years. It is a great company with core values that I admire. It is flexible with the work/life balance and provides good benefits as compared to industry standards.
good,Lockheed Martin empowers it employees to speak up and question processes and procedures to make sure you are doing the right thing but also help with process Inprovement
good,It was a good start out job working for a big government contractor. Why am I required to fill out a review just to post my resume. I left the company
good,The employees are highly knowledgeable in there fields of expertise. The work is challenging and there is great team work across the business. The ability to do various jobs without having to relocate was a plus.
good,"Lockheed Martin has a Enterprise Operations division that performs the internal IT activities needed to run their business. If you have an interest in Cybersecurity, Cloud Infrastructure, or any form of IT service engineering, this is a top company to join."
good,"The company is a defense contractor where there is a wide variety of skills and people.  It is a very large corporation with a lot of silos, so it's hard to feel like it's 'family'; yet the immediate co-workers are great."
good,"It felt good accomplishing work at the United states Mint, my team was very supportive as well as the management. I learned alot and passed on what I learned through the knowledge bases. Great work experience!"
good,This is a great company work for but I am eager to do greater things. A success person makes a company better overall. Having years of management experience and. Being overlooked over a college graduate with no leadership experience is unfair and unwelcomed.
good,"I enjoy working At Lockheed Martin Missile and Fire Control. They offer Flexibility, telecommuting, friendly environment. Good group of people to work with."
good,"If you can get an interview, you can sell your skills and ability. The hard part is getting the interview and securing the second interview. It is a structured environment."
good,"My time with Lockheed Martin was an interesting one. The position involved extensive travel all over the USA. For the Atlanta Market, the pay was Below Average."
good,"Strong training emphasis for new employees"
good,"I made a big contribution to the business unit."
good,"I was contract with the FAA contract with Lockheed Martin for 8 years and was laid off, January 2014 because of the government shutdown in 2013."
good,"Great company overall. Govt contracting makes job security less than what you might expect otherwise. Fun, smart people,always willing to help and share knowledge. Personal on-the-job training not always available but plenty of training resources via online books etc. and courses that you can request..."
good,Peer review and working with coworkers to get thinks done.  Very competant people that have worked together for decades.  The work force of old is retiring and the new work force is coming in.
good,"Lockheed is one of the most amazing places to work at due to the coworkers and environment. It has a great on campus cafeteria and many areas to walk around when not working. The areas in which you work can be large and relaxing while many areas feel like they were fish in a bowl. Overall great place to work, at least once in your life if you can go."
good,"Dozens of disparate systems providing policy and work processes. Unless you're young and a newly minted graduate LM doesn't have similar ascen advancement programs for its older work force. "
good,Overall a good company to work for and good management for the section that I worked in.  Just started here as a entry level job when I departed the military.
good,"Great company to work if you are lead by a good managment team. Good benefit and flexible work schedules. Competitive salaries, along with lots of job opportunities."
good,It wasn't a bad place to work. I just wished there was more room for advancement when I was there. It seemed like many were content with average effort and were bothered by those who needed more. My day goes by faster when I'm continuously busy so average just doesn't cut it.
good,"Working as a contracted editor from ISPA, Inc. to work for Lockheed Martin, I really enjoyed working on-site (and disliking my job when working at the corporate office). When at the air force base I found the people I interacted with to be a bit brisk to outsiders when I first arrived but they quickly started to warm up to me once I become more than just a name on a piece of paper. The sheer volume of employees and the size of the hangers makes one feel that they could easily be lost and/or replaced. Because I worked at the air force base so much I believe that my immediate supervisors forgot about me, meaning that I wasn't receiving the same training and opportunities as the rest of my coworkers at ISPA, Inc."
good,"Great experience.  worked with diverse groups and disciplines. Balance work life program. Assign many projects from simply floor polishing to procurement of million dollar equipment ,"
good,A great place to use many different skills.  Every day is different from the last and it can be challenging and enjoyable at the same time.  I recommend working there.
good,The culture where I was in flight test and the delivery flight line was intense and the culture was that all was expected every day. Was not that way everywhere but could be too much sometimes.
good,Overall great company. Many interesting products and teams to work on with the added benefit of utilizing a 9x9 schedule so every other Friday was off.
good,I enjoyed working with an amazing team and management. People are nice and friendly. I also learned a lot from senior Software engineers and from my team. They believe in knowledge transfer and willingness to help you improve your skills.
good,"I've been in the work force for over 50 years and Lockheed had the second best scheduling that allowed sufficient time for family and activities. There pay sucked for my prior experience but the benefits were great and anyone working there should take full advantage or all of them. Job security is good, I didn't work there long enough to determine what the advancement opportunities would be. Management during my short tenure seemed to be responsive and overly accommodating in my opinion. To PC. Can't realistically comment on the job culture since I was only there 2 month and was in an auto accident that ended my employment. The short term disability insurance offered as a benefit helped tremendously during my recovery and rehab. I wouldn't recommend working in the Orlando plant. The traffic was terrible. I spent as much time going and coming as I did on the job."
good,Great company to work for benefits  was ok plenty places to advance to.Pay was well compared to other company's. Some benefits  could be better. Plenty areas to work.
good,"If not for chances to get laid off, I would still be there. I have a family to take care of and I don't need any gaps in my pay. Outside of that it is a great place to work."
good,Lockheed Martin was a great place to work and I enjoyed my time there. I would recommend working at Lockheed Martin. The benefits at Lockheed Martin are good and the 401 matching program is great. I was contracted into the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at there location and the people at the FAA were good to work with and willing to help out in any situation.
good,"Good company to work wth good pay and advancement opportunities."
good,"Good employer to grow your baseline career foundations. You will find many resources along the way to get training and education, and how far you go depends on you."
good,I learned from working for Lockheed Martin. I wish they would considered going to uniforms. I think it would be more professional having a LMC uniform to work in. Plus clients give more respect to uniforms than workers just wearing casual attire.
good,Great work facilities & employee services.  Plenty of opportunities to take advantage of if self-motivated. Constant improvement encouraged & CEU learning opportunities are available to you.  Work schedules & tasks are always in a state of flux / constantly changing priorities.  Fast-paced high demand work environment.
good,"I enjoyed being subcontracted to a civilian project at Lockheed Martin. I personally didn't want to work on military or intelligence projects, but Lockheed Martin does serve programs that benefit the civilian population. The people I worked with were professional and extremely competent, and the company seemed to do their best to support their employees to achieve success."
good,"I had different assignments.  One assignment had me analyzing, what is called Digital Signal Processing (DSP), a plume from a space craft to try and label it as a ""Friend or Foe"".  If its a Friend no problem, but a Foe may require action to be taken or it may shoot you down.  This job required understanding the Fourier Transform.  (FFT algorithm was being used.  I switched to 10 other algorithms and partially solved the problem.)"
good,"Nothing bad to say, just couldn't do it anymore. The job was everything you would hope it would be, but the commute from my current residence became more than i could handle especially in the winter."
good,"Security is #1 here, and I could not have been happier learning the protocols during my co-op placement at Lockheed Martin MST."
good,"Good place to work.  9-80 schedule.  Good management.  Smaller number of employees than other LM facilities, thus less chance for professional advancement."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is doing what I was hired to do. Lots of opportunities for educational growth and is encouraged. Parking is a huge problem as more employees are hired at the facility.
good,"I only worked for Lockheed Martin for 11 months at the SEC in Salt Lake City, Utah. My supervisor was always responsive and found out the information that I needed quickly."
good,"Good place to work. There is a lot of work to be done for all the Government contracts that the company has. The times that I worked for Lockheed was collaborative, with very good management."
good,"The people are great and there is job security, however the pay is sub par. Coming in with an engineering degree is highly advised. Once in the door, it is very hard to get fired."
good,"In six years, I had the opportunity to advance from a Sr. Systems Analyst, to Work Order Manager, then Task Manager on a contract for SSA.  I learned to manage my contract's budget, enhanced my system design skills, project planning skills, as well as, written and oral communication.  I've found Federal government IT contract work to always have a significant element of stress, but also provides civic pride in being able to support and improve gov't systems.  There's intrinsic pride in working for LM, due to their reputation for excellence.  Occasionally, wearing one of my LM t-shirts to the gym helped to attract my eventual wife (unbeknownst to me at the time).  "
good,"Starting pay is low and probably not enough for most people to live on, but tuition reimbursement starts 1 year in making this an excellent first job for someone who wishes to earn a degree.  The benefits are pretty good, which also makes this a good job for older persons who are already established and may have already paid off their mortgage.  Also, upper management has made some mistakes and is 'fixing' them in part by mandating overtime.  Pay starts at the bottom of the scale for everyone."
good,did not have time to do very much because I was constantly pulled into meeting after meeting to report information. They need to spend more time on getting teams working the issues in the production facility.
good,Compressed work weeks and ability to work remotely. Benefits and company programs are competitive related to other industries. Recommend pursuing opportunities in US before Canada given access to considerably more resources and programs.
good,"Enjoyed a long career at Lockheed Martin surrounded by smart, respectful, career driven professionals.  Strong focus on the mission of the company.  Need to proactively manage your career."
good,"After working there for 9 months I was diagnosed with heart failure and wound up having a heart transplant. They offered to keep my specific position open for three months and then offered to keep another position open for an additional three months before letting me go. The entire time I was on sort-term disability, they paid my salary. The disability insurance I signed up for pays 60% of my salary."
good,Very structure company and compensate employees fairly.  Interesting products and technologies that you can't find any where. Management promotion is hard to come by.
good,"Worked as a temp through B2B Workforce. Learned alot about the supply process on Robins AFB. Very decent experience. However, no chance of crossing over to permanent was provided for any of us temps. Only con."
good,"I spent over a decade at Lockheed Martin and it provided me a great career path, a great learning experience, rewarding career assignments, and high visibility.  Unfortunately, I made a hasty decision and chose to leave for a challenging opportunity elsewhere that did not work out."
good,"Great Pay, but lacking good managers. Still running under the good ole boy system. Performance is not a determinant for promotion rather who you know."
good,"Great corporation with tremendous pedigree and world-class capability."
good,Without a degree you will be underpaid until you top out and it takes 6 years to top out in your position. Seems fast paced until you actually do the job and then it is terribly slow. I spent most of my days pretending to work. My manager actually told me to make it look like I was doing something.
good,We were required to deploy to Antarctica yearly.  Traveling down to the Ice was fun.  Accommodations in McMurdo were less than desirable.  South Pole was great.  Time away from family and friends was hard.
good,Not the same thing everyday.  There are numerous opportunities to work on different products with a vast variety of very meaningful and rewarding employment
good,"Lockheed is a good company to work for, they have lots of contracts with the military. They care about their employee well being, their family.  It is a happy place."
good,Company is flexible and structured with many opportunities.  Lots of training options.  Great employee discounts on many services.  Lots of unique and challenging work
good,"I began my nuclear career with Lockheed Martin. There was a strong team environment, and opportunity for growth, and to be involved in the community. As with any government contract job, there was always potential for layoffs or restructuring, but the company handled it as well as possible."
good,I was not at Lockheed Martin long enough to have a full thought on the program.  The people were great and I had a great time until I was layed off.  On the the next project.
good,Good Company. It allows growth and development if you are apart of the money making portion of the company. This is all I have to say about this company.
good,"Lots to learn and great teams......"
good,Nice place to work for young people. Make sure you get to know as many people possible as you work here. It does such though that there is no funding for Cross training though.
good,"Lockheed is a great company to work for in that you really have a sense of pride of WHO you are working for.  The great folks in the Armed Forces who use our products are what keeps our workforce motivated everyday!  The culture is indeed different sense their is a strong military influence, combined with the corporate feel.  Overall, I would rate this as a great place to work."
good,Good place to work but you must always be aware to manage your career.  Keep your skills current and stay relevant.  You can grow with this company but it is sensitive to gov spending.
good,Potentially it can be a great place to work and have a career. Gorverntment contracts dictate the longevity of employment. There seems to be a lack of general communication from upper management toward the workforce.
good,Great work culture with great benefits for hourly workers. Advancement to salary is difficult not only due to a limited number of positions but because of a culture of favoritism and relationships over qualifications.
good,It was the best paying worse job I ever had. Company overall is very dysfunctional. Not much support from mgmt./supervisor. Pretty much on your own. Never know if you are doing a good job or a bad job. Not much communication between hourly and salary in my department. Even worse between 1st shift and 2nd shift. No camaraderie between peers in my department. Some people were very childish and unable to communicate with them. The hardest part of the job was trying to get others to be on the same page. We had a way of doing a job and over time everyone just developed their own style and broke away from procedure. The best part of the job was definitely the paycheck. At times overtime was abundant.
good,"Great company to work for.  You can tell that LM really values their employees home/work balance.  They do have a terrible habit of offering low, really low.  My first offer was 8k less than what I was already making."
good,"Our managers picked their favorites and they were the ones that got the opportunities first.  fast paced work, diverse background of employees"
good,"I started as a Telecommunications Technician. My job was installations. wiring, Fiber Optics. Which Lockheed given me the opportunity to advance to the Engineering Dept/ NOC."
good,"9x80 schedule 6:30 AM- 4:00 pm Monday thru Thursday w/ Friday off 1 week. Next week 6:30AM- 4:00PM Monday Thru Thursday w/ Next Friday working until 3PM."
good,"Good job, but no natural growth/promotion if you telecommute as a Supplier Quality Engineer outside of the main plants in Fort Worth, TX and Marietta, GA. Flex time is good, benefits are good."
good,"I worked here for 6 years as an hourly employee. I interviewed 7 times for positions of which I was more than the most qualified for and was told I always interviewed well, but never got the opportunity. I got my degree while working here, of which they pad for, and they never would give me the chance to use those skills. Great Pay and Benefits, just no promotion opportunities for hourly employees. The culture is very much to source people from outside the company than to promote from within."
good,I learned a lot during my time at Lockheed Martin. My managers were great in helping me build my career as a developer. It was a great learning experience and I had a good time working with those at NASA as well.
good,I enjoyed my day to day work schedule at Lockheed Martin. I learned to thrive and stand out in a competitive and large corporate environment. The hardest part about the job for me was seeing a large amount of turnover due to changes in benefits and compensation. I loved my program and networking with others making a difference in the work place.
good,"Great place to learn cutting edge IT as it comes out. Excellent health, dental and educational benefits. Positions available world wide. Management works hard to assist whenever problems arise most of the time."
good,Great work environment and comradery amongst co-workers. Work / Life balance is good and overall a good company but the benefits are definitely less then desirable if your position even qualifies for benefits and pay is very low compared to industry standards and work performed.
good,I have enjoyed working here many years but there are times when the vast enterprise makes you feel like just a number. I've been fortunate to have wonderful people in my career to help me navigate and find great opportunities. To be successful it's important to have a mindset of accountability and take action for your own career path.
good,The culture at Lockheed Martin is very friendly and encouraging. There are many opportunities to learn new skills and grow. The work is both challenging and rewarding.
good,"Contract for Iraq, training Iraqi military to work aviation issues. Language barrier, hot work conditions, lack of equipment, and dangerous environment all contributed to the high stress levels. Good co-workers, comfortable office environment, and free lodging/food, made this contract bearable."
good,The company is a good place to work for professionals and has a really good work/life balance. There have been day we got off just for doing a good job.
good,"If your on any other shift than second you are good.  I was on second shift and we weren't treated the best.  It depends on the manager that one has.  The managers are changed routinely.  If the work is there you can work as many hours you want, just no more than 12 a day.  Flex time is amazing.  If you need to leave a few hours early for something, no problem just work the hours earlier in the week or come in a few hours early.  if you have an appointment at 3, no problem just take an extended lunch.  My area we could do that some you are limited.  They also have a medical center there if you don't feel good you can go there and they can treat you.  They also have a gym and walking course inside the facility."
good,In the time I worked made a lot of good connections and friends. Everyone helps each other and there are plenty of resources available. Good teamwork environment. I enjoyed the events during the holidays.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for if you can find a fit with your skills.  Since it is a very large company, there is a lot of bureaucracy.  If you can get past that, it is a good place to work."
good,"As with most large companies that have a matrix organization, one could be on the staff of a project Director, yet lose their staff numbers at the functional level, giving the impression they have more people reporting to them. Depending on one's functional group, due to reorganization, now completely against people of the same labor grades, you're passed over for promotions, due to lack of experience. This puts some managers in a bad position when it comes time for evaluations and should layoffs occur."
good,My day consists of receiving in new product and materials for engineering. Processing requests for the different flight test programs. Scheduling shipments for off site flight test programs.
good,"Good place to work, but management need to learn out to balance contracts so work continues with out a break in between them."
good,"First place I started to work as help desk support. Lots of new people with different job skills. Learning to get along, some more trouble shooting skills than others, first time learning to work on a government contract. Was a good starting point."
good,Enjoyed working there for the most part.  Cool projects.  Who doesn't want to work on rockets and satellites.  Good benefits and decent salary.  Give them a try.
good,"Lockheed is a good place if you want job security. Most people work there for at least 10 years or more. The benefits are really good, but as an intern, there wasn't much guidance."
good,An excellent place to work! Sound leadership and excellent benefits. Management supported training opportunities and upward mobility were available to all. Very good morale though out the local organization.
good,"Contractural Position, management was very positive, work culture was very flexible, Learning environment was very positive.  Our team supported operational customers work requirement 24x7. After hours support is required and the position requires rotational on-call support."
good,"The work was fun and exciting, we always had tasks and the management never had enough staff to get it done. We could always have used 1 more person. Managers where consider worker bees but they where always to busy with management task that they never really where able to help with the daily tasks. This is why we where always short a person."
good,"Worked with a good team. Flexible working hours to accommodate long distance commute. "
good,Majority of management (including myself) valued passing credit / praise down to actual contributors.
good,Working with Soldiers and Marines as closely as we did was very satisfying.We went anywhere our assigned unit went for both training or combat. We were responsible for all higher maintenance.
good,"Lockheed Martin offered a wide variety of opportunities in the engineering and development spaces.  While working in the Silicon Valley, I had the opportunity to collaborate with multiple departments and divisions.  Being a Department of Defense (DOD) contractor in the Bay Area keeping talented IT professionals was difficult as the opportunities were plentiful."
good,"The management was atrocious, there was absolutely no room for advancement or improvement. The union in place simply protects workers that are lazy and imcompetent. I witnessed several good and very hard workers that did their jobs with perfection and always on time and never slacked. yet they were laid off because everything in this company works based off time with the company. There were several people within the same department as this fellow worker that terribly messed up every job they completed and were always almost a hundred hours over the time limit to complete the jobs. yet they didn't get laid off at all. In fact they were simply moved to easier jobs."
good,Typical government contractor where you can find intelligent hard working individuals attempting to use their time with the company as a launching point for further career opportunities.
good,I am a contractor to Lockheed so I don't deal with Superior much. But the few times I did deal with them. I wasn't very pleased. There is often allot of miscommunication and they seem to be getting on board with anything but my previous company was much better than this one. So I don't have great things to say about them other than they don't really bother you. As a contractor you deal mostly with the company your supporting rather than the company that hired you.
good,"Basic defense contractor, good work when contracts won. Good basic people management. Decent benefits. Team oriented oriented with many opportunities across the complany."
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work. A lot of changes over the years, but my personal experience has been a 90% positive with the exception of high turn over on the management level."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for.  Job opportunities are there for those who seek new type of work. I thoroughly enjoy working at the company and have been fortunate to have a chance to be amongst many great teams, building tactical product and business application product.  My current team respects and  work well together. There are managers who will allow for great work life balance where I can work at home to catch up and meet deadlines,  as needed."
good,"Problem solving, project management work, audit support, presentation material for senior management.  Management is strong, culture is very good.  Hardest part of job is multi-tasking many high priority tasks.  People are the most enjoyable part of job."
good,"The culture is driven by stated goals and individuals are motivated and encouraged to reach them.  The mission of Lockheed Martin is to provide engine overhaul and support to defense and commercial entities.  While the work environment is good and people generally get along very well, the hours are long."
good,The contract I work for is slow-paced and very established in business practices. Offers a good environment for low-stress but not as much for career growth or growth within your position. Other contracts do other different paces and challenges.
good,As a contractor in support of the Collage of Distance Education and Training we created online courseware and training material. Lockheed supported this contract until the USMC decided to go to a small business award.
good,Overall a great place to work.  They treat the employees overall pretty well. Compensation is average but job security is good. Get to work on some incredibly interesting projects.
good,"I was a contractor on a long term, steady contract. There wasn’t much motivation for the company to allow me to move, and the nature of the contract did not provide upward mobility.  The company made a % off of my salary, and that seemed to be their bottom line interest. That said, they are a huge company with good benefits and great credibility. We won our contract because of their great reputation- and this provided great job stability- even as a contractor."
good,I performed a range of duties while at Lockheed which made my time there more enjoyable and interesting. I initially started out in a mentorship program until I was picked up by a permanent project. I also assisted in the review of free and open software requests. I performed data migration activity for several projects which included the use of Informatica and SAP data services software. I assisted in the set up of pay practice paycodes for timecard charging and performed code break fixes.
good,"LM provided wonderful care to the customer. Management was task-oriented and did much to show appreciation for the LM team."
good,"Really enjoyed this job. Extremely challenging and rewarding. Very team oriented and everybody is very focus to provide the best project experience possible to achieve a successful outcome. Co-workers and management stay involved and make sure everyone has the proper training, tools and information available for the job at hand."
good,Lockheed Martin had a good work environment.  There were great benefits.  Management was concerned about work/;ole balance.  The telecommuting was great for me.
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to build a career. Leadership does a pretty good job overall of engaging employees and encouraging growth... Very smart people working on very important projects.
good,Management not in tune with what employees are doing sometimes because of classified projects. Performance reviews are lack luster and many times employees do not receive the raises they deserve. The system is flawed and needs to be updated.
good,I spent over 16 challenging years at LM. I would do it again but I will not work there again. Too conservative and too much politics; too much favoritism. Easy to go in and out of the employee of the month with no good understanding of why you're in the position you're in.
good,"Considered the pioneering company in terms of the ""Cradle to Grave Systems Engineering"" construct.  Good company to work for overall, just maybe not in select areas due to high cost of living, company budget and dynamics of gov't and civilian contracts.  Unfortunately, many of my coworkers (~60%) are retirement eligible, and there's very little effort to truly backfill and train the up-and-coming engineers to take over."
good,"Co-workers were awesome. Crew leads had no leadership skills while supervisors were ok. Program managers were very petty. Most techs are military, so work was accomplished as needed."
good,"I enjoyed working at LMSC in Sunnyvale and later in Milpitas."
good,"Lower level management needs improving. Leadership lacking, emphasis on status quo, maintaining salaries and not wanting  to rock the boat. The team was great, management no so much."
good,Lockheed is a great employer they have a couple of down fall first starting with pay. I took a big pay cut to  go there thinking they would pay more an another one is they are very un organized.
good,"Got to travel a lot. Great Compensation during travel. Very time consuming, as weekly hours exceeded 70 at times. As an hourly employee overtime was time and a half."
good,Good company to work for. Strong ethics and good communications. Really good benefits.  Felt like you were part of a team.  Management was supportive.  Opportunities existed for technical growth.
good,While working in cables and wiring harnesses I worked on new equipment every couple of days. While on the flow line in sub-assemblies I worked on two sub-assemblies mostly.
good,A very good place to work but jobs are at the whim of the defense contracts which are awarded by congress.  Some years good some bad.   Most jobs require a security clearance which can take a long time to acquire if you do not already have one.
good,"For many years, I enjoyed working at Lockheed.  My last few years were miserable.  In hindsight, I should have moved around more between different programs.  Staying on the same program for 10 yrs allowed me to feel important, but it also meant long standing burned bridges. The performance ratings are a joke.  Each person can select their own raters. In fact, you don't have to select your co-workers. You can select anyone you want , even those you don't work with.  In the end, being popular and well liked gets your promoted without any technical skill.  The good side is it does take several years to be pushed down to the bottom of the pile."
good,"It's a great workplace.  I was there for 20 years.  It is a diverse culture, they have many meetings and have great benefits.  They recruit personnel."
good,this place is good but your work home life is a little out of balance. the insurance I had was amazing and my supervisors for the most part were fairly decent. overall if I could I would work for them again.
good,"Working as a full-time intern and then part-time intern during the school year, Lockheed was very flexible and willing to find a part-time position for me. My manager has been very involved in my development as an employee and helped me to grow as an engineer and person."
good,"Work environment can be stressful, but management supports the workers.  Benefits are ok but would like to see then above industry standard, rather than just matching competitors."
good,"Work day consists of making sure my applications are working normally and help others out when necessary.  I've learned about print, SQL, patching, general server administration and how to continually work well within the team.  Management is o.k. but not the best it could be.  We have a very diverse culture in our group.  Hardest part is on call because sometimes its very demanding.  The people on our team are wonderful to work with.  Anyone is willing to help with questions or problems you may have."
good,"Collect weekly reports and edit for director, manage calendars, organize and schedule meetings.  I also books travel, hotels, transportation and complete travel and expense reports."
good,I worked here for 15 years and if it were not for the ULA joint partnership I would still be there.  Aerospace/defense is very interesting work.  I enjoyed it all but it can be stressful at times.
good,"The company itself is phenomenal! The Marietta GA campus just lacks people with the right attitudes, to help you stay within the company, or promote. The ""good ol' boy system"" plays a huge deal in the approving stats there not to mention, It is really an ""every man for himself"" motto there. The pay was like no other and you accumulate PTO monthly, so it can be unlimited and come in handy especially with a family and young children."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a nice place to work, I've gained a lot of experience here. I consider management to be made up of many good leaders who want the best for their employees. The workplace culture has changed over the past few years in a positive way."
good,"I worked for Martin Marietta/Lockheed Martin from April 1995 until August 2016, when it spun off our division to merge with Leidos. In that 21 years I hit a few bumps with some of my managers but I also got to work for the most inspirational and intelligent leader I've ever had on the job in my 30-year career. How you enjoy your job depends more on who surrounds you, especially your immediate manager."
good,"Lockheed was a great company to work for."
good,"As an employee and Program Management Office professional, Lockheed Martin provided me with 13+ years of DoD Government and IDIQ Optimization experience."
good,"Lockheed offers many incentives, compensations and benefits to employees.  Work / Life work balance values are promoted. Flex time is also offered.  Many training opportunities are also offered. The company also promotes different job opportunities to employees."
good,Great people to work with. Management needs to help and be open to individuals that want to advance their careers without having to leave the company.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of showing up slightly early and planning the days activities. I am versatile and if specific work must be done to meet a deadline I will perform it. I have never said: ""That is not in my job description"". I learned that this is both productive and as long as there is something urgent I come in handy. Management may seem distant but there are times you interface directly with someone several layers above and they are aware of accomplishments. Workplace culture is one where you may have specialized assignments and if desire to learn more seek it be resourceful. The hardest part of the job is contracts and demands may require mandatory overtime but that pay comes in handy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with individuals very advanced in their careers and still living well down to earth and well rounded lives."
good,"I worked at Lockheed for almost five years on the JSF program.  It was a very great project on which to learn many different aspects of structural analysis."
good,"A typical day's work consist of task with medium-level hardship and normal stress. The work is not difficult, yet sometimes assignments can pile up depending on the pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 4x10 work schedule. I am off every Friday."
good,A government contractor that provides benefits to its workers in a challenging environment that tests the skills of its workers on a daily basis in meeting the needs of the customer.
good,Really enjoyed working there for almost 20 years. It was better when technicians were NES before being forced to become unionized. Good rapport with supervision. All of our Directors were available to all employees. Great benefit package. Workdays could be very intense at times due to the importance and cost of space launch vehicles and their cargo.
good,The culture was about helping each other and reaching the best outcome for work objectives. Work was contingent on contracts from the government which stressed people out since the government constantly threatened cutting funding.
good,"My first job as a defense contractor after retiring from the USAF. They are a professional organization moving a lot of money and contracts under the, now expired, USAMS II contracting vehicle."
good,"Well, this job isn't there anymore.  With the end of the Space Shuttle Program, there was no more need for the External Tank.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.  Met a lot of great folks and learned a lot about aerospace engineering."
good,"Good life work balance, behind on technology and not good place to keep skills up to date, good environment and good people to work with. growth opportunities are very limited"
good,"Good company, pleasant co-workers.  Provided monthly software installation instructions, peer reviewed, for the data capture sites nationwide.  Also wrote the help desk policies and procedures manuals, trouble ticket resolution etc."
good,"I have been working here for just under a year now and I love it. Most of (4/5) of my managers are wonderful teachers and mentors. My co-workers are pleasant and funny, as well as very intelligent and knowledgeable. The overall picture of this place is great. I am fresh out of the Navy so I may have some blinders on, but I love it here."
good,Good company to work for with competitive pay. Union has taken advantage of the company though. Such is life. Getting in as a direct non-union employee is hard.
good,"Typical day: Goes fast!"
good,"I learned a lot from this global company. I was fortunate to see some very cool products from Lockheed, very demanding but in the end I learned a lot."
good,"Employees worked well together which created a great working environment."
good,"I worked for Lockheed Martin for 22 years and for the most part enjoyed it. I worked the entire time as a contractor at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Research Triangle Park, NC. "
good,"LM Aero is a great place to work. They talk about work/life balance, but that's something hard to do in a job that wants 10 hour days. Not much of a chance for promotion unless you come to work for them right out of college. Hardest part of the job is promotions or lack thereof."
good,Worked there at several different company and customer sites for 16 years. Hard work rewarded both financially and with promotion. Company has a strong ethos for appropriate training and certification.
good,Excellent Company with good pay and Benefits. Fast paced open to Innovation. HR a bit lacking. Business variable with a good deal of travel required mainly to the USA
good,"Working with great people whom are very supportive and helping to work together as a team to get the job done, without worrying about who gets the credit."
good,"I worked in the Advanced Engineering group in NH for 4 years. Was able to work on many interesting projects and had great team members. Only downside was to get promoted, you had to get more schooling. Does not pay as well as other sectors."
good,"Good company, loved the location, people and the work. This company is large so there are many divisions that offer opportunities within the company. I would work there again."
good,"Lockheed's Orlando site does a fantastic job with lean education and application. People are all very friendly. One of my co-workers once described it as the world's largest mom-and-pop shop. Even with this, production controls at the site are top notch."
good,There was very little down time but everyone seemed to get along well. Things were very policy driven with very little leniency. Lead / Supervisor was great.
good,We were always behind schedule and needed to focus on what was needed for the next demonstration. Did not have time to clean up code you knew could be better but had to move on to the next requirement. Management was very understanding and work to give you the best working environment. Lots of work weekends. The people were all great to work with.
good,"Learned the non military side of rocket building and non destructive testing of the of the rocket."
good,Lockheed Martin is very typical for any large defense company.  Work load is also typical.  Be able to have time for family.
good,"Great working Environment."
good,"I enjoyed working for Lockheed, if it wasn't the talk of layoffs I wouldn't have left. My immediate supervisor took care of us. The upper management was more concerned about themselfs"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a company to offer a good future with stability. It will challenge you at the right level, but not put the pressure on work outside of the office."
good,"Overall, great place.  I learned a ton regarding supply chain and project planning and management.  Made some great acquaintances who took me under their wing.  The hardest part about the job is that sometimes you feel like red tape/non-value added tasks or processes get in the way of the actual execution of the work.  The most enjoyable part is that you get to work on some of the most exciting projects and programs.  There comes great pride with saying you are a Lockheed Martin employee!"
good,"Steady workflow with familiar programs and customers."
good,The company provided excellent wages and retirement programs. Incentive programs for employees to benefit their department and weekly meetings with department management for problem solving solutions and clean work environment.
good,This was a 40 hour a week job but was only given part time status. this was to replace a leaving officer before the installation of a card access security system. This location needed a government Security Clearance. Security handled certain documentation to be destroyed. At this location we had standard tours.
good,Very professional company to work for with good benefits and opportunity for advancement. I am would work for them again.
good,Lockheed Martin MFC has made improvements through their Culture Optimization intiaitve including a telecommuting policy and off-Fridays.
good,"From all of my jobs I have ever had. Lockheed Martin, was the best job I have ever had.  As a part time plant protection officer they had very flexible schedules which could accommodate school or other jobs. The employees of Lockheed Martin treat you with respect which for security is uncommon. Fellow officers were for the most part dependable. The atmosphere and culture of Lockheed Martin is undeniably great.  The issues I had with Lockheed Martin was the inability to advance, poor leadership from upper management of security. Favoritism and nepotism were rampant in management. Overall the job was great, and the minor issues with management can be overlooked due to the major pluses of the company."
good,"If you were not an salaried exempt employee you had no chance of advancement. They would build you up that you can go far but when you applied for positions there was always an excuse for why you didn't get the job."
good,"Years of employment with Lockheed Martin have been marked with a great Program Manager and support staff. "
good,Was able to find the perfect job to transition from military to civilian sector with a great company that was able to provide  me with knowledge and experience
good,"I learned quite a lot about process improvement and requirements gathering, management, analysis and testing.  Never seen a project manager as such a micro-manager.  Great co-workers made up for it, however."
good,"I have no complaints, Sikorsky has been good to me for 20 years."
good,"Good place to work, was able to work from home for a time and from an office.  Contract work is feast or famine though.  I worked independently at times and with a team.  Typical day was spent reviewing and courseware and leading a team of ISD professionals.  Management was support and my co-workers were professional and talented.  Job was never hard to me and the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of completing tasks on time."
good,"Pro- Learn alot about systems engineering, cafeteria is welcoming.  work with experienced engineers and get into team play."
good,"My job is a specific contract, so it does not reflect actual corporate working at Lockheed. Some days the work is very busy. The system is maintained very well, and it is a relatively low-stress environment."
good,Good place to work but your stability there is not written in stone. i have work for the company 2 times and layed off both times.
good,"Was a great company with great colleagues, young positive work environment, with a lot of potential, just breaking into the industry"
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for if you are not contracted out by another company. My contract was for a period of one year through Superior Technical Resources.  I successfully completed the one year contract however, at that time there were not any other contracts available for my skill set.  There was a six month learning curve where I was continuously introduced to new concepts and ideas that has helped me to this day.  My work day consisted of occasional meetings and allot of the time I would remain at my desk for the duration of my work day.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the production line workers while trouble shooting common computer issues/upgrades."
good,"I  Assist in Monitoring and documenting the patients  care ,Identify needs of the patient  "
good,"Lockheed is a good place to work, benefits are getting worse but the work/life balance is good.  Typically it is up to you what role you want and how you want to move up or satisfied with being a role player.  Both are valued."
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to work. The projects are highly technical and so I learned a lot by being exposes to some of the smarts people in the industry. The work culture was like a family at the time I was there. Although like most families theirs were issues. The hardest part about the job for me was leaving but it was necessary at the time. Most enjoyable part and the company was the type of projects I've been involved in.
good,"Interesting challenges daily and location, Understanding personnel from internal and external employees, Project deadlines and budget always are met by employees"
good,"Every work day started at half past 8 and finished at 5pm, with a 1hr lunch break. The times were flexible with when you were working with in reason. I learned a lot at my time with Lockheed Martin, how to work and behave in an office environment, how to code software, how to work databases, how to communicate with others and work in a fast paced deadline driven work environment. "
good,"Being a Sr Tech for LM, I could be working in engineering or repairing black boxes or being a certified Black belt I could be  running a lean six sigma event. That's what made working for LM exciting, you were giving the opportunity to explore your skills."
good,"Ok company to work for.  most enjoyable is actually seeing the aircraft come together, work 9/80 shift. "
good,This company seems to spend a great deal of time concealing legal  regulatory practices with regard to Human Resource issues than resolving them.
good,"The company is was just Okay. All of the other reviews listed as to the con are correct. Lack chances for advancement even if you are HIGHLY qualified. Lack of work a lot of time. Culture of robotic minds that if they did something the same way for years that it was correct even after management and coworkers are shown what they were doing is wrong. "
good,"Overall a pretty good company to work for.  Most places offer a flexible schedule, and pay & benefits are average to above average for the industry.  Complex matrix organizations can be difficult to manage within at times.  Otherwise, the culture is good and there are often times opportunities for growth or advancement (depending on location of course)."
good,"A great place to work with hard working and dedicated colleagues."
good,"Good work ethics and management is nice, learn a lot in your field.  But climbing up is very hard and reserved. Co-workers are nice"
good,"Manage multifunctional teams building the most advance aircraft on the global market. Manage projects, cost, schedule performance using tools such as EVM systems. support teams as technical engineer, coach and educate first line supervision, lead performance management teams as team lead."
good,Typical for what you would expect from a defense contractor. The contract was for a certain amount of product to be produced in x amount of time.
good,"Well, I started off working as a mechanic helper back in 1995 and then working my way up to a lead mechanic.  There were many challenges while growing with the company, from learning different engine lines to work on to the diverse group of people that came and went.  The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the new task to get certified on the many different taskingon building up a Jet Engine.  Over all It was a great place to work and enjoyed every last moment employeed for the company."
good,"Too many mid-level to senior managers are hanging on until they are forced out or are made to retire, and that has forced many high potential managers and leaders to want to leave."
good,Typical day involved following another operator on a machine or machine cell in the production of components for systems and or assemblies for customers. Machine operation training was minimal though as there was strict adherence to no programming changes without a process taking place. Hardest part was the fast pace & monotony in some work assignments. The most enjoyable for me was the setups as this was the time most of my skills came into play.
good,Sky's the limit if you have the dedication and tenacity to achieve great things. The opportunities are there for the taking (technical and managerial paths are available).
good,A good place to work but job security is always an issue. there were many layoffs during my time with the company. benefits were good but they were working on reducing those benefits.
good,"Very much enjoyed my job my position and my co-workers seemed to have something different to do everyday, I was able to take on new task and share with others  knowledge of the jobs, sometimes it was very hot out side but this is Florida, water break due to heat was needed  and lighting could slow you down, management could understand the slow down and  was quite supportive to the  importance on safety, I have seen company's want safety and not in trust the workers in sever weather  conditions mind all we did make up for the productive when conditions had lightened.  You could see managements great response to our efforts, My thoughts, Safety is # 1 with all Company  No job is so important it cannot be worked safely."
good,"Typically we tested and Repaired the equipment for the LANTIRN and Sniper System."
good,Excellent company to work for. They provide a challenging and rewarding professional environment. Their management is positive and engaging. They offer opportunities for self improvement and and professional advancement.
good,"Very good company to work for but they don't know how to manage firm fixed price contracts as well as Raytheon."
good,Lockheed Martin was a great start for someone breaking into the IT World as i did. I started on the Helpdesk answering phones for Network issues and was promoted several times from  Help desk Tech to  IT Project Manager. I learned how high you rise in the company is totally up to you.
good,"Huge company. Somtimes felt that corporate had no idea what was happening in the feild sevices divisions."
good,"The work area or shop. We have a supervisor who is a leader. He cares for his people. In turn we have great team relationship and very low turn over. Recently, we lost our contract and our supervisor is letting us find work. He cares and understand. Its a great shop."
good,"Most days were a lot of fun. There was a great deal of autonomy."
good,"Not that fun of a work place"
good,"During my long career, I was a constant learning, and took on huge amounts of responsibility.  I was able to broaden my skills through many experiences and job titles. I was a Test Engineer for Satellite processing, an Engineering Liaison to Manufacturing and purchasing, a shop planner a manufacturing engineer and a design engineer using the latest CAD tool. Many of these roles were done simultaneously and had far reaching affects on manufacturability in design, shop leadership, and increased in-house and outside vendor customer development."
good,"This is a wonderful place to work. There is opportunity to learn constantly if you are willing to apply yourself to solving difficult problems."
good,"Lockheed Martin is an excellent company.  As a government contractor it is difficult to maintain a corporate culture with other cultures always creeping into every part of the business.  Lockheed has always a strong, if not simplistic, core values (do what is right, respect others and perform with excellence).  These values beat like a heart at the center of our company and I believe this is why Lockheed has done so well in so many areas of the industry."
good,"Lockheed Martin over all is a great place to work, especially my Business Unit. However, because the company is so big, you really need to have a champion that is high enough to be influential or you could become stagnant and not make traction where you want your career to grow."
good,Management I worked with were very professional. Sometimes upper management was too set in stone to realize opportunities and talented personnel.
good,They pay well and the only issue is the workload is so contract centric that every leader protects their own and it is hard to get extra hours when needed to fill your commitment.
good,Work/life balance is excellent and a logistician will get what they put into the job. Working with the customers can sometimes be rough.
good,"Every day is different, my tasks vary from being in control of the help desk for the entire army for the NetUSR application to helping the test team test the software developed. I have learned  how to multitask, take lead in an area, and budget my time. I enjoy living close to my office and being able to come and go with no management breathing down my neck."
good,Excellent professional working high tech environment with close relationships formed.  Active security clearance. constant changing dynamic to fit specifics for all customers - military and civilian. Management very respectful and value employee input.  Close relationships with fellow employees to assist in collaborative working environment.  The most difficult part of job is adjusting to ever changing dynamics and challenges for customer needs.  Working with and meeting customers from all over the world and all aspects of life.
good,"Supporting the ATLO organization of a major program is a very demanding task, it requires a lot of time and coverage to meet schedule - very schedule driven industry."
good,Worked with a team of professionals toward a common goal of providing best national defense products and services possible.

good,Upper management really trusts their techs and allowed us to get our work done with little interruption.
good,The best thing about working with the military personal and the vehicles they use is its never the same thing twice. The work is fast pace. I learned over the years a lot form my co. workers. Out of all the company's I work for with the us Army and if your a mechanic and if I had to give a rating it be that Lock head martin was good company to work for. The bad part was getting led off.
good,"The pay is decent, the work schedule is great.  Some days there is nothing to do and it can get boring."
good,Some of the management was wonderful and did right by their job. Others were in need of counseling or to be let go because they did not supervise well.
good,This is a stable company that will be around for a long time due to their involvement with the United States government. Their CWEP with UCF is great for many students who are unsure on what they want to do with their life.
good,Great place to work but unexpected layoffs and plant closings are the nature of the business.
good,"Learned to work with J Boss FireFly JEE."
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to start a career. Unfortunately is does not seem to be a place to advance your career. It has been a good place to grow and learn many different aspects of aeronautics. The culture Lockheed Martin provides is a diverse and dynamic one. Management is understanding and willing to work with you in order to get the job done.
good,"Outstanding Achievement Award. TF-39 Engine Project Team, Employee of the Month, Numerous Awards and Recognition for implementing processes saving multi-millions of dollars for Lockheed Martin."
good,A great experience working with top engineers on highly confidential projects was exciting. I would have state longer had I not moved to Boston to be closer to family.
good,"Opportunities to move into new positions/roles within the company are typically encouraged. Management is what you would expect from a  large company, but overall is acceptable."
good,Lockheed is a good company to work for over all. Management can be a little unresponsive at times but all issues are eventually addressed. The work environment is pleasant and the people are great.
good,"LM Aero is a fast paced Aeronautics company. They offer fair growth promotions, salary compensation and an excellent benefits package."
good,"Mornings would be slow, building kits all day long with just a 30 minute lunch break. Working 9 hours with every other Friday off was a highlight of the week. Slow pace most times, getting along with my co works all the time made up for having good days. "
good,Pretty good place to work. Very good monetary and health benefits
good,Contract-Driven employment depends on whims of Dept. of Defense and ability to sell weapons systems

good,"I loved this job to the highest of any job I've ever had the pay  was awesome, the co workers were very professional,the management,there were not many hard tasks on this job,the most enjoyable thing was getting paid every week was another awesome deal!!"
good,"I worked with a great team, we had a flexible schedule with core hours between 0700 to 1700.  The team was very good, and knowledge was shared across the team.  Management for a given team was variable.  Like any company you could have an outstanding manager or a very poor manager.  "
good,Enjoyed the flexible hours and challenging work. Coworkers were extremely helpful and considerate.
good,Enjoyed having a flexible work schedule and the challenging work.
good,Benefits and salary are good.  Sometimes work life balance is unrealistic
good,"Lockheed Martin has always provided comparable benefits. Some things they have changed/added to the corporate culture is on-site medical services, on-site employee gym, and wellness programs. LM embrace diversity in their workforce and is moving forward with updating their work spaces to foster a more collaborative environment. The hardest part about working at LM is trying to get employees that are entrenched in their processes to try something new."
good,Management makes it difficult to keep from getting frustrated. Your immediate supervisor could be excellent or poor. Middle management creates chaos for lower management making it difficult to delegate work assignments effectively. The salary is at the top of the scale comparatively speaking. The Union is an unnecessary evil that sides with the company creating more frustration. I have had non-union jobs that offer just as much compensation.
good,Was a co-op and involved in multiple of their engineering disciplines.  Managers and engineers were helpful and professional trying to help.
good,"a typical day was always  something different. i leraned to be self reliant,  self motivated.  work with management on meeting time   schdule and quality issues.work in team effort with other co workers. the hardest part of job worrie about being laid off. as far as the most enjoyable part of the job . it was all enjoyable very rewarding to see something we built together  as a team for our military and our country!"
good,"I enjoyed working with this company except for the fact that my boss at the time wanted me to fraudulently bill the government, which I refused to do so he let me go."

good,"Flexible and Dynamic Workplace, Emphasis on Ethics and Performing with Excellence"

good,"It was a great company, and great management team. They will take the time to train people."
good,Great place to work with regular opportunities to move up and sideways.
good,"Great place to:"
good,"This is not a place to work if job security is important to you. While this is a good paying, amazing benefits, the government and economy have a lot to do with whether you are laid off or not."
good,"Show up on time and there is always something new to learn. Management is helpful and answers any questions. Co-workers are friendly and are available to assist on new projects."
good,"My experience with Lockheed Martin has been an overall good one. It  allowed me to truly develop as an engineer and a person, but not without some short falls. I was fortunate enough to have a manager that focused on developing the skills of his staff while many of my coworkers had managers that failed to do the same for equally as potential staff members. My work/life balance was great because I was able to ""turnoff"" work after I left the office or test facility as well has begin graduate school. As the years pasted with the company, I  found that the processes implemented to support one project would be the same processes the prevent corporation from capturing new business or performing efficiently. Also, there was a large ""this is how we did it before"" attitude that prevented new ways of thinking. The ideals that were once put in place to verify the execution of work now slow the process of work completion and allows for wasted costs. I believe the company is learning more about the current internal issues and addressing each slowly, but I am looking to expand my expertise and work experience outside of government contracting."
good,Great management and associates and just a great place to work  --- kept me busy and interested - I thoroughly enjoyed my time at LM Co.
good,"Available upon request. Currently working normal 8-4pm schedule, on mostly hardware systems and power management/redundancy."
good,Daily contractors along with military require access to the base.  It require walk in access and vehicle access.  Four times a week i used to do fingersprints for background checks.

good,One of the best places I've ever worked.  Outstanding development program for targeted leaders.

good,"Main job was process improvement.  	"

good,Lockheed Martin has an expanse of job opportunities that allow for growth in various different job fields.  
good,Work/life balance isn't really there. Success in the job depends on what group/program you work for. 
good,Surfing through several databases to glean intelligence information with a counterintelligence point of view. Great bunch of people to work for and with. The hardest and probably most enjoyable part of the job was getting a finished document through the approval process and out to the customers.
good,"My typical day was demanding but extremely rewarding.  My manager was a perfectionist but very supportive.  I enjoyed the large scale of the plant and getting to know the people there.  My co-workers and I acted as a team to get a lot of work done, sometimes with short deadlines.  The most enjoyable part of this job was looking at the work completed and having the self satisfaction that I was a part of it."
good,"Working at Lockhead was ok. I enjoyed the work I was doing, I am going to miss that job. The Engineers I worked with were great and helpful when questions needed to be answered."
good,"Lockheed consisted of teams who worked on different parts to deliver results in a set time frame. The key was planning, organizing and open communication. If your on a good team, other teams rely on you a lot more. There was fex time and the ability to have work scheduled a little bit around you."
good,"Everything we did was done like it was the most important thing we needed to do. We worked at a frantic pace to make sure our product got out to the customer, sometimes before they even knew they needed it!"

I was a busy individual all day. Management was flipped around with the latests reorganizations due to government cutbacks which as with any company can cause employee decisions and layoffs. I wish i was still with Lockheed."
good,"The best part of my job was that I worked with some awesome and talented individuals which made my job easier, and we enjoyed the respect of the management that we worked for."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a large multinational technology company. And due to its size and scope, there are tremendous opportunities to be involved with some very interesting and cutting edge technologies."
good,"Lockheed offers great compensation/benefits with diverse culture. Very secure employment with unlimited advancement. Too many layers of management, very unproductive. Managers do not know how to do their jobs well resulting in declined morale and work performance. Overall, a good place to work."

good,"While in the office I typically engage in the coordination of civil/environmental site surveys, provide technical reviews of environmental work peform for the FAA and do research to ensure enviormental compliance in the United States and US Territories."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lockheed Martin (LM). I met some wonderful people who made work fun and an enjoyable place to be. There are always poor managers, but the good people far outweigh any poor ones."
good,"Not a bad place to work, however I was blocked from taking another position within the company. My supervisor at first stated that if I wished to take the position, he would not stop me. After I was accepted for the position, he stated that he couldn't afford to lose me."
good,Fun place to work. Co workers great team. Learned a lot of different skills. management was fair and to the point.
good,If call upon I would work for Lockheed Martin as a contract Engineer
good,good company with good benefits. i worked in a warehouse setting. i had a non productive manager.

good,There are some development opportunities to enhance your career.
good,"The typical day could be challenging, but rewarding. I learned to read code, develop, document, create scenarios, test executable system changes or modifications. Because our department was outsourced, most of my co-workers were ones I had known for a very long time. We enjoyed assisting each other in any way we could. We were a true unit. Managment was great when it came to resolving issues that appeared to be unresolvable.The hardest part of the job was learning the new and different. The most enjoyable part was that they were willing to assist you in whatever way they could. When it came to family issues they were very supportive."
good,Entering information into the PBUSE system.
good,Typical day at worKk is making site is secure. Insuring policies and procedures are met. I have learned many areas in the security field that can only hep me advance. The hardest part of the job is working nights when needed and not being home.

good,First-level Tier 1 Help Desk Analyst via phone and remote support
good,Fast pace environment. I learned that in the manufacturer environment like this you have to work fast. Management overall was helpful but no chance to learn anything. They push and push.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me working the 3rd shift and over into the first shift because of a lack of personell. I was working there over 100 hrs a week. Everything I know about quality today was taught to me by classes I attended through work and the work experience I was provided. My management was decent, my supervisors were great and I loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was pulling so many extra hours and working 7 days a week. The most enjoyable part of my job was working hand and hand with others to get jobs completed."
good,"There are numerous opportunities for exciting and challenging work. All the jobs I had there were demanding, but rewarding. My co-workers were all very professional and made a great team environment. Working for numerous customers provided a broad look at new IT solutions. Most enjoyable was the variety of work. Least enjoyable was the limited time off and needing to work while on vacation."
good,"I had the distinct pleasure to work as a QA Rep. from 1999 to 2004. The staff and Management were a joy to work with, very professional and helpful."

good,"I came in to the logistics field with very little knowledge and thanks to the opportunity Lockheed Martin gave me, I now have a depth of knowledge at my disposal. I enjoy my work and want to make this my career. My co-workers helped me as I helped them, we all had an easy give and take relationship where if you needed guidance, everyone would be willing to help."
good,I have fully enjoyed my 30+ years at Lockheed Martin. It has been a great company to grow with. My experiance and knowledge has led to win win carrer and have had a life time of development. I am now looking to branch out to a new location in the warmer area of our great country.
good,"The team at LM were knowledgeable, happy, friendly and productive. They all worked hard and were dedicated to making a positive contribution to their customer's business. While most were customer and delivery orientated, they were always willing to pitch in and lend a hand!"
good,"For transitioning into this company, it is a very patriotic culture where integrity is strictly enforced. Most military personnel find it easy to adapt to Lockheed. For seasoned professionals transitioning into the company, the pay and benefits are very competitive and the technical work is some of the best."
good,Working at Lockheed was a true privilege. The experience gained from being on a multitude of contracts and projects is bar none. I would return to most any position there without question. Unfortunately I no longer travel as much as needed to still hold a position there.
good,Plenty of work with long hours and expectations with great rewards through pay and sense of achievement.  Overall company management is great but local is not good.
good,"You have to stand out to be seen.  The company is so large that you absolutely must be in your passion field to succeed or you can easily get lost.  But also, if you are a subject matter expert, that too can be difficult because you can fall into a niche and can’t get out."

good,"The benefits are amazing"
good,"Depend on how you take actions and items that come your way while working for the company, will depend on your experience. Not every place is going to be exactly what you want, but depending on how you react to things will depend on your experience with the company and people in it."
good,"My daily work day is busy and at times filled with meetings due to project proposals, kick-offs and contract award(s). The hardest part of this job is balancing the amount of meetings you have with getting work done within an 8 hours shift. Typically, that doesn't happen which results in working anywhere from 8-12 hour shifts, depending on the day of the week. I've noticed most meetings are front load at the beginning of the week. The most enjoyable part of my job is the open-policy and optimistic team I work with. My team is one of the best I've had the pleasure of working with that in turn help my growth within Lockheed Martin."

good,Great place to work with opportunity for advancement and some work/life balance. A little could be done by listening more to employees' opinions and providing training opportunities.
good,"I had 13 managers I reported to. Lockheed put a lot of emphasis on the importance of leaders. If you are not managing someone, you don’t matter. Reverse discrimination was practiced."
good,Nice place to work and had a career! Lockheed Martin is a family first type of corporation! I would recommend this as a nice place to work ! Benefits could be a little better.
good,experience with inventory and inventory transactions. General stock room knowledge and computer skills . Team player • multitask in fast paced work environments SAP Transation Forklift

good,"Lockheed Martin was a very good place to work, there were many opportunities for advancement,"

good,"Its a good place to work, I just got tired of the long drive, was looking for something closer to were I live. I had a great time working there and advancing their safety culture."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Lockheed Martin while it lasted."
good,"The base pay is good, but the benefits are getting less and less.  Great work environment. Great opportunity to travel. The higher level has their own agenda and the lower rung often gets forgotten."
good,1 year as a contractor to see if there might be a future there. Towards the end of my tenure they were bringing in techs making around $15 an hour and it SHOWED. Was time to get out.
good,"PTO and 9x80 work schedule the number one perks.  It is also really cool to be part of a company that not only does so much for the defense industry, but the advancement in outer space as well."
good,There's a family-like atmosphere at my location.  We don't get direct communication from home office but gets filtered by business unit. It makes my location feel disjointed. Otherwise pleasant place to work.
good,"Professionals are able to perform their daily tasks without going unnoticed. After contributing your efforts throughout the day, you have a good sense of appreciation from your fellow colleagues."
good,"Government contract company, with excellent benefits and working enviroment. Great learning possibility for other careers. Will recommend to friends, with possibility for overseas duties."
good,"+ Nine-hour day with flex time allowed a strong work-life balance.  "
good,"I separated from the military and switched over to Lockheed Martin. Much of who they are is centered around the military, and it shows in the organization. A lot of bullying techniques used in this environment, but the pay is good."
good,"Great company and salary is generous. Healthcare is only catastrophic since first $5,000 or so every year come out of your pocket before they cover anything."
good,The company had great benefits and pay. I would have stayed with them if they retained the contract I was on. Satellite locations are lack company culture and resources

good,If you are someone who really likes to use your skills and abilities on a daily basis to better enhance our military's future this is the job for you.
good,"Excellent place to work. Very high pressured but challenging and people work well together.  There is a mix of United Technologies employees and new integrated Lockheed Martin employees.  There seems to be an excellent balance of both, which isn't always the case when there is a buy out."
good,"The company culture overall was very relaxed but there was definitely a huge age gap between the younger employees (<30 y/o) and the older employees (>45 y/o). There was difficulty retaining younger employees because the overall pace of the work is slow and the traditional company culture doesn't help, especially in the Silicon Valley."
good,One arrives at work and immediately begins shift work.  Works autonomously and continuously for 2.3 hours then gets a 20 minute break.  Keeping the schedule is very important and the work requires a lot of attention.
good,"Performed weekly preventive maintenance, accommodated service requests, and ensured complete and timely hand-off of incidents to other support teams as appropriate. Assisted other teams with maintenance and change implementation. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to monitor system status and resolve issues utilizing available knowledge and reference documentation.

good,"Contracted to Sandia National Laboratories. Great place to work. So many different projects to work on. Contract administration was good, but pay/benefits were not so good."
good,Lockheed Martin in Orlando Florida is a very professionally run organization. The company as been very loyal to me and I have been very loyal to it over my 29 year career. Company standard of excellence and execution is bar none to others in the military contract business. I had a long and prosperous career at Lockheed Martin. The stock price has always stayed strong and as a result my 401k program has benefited. I recommend  any young professional to consider LM as a career choice. Good Luck!

good,"Job is for a younger, upcoming class of leaders. Old, experienced leadership is not valued. work life balance in Operations is terrible. Leadership separate themselves from the worker bees"
good,"Good place to work Their traing system is very thorough and advancement is very well looked at. The only problem is that when hiring on permanent people, it takes forever for them to make a decision."
good,"This isn't a review of Lockheed Martin in general.  It is a review of LockHeed's small presence in SLC Utah.  They tried to establish a presense here to support the Air Force at Hill AFB.  The team members here are all great to work with.  Sadly this remote site didn't get the support it needed from the Lockheed mothership.  We simply didn't have all the little things we needed and didn't have a small purse to fix that in a timely enough manner."
good,Lockheed Martin is a well-established company with plenty of advancement opportunities due to the size of the company. Overall solid company with great benefits.

good,"Good management and a comfortable environment conducive to maximum productivity.  Interesting work assignments.  Great internal infrastructure support,"
good,I advanced in my career there because I am self motivated type of person. There is to much obsession with career built through schooling/education and not enough emphasis on management that has developed their skills through a hands on approach of management and training.
good,"Other than being in an active war zone and dodging mortar rounds..Great Long hours as a contractor but the money was great. Keeping in mind that ""With change, comes change"". Obama declared a 75% civilian reduction of force."
good,"Lockheed is a company that invites diversity, encourages movement, and empowers its employees to make a change. With countless opportunities (not just engineering), Lockheed is limitless with where you want to take your career."
good,Training for special jobs was non-existent. The job was very interesting. I do not have 150 letters to describe the job at Lockheed Martin Space company.
good,The work environment was clean and well maintained. The work atmosphere was good and the employees were smart and productive. Great place to work. Managed well
good,"Lockheed Martin ERP systems supports several Business units from Space Systems, Aeronautics, Rotary and Maritime systems, P2P, and others with several hundred databases to manage.  Standards and procedures are developed to streamline the maintenance of all these systems and it was my responsibility to ensure all the databases ran smoothly."
good,Great place to work and good management. Always treated fairly and enjoyed my time there great management that is always striving to do better every day. I would definitely recommend them to anybody.
good,"Work was challenging and fun, resulting in a great learning atmosphere. Management used the servant leader model helping to instill the ethics based service model that created the work culture. The applications I worked on were vital mission critical safety applications for flight safety, so attention to detail was paramount. There is a level of collaboration here among the Database Administrators, that you don't see most places. Information sharing without the feeling of losing credibility, was normal and enjoyable."
good,Lockheed - Martin is always advancing in a way of technology. They are a lot more advanced than most companies. Everyday is a tremendous learning experience.
good,lockheed martin is a great place to work.  very diverse company with many different levels of interest.they offered tuition assistance and training was frequesnt
good,Very flexible with work schedule. A lot of people with lots of years working for the company. Some are nice while just a few would need a intensive training on people skills.
good,Nice company to work for until they merged with SAIC to become Leidos. Then work environment changed with new policies. Overall Lockheed Martin is a friendly and enthusiast company to work for.
good,I like the people that I worked with and we had management that cared about us. They tried to save our jobs but in the end we still got laid off. They paid a good salary and a safe place to work
good,The work was rewarding and the staff was great to work with. The management and supervisors were great to work with. Outstanding environment to work for and with.
good,I enjoyed working for this company very much it was potential to grow but manufacturing was a union job so seniority comes first n u have to be at the company a long time to have job security but overall great company
good,"Lockheed has so many projects going on that there was always an opportunity to try new things. They seemed like they wanted to retain talent and allowed you to apply for jobs above your level as long as you met the ""years"" requirements. That being said, one negative was that you had to have a certain amount of years to move up to the next level."
good,for the short time I worked there the management and staff treated me with dignity and respect. Great work environment. Would work there again if asked.
good,"Pay for performance, pay for performance.  Don't go looking for a place to lay low.  This company is fast paced and fair.  You won't be sorry you applied."
good,"I had a decent time working at Lockheed.  Was never really bored, a typical day begun with our supervisor and lead giving an objective in the morning meeting in order to meet schedule. The management in my Program wasn't always ideal but fair.  I learned the basics of blueprint reading and aircraft metallic structures. The workplace culture was relaxed overall despite the few negative Nancy's. you have those everywhere though."
good,I have enjoyed working for Lockheed for over 17 years. They take care of their employees and offer a viable path for advancement. They also encourage you and support opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"Great place to work. Plenty of options for advancement.  They offered trainings to improve services and to keep up with changes in the field.  I enjoyed answering phones, having access to SOP guidelines to answer in questions about the hiring process, and  helping people through the hiring process to get a possible job with TSA which has excellent benefits. A professional environment. The hardest part of the job meeting the stats. Some calls required more time than others and sometimes it required more than the allotted 17 minutes for a call. They offered overtime frequently, of which I was able to participate in when needed."
good,"Lockheed Martin is very good at rewarding employees that perform, and continue to reward them for continued good performance.  Lockheed Martin is also very thorough with employee education and compliance, as well as providing training for additional areas of growth."
good,"Learned alot and worked with a great group of people. Location and benefits were great, as well. Training opportunities were available. Commute was a dream!"
good,"Lockheed was a great place to work.  The people you work with are all pretty friendly.  A cafeteria was provided, along with an on site nurse practitioner .  The items made there are really cool, and it feels good knowing that you're doing your part to help the country.  There were year evaluations, which your peers also graded you on (nice since your manager can't know everything you're doing).  The insurance was pretty good and the stock does very well."
good,The employees are more like a family at my location.   They support the customer and mission insteas of just seeing what they do as a job. Many of the employees have been there for 20+ years because they believe in what they do.
good,"Management generally gives one a task, asks what tools are needed to accomplish it,  then goes away and lets one complete it. Employees are empowered and held accountable."
good,I was new into system and had to learn to use my technical taught skills at the work place. I learned a lot and enjoyed what I did for the most part. It was nice to work at that location.
good,awesome when i work there. It was a bit of a travel was the only downside. It took a while to get hired on i was told. One lady worked there for 3 years and still wasn't hired on.
good,"Overall, wonderful place to work.  "
good,Flexible work hours with 9/80 work week. Very good benefits and good pay. The people are kind and helpful. A typical day varies from being behind  a desk to working outside on an aircraft.
good,"Long productive work days with a very competitive environment"
good,One of the best places to work for! I had a lot of opportunities while working at GE/Lockheed/Lockheed Martin that allowed me to grow personally and professionally!
good,As a former LMC employee I enjoyed my employment as part of the LM family. The culture and structure for the most part I found to be well balanced across functional areas of the company.  I enjoyed the camaraderie and certainly miss many of my former colleagues. The benefits package offered during my employment was excellent.  Unfortunately the government contract that I was assigned to support had ended with not follow-on work in the area. Remote employment is an area that I feel could be offered more readily.  LMC is definitely a company that I would consider returning to if given the opportunity to do so.
good,Worked in local San Antonio area and on-site locations to support several IT government contracts in and around San Antonio.  Had a lot of autonomy. The most enjoyable part of the job was hiring new employees.
good,Good company with good benefits but the company has lots of red tape and rules that contradict themselves.  Great place for a lawyer or systems engineer!
good,Great place to work with a small engineering team in multiple large and small projects. Good work life balance. Opportunities to engage with multiple locations.
good,High levels of professionalism. 
good,"Working at Michoud was a life building experience.  The plan for work was well structured, and safe.  The co-workers became like family.  It was great to see a build come to completion and on time , because we worked together to make it happen.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work to an individual's strengths.  The management recognized that and placed us where we would be most successful."
good,"Working at Stennis was very Pleasant, the work was steady and well structured.  Management made it easy to be successful.  There were perks to employment , and the co-workers were pleasant and supportive.  All in all , I enjoyed my time there... I just felt that the pay for this department was too low for the effort given."
good,"I loved my 9 years at Lockheed Martin. It was an ever evolving workforce and the company does everything it can to make the culture enjoyable."
good,"•	Directing managers & supervisors/op tech teams and control production flow while maintaining production schedule and cost."
good,I like working here. The only reason I left was that they lost the contract I was on and I did not wish to be relocated by them. I would definitely work here again.
good,"The benefits were awesome, so were the discounts with other companies. Good work atmosphere, but they went through too many supervisors too fast. The experiences were good though."
good,I love everthing about the job but especially the people.  The work was challenging but never more than I could do.  Very collaborative environment to work in.
good,"As I wrote earlier, when I worked for LM overseas it was a great company but as soon as I returned back to the US, hardly any effort went into assisting my return and locating a new position."
good,"Lockheed is an excellent place to work because it is very family oriented and the people care about one another, even HR."
good,Good place to work but salary is knocked way down when you become permanent. They need to improve that. Lots of people leave because of salary cuts after bff etting picked up.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Lockheed, as it was one of the first IT jobs in my career where I learned multiple different systems and was able to effectively troubleshoot tier 1 and 2 issues. I learned the ins and outs of help desk and also had the chance to gain knowledge on account maintenance and desktop support roles."
good,"A lot of outstanding people work for Lockheed Martin, but there are a few managers who really have no business being managers! There is plenty of opportunity if you are working in the right areas."
good,"Lockheed is a great company, however, unless you have a degree or a license of some sort, don't expect much in terms of hourly wages.  I do enjoy having a very flexible schedule, but I'd forego flexibility for more work hours.  Vacation, floating holidays, and sick days are quite reasonable all while being able to flex hours into or out of each day to make 40 hours per week."
good,"My employment and Lockheed Martin was rewarding and challenging. The opportunities to learn something new and work with people of various backgrounds and cultures was enjoyable. Managing change was a daily activity and required interaction with several departments such as Finance, Master Scheduling, Production and Global Sustainment.  The hardest part of the job was the length of time required to win contracts to manufacture or modify new aircraft. Acquiring these contracts are necessary to maintain employment levels."
good,"I was spoiled.  The work hours were flexible; they encouraged personal growth; and they work hard to ensure that you are always employed as in, whenever a contract ended, they worked hard to make sure that everyone was placed in on a new one."
good,"I saw a lot of change -- went from being part of Ford (Ford Aerospace), to being part of Loral, then getting acquired by Lockheed Martin.  The division I worked at was relocated to Orlando FL, from Orange County, CA (Only 4 people re-located).  I learned a ton in project/program management, strategic planning and leadership.  Worked hard.  Was paid well, and was fairly treated."
good,Overall great place to work. Employees are friendly and everyone works well together. The benefits could be a bit better however they a great work life balance program
good,"Good teams and people to work with, with plenty of new cutting-edge technologies to learn. Typical work days are nine hours, with every other Friday off."
good,"Was a very unique situation in that we were helping the commercial  customer define its needs and methods of operations.  Had plenty of leeway to talk to the customer at all levels and be listened to while making the case for something.  If the customer liked it it was possible to get handed the job of implementing the idea right then and there.  LM management on this contract was great in most respects if you did your work without close supervision.  They didn't have a problem about talking directly to the customer on most things.  Just let them know what you had going and if you ran into a problem."
good,Lockheed is great company that you could be proud to work for. The company offers many advancement opportunities for those that are willing to learn and take company provided training and classes.
good,"Lockheed Martin gave me the opportunity to work on some really fantastic programs. And there was a great deal of flexibility internally, on what I could be assigned to do. "
good,"LM was a good company to work for once the new manager took over. Senior manager was dismissive of any job category that did not have an engineering degree of some type. Coworkers were diverse and interesting, so was the work."
good,At Lockheed Martin I was give plenty of opportunities for career advancement and self improvement. This is a company that believes in investing in the community and it's employees but you do have to meet them halfway. They do offer a tuition reimbursement plan and offer flexible schedules if the need required and option is available. The company even offers opportunities for job placement or limited services to find a new job in the event of a layoff.
good,Good employment opportunities and lots of great co-workers from similar backgrounds. Also the downside to working there the turnover of old-timers is non-existent
good,"Management good, salary and benefits OK. Room to grow educationally, client often demanding, but company often worked with employees. Was not happy with shift work, but good people to work with."
good,"The work place and employees were interesting. My boss was a little difficult, never having much to say and giving very limited instructions. My assignment was to rewrite a technical manual for a mail sorting machine, My job was to rewrite the existing manual giving it more detail and updating it to provide for changes that had recently been made to the equipment. I would go for days and weeks without interacting with my boss. I wandered if the job was real because I got a sense that no one cared much what I was doing. The technical manuals I had written before was for equipment I had provide the manufacturing details for. So this job would have been more interesting if I had had access to the designer and those who had worked on the equipment. As it was I was on my own with no one to give any guidance. Although Lockheed Martin was a very reputable company, The PTI division had recently been purchased and unfortunately did not last very long."
good,Work was rewarding & allowed some autonomy/authority commensurate with responsibility.  Work as part of a team of professionals with same ideals.  Pace of work was good.
good,"was planning on retiring with LM however corporate decided to move program to TX. Lots of opportunities for advancement, large company that have many career choices"
good,"Lockheed Martin was a good place to work. It was interesting work, it could be challenging at times, I had the chance to move up to a leadership position, got to work on top secret government projects. I made good friends for life while working there, as there was a lot of good cameraderie, both at work and outside of work. Working shift work could be a bit hard, and weekends, too. Sometimes, not a lot of room to move up or improve skills, and not much help from the company to foster that. But, the pay was good, benefits were good, and overall I felt respected there, and there was good teamwork overall amongst co-workers."
good,"Very friendly, and extremely helpful in finding a job that would work well for me. Also helped me find places to advance. Very pleased with how they always helped me"
good,"Working on a NASA program rewarded me with exciting an new adventures.  It also taught me the business of doing thing right the first time, first time quality is very important."
good,Good advancement within career field.  Training excellent.  Great boss. Pay well above the norm.  Would love to work there again.  Promotions from within.
good,"Great first job for a new grad, but limited chances to move up and advance a career.  Pay and raises are very stingy compared to other companies.  Day to day work busy, but not challenging.  Limited chance to build resume with new skills."
good,My typical day at work for Lockheed Martin was a very good because of the training I received by utilizing my computer skills. I accomplished a great deal. I was motivated and looking forward with assisting coworkers and visitors.
good,"nice to go to same place every day."
good,This company has afforded me many opportunities to challenge myself and grow my skillset.  It is fast paced but has many resources available to complete your tasks properly.  Although it is sometimes difficult to find a healthy work/life balance they do try to accommodate their employees as best they can.  There have been a number of changes over the years with more on the horizon and their ability to think outside of the box and accept any challenge presented to them makes this a remarkable place to work.
good,"Lot's of time wasted trying to reach customers in closed areas, slow responses to requests for escorts into those areas. Overload of work (not enough cleared employees)."
good,"I did shipping for the department of the Navy,paperwork and plane parts all over the world using US Postal Service,UPS Fed Ex and trucking company form large plane parts . Filled in the custom paperwork for the large shipment going into other nations"
good,Lockheed Martin is an excellent company with regard to pay and benefits.  The flexible working time options and telecommuting options are very positive for employees.  Overall a good culture.
good,Liked working there. Pretty good for a large company. They had a terrible overtime policy where you weren't paid until your 6th hour over 40 hours. I'm not sure if that is still in place
good,Typical help desk environment. Cross training and lateral position moves encouraged. Training and informational sessions built into the daily routine. Employee interaction and assistance expected. Training and informational aids posted throughout the facility.
good,"A good place to work."
good,"Very Ethical!  Never worried about unfair treatment and received regular raises.  Only con is 60 hour weeks are required if you expect advancement, often with no hope of OT compensation for salaried folks."
good,"Great place to work. I've never had any issues at this job. The benefits are amazing and the discounts are also a plus. Home, auto ect. I'd recommend this place of business to anyone."
good,We were a remote mail entry site for the US Postal Service.  You set and keys mail for Indianapolis IN.  If your speed was kept high enough and had a minimum of errors we were allowed to listen to audio books.  This made the job more enjoyable.
good,"The job was fantastic, great atmosphere everyone is very friendly and helpful.  Learned a lot of things and was placed into multiple roles.  Management always encourages you and the hardest part of the job is probably meeting deadlines that were unreasonably placed.  It happens once in a while but they are great with getting extensions when they realize how unfair the deadline was... for example sometimes you'll get the material after the deadline has already passed...  Usually good at correcting for these issues though.  Most enjoyable part of the job was having access to the specified lab and free reign to do what you like with the system and having your office space right outside the lab as well.."
good,This company understands the importance of its employees.  Continuous improvement is embedded in the culture.  The work is stressful because the roles are stretched to be very lean.
good,Typical day of work was 9 hours. Most managers are good and rarely micromanage. Good work life balance with a strong culture. The pay you receive is fair for the work you provide. Some employees work harder than others and the yearly performance reviews do not necessarily allow for large increases in salary for strong performers.
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. New company took over contract and my position no longer existed. Great benefits, excellent management team in place. Would work for LM again."
good,Mainly now a support role but did get involved with new projects from the design phase up to the integration which included a lot of travel around the UK and time spent in Sweden integrating the new product and writing training manuals and delivering training to the Swedish trainers.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Lockheed Martin, working as a contractor. I learned many valuable professional skills, and developed my abilities in customer relations, data mining, organization, and technical writing."
good,"Provided alternative work schedule.  Promoted training and education, team building events such as picnic outings.  The holiday and the annual task-order luncheons were always a hit with the staff."
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to work. It is a lean culture that is willing to invest in process improvement. I had the opportunity to obtain a green belt certification which is a key tool in spearheading change. The company also does well in recognizing family as well as reaching out to the community!
good,Typical day had lots of activity. I learned a lot about supply systems. The management was fair and engaged. The workplace culture was happy and mixed employees of various experience levels that fostered learning. The hardest part of the job was the volume of data on inventories. The most enjoyable part was when a big project was completed.
good,"Although I was there for a short time, it was a pleasant change of pace from the wiring work that I was doing in the past.I had a great lead as well as a great manager who made sure that we remained productive and tried their best to get us the parts we needed to complete our jobs"
good,It was a great first job out of college with great people. Slow advancement and low compensation is ultimately why I left. I have heard this isn't true for Lockheed as a whole but in my particular branch it was.
good,Great place to work - lots of room for growth and improvement. Very challenging pace and atmosphere - but folks support each other.
good,"As an intern, I felt very comfortable working within the different software teams at Lockheed Martin. They provide you with any assistance you need as well as offer you certain levels of autonomy on specific tasks."
good,"A typical day working on this assignment had me working with several people at ARMY INSCOM to prepare for a new cloud based intelligence system that was being designed in Virginia to be relocated to a certain building at Ft. Gordon, GA. I had to prepare space in the data center by working with the G6, had to work with the IAM to make sure we had system security covered as per site guidelines stipulated, had to work with security to get clearance for any visiting personnel or for any equipment being delivered, basically learning the systematic process of who performed which functions within the building and then working with those people to prepare for the delivery and integration of the system that was getting delivered. (Fun times...) I learned a lot and met and worked with a lot of great people."
good,Outstanding work environment.  Efforts to create a work place where employees are valued and respected is sincere.  Compensation and benefits are outstanding as well.
good,"Great company to work for, so far best thing is work life balance. Moving up is a slow but almost sure process. Management can be good in some areas. Yearly performance system thats heavely criticized."
good,Company was great and benefits top notch.  Learned a lot and great workers that I would consider as friends.. Unfortunately totally dependent on one program at my location.
good,"Lockheed Martin is an excellent company in many ways; however, in my opinion (and others) Human Resources is not in place to help the employee who is struggling with management or other employees nor with advancement information. Also, (and this is true in other companies I (and others) have worked for - Ethics is not in place to protect the employee. It's there to ensure the company's written and unspoken policies prevail. Having said this, most employees are loyal and dedicated to the contract at hand. Still, it remains a very political environment and those who don't understand how the game is played, either get laid off or rarely have advancement opportunities. The ones I admire the most are the retired Navy Officers who are excellent in every possible way. Always!"
good,A great place to work! Very competitive salary packages and great room for growth and personal advancement.Very large company with great people to work with. Team atmosphere.
good,"Typical day efficiently and accurately sort child support payments. Coworker interaction was great and fun. Hardest part was the long days, management was very helpful"
good,"This was a typical cubicle workplace, easy to fall into a simple and repetitive routine.  The job had very nice benefits and rarely left me overworked or working overtime.  Management rarely impressed, but the workplace was overall a fairly nice place and there were still plenty of fun and kind coworkers.  It is a large complex, so there are a lot of other people working in the vicinity."
good,This company has its up sides and downs like most others but the good outweighs the bad.  One of the best things about this company is opportunities.  The company is always willing to let you try what you want and i think that's just great.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with LM. I worked with the grants review process working with different government organizations. I loved the independence and that it wasn't a typical in office 9 to 5. I loved my job as a facilitator and editor.
good,Great company to start or end a career.  Excellent management training and growth opportunities.  Stagnant with the raises and layoffs happen frequently.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with various IT (Contractors) and Federal Civilian professionals. "
good,Fabricating and Welding Parts directed to me by supervision and work with other employees to get the job done. Have the satisfaction of creating a part or parts that will help the space program
good,"I have great bosses, the atmosphere and culture are outstanding and they are forward thinking in their people skills.  There is room for growth in their training new employees arena and it was frustrating navigating the pit falls in choosing the right benefits."
good,Good Company.  Good benefits.  Good group of employees.  No new work since acquisition.  It appears we are headed for a shutsown.
good,Overall a great company to work for. Some co-workers need to learn what is appropriate for the workplace and what is not. There was a lot of free time within my department. Management needs to learn time management of their employees.
good,"LM really is a good company, and the benefits are very good.  My co-workers were good people and fun to be around."
good,Great place to work with lots of challenges. Employer were a willing to work with work schedule . Lots of good training great benefits
good,"I am very proud to be deployed to support our military heros. I work 12 hours a day- 7 days a week for 4-6 months at a time to give our troops support for mission requirements, working and living conditions, and overall well being to the best of my ability. I have learned the importance of our mission and am dedicated to it's success. My managers, co-workers, and I all work together as a team to accomplish this goal. The hardest part of my job is being away from family for extended periods of time. The best part is helping someone solve a problem to make thier deployment a little easier. I have made many lasting friendships throughout my deployments."
good,Working for Lockheed Martin's Center for Leadership Excellence is a fantastic opportunity. I am consistently driven to success the expectations of Lockheed Martin's Executive Leadership Team and the high level VPs that fall under the various business areas lead by the Executive Leadership Team members. The hardest part of this job is ensuring that all teams are aware of updates or changes to the event/program when provided on site. Supporting events for the CEO is both challenging and rewarding knowing that she has faith in my skillset to exceed expectations.
good,I worked for Lockheed Martin for 14 years and only left because of a reduction in force due to the government.  I would probably still be there if not for that.
good,Lockheed Martin is a very diverse company specializing in government contracts.  They are leader in innovation and emerge as a top player among defense and aerospace companies.
good,Great place to work and opportunities to move to various positions within the company. Great benefits and 401K. Not to stressful of an environment and will learn a lot from other co-workers and managers. Very goal driven company!
good,"Arrive at 7 and go through security and 4 doors before I got to my office. Perform required task and ensure my are was straight and organized. Learned a lot about lean management and ACE, Kaizans, Six Sigma and Root cause analysis. Co-workers were very competitive and that is good when you are all competing for the same  goal of and ACE'd company. Resources were the hardest part of my job but I enjoyed the benefits that the company offered for outstanding work. Great bonuses and giveaways."
good,"A typical day would include constant interaction with employees and customers that lead to teamwork and customer satisfaction.  Learned how to manage multiple personalities effectively and how to keep a large team motivated.  Management helped to provide career growth and stretch assignments.  My co-workers were professional, hard-working, and dedicated.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the changes within the timeframe and anticipating upcoming issues before they occurred.  The most enjoyable part of the Job was contributing to employee's career path and providing the best products and support to our customers."
good,I worked for Lockheed Martin for 18 years as a Computer Hardware Engineer. During this time I worked on the GPS ground system and was fortunate enough to travel to some remote Islands. I worked as an EMT Basic/Intermediate and Paramedic during the time I was working for Lockheed Martin.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for,  can be stressful at times but the management is very good and really cares about the employees."
good,"The work was great when it was steady. The up word mobility and cross training where there if you put the work in. Management kept a good flow of communication between mechanics and then self's.Co-workers where the same as every where good,bad but mostly good hard working,knowledgeable people. Hardest part was waiting for parts. Most enjoyable part send your product down the line 100% no defects."
good,"An OK place to work. They treat employees fairly for the most part. nothing great or bad about this place. I have worked at facilities that send contractors home when it is slow,,, so they have been good at finding us work instead of sending us home without pay. However,  alot of uncertainty heading into 2016."
good,"Participated in development of Standard Cost Part system. Involved in every part of the system's life cycle: analysis, design, writing specifications, coding, system testing."
good,"The work varies due to the contract but you will have the opportunity to learn from many different contracting opportunities. Therefore, remain teachable."
good,"Strong, large corporation with locations throughout the USA.  Great work-life balance with 9/80 scheduling and significant vacation.  Below-average compensation with low raises year to year."
good,"A place you can grow with.  High pressure, but not unreasonably so.  More comprehensive new employee education would be a win/win for management and engineering staff."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a very good company to work for, and very hard to get into. I will say that the pay is mediocre, but the holidays and off days make up for it. Also, the managers here at Lockheed are better now than ever before due to a heavy emphasis on making great leaders. Lastly, the once down side is the defense spending budget dropping. It doesn't help jobs here, there for promotion is hard, and worry about layoffs is a must."
good,"I review labor retrievals daily to ensure accurate charging to the correct charge numbers and project.  Weekly retrieve functional actuals and investigate any costs that do not appear to be a part of the plan or larger/smaller than expected.  I learned that creating automated excel files to calculate and highlight variance percentages, leave more time for data analysis.  The hardest part was locating the common data point on two systems so you could continue to search variances.  Most enjoyable part of the job was finding the exact driver of the cost variance."
good,Lockeed Martin is a company that survives.  It has many tenured employees that have worked the whole carriers in no other company.  This speaks to content employees that have a stake in the company.
good,East coast facilities were not originally Lockheed or Martin Marietta holdings and were never treated with the same respect.
good,"enjoyable atmosphere, great co-workers.  learned a lot about accounting areas,  supportive management, areas to move up within the company"
good,"Most days I get in early so I can get emails done and be ready for the team meeting. On a typical day this week, we had a late change from the client to deal with.  The team weren't too happy to have to squeeze in another change, but when our Task Order Manager explained how helpful it would be to the customer, we strategized and discuss how we could create a new process internally to continue to meet the costumers needs and demands."
good,"This company, along with most, has felt the impact of the poor economy over the last few years and as a result has taken away a lot of the benefits employees value such as transportation subsidies, gym membership reimbursements, and award fee bonuses.  "
good,"The assignment is challenging, The work internment is friendly between the management and the co-workers. I have support when I need to."
good,Lockheed Martin is the largest government contractor.  Saying that they have a lot of challenging jobs and some come with great pay if you have all the qualifications and certifications that meet the job requirements.  There benefit plans vary but on the most part are good.  The work environment on the most part is very good.  If you continue your education while working for Lockheed Martin and acquirer needed certifications related to your position .... Lockheed Martin usually recognizes those accomplishments with either upward mobility and/or increase salary.
good,I like my job at Lockheed Martin.  My job title is Desktop Imaging Engineer which consist of costomizing Operating Systems such as WinXP and Win7.
good,"Challenging and Fulfilling, Full spectrum of HR.  Team Effort.  Customer Satisfaction, Meeting, Customer Expectations."
good,I worked for Lockheed Martin for 27 years. They taught me everything i needed to know. I always got along with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the finished product.
good,"Start out the day with what is most important of the day task "
good,"Very busy area of the company, supporting all area's for parts and keeping track of inventory, Co workers all worked together did not matter the job that needed to be done, we got it done together."
good,"Management cares about the employees, There are lots of training available if you have time to pursue it."
good,The typical work day consist of putting together a kit list to make sections of the aircraft that is currently being made at the plant. I have learned to both lead and support in the years at the aircraft plant. The hardest part of the day is surviving the nine hour days and being able to stay focused on the job at hand.
good,"This company treated me fairly until the day they had to lay me off.  "
good,A typical day is making sure the entire installations Vindicator system doesn't go into a full communication fail. I also prepare for installs on multiple government level sights to ensure security standards are up to date.
good,"LMCO was a great company to work for.  If you work for the Civil group you will need to understand Engineering Change Notices, BOM's and waterfall schedules.  They offer great benefits especially if you are young and fresh out of college.  You will need to be a self starter and be able to multi-task well."
good,"The typical day was helping the retired military with what ever changes they needed to have done with their pay.  Great position and would have loved to stay on, but it was only a temp assignment."
good,"Great place to work. All holidays paid. Friendly work experience. The medical insurance is a little much, other then that no real issues. Work in different areas. Some advancement opportunities are available. Overtime is always an option."
good,"A top notch company for whom to work. Like all companies, know your craft."
good,"A typical day would include running through multiple reports and databases to enter billing for our contractor and then run through it all a few more times to check for accuracy. Most of what I know now about computers, came from working with this contractor and working directly with the techs. They even helped me build my home computer. Management was typically very easy to get along with, but they still made me want to do the best I could. Most of my co workers were easy to get along with. We all basically had the same sense of humor and laughed often in order to keep the stress levels low. The hardest part of my job was training someone to be my backup, as it took a few years for me to learn my position (and I'm still learning it) because things change often with how management wants things done. And to train someone who knows little about computers or how our databases work, it was a challenge. The most enjoyable part was working with my little group of co-workers. We had fun and joked around, but we also worked really well together. We were mostly on the same page with how things needed to be done from a workflow perspective."
good,"Good products and people.  Good benefits to include 401K, Medical, vision and dental."
good,"Lockeed Martin is a dying breed of employers where one can pick up with straight out of college, put their head down, and stay their whole career.  Work-life balance is reasonable: 40hrs/wk is the norm."
good,"Interesting, learning experience, with a team attitude.  Worked with various professional engineers.  Enjoyed the hands on learning experience of test lab equipment."
good,"A day of work is usually the same insatlling or terminated copper or fiber cable ether outside or inside. Thesting and tgging to indentify the new cables."
good,"Fun and challenging environment; key to growing within the company is to move around laterally across programs and areas"
good,"working in a dynamic environment and projects and tasks keep on changing, so much like working in a military camp. Want real comments? I'd rather keep it private......."
good,Lockheed is a good company with great benefits. The salaries seem to be on the low end on the contract I was supporting. Unfortunately my contract was up and the company was not looking to place us so we were forced elsewhere.
good,"Conducted a personnel of 3, conducting foot patrols, but vehicle patrols were more enjoyable.  I learned bout the hydraulic machines and how they actually worked, and looked at a few blueprint specs to get an idea of the engineer's job.  My coworkers were dependable.  We worked well providing a safe working environment for the employees."
good,Lockheed Martin was very professional and process driven. It was a fun place to work.
good,I worked as a safety specialist in the EHS division.  I was responsible for technical assistance to the maintenance department.  I also was responsible for the elevated work program.  Management was very supportive of the safety program.  The hardest part about the job was driving or riding to Oak Ridge everyday.  Great company to work for.
good,"Really enjoyed my time, great co-workers, and great work to do. Not much in the way of new opportunities recently due to the decline in the federal budget."
good,I enjoy the supporting the Marine Corps thru Lockheed Martin.  I have learned that if marines didn't have install teams then a lot of their communications assets would be installed wrong.
good,"I fly RC helicopters so for me watching Black Hawk helicopters flying over head is exhilarating to say the least!"
good,Government contracted work. Industrial machining environment.
good,Repair equipment used to maintain roads and sites of the test range. We had to work in the shop and on the range where the equipment was used. Great compensation for the job and also great benefits.  Too bad there was a contract bid that came up and Lockheed didn't win the contract.
good,"LM is a good company to work for in terms of work/life balance, salary, and advancement. However, those familiar with the frustrations that can occur in large companies will know the type of issues that can occur at LM."
good,"There are lots of opportunities. Multiple organizations and jobs to be had in a big company. However, watch for how you rank against your peers, as that will determine how you are compensated and progress in the company. Networking and managing your career is up to you, no one will do it for you, so keep abreast of your job field and ensure you are just as employable outside as inside . . . you never know when downsizing will catch up with you."
good,Smaller locations do not have advancement.  If you are young try for the leadership development program.
good,"Good work/life balance, ok money until you reach a certain level, you need to chase work/projects. Overall good company to work for."

good,"Some good and some bad attitudes within the company, but all together not to bad of a company to be working for."

good,"Although there is a heavy beuracracy, I still liked working for the company."

good,"The work at Lockheed Martin is interesting and challenging which means there is always something new to learn. Never had a day where I would come in and say ""There is nothing for me to do."" "
good,"This is actually the job with the crocked management. Other than that, I really enjoyed my job, the location and the environment."
good,"It's a big company, so the are plenty of opportunities, but the life of a contractor is not one of job security.  Annual merit increases of an average of 3%.  If you work hard, and are diligent you can advance, but they do place an emphasis on a college degree whether you have all the experience in the world, or not.  I believe this is just because that is what the customer also emphasizes as well.  Overall, a good place to work."
good,"Typical day at work: Start right in on whatever project I was on. Staff meeting attendance, communicate with the team to ask specific questions on what I have little / some knowledge. Interact with SMEs and Engineers to solidify and clarify any questions."

good,"While working for Lockheed Martin I've learned the supply chain process inside and out.  From ordering parts, to building a product, managing people, and shipping it to a customer.  Many of the teams I have worked with are willing to support others in their learning process."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the high level of stress to meet deadlines and rely on other people to get me information.  Also, my workload is constantly changing, so it is difficult to get into a rhythm."
good,Good place to work and excellent pay but advancement is limited for hourly employees.
good,Great place to work.  Valued independent thinking and valued you input
good,"I learned how to build the cargo floor for a C-130 aircraft. The typical day was okay. We had 2 breaks and 30 min lunch. I had some good people that I worked with but there was a lot, more than the good, that would talk and spread rumors for nothing. It was good because we only worked 4 days a week and had Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off. We were offered some overtime and when worked on Sunday's we earned double time. The hardest part of the job was the physicality part. Not every area in the plant was bad but the section I worked was very debilitating. The most enjoyable part was knowing that no one in the world built the section and part that I did. There was no chance for advancement."
good,LM is a company you will find yourself learning something new each day. Working with SAP is where I spend most of my work day yet my primary function is program management for various contracts. The team I currently work with is highly knowledgeable and extremely friendly from the co-workers and up to management.
good,I would recommend this company to new hires through mid level career employees
good,I was a deployed contractor for Lockheed Martin so my typical day at the office involved working closely with the army. I never had any issues with my supervisor or co-workers. The hardest part of my job was being away from my family and the best part was being able to do my job.

good,typical day of work - 75% of day in internal/external meetings
good,A typical day at work on third shift consists of doing flight inspections getting the jets ready for flight.  Sometimes there are components that go bad and need changing.  Management is okay.  They are not there for the entire shift so if there is something that needs to be addressed it must be done before they go home.  Co-workers are great.  If it weren't for them I would have searched for another job a long time ago.  The hardest part of the job is when there is nothing to do on our shift.  It gets really boring and tedious sometimes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.
good,A great place to learn and grow. Lo ts of opportunities to increase knowledge. Lots of leadership development opportunities. HIgh scrutinty due to government spending. 
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for. They compensate me well for my time, but it was like pulling teeth to get a raise after 2 years, even though new employees that were hired to work below me were started out with a higher salary than I was currently making. The advancement opportunities really vary depending on what contract you work on. It is spotty at best."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at LM because the people I interacted with on a daily basis were interesting and passionate about their work as much as I did.
good,"Enjoyed working for Lockheed! It was a great palce to work which concentrated on work life balance. My co-workers were the best group of people to work with, all were very knowledgable."
good,Flex 40 gives good work/life balance. Co-workers are great. Advancement sometimes difficult. Layoffs are usually emminent.
good,A nice company to work for. Flex 40 hour schedule gives you a good work/life balance. Job stability sometimes questionable with the economy because it's a manufacturing company. Co-workers are great people to work with. Job advancement sometimes difficult.

Each day is filled with a heavy workload that have certain timre restraints on them."
good,"Every day is a challenge, with new opportunities to excel. There is never a dull moment and it is full of challenges. I have learned a lot about a new aircraft programs, from initial development through customer deliveries and field operations support. The management expects a lot of hard work, which makes better workers. Expectations are high. The people working on the F-35 program are some of the hardest working pwople I have ever worked with. The pace of the work, and the challenges, keep it interesting. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I have accomplished something that helped the program. It is very sarisfying to know that I have the confidence of the customer (US government) because of the work I have done. They have confidence that I will take care of airworthiness related issues that challenge the flight certification efforts."
good,"I initially worked on the Titan ICBM missile, as a lead Dynamics, acoustic, and vibration engr. I then worked for17 years on satellite programs, and was the lead Dynamics engr. on these programs. Performed tests, analyses, and documentation. Made presentations, evaluations, and supported many proposals. Hardest part of job was when, as lead dynamicst, I have to give program mgr. impt decisions whether I thought spacecraft were safe to fly, based on my analyses and evaluations. Most enjoyable part was the interchange with other engineers, including the customer."
good,Great opportunities to grow within the company. Good work/life balance and sound management.
good,hard but consistent work place. intelligence is required and the ability to preform repetitive task with precision.
good,"This is a good place to work in the Defense industry, but the organizational structure is very tall and it is slow-going changing the culture form the ""good-ole' buy network"" to performance-based management."

Everyone worked with the same care and priority understanding that we all supported each other. I enjoyed the job and really cannot think of anything negative, unfortunately the contract ended at Robins Air Force Base."
good,"Constant changes, mission challenges, make for a diverse and interesting work environment. Great benefits, One of the best. Excellent work/life balance."
good,"I loved my time with Lockheed. On occassion, management would make bad decisions, if it truly was them instead of leads that made decisions. I had no issues other than a few databases that were poorly created."
good,"Large company with diversly located facilities, roles and responsibilities. Lots of opportunity."
good,"hold kick off meeting, assigned work schedule, review and updates all reports on receiving, inventory, cycle count, aisle audit, and recycle"
good,"My experience at Lockheed Martin ranges from conceptual fluid systems design to formal released engineering for machined part, sheet metal, casting, tubing, assembly and installation designs for the most advanced fighter program in the world. After design of several developmental test aircraft, I switched over to manufacturing in order to gain experience with respect to the build of the jet. During the IAM union strike, I also had the opportuinity to spend several weeks working on the aircraft. I prefer a challenging and fast paced work environment. Lockheed Martin offers this experience and more. The co-workers are as good if not better than most companies. For the most part, the Lockheed Martin management is made up of seasoned professionals with good experience. Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for and offers a good salary and benefits package."
good,- Excellent working environment that typically involves the Installation of various Tactical/Satellite Communications.
good,professional in the heart of downtown. You get to work in peace.
good,deliver classified to classified buildings and destroy classified when needed
good,The most enjoyable part of my current job is considering the end result which is affording a better life for children around the nation. The programs I manage help to find mothers and fathers who neglect their children and do not meet their support obligations. The work is for a very honorable cause and I appreciate that.
good,"Enjoyed all of the positions I held there, I gained so much experience in human resources and publication. I enjoyed friendships with all my co-workers."
good,Been with lockheed missiles and fire control for 5 years. It's a good environment with challenging work. Advancement up the corporate ladder is attainable if you work hard. The only cons I would say is it can be difficult to move from one program to the next for a different experience.
good,Wish I was still there. Different duties each day........interesting work.
good,While working at Lockheed I have met some amazing people that I continue to keep in contact with because we have become as close as family. If I had the chance to come back; I would be glad to.

good,Typical big company environment but relaxed environment. They have pretty flexible schedule.
good,"Very slow place environment, old school company with hardly any perks."
good,"A stressful yet fulfilling experience every day. My day was about ensuring the surgical staff had what they need to take care of our wounded warriors and veterans. I ordered what needed to be ordered, resupllied, and navigated around potential problems as the need arose. What I learned most was how complex the logistics process could be. Although, when you have the right processes and resources the supply chain will remain strong."
good,Challenging day to day with new opportunities to advance and grow.
good,it was a good job to work for they where flexible with the hours and the work environment was cool and laid back. they let you tend to your work and get as many hours as you want. their are only two cons that come to mind and that's their lay off period and then the end of the quarter where everyone was in a rush to get units out the door
good,"Lockheed Martin has great benefits with their 401K matching and health and dental. They also implement a 9/80 work schedule and so I have every other Friday off work which is excellent. "
good,"It is a good company. Good People. Job Security. It is a bit crowded as regards to the huge number of employees, and parking problems. But all in all a good company."
good,Good company to work at in 90-2015.  Became overly focused on processes over performance from 2015 and on.  Still a good company to work for.  Needs less emphasis on processes and more on production of product.
good,great people to work with. people helping people friendly work place. no pressure. well planned working team. very giving work schedule management will work with you if you have any issue with your schedule.
good,Great work environment with many flexible job requirements that push employees to think outside the box. THe pay is pretty good and time off is as well.
good,"If you want to work on a diverse set of space programs for the military or space exploration purposes, this is the place to be. Great history, hard working and brilliant people for the most part, beautiful campus, not much to complain about. Some teams you can be placed on are not good experience, but that is to be expected in a company of this size. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Phenomenal Company!  Great work-life balance.  Work 4/10's so every Fri off, but long work days (10 hrs ea).  Great teams in ADP.  Pace is incredibly fast!!  But that also depends on your position.  Some admins support one, others two directors or more."

good,"Great place to work given the area of experience and professionalism, enjoy my management and group I am involved with. I would recommend working for Lockheed Martin to my friends and family"
good,They are a good company  they are fair and they have great company moral only thing with LM is that they do not pay very well in accordance to the position one holds
good,Productive and fun. innovative and productive. Public sector experience and insights shape understanding and deliver the answers you need to move forward.
good,Lockheed Martin Aeronautics provides a challenging and rewarding job environment.  It provided an environment in which you could contribute to the advancement of the program you were on.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work for family work life/ balance.  The hours were great and we had every other Friday off or 9/80 work schedule.  My job was challenging, but leadership worked with you to make sure you succeeded in your role.  They also encouraged continuing education and provided tuition assistance.  The culture at the job was enjoyable, as there was always something to do and get involved in.  Overall, I enjoyed my time with Lockheed Martin."
good,"Good work-life balance, especially every other Friday off is one of great perks in this company. The Big downside is that a compensation is about 20~30% below than market average and there is only 1~2 percent raise every year which means wages aren't keeping up with Inflation."
good,"access control. checking credentials and ID's. accepting deliveries for people inside the building. Patrol of building insuring all doors are closed and intact. Making sure there are no cell phones or data recording devices in the building, with the exception of government cell phones and devices with a wavier."

good,"Lockheed was a very professional work environment. It was also extremely independent with the work, you were offered overtime anytime you wanted to take it and most groups had flexible hours as long as you were able to complete your weekly quota they did not mind if you came in early or stayed late. this often led to having four day work weeks. they provided multiple outlets to help build a good work family relationship."
good,Very good place to work I was treated great and welcomed in as a contractor. I would go back to work for this company anytime. They treat their employees as family.
good,"Nice company with engineers with technically excellent background and capability. Streamline processes are in place with several decades of experiences. Provides good benefits for vacation, 401K, health insurance. Making efforts to catch up with new rising company's special benefits like stock option. No free meals and snacks. Occasional meals and snacks for program events."

good,Lockheed was a great company to work for. The work group had synergy. The upper management communicated well to continually support the goals of the employees.
good,Working here I have learned a lot. It is a great work environment. Everyone in the workplace was very informative and very helpful. I would definitely re-apply.
good,"As an electronics assembler, I almost always had the resources needed to do my job. Engineers and support staff were readily available if any problems or questions arose."
good,"Manage the LM Raven Works Labs and primary interface with the DOD customers, vendors and partners.  I am currently a SME for C6ISR systems and with DOD as Combat Mission planer."
good,"There was a production meeting every day.  Each department would report their daily activities planned and unplanned.  There"
good,"Everyone there was awesome.  It was a great place to work. My boss was a great guy who always made sure we were taken care off.  Unfortunately, I was a contractor and the contract dried up."
good,As an intern I mostly helped create requirements documentation.  Most of the time I was fairly bored and had to seek out projects that interested me since the work I was given was boring.  They paid well and were very eager to get new engineers.
good,Good people. Many Process's. Many hoops to climb through. Must conform to the LMCO culture or you will be very unhappy working there. I found it to be a very good experience over all. Developed greater respect for our military and the company as a whole.
good,"While working at Lockheed Martin I was able to secure a Secret Clearance, receive updated training, the atmosphere was pleasant, supervision was very helpful and encouraging."
good,8 hours shifts.  Learned to work quickly an efficiently.  Management left you alone as long as you were productive.  Culture was with other contractors doing the same thing.  Hardest part was not knowing if there was another contract was available after the current one was finished.
good,"There is always something new to look at in Lockheed Martin, requests for bids are coming in all the time and have to be responded to. Technically, these can be challenging and finding the right skills to respond in the time available is always challenging. Finding the skills for deliver is equally challenging, but that's what makes life worth while."
good,"Good place to work and job security. The company overall is a good place to work. Depending on the actual work location will depend on the environment,  some environments are less interactive than others."

good,"Big, well-established corporation with many opportunities, especially for those in the early phase of their career or willing to relocate, and with competitive benefits."
good,"The promotion system at Lockheed is, frankly, abysmal. In-line promotions almost never happen, and so for a while I was encouraged to simply apply for other jobs at higher pay grades when I became eligible. Of course, this means I likely have to apply to a position elsewhere with the company, because there isn’t an incentive for the company to take a lower level person and put them into a higher level seat within the same space or program, which makes the overall logistics of promotion difficult."
good,"good job, good hours, set hours, organized, steady work days, dependable workers, sufficient tools for the jobs at hand, clean work environment, great supervisors"
good,Lockheed martin provides career opportunities but might be a slow process for some.  More advancement opportunities would keep more employees happy and eager

good,"good work days "
good,"I worked for Lockheed Martin in Ocala for 8 years. I saw a lot of change in those years, some was for the better and some was for the worse. Overall it is a stable career with benefits. That alone is hard to find. You can be promoted to management if you have a Bachelors degree and you put in your time. you may have to apply multiple times before you get a interview. If you like to work with your hands and be apart of a team, Lockheed is the place for you."
good,"Working as a Project Manager at Lockheed was a very interesting position that varied widely depending on my customer.  It went from standard waterfall, EVM projects following a structured, traditional project management strategy to a variety of flavors of Agile/SCRUM/Kanban projects.  Everyone working there was considerate and hard working, although most had more loyalty to the customer than to the company because they had migrated from company to company over various contract cycles.  Overall, I really enjoyed working for Lockheed, management seemed to care and there were opportunities to advance, so long as you were willing to put in the work."
good,"I enjoyed working at LM and only left as I relocated up in the NE Kingdom.  LM is a wonderful place to work, I miss it. It is hard to get hired, and it's a lengthy process too.  But well worth it!"
good,"Every second Friday off.  Work 80 hours in 9 days. Well educated and motivated team.  On site cafeteria,  Modern office space.  Stable IT for in office and remote work."

Managed invoicing, overhead and customer reports, PR suspense, timesheet adjustments, purchase orders for hardware/software, marketing input. Liaison for Payroll and HR issues."
good,"Job is fine, no real complaints. The fact that I need to be more descriptive is such a pain, especially to update a resume. Come on really Indeed. Lockheed is perfectly fine and just like any other aviation company."

good,"A typical day at work is a combination of critical thinking, problem solving (really only suggestions), and database maintenance. Every program has a place where things are stored and you must maintain your own little area you are put in charge of. Usually people won't have to see your specific stuff but navigating people through the many mazes of folders to your specific folder is not conducive to solving actual design questions."

My job was to maintain the integrity of the material store inventory records and keep them accurate. But alas as the military and aerospace needs of the U.S. changed the company was compelled to downsize. and my job, and indeed the whole organization moved and consolidated in Colorado and elsewhere! I would have been happy there my whole working carrer!"

good,Senior technicians and engineers willingly share their experiences to other technicians. All people collaborate to accomplish end goals and to achieve deadlines for delivery of systems.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be getting to work early to prepare me for the day before I clock in. After I have clocked in we have to do much need stretches before we head to our workstation. Then management would tell us about the latest news about the company and if we had any questions to come and talk to them at that time. Working with so many different people helps me to understand we all do not think the same way but, we all have to work together The hardest part of my job would be having to wait for parts that's down time and hard to maintain schedule. Through out the day I'm doing my job as a sheet mentalist drilling holes, shooting and bucking rivets. The best of my job is completing my task and knowing that I build a quality part. Also knowing what I have build is correct because people depends on it. When I see airplanes fly I feel proud because I know that I may have build a part of that plane"

good,"Great company, with a lot of different opportunities, but career growth is often very slow. Lockheed Martin boasts some very challenging and interesting roles, and an incredible group of intelligent and hardworking people."
good,"My experience with Lockheed was a good one, it quickly showed me that understanding your ability and what your capable of is greatly important. That sometimes, what you think your meant to do, or what you think you should do, isn't necessarily what you are actually meant to do. The management team at SOFSA was incredible, and I greatly appreciate my leadership there for the time and effort they gave to me when it came for it. As far as the culture, with over 100 folks there, many different people were around, and many folks were able to give a great deal of expertise and experience that helped in my learning of my role in the workplace. My only chief complaint is that...upon arriving to my work place, i was effectively dumped at a station, told good luck and be on your merry way. The result being myself spending time asking a thousand and one questions about where things were, and how to start things, and being put to a position i was unfamiliar with how to handle, costing time and effort. If i were to place a recommendation, it would be to have a shadow program where new folks, or those of lower experience, be able to shadow someone and work 3-5 jobs to get a better feel for the flow of the work life. This creates comaraderie and a sense of understanding of what's expected./"

good,If your contract ends you shouldn't take it as a given that just because Lockheed Martin is a very large company that they will be committed to finding a new position for you.

In this environment we were able to work in different areas depending on the need of what had to be done. If we did go to a different area we were trained properly. I myself liked learning different procedures and always tried to learn more. Management was always a problem. Seemed like they assigned people that they liked rather than for what they actually knew and it was apparent to everyone which created an atmosphere of resentment towards higher management.

good,I had a wonderful management team for the last 7 years of my 24 years at LM. I have also had some awful managers that made going to work dreadful. It is not consistent across the company. But since there are so many opportunities in the corporation - the best option is to move internally if you are unhappy.

good,"I really enjoy working for Lockheed Martin. The people are great and the management is great as well. The workload is manageable and I enjoy doing what I do. The only downside to Lockheed Martin is that its very hard to move up in the company. The pay is reasonable, but a little less than I could make somewhere else."

good,Ok company to work for with great work life balance. Sometimes the management can be a little out of hand but other than it's not all that bad.
good,"I would typically begin work early in the morning before most employees entered the workplace (I feel I can get a lot of work accomplished at this time).  I met some really great people that also work on the Sikorsky team, many of them I still stay in contact with.  This job required me to verbally report on the financial and schedule status of the program to management.  The preparation for these reports was very time-consuming and rewarding."
good,Good company to work for. Compensation is rewarding however advancement is difficult as you reach higher grade levels. Cultural awareness should be a focus to improve customer/supplier relations and employee engagement.

good,The company has an excellent attitude to all its staff and has friendly atmosphere. They have an open and no blame culture and embrace change through lessons learned.
good,"One of the benefits of working for such a large corporation is the ability to move around in order to gain new experiences from various programs.  They have tuition reimbursement for those who want to continue their education.  There's also gym reimbursement to help promote healthy living.  There are peaks and valleys in workload:  some days are calm while on others you're scrambling around like a chicken with its head cut off.  It's a desk job, where (for the most part) the only walking you do is from your desk to the conference room for a meeting (where, again, you sit).  It is a heavily defense-driven corporation.  With that, comes a lot of Type A personalities."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a good place to work where work and life balance is practice everyday. Usually, they are very flexible if you have a family."
good,"Great program working on an awesome product. Overall company and leadership have strong values that are adhered to.

good,"Co-workers and Management was terrific! Everyone helped each other. We were all busy however, if someone needed help, we asked and received. It was a family that worked and taught others. This enabled us to pass on knowledge and in the long run it helped the company. The company never frowned on it."
good,Company is good with work/life balance giving employees the opportunity to work from home and flextime. Also giving every other Friday off is a plus.
good,"I enjoyed the majority of my employment with Lockheed Martin. I would absolutely consider working for them again. The location in Southern Maryland is right next to a huge police academy and the police trainees frequently pull over people going even a mile or two over the speed limit. Although, that is no fault of Lockheed Martin, it is a huge negative for working there. Once i complete my education, I would consider working for this facility again. Really fun workplace!"
good,"I learned how to behave in a corporate company, increased my knowledge about helicopters, and enjoyed the work I am doing on a daily basis."
good,"LM is an excellent company for work for. It's the leader in the government contracting. If you join the company right out of college there are many opportunities but it can also be a spring board or a revolving door. The Tuition Assistance is the best providing employees with ample opportunities to obtain Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees."

good,Great people and systems in place to insure contracts are effectively handled.  They pay right on time and have adequate benefits.  They train their employees well.
good,"I worked at KAPL, Inc., which is a Department of Energy Laboratory where US Navy nuclear reactors are designed.

He challenged me to pursue answers, to ask questions and answer with facts.  "

good,"excellent job opportunity, management very supportive, work environment first class (NASA facility) building large tanks for LNG gas products."
good,"I was a software development intern and had the opportunity to learn from some of the smartest people in the industry.  I worked in the flight simulations lab, so there was always plenty of work and new projects.  Management very encouraging and provided great guidance.  Any issue I had was addressed immediately.  My coworkers were very helpful and had no problem helping me with my summer projects.  Overall, I enjoyed my time there, but the job culture was average/below average.  It seems as if it is very difficult for younger employees to move up the chain and many of the older employees seemed disgruntle by the current conditions there."

good,Small workforce that worked well together. Management really seemed to care if their people were happy and took care of them.
good,always leaning forward to face situations head on. Great family atmosphere. Willing to go the extra mile to assist with any problem.
good,"I worked for 20+ years for Lockheed Martin. There is a lot of diverse opportunities available within the Company. Like all companies it has some good and bad features. If you want to work in a high profile top technology company, this is an excellent company. Only set back would be the lack of personal attention you might receive at a smaller company. I would recommend this company, especially to those seeking technical opportunities."""
good,"My daily duties as a catering and planning manager position are:"
good,"I enjoy working with Lockheed Martin.  Helpful friendly people.  I managed my own ADO office among other tasks and responsibilities at CMAFS.  Organizing, training, machine checks and maintenance, customer service, multi-tasking, and problem solving.  My customers consisted of Military, civilians, and contractors.  I love my job and what I do.  Helping people on a daily basis was what I look forward too. I have enjoyed working with Lockheed martin."

Beyond that portion of the day, we were constantly addressing areas for product improvement focused on continuing successful launches through the duration of the flight program"
good,A typical day at work starts with a morning meeting with staff and production line employees.  Safety and what is expected for the day concerning desired production results. Management ask employees is there any questions about a specific type of job and safety concerns.  Co-workers have many years of  experiencein the field of their work. The more experience employee is placed with the less experience for them to gain knowledge in the area.  The hardest part of the job is knowing the one mistake may cost you your life!  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing  that what you do if for YOU  and YOUR COUNTRY STRATEGLY !!!!!
good,"•	Develop proposals for US Government (DoD) programs utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and TINA audit/management elements."

The shifts are not easy they are sixteen hour shifts. there is no tolerance for tardiness or undone duties. There is always a strive for excellence."
good,"I enjoy Lockheed Martin. My colleagues are pleasant to work with, much of the work we do is interesting, and the benefits are good.  I am less bothered by some of the government contract requirements than by the occasional misplaced request to drop what you are doing and respond to a Lockheed Martin corporate policy request. Despite some large company bureaucracy, I still give LM a big ""thumbs up."""

good,"A typical day at Lockheed Martin starts with setting up for the jobs you need to do that day. You learn a lot about team work and work ethic. You are working for the fighting solider on the field. Management is helpful, but thin at times. The co-workers keep to themselves most of the time because it is a manufacturing plant. The hardest part of the job there would be learning all that goes into building assemblies. The most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing you built a quality product that will not fail."

good,I have worked for Lockheed Martin in a variety of positions for 18 years. I love this company and the opportunities it has afforded me. I am currently at risk of being laid off because the program I am working is making cutbacks which has been determined to be the Systems Engineering group. I have been part of the SE group since it's inception 3 years after the program began. I have been working to pay down the technical debt the program has incurred since it's inception. Gone are the times in which a lifelong employee who isn't close to retirement age is a valued employee utilized to teach young engineers how to integrate into the work force.

good,Good people to work around and just absolute good environment and great workplace
good,"Loved the people and the company. Worked for a government contractor special projects. The facets of the work place I can't say, sorry. I was advanced to a new position from where I started. I had benefits from my company and from my husband since he was in the military. The hardest part of the job was having to say goodbye - my family was moving for the military. I enjoyed everyday I worked there, so much to learn."
good,Typical day at work in working with other advanced missile design team members and Pro E drawings to obtain for physical description of parts and building 3-D thermal models for Thermal Desktop Thermal Analysis Software.  Finite difference and finite element models of the parts and sometimes the entire missile were built and analyzed to determine what if any design changes were required to maintain critical parts within acceptable temperature limits.  Aerodynamic heating boundaries were calculated and incorporated into the thermal model.  Periodic design reviews were held by management.  Laboratory tests were also performed.

good,"great place to work. Management was top notch."
good,"Good company to start work for, for first time job. I started off as a utility worker, after a few months of employment I was moved to warehouse. An after 3 months in the warehouse I became a team leader not a assistant or supervisor. After a year in the warehouse I was then moved to a cook/chef. The managers and supervisors there are all good people. When I needed time for family issues they gave me more then enough."
good,"My typical days where spent making sure my responsibilities where taken care off."

good,The demands change daily but I would gladly go back.  I miss my team!
good,Every minute of the day was put toward the final product and to my team who made it come togeather. Management was a strong supporter in the day to day efforts. My co-workers were there to help you when ever you needed it. The hardest part of my job was waiting for the materials we needed to fix our old airplanes. Lockheed and the folks that worked there were family.  We had a great team.
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"A typical day at Sikorsky Aircraft, was indeed a positive feeling on the outlook ahead. I enjoyed learning how we fabricate transmission gears, for the BlackHawk Helicopter. The management and my co-workers, always knew what had to be done to make sure, all aircraft got to the customers on time. The hardest part the of job was, paying close attention to work instructions, and paying attention to detail. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing, that I was helping the United States Army saving soilders in, Iraq and Afghanistan."
good,"There was the every day challenge that made going in fun.  While the basics of Supply Chain/Contracts is the same, each contract had its own twist which led to the everyday challenge when it came to managing the work."
good,"Lockheed is a great place to work. Just know that you are a contractor, and when that contract that Lockheed has is up, you need to have another opportunity lined up."

I enjoy interacting with people and learning new concepts and ideas."
good,working with and for Lockheed performing depot maintenance was very rewarding with opportunities for advancement
good,"I enjoyed my job at Lockheed very much so, giving me lots of exposure to a professional working environment. For my daily routine, I would get in, in the morning and eat my breakfast while checking my emails for new or updates on projects and run data to create reports for a coworker. After running the reports and sending them out I would work on a model or drawing that had been red lined for a desired change. Upon finishing I would take the next task, which may be another red line, or a design project. I would continue this until a coworker would request my assistance in the lab. I would help with the task at hand and go to lunch. I would continue working on any design project or red lined drawing/model until the day was complete. I learned a lot while at Lockheed, some including: priority and time management, as well as the cohesive working environment involving team projects and continued exposure to design work. My only dissatisfaction with the position is that there was not enough hands on work and would like to have been able to get away from the computer once in a while."

Drilling holes in an aircraft wing to input new fasteners, flying to another state to assist in maintenance until replacement hires are appointed.  Checking the top of an aircraft, looking into an engine, whatever is needed to make sure quality and professionalism is attained."
good,"A great place to build experience.  Very supportive of new employees, and lots of opportunities to broaden your knowledge.  Tends to be very conservative though.  Often small challenging opportunities are passed over in favor of large, less risky programs.  While a great business strategy, these opportunities tend to be less interesting and leaves more experienced engineers unchallenged."
good,"Inspecting and rejecting of non conforming parts to specification. I ran the area the held the non conforming parts that were distributed to the departments for repair or scrap. A meeting was held with the engineers twice a week to decide if the parts could be saved or scrapped out. I processed the paper work to return the parts to the right departs for rework as specified by the engineers. Or made sure the parts were scrapped out as required by the engineers. I kept records of all processes and reworked or scrapped and where the parts were released to. "

good,"Productive "
good,Completing my goal and staying busy.  Did reports and installations.  Got more knowledge on avionics and wiring.

good,"Good benefits, hands on work, high responsibility and impact on product."

good,Lockheed Martin is a good company to work for.  The benefits are probably the best in the defense industry.  The work was challenging and job security was never an issue.
good,"The first thing I did in the morning was check emails and voicemails from the previous day. Next, I would browse my notes pertaining to my current project and continue working from the point I stopped the day before. I would attend any necessary meetings and consult with co-workers for help as needed to perform my duties."

good,"love the working enviroment with great employees at Ft. Polk, la."
good," Busy work day"
good,"Working with Lockheed Martin has been an excellent opportunity for me  as it has afforded me the exposure to working with government contracts. The arena of working with an organization whose primary customer is the U.S. government has presented me with totally new mannerisms of working in the accounting field.  I have been tasked with working on government contracts from their inception through their close out process.  Over the past 10 years I have held a couple if different titles/roles with the company.  Initially I spent 50% of my time working in an accounts payable role and 50% in an accounts receivable role.  When my business manager realized my expertise and prior work history she felt my talents were not being put to their best use and requested that I devote 100% of my time to the accounts receivable side.  Three years after being hired by Lockheed I was promoted to a Multi-Functional Analyst Senior.  I continued to work the accounts receivable accounting aspect but was also exposed to the financial planing and analysis side of the Business Operations department.  I have been consistently challenged by the frequent process changes due to current state of affairs in Washington D.C.  Of particular note, due to the sequestration dilemma, we are currently faced with decreasing budgets and lay offs are ensuing. The most difficult portion of this job is the fact that the billing rate structure is in constant flux and that it takes several years before the government has finalized the rate for a particular year.  This results in frequent adjustments to the billings and forecasts."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Health Fitness Corporate as a Health Fitness Specialist intern.  I was able to interact with the employees of Lockheed Martin by greeting and checking them in at the front desk.  I monitored and maintained the Fitness facility.  I helped administer and demonstrate specific exercises and stretches to answer any inquiries the employee may have had.  It was a rewarding and great learning experience to be able to get my feet wet and work with all the members.  I was able to build life long customer relationships and enhance my knowledge through working with them as well.  I was able to create and implement workout plans specifically tailored to each individuals wants, fitness level, needs, and goals.  My fellow staff were friendly and wonderful mentors.  The only downside I felt hindered having optimal learning was the allotted amount of time for the internship.  It was a shared internship for 2-3 times a week and every other day.  The hours I was allowed to work wasn't on a continuous basis where I felt I could establish a routine and have more time to focus on core learning fundamentals.  An example of this was not being able to actively administer fitness evaluations and tests.  My internship was a temporary position, towards earning college credit for graduation, therefore, my time there was very limited. I definitely would like to return to work through HFC, for I see the potential career paths and opportunities that they provide that would make a bright future. "
good,A typical day consisted of operating and maintaining radars and performing training missions. You have a diverse team of co-workers. 
good,Lockheed Martin is a good company to work. They have great work/life balance by providing 9/80 work schedules. They have great training courses which allow employees to grow and learn different fields. I have learned a great deal about Lean six sigma working as an operational excellence enginneer.
good,I was the Financial Analyst on the International Program. I learned how to interact appropriately with individuals and customers spanning the globe. The management staff within my facility was a unique blend of individuals with varying management styles. My co-workers were highly skilled individuals who had a strong work ethic. The hardest part of my job is the deadlines. I am often presented with tasks that require an immediate turnaround time. This causes for a fast paced and challenging work day. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I was able to reduce risk on my program while performing with excellence.
good,I enjoyed working on the 9/80 schedule getting every other Friday off and having a great working rapport with the employees and management. The hardest part was leaving as our campus was being downsized.
good,"Production here is like surviving the trenches. Great comradery is built, you can't believe what you accomplished, and it gives a nice satisfaction."
good,Management and peers were pleasant and helpful. I was encouraged to learn as much as possible. Good training.
good,Lockheed Martin company is a wonderful generous company to work with!

good,Job was exciting and changed daily. A really nice and exciting place to work.
good,"Maintained system documentation, tuning system performance, installing system wide software and allocate mass storage space."
good,springboard for many opportunities
good,"Good company to work for. But contracts come and go so depending what project you're working on, you may have a job in 5 years you may not. But if you move around for promotions, you can move up pretty steadily. Solid benefits!"
good,"While I would rather not get in to specifics, Lockheed Martin is a very good place to work. They provide stimulating work and allow for enough vacation and time off to have a good family life outside work. I have been with them over 8 years and I hope I can stay with them at least a few more years."
good,"Review of quality, efficiency and safety issues on file with shop leads and develop action plan for the day. There are always new or improved ways of doing the same work to eliminate waste. Shop workers are always engaging in the process. The successful completion of this team effort provides sustained incentive into the next project to be championed by engineering and manufacturing."
good,"Currently I am in the process of establishing and implementing a quality management system. ISO certification has been achieved with successful government acceptance for Surface, submarine, and shore installation work. There has been a change in management and multiple groups have combine under a single business unit. The current management does understand quality principles and process improvement. The main focus is less than what is required to maintain the currwent level of success and will require a culture change of most of Top Management and staff making it a difficult and less than enjoyable place to work. My solid line manager is more understanding of quality principles and believes it is the road to a successful business unit future but he is based out of the west coast and is seldom in the local area. The Top management on location says all the right words but their actions says the opposite. I enjoy working in the quality arena but progress will be non-existent in quality for years to come unless something drastic happens, which doesn't seem likely."
good,Management was good.
good,The people can make the job worthwhile... it is about the people.
good,The company is a stable company that in the past offer growth and potential movement. I enjoyed the people I work with and for.
good,Enjoyed most days working in the group. Engineers were friendly and willing to give a helping hand and guidance. Interesting projects and got the chance to travel and participate in flight testing
good,"I have been with Lockheed for 10 years now and it has been a great place to work. The only negative thing that i can say about it, is that the work depends on the economy. If the economy is down then there aren't a lot of orders and the number of airplanes produced will reflect that."
good,"This work involved working for Lockheed Martin, Inc. on a dedicated contract supporting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/Environmental Response Team-Research Engineering and Analytical Contract (US EPA/ERT-REAC) with state-of-the-art innovative technologies and expertise for the evaluation, assessment and solution of environmental problems impacting human health and the environment."

good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work and develop or hone your engineering skills. On my program and the company as a whole, mentoring was highly encouraged and allowed the seasoned professionals to hand down their knowledge to fresh new talent. The young engineers brought new ideas to the table that were encouraged and allowed to be cultivated by management. I enjoyed the fact that we had fun together performing our jobs and working as a team respecting one another."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job as a manager is seeing me team be successful by tackling a challenge they thought they couldn't accomplish. By pairing up the right people with the right stretch opportunities, our organization more capable overall because we have developed technical/leadership skills and personal confidence."
good,"Lots of hand on need for a wide array of military baselines. Travel was a must, but lockheed takes great care of its personnel."
good,If I could have a set full time schedule I would love to work there full time however that is not how they roll
good,-Great Benefits
good,"I enjoyed working at Sikorsky. I was part of a two man team, Me and a older Gentlman who had worked on Helicopter for 30 plus years. I learned alot from him. Hardest part of the job, was waiting for our supervisor to figure out what was on the list to do, or finish or fix.. Waiting in line for tools from the tool room, because all tool needed to be accounted for..(FOB).Wasted time in the waiting process. Other than that I worked with a great group of people."

good,I was able to learn tons about the industry when I interned here. The space program is inspirational and working on projects was very exciting. Lockheed is a good company to work for.

good,good place to work great team work high level of quality product
good,"As a Contracted Site Manager, I enjoyed the management level interaction with this client due to honesty and committment to excellence. I was always encouraged to challenge my staff and accepted the challenge with positive results."
good,You can be proud working for Lockheed Martin. As one of the largest defense contractors (if not the largest) their products and services directly contribute to the security of the United States and its allies. You can also have a wide range of opportunities. Because of the size of the company and the breadth of its technologies it probably employs more different skill sets than any other company.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for. Although the pay is average, the benefits are good and, from my experience, the company treats employees fairly. Lockheed Martin is a very diverse and ethical company. The company is very well run, which is amazing considering how large the company is."
good,Lax but a detailed environment. Need education or skills to be able to fully function in this environment. Hourly employees are unionized and the salary is not represented. The training environment is better than any other companies I've have been with but there is always room for improvement. There are employees there who are entitled and should probably find another source of income but are backed by the union and would have been terminated by most other companies and this is coming from a represented hourly employee.
good,Lockheed Martin has a lot of opportunities to learn and grow with the company. There are many programs to advance your career and move to other divisions.
good,I am learning several new processes here at Lockheed. There plenty of knowledgeable people here who are always willing to assist with any issues you have. There are several training opportunities to advance your skillset. The most enjoyable part of my job is being a part of a team and everyone working together to accomplish the same goal.
good,"The work life balance was a little uneven, but not terrible. If you are willing to put in extra time every week, it will be noticed. The management overall is accommodating to situations that life brings and work to be flexible, but some managers are more focused on advancing their own careers instead of helping their team perform their jobs."
good,"Innovation and creativity. Global leader in supporting our customers to strengthen global security. Do what's right, Respect others and Perform with Excellence."
good,The daily activity for work is consistent and busy.Management is easy to work for and with. Positive reinforcement attitude from management. Clean workplace which promotes 6S.
good,I've only been with the company a few months so far. The people are incredibly friendly and supportive. The morale is good. Infrastructure needs updating but the company is aware of this and seems to be focused on improvement. Management is supportive in my department/program.
good,"Very good place to work, work life balance was amazing. Pay needs to be better. Benefits were amazing. promotion needs to be given to individuals after some time."
good,This company provided an enjoyable workplace environment while I was onsite.  Remote position attainable due to good tools and communication.  While work to do kept me very busy.  Company is big into AGILE.
good,"Lockheed used to be the best place to work, until they started bringing all this young kids into management. I hope it can become what it was again..."
good,My position was not a full time job. The people were great from my first line supervisor to my team-mates. The job position did not keep me interested or motivated.
good,Fast pace and changing work environment.  Many opportunities for growth in the company.  Great benefit and job stability.  Great educational opportunity.
good,"I enjoy working at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. The work is very engaging and challenging. There are a variety of programs at Missiles and Fire Control, which gives employees good lateral movement."
good,"Busy workdays, lots of pressure from management to meet the many deadlines. Friendly and inclusive culture. Hardest part is meeting deadlines. Most enjoyable part is seeing the amazing products."
good,"- Expectations in my role is extremely clear"
good,I really enjoyed the work that I did with LMC in Ocala. They are a Missiles and Fire Control facility in Ocala where they produce cable and harnesses as well as circuit card boards. There is also a fair bit of mechanical assembly. Primarily the Ocala facility feeds other customers such as LMC Orlando or Red Stone in Alabama. But there are a few products that are completed and sent to the customer from Ocala. The culture in Ocala is rather mundane and the city itself is not a fun town to live in. There is not much going on for young adults to have a good time. But LMC Ocala does hire a lot of young talent so it is a great place to get a foot in the door into a great company.
good,"Lockheed was a great opportunity and is a good option for anyone starting out or looking for a new career path. The have competitive benefits, good salary, only drawback is the lack of internal promotion. It is better to leave and come back to get promoted."
good,Very rewarding place to work. Seeing the end product makes it all worthwhile. There are some great leaders that need to move up but there are not enough growth opportunities for them.
good,"Fantastic place to work with excellent benefits and lots of room for growth.  Unfortunately, our plant was going through a slow market and it was decided to shut down the plant."
good,Good place to work but hard to advance.  Average pay raises.  Large corporation and hard to navigate but if you are motivated you can work your way up.
good,The only problem occurred when the cards came in. It was taking about 1 -2 hours for the cards to get done. I called the help desk and the next day everything was fixed. I was able to get the cards done in a timely manner.
good,I worked with the Facilities Department so every day was different and challenging.  Plenty of opportunity to try out new roles and job titles.  Some challenges due to the fact the company is largely a government-contractor.  Sometimes too much red tape and it could prove to be difficult to get tasks accomplished.  High levels of security made project completion sometimes frustrating.
good,Lockheed Martin was and is a great place to work.  The company has a great work life balance.  A productive LM employee is a happy one. The work is challenging but it help you to increase your respective skill sets.  The company believes in educating their employee to stellar performers.
good,Worked with a team that stayed very focused on the mission of the program and did not waiver. Smart group with a desire to promote those who were dedicated and talented.
good,"I had to leave due to family / life issues, but while at Lockheed they were one of the best to work for. They are starting to get my competitive with their other competitors which has trickled down to the employee (Pensions, 401K contribution, MEDICAL, and even vacation/sick leave), however looking around the market place they are still one of the best. Overall work life balance was good because while you might work 9-10 a day on the work days you do get off every other Friday."
good,"Had a number of positions, bother hourly and salaried over the years.  Generally they challenging and enjoyable.  Generally felt like I was part of the team."
good,This company was great to work for.  They were very conscious of the needs of their employees.  They offered training and a relaxed place to work.  Employees were given awards yearly and provided with little gifts.
good,"9-5, you don't have to take work home. You are separated into engineering, or supply chain. You don't always to cross train or learn other aspects of the business."
good,Great company to work for. Did 40 + years as employee and contractor. Location is not great relative to Los Angeles and the beaches. Little auto traffic congestion though.
good,"Working there was a great experience. It taught me Human Resource at it finest. I learn how to do Military Buy Back,Estimate Retirement,  and help me to understand Benefits.  It was a great job to have.. the hardest part of the job was nothing had a very good Supervisor that taught well any thing you did not understand. I enjoyed  working there.."
good,"worked in a small team environment where we all worked together extremely well.  Great benefits, even with working a part time position. Management valued your work and was always open to explore ways to improve work procedures."
good,As a electronics instructor working with military instructors instructing satellite communications each individual pulled their own weight. There was enough support from upper management that kept the drive to want to come to work.
good,"Working at Lockheed Martin was a pleasured. It helped me get my career going in the right direction. If given the opportunity, I would like to work for Lockheed again in the near future."
good,"Great place to work, friendly staff, excellent management. Benefits could have improved as they were altered for the worse in 2016. Major changes occurred within LMIT and that section of LM was sold."
good,"Lockheed Martin demands a lot to meet deadlines, but it compensates it's workers well.  The co-workers hired are all very knowledgeable and hard working, which makes working here enjoyable."
good,"I worked for Lockheed, but was a subcontractor for another company. I did receive good management support, however the job description did not go into sufficient detail."
good,"Very competitive, but a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement. The benefits are phenomenal with ample time off and a 401K matching program, along with a percentage of your salary depending on your sign on contract."
good,Every day is different. I'm not sure how to fill in this spot since it's always different. We travel sometimes. We've also been known to have enough down time for me to get my homework done early.
good,"Always training, must meet production floor requirements. Set up own calibration schedule. The more information you learn, the better the opportunities for you to advance."
good,A steady and dependible source of income to raise a family. Some departments need extra people to help with manpower issues. So switching departments is possible on weekends foe additional pay.
good,"- Fast pace"
good,"it was a good place to work in my early 20's the management was good and the systems they worked with were great to learn."
good,Never have to worry about job security but the pay is below average for new engineers. Benefits have been declining in recent years. Work/life balance is great though.
good,"Management time was spent directing staff activities and reviewing staff work product.  The culture was fair, evaluating employees on work product and not too political."
good,"Lockheed is a great organization. Interview process is easy but takes a long time to hear back. I was hired to work over seas in Afghanistan. I was already in Afghanistan and quit my job to work for Lockheed. But once I returned to US for training, I was told I had to wait 3 months before training began. But Lockheed paid me for those three month and I reported to Melbourne office. I was not happy with the money I lost, but was happy that they did make an effort under my circumstance to make things right again."
good,Well organized compared to other workplace. Plenty of advancement opportunities especially to those with bachelor's degree and those who are passionate about their work.

good,"Great company-- Company bought out company I was working for."
good,"Lockheed Martin creates a comfortable work environment. Sandia National Labs has excellent job security and great work-life balance. The only negative about Sandia National Labs is management because technical expertise seems to be the main factor for determining who gets promoted into management, which is a position that requires sound interpersonal skills."
good,Lockheed Martin was a great employer with generous benefits and a pleasant work environment. Professional people surround you inspiring you to excel in achieving the next level. Lockheed Martin is customer focused and did a wonderful job balancing expectations with employee life and requirements. I enjoyed my time working at Lockheed Martin.

good,Great experience for a college intern. Most everyone is supportive and collaborative. Learning and growth opportunities abound. Good management and workplace culture.
good,"Compared to professions that are centuries old, Software Engineering is a new profession in human civilization, . There is much to learn for people and companies, especially while engineering is focused on continuous optimization.  There are two kinds of companies in the new millennium: those that buy software and those that write & sell software.  Lockheed Martin both writes software and contracts other software companies to write software; while overseeing software engineering of both software programs.  I experienced this dual level software development at Lockheed Martin and it is a ballet with an immense choreography."
good,I was with LM in an overseas location working with indigent military forces as well as NATO/ISAF forces and civilian contractors.  I was responsible for developing the on-the-job training program for the indigent forces.
good,Have great innovation center and working groups for employees to participate and contribute. I am very please with LMCO for almost 20 years working with the company. Highly recommended.
good,"Interfaced with customer, management, and other teams to work issues.  Management was consistent, gave direction when requested or needed.  Followed Full Spectrum Imperatives. Hardest part of the job were many of the technical issues--but enjoyed the team atmosphere to help solve issues."
good,Was a good place to work; benefits were good; fast paced but will be getting busier. On the flightline things are fast paced and you have to have your head on a swivel; aircraft moving around and the noise is incredible
good,Work life is great. Great and flexible hours. 401k match is great. PTO is big plus. Benefits are great except the insurance. The insurance is going down hill.
good,Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for.  The salaries could be more competitive but the management was always great to work with/for.  Very family oriented.
good,"Logging trouble calls for software issues Department of Defense wide."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Lockheed Martin, it was challenging, very educational and it was always busy and faced-paced.  It was very rewarding to assist others when they needed help."
good,Nice place to work friendly place to work can be a little stressful at times but laid back always can advance to other areas to work excellent benifit package
good,"Wasn't really a typical day"
good,"A great environment to work for those seeking challenging opportunities.  Working closely with the government customers, it provides experience that is hard to obtain anywhere else."
good,"Lockheed is a create place to work if you are interested in a company dedicated to Government business. It has plenty of work-life balance and great job security if you are a performer. If you are interested in commercial business, it may not be a fit for you."
good,"Tremendous growth opportunities early to mid career.  Growth for expanded roles are limited...unless relocation opportunities develop."
good,The work days are long however you get 3 day weekends (so long as putting in overtime isn't required). The job was pretty laid back and lent itself to some interesting work.
good,"Great company for work life balance, offered flexible work schedules and had the added benefit of 4 days on and Fridays off.  Deliverables were achievable, realistic deadlines, and fantastic management."
good,"Typical work day was fast paced but rewarding."
good,"A great place to work! Would work for them again!!!! Loved the staff, management, and the job. Day went by quickly, lots to do to challenge you. Definitely would recommend working here."
good,I worked in Lockheed Martin's commercial energy section.  We had a great staff supporting Pepco's Commercial and Industrial Energy Conservation program.  It was nice because we were administering the incentive dollars to businesses and organizations implementing energy improvement projects.  I was primarily responsible for training contractors to preform comprehensive assessments on customer's facilities.  The buildings included all types from large commercial facilities to small business operations.  I also managed customer service issues.
good,Fair and ethical.  Structured and highly disciplined environment.  Great mission in support of the War-Fighter.  Good pay and benefits.  Life balance is sometimes difficult.
good,"As with any large company, you can move around and find a fit for your skills. They offer a leadership rotation program which will allow you to explore divisions and various assignments. This program is offered to both entry and mid-level employees. Lockheed offers great benefits and a solid retirement saving plan. They also offer a 9/80 or flex work schedule where you get every other Friday offer. "
good,I love the company but no room for advancement and the pay increases are next to nothing. I had a bigger raise when I was 16 working at Kentucky Fried Chicken 28 years ago.
good,The job was great.  the biggest down fall is the disconnect between the Lockheed and the subcontractors.  The difference in pay for the same position between Lockheed and the subcontracts has created unrest in some of the employees.
good,Good company to work for. Competitive salary along with good benefit package and a savings plan opportunity available. Company reputation is an excellent resume builder.
good,All around good company at times is very loud from all the machines. Time flies by when you have a certain time table to meet. The co-workers are nice
good,"Good pay, great culture and solid principles of software development. The only downside is the glass ceiling and the lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"Analysis based working environment with opportunities to utilize technical, analytical, business, accounting and finance, cultural, linguistic, and personal skills."
good,If you are an engineer or executive there are lots of areas to grow within but in the adminstrative field there are not alot of areas unless you move to other states but in virginia I did not see alot of opportunity.  In the position I am in now there is no where to move or gain merit increases.
good,"I left Lockheed Martin in 2006 when we lost the major contract I was working on, so the latest information I have on them from an employee perspective is 10+ years old.  When I worked there I had tons of opportunity for advancement and moved from software engineer up through technical lead, to department supervisor.  I worked for a lot of great people and had many great ones working for me as well.  Highly recommended."
good,"This job required that the applicant would have a security clearance; unfortunately I was recruited after having had my clearance temporarily suspended, and I had to work alternatively to being a configuration manager. So, my work returned to Systems Engineering; I enjoyed every minute of the work."
good,I worked under a yearly contract that require management approval for continued employment. It was overseas and the company provided good housing for all employees and the pay was good
good,"I worked for a couple of smaller defense contractors, along with Lockheed and Rockwell Collins."
good,"Working here was a great experience. Typical work day involved troubleshooting clients issues via the remedy system and working with colleagues to enhance existing knowledge. I've learned additional skills within this company which included how to troubleshoot webex issues for end users and other system-related functions within the company. My co workers were extremely knowledgeable and helpful and was ready and available to answer any questions I had relating to my job duties. The hardest part of the job was getting clients to follow standard procedures within the company. The most enjoyable part of this job was the friendly work environment, the ability to take on new skills, and of course lunch breaks with co-workers"
good,This company is great with the work life balance.  I'm able to leave for appointments as long as it doesn't interfere with customer meetings.
good,"Overall, Lockheed has given me the opportunity to get a degree, trained me in six sigma, and help me mature in the Quality field.  I love my job, but it has been hard to move up and out my current role.  Lockheed is a great place to work and with a lot of determination can provide long term employment."
good,Great company to work for with a nice work/life balance.  Recently bought out by Lockheed.  Hope work culture doesn't suffer.
good,"Worked for Lockheed (first as an employee of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, and later as an employee of Lockheed Martin) for over 32 years. Enjoyed all the assignments and challenges"
good,Lockheed Martin made me grow as an individual and trained me in areas that i was weak in.  the system which they run holds everyone to a higher degree of responsibility
good,Typically I report in for my shift and it's pretty easy going. It is very technical and can get extremely busy.  I have learned about the various types of routing devices (being that my previous world revolved around Cisco devices and circuits).  My manager is probably on par with some of the best leadership I've ever had.  My coworkers are typically a joy to work with and filled knowledge and insight into the computer science world.
good,I would like to go back working in Lockheed against if I have another chance and I will do my best for Lockheed and I will show them what I can very do for Lockheed with my experience
good,It is a great place to work but you cannot expect any career progression here.  Work day is challenging at times and gives me a sense of accomplishment.  I enjoy figuring out issues for my customers and how to make things better.
good,"Enjoyed working with personnel supporting the Infantry Weapons program.  Whether personnel supporting the program or the customer, everyone worked as a team to provide the support needed to accomplish required tasks."
good,The company supports diversity in the work force and has many talented people who are passionate about their jobs.  The pay and benefits are excellent and the work hours can be flexible to accommodate personal needs.  Working extra hours is often necessary to meet the schedule demands.
good,"Generally fast-paced work environment with highly skilled individuals focused on getting tasks done to support overall customer requirements within budget and schedule.  Excellent management teams who encouraged and fostered a culture of creative problem solving, career development, and work-life balance.  Reasonable demands on task completions and adequate staffing levels to successfully support requirements."
good,"I enjoyed my many years with Lockheed (started in 1982 with RCA which merged with General Electric, Martin Marietta, then Lockheed). Benefits were great, I traveled, I worked hard, I met lots of great people and had lots of good friends, The people in my business area all knew each other and cared about each other a great deal. We were all like family. I held two security clearances and had gotten many accommodations and recognition awards. I really enjoyed what I did and it showed in the high level of work I produced, But in the end, after 32 years of loyal service I was laid off due to budget cuts and geographical limitations."
good,Very good company to work for and gain a ton of experience at one of the biggest helicopter companies in the world. This is a large company and is in the process of getting sold.

good,Daily case management ranging from receiving search criteria to ingestion/production of ESI
good,"Typical work week is Flex time and 9 hour days and every other Friday off."
good,"I would pack and distribute items for small to 100's of pounds. I placed orders for supplies once a week. I was cleared for top secret clearance projects. I loved the people I worked with and still keep in touch with them.  I worked well with management and still talk to some of them.  The hardest part of the job was getting up so early,  my shift started at 5:30 am and had a 1 hour drive.  My favorite part of my job was organizing jobs and the people."
good,"A Nuclear Criticality Safety Analyst working for a government contractor is a very interesting occupation.  A Secret Q-Clearance was required."

good,"My current employer is a great company to work for. The company strives to keep their employees and customers happy. They are not perfect and they have been working on bettering themselves. "
good,I have learned that no matter how hard you work at the end of the day it all about the business and not personal.
good,A sharing environment where team work was emphasized. A place where learning new skills was encouraged and rewarded.
good,"Great company, opportunities endless.  Great work life balance. Provides great training"
good,Project to project learning is life time memorable experience
good,Work aircraft maintenance on the flight line 12 hours a day ever day and like it!!!
good,"Research is very poorly funded.  As a rule they claim to fund projects that promise viability in 3 to 5 years but in actuality expect viability after one year.  The dollars spent on advanced IR&D has shrunk every year for at least the last three years even before sequestration.  This lack of commitment to the future is disturbing."
good,"Sikorsky Aircraft a leader in aircraft technology and production. Great place to begin a career, great benifits, great managment, good locations. Overall great place to work."
good,"Only bad thing for me- 2011 yr involuntary layoff (but I was 78 yrs old-so ""fits our times""). Trying to get back to LMC if feasible for a few more yrs."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like I was a part of huge nationwide organization that played a critical role in our Country's defense.

good,Great company.  Unfortunately I have to move and leave the position behine.
good,"Great hours, work was easy described for you. I learned how do drill, measure, countersink etc. this was my first aviation mechanic job. management is friendly and properly managed, co-worker are friendly and willing to help with just about everything. the hardest part of this job would be none.. everything is simplified! the most enjoyable part of the job would be completing tasks on your own."
good,"I love to work again with Lockheed Martin, I was laid off due to budget cut."
good,"Learned the software life cycle process, how to properly test and debug code. The hardest part is being in a confined environment because of security measures."
good,"High stress workplace due to volume and time sensitivity of work, but also relaxed at times because co-workers are friendly. Employees are highly trained professionals and generally allowed to complete their work without much management intervention. Everyone works very hard and is expected to put in as many hours as it takes to complete the work. Flexibility is allowed in work schedule, many employees work remotely from home at least one day a week. The most stressful part of the job is unexpected tasks created by system failures or customer demands. The best part of the job is that I am given tasks and allowed to complete them with my own solutions."
good,"Caring, professional people who want the product to be the best we can deliver in an aggressive time-frame. The inevitable changes in deriction & priority are met with can-do attitudes."

good,nice coworkers and have great work life balance. Have great opportunities to move up and different job positions.
good,I have enjoyed working for Lockheed Martin; at this time I feel there is no advancement offered.
good,"As a Project Manager I was constantly challenged to maintain quality standards while managing other managers and delivering data driven reports. There were good days and bad days and I retired after 20 years with full benefits and pension and retirement savings account, so overall this was a great company to work for. Even as an engineer developing the CATIA designs and initiating technological solutions for the general populous, the adherence to ethical and standardized work was beneficial to my professional development which was also subsidized in the form of multiple continuing educational opportunities."
good,"Great advancement opportunities if you keep moving to different depts with challenging work. Those that want to be comfortable in a certain department may find themselves at the lower end of their salary range. Overall good people, professional, and for the most part insist on straight-laced & conservative attire. Company enforces respect of other's rights."
good,Lockheed Martin was a truly a great company to work for. I had many stretch assignments that were thought provoking and motivational.
good,Extremely physically demanding work while working in extreme temperatures day and night in a hostile location.
good,• Coordinate spare builds and Test/Repair for the OCONUS PTDS Depot Sustainment Team.
good,My days are spent working on engineering information for mods or SW updates on the aircraft. I write TCTOs for these updates besides other technical orders. I work with many talented people in this field.
good,Enjoy working at Lockheed and have learned a lot during my tenure. Lots of professional people and disciplines. Very nice atmosphere for professionals. Company is an industry leader.
good,Good place to work. Many positions are customer contract time dependent.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Lockheed Martin. I was assinged advanced technology new business initiatives as a Capture Manager and learned techniques to win targeted new business initiatives. My managers were great motivators and visionary. My co-workers all had a strong sense of responsibility, loyalty,and great team spirit. We won many programs. The hardest part of the job was having to move on to new projects and new teams but that was okay because it was a turning point for a new adventure."
good,"Performed all duties related to processing of all documents required for recruiting hourly and salaried personnel within the Employment Department including composition and maintenance. Proficiency demonstrated with regards to all office procedures for upper level management and engineers. Departmental support executed for the following departments/divisions: Employment Office, Business Product Support, Body Mate, Technical Publications, and the Division of Flight Sciences."
good,A typical day at work is chaotic but fun at the same time. I learned to work with employees that are old school and learned to respect what they are used to as per as tools goes and create a much and easier procedures for the new tools. The hardest part of the job is not having enough manning. Many of us wears different huts. The most enjoyable part of the job is no matter how diverse people are at the end still a good place to be.
good,"the company has great benifits and is a company in which any one can go up the ladder easiy. It has a great retention, and good salaries. The work environment is great but at times it can get stressful. The person who wants o work at this company needs to be goal oriented, focus and pay attention to detail because the company mostly follow military guidance."
good,Ability to work in a highly stressful zero defects environment. Sacrifice my own convenience to help and assist others learn and succeed in their tasks. Apply my considerable mathematical and engineering skills to bring process and discipline to my work.
good,"LM is a great company to work for. If you use their motto ""we never forget who we work for"" and ""always do what is right even when noone is looking"" are great attributes to follow for both personal and business. My only complaint is that We did not get to keep our contract for the promised 5 years."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a large employer with solid benefits and a diverse range of opportunities. Although the pay is lower than one would get working for a smaller contractor, Lockheed is a stable option."
good,I enjoy working for lockheed martin. The pay and benefits are great and everyone is career oriented.
good,"Sikorky is a great place to work, great benefits, medical, and pay."
good,Overall Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for depending on where one is and who one works for. In my current position there is no more growth opportunities thus I find after 15 years its probably time to move on.
good,There is plenty of work to stay busy and often times a chanced to learn something new. The company pays more than fairly and management is excellent. Fellow employees are easy to get a long with and your management is always willing to help.
good,"Learned a lot and made good career progress.  Nice employees, good management and a good opportunity to expand your career.  Teaching how to be prepared for change and a flexible environment"
good,Good day to day work experience overall. Gain experience through working in certain positions to advance in the company. More beneficial to work days but building is open 24/7
good,Great start to a career. Great benefits. Friendly workplace. Okay management. Compensation is good. Communication could be better. Would not stay there for more than a few years.
good,"I retired at the age of 62, I should have waited and retied at the of 70."
good,"One week long work experience, observing working engineers and developing my abilities to assist in their military projects. Very good work ethos and everyone was very helpful."
good,"Great place to complete an internship at.  It is a very corporate culture though, which means a lot of desk time/cubicles.  Lots of teamwork and networking oppurtunities, and lots of upward mobility."
good,"You can make what you want out of your career.  Tons of learning and opportunities and leadership programs available to everyone, along with opportunities to move to various locations. Great benefits."
good,LHM is a great place to work.  It offers great benefits and allows personal growth.  The company has a large variety of career fields to choose from.  I highly recommend it.
good,"It is great to be able to work from home, offers good benefits. Unfortunately, the company runs on old technology due to government bureaucracy, which can be frustrating."
good,Lockheed Martin is an extremely fast paced rewarding place to work for the self starter who can train themselves and execute with little guidance from management.
good,The management here is outstanding at the department level. I've learned a lot about engineering as I work on various projects on a day-to-day basis. These skills will be valuable whether you choose to stay with the company or find something more suited to your personal tastes.
good,worked with a small team where everyday there was a different problem to solve. Always kept me on my toes. My manager was very receptive to different ideas and was very accommodating.
good,Lockheed Martin did let me leave a hour early everyday and work from home for that hour to let me get my elementary school kids off the bus.  At times when my kids had off of school they even let me work from home.
good,The people that I worked with were excellent. The pay was great and the benefits were well thought out. There was always opportunities for overtime if you needed a little extra cash.
good,"As with all contracts, they are subject to change. Mine is up for review, BUT...all in all Lockheed Martin is a great company with MANY venues and opportunities."
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed working with the people and the alternate work schedule (took a little time to adjust to) but was really nice perk to have every other Friday off."
good,"I had a great time with Lockheed Martin and I would go back to work with them. I could have been challenge a little more. As far as management went they had people who were more in there corner if you know what I mean. But overall, Its a great company hands down."
good,The job keeps you busy. If you don't mind being in a enclosed area 10hrs a day 4 days a week this might be for you. Benefits were good. pay was good 401k good.
good,"Opportunities to grown and learn.  Including rotational assignments and  tuition reimbursement."
good,"I worked for Lockheed Martin at the NASA Shared Services Center at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi. They were a great company to work for with annual merit increases and great benefits. They constantly kept in contact with employees to encourage personal growth and development."
good,"The Lockheed Martin Leadership institute has taught me to reflect deeply about myself. This has allowed me to development a better understanding of myself which has allowed me to be able to communicate my ideas clearly and effectively with others. Communication is key in any work space, and being able to do so great increases productivity."
good,Was a great place to work!  Professional peers and management was always thee to assist if any issues needed to be escalated to a different department.  Great company to work for in the aircraft industry.
good,I worked at Lockheed Martin and I enjoyed the environment.  The managers were informed and did their best to help the employees transition to a new job.  However the salary was quite low when I worked there.
good,"Good values, clearly articulated. They have excellent training videos about those values and other aspects of working well and ethically."
good,"It is a challenging place to work at.  While managers are very professional, they are also very understanding and flexible and take into account personal circumstances."
good,"Vous pouviez arriver le matin a l'heure que vous vouliez, sauf si obligation (meeting, rendez-vous,..). Le management nous laisse une totale autonomie dans la gestion de nos taches et responsabilites, tant que les deliverables etaient livres aux dates prevues."
good,"The people I worked with were pulling the edge all the time. They listened to ideas, Worked to push the envelope on any thing I would on. Yes stress was high, but I worked on a many different types of projects. Made the day's go very fast."
good,"a good company to work for. need long term disability offered"
good,"Lockheed was a great place to work. Many of the people there have worked there for years and are gearing up for retirement so they have put an emphasis on a youth movement. The opportunities for young people in this company are huge and numerous as many of the older staff make their way out. I was an intern while I was there so a typical day for me consisted of helping my team with testing and other various tasks involved with that. Management was great, very accommodating and friendly, it felt like a family and I enjoyed it."
good,"Great department to work with, even when there are bottlenecks and drama it never gets out of hand. Management is good and challenges you, but at the same time feels like they're not really in your corner so to speak. They won't toss you under the bus, but they wont stop the bus either. "
good,This was a contract position with a very specific goal in mind. The plan was structured before employees were hired to perform the task at hand. All employees were made aware of our presence. Security clearance and accommodating to the circumstances went off without a glitch.
good,"I worked on new structural designs as well as fitting electrical components into difficult locations which would be placed into environments which experienced vibration."
good,Great Pay Boring Culture - Lockheed Martin will compensate you but I often found the culture to be boring - and that is not for me - it's up to you for what kind of culture you like
good,Work culture is good.  The company offers remote opportunities for some employees but my site didn't.  They offered flex time which allowed for a balanced work schedule
good,"There are good people to work with and good management. The work is always interesting and upbeat. New problems to be conquered. The benefits are always good. Contractor benefits are good as well. Many people are on contract and not directly employed by Lockheed Martin. This is part of the culture. You work until your contract is complete and stay home for the required amount of time then you can continue working on a new contract. There are a few things wrong just like any other work place but, Lockheed ranks well."
good,"Enjoyed the work environment and the work, but military opportunity was more advantageous for me at the time.  The opportunity to move into management was very challenging and the work culture was quickly changing with a younger workforce coming on board."
good,I worked at Lockheed Martin that was located on the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center. It was a great company to work for and I would highly recommend. Flexible hours and great people!
good,"Good comp, mission, values, ethics, leadership, growth and development, products that bring our service members home safely and clean our environment. My voice is heard, I’m having a great time and an energized and engaged to work on cool things.I loved my job."
good,Overall a good place to work. We are now on a 9X80 work schedule which gives us every other Friday off and that is great. The pay is good and most of the time you feel the job security. Most jobs are on contracts and sometimes those contracts are downsized or not won so there is that element.
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to work! They have a family type culture and the job work/life balance is great.  They have wonderful benefits. The people are friendly and helpful.
good,In many ways I was very pleased with my job at Lockheed Martin. The management was approachable and fair. I had planned to continue working there but there were very few advancement opportunities in the program I worked. I work very well from a home office and on the road which was 95% of my job. The hardest part of my role at LM was the monotony of doing the same thing for over three years. The best part was that management recognized my strengths and my job performance reviews always reflected that recognition!
good,Supported a wide range of programs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.  Worked with program management and staff to assure program stayed on track according to cost and schedule. Supported all program and customer reviews.
good,All the tools were available to execute my tasks. People were very helpful in mentoring and reviewing my tasks. Ample learning opportunity at various levels. Education Assistance and Training.
good,"Worked on a great project for the USFS and worked directly with the customer.  Worked to obtain requirements, maintain current reports and data models, and also tested the application.  Most enjoyable was working with the customer and seeing them happy about what we produced.  The hardest was doing the deployments to production as they were done overnight."
good,"Its 7am and we get a call from the production floor saying that they are ready to have there radar warning cables checked."
good,Lockheed Martin offers benefits desired of a large corporation.  Opportunities to advance career are virtually unlimited.  Jobs are available across the country and in many parts of the world.
good,"The work day is a quicker pace and challenging at times, I have been blessed to learn a great deal about the aircraft I have had the opportunity to work on.  Management for the most part has been great,  the culture at the job is very inclusive and fair.  The most challenging part of the job would be time spent away from family from time to time, but the most rewarding part for me is having a direct hand in developing the program I am apart of."
good,"They were a good employer.  They have me a chance when no one else would, and was proud to work for them.  I do admit that my last assignment with NDW-CMS, I questioned if I was a good fit.  There some of my colleagues and I didn't always get along, but I wasn't payed to get along, but to do a job.  As far as I knew, they thought I was.  I left because I wanted to leave the state of Maryland, and figured I needed a change."
good,"Nice place to work, good benefits and work environment, pleasant co-workers, personal job-related challenges, excellent equipment, software, and training"
good,"Good place to work as they take care of there employees."
good,A great organization with a great group of professionals. I am very impressed with the professionalism of my co-workers. I can very easily say that some of the brightest minds in the C-130 world work for Lockheed Martin.
good,"Lockheed Martin recognized the value of their employees.  This was often demonstrated with recognition awards and career advancements.  Leadership provided a Moving Forward style providing a solution focused approach and not a people focused solution.  (Not interested in blame, interested in solution)"
good,A non profit organization that helped the local and surrounding communities.  Provided the employees what they could when they could.  I wish the wages had been better.
good,Great place to have a career if you started back when they had a decent retirement plan. Otherwise a great place to work until you get a better offer at one of the other big aerospace companies.
good,Performed duties as prescribed in the job requirements. Maintained all required duty and job location training proficiency level. reported all required duty overtime and extra duty overtime pay.
good,My job in Engineering was interesting and the work was variable. No two days were exactly the same. I worked with engineers from all over the world. For a time I had a coworker under me who was deaf and I learned enough sign language at the time to communicate well with her.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work and the company does try to take good care of it's employees."
good,A great company with professional personnel with disciplines spanning across all Engineering fields.  I enjoyed the personnel both workers and management.
good,"A highly ethical company providing numerous opportunities in science, engineering and technology.  The company is focused and strives to provide outstanding customer service.  Management style and effectiveness varies with the individual.  I have had outstanding managers who I would not hesitate to work for again and others who were not as good. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in teams with talented, dedicated, and professional individuals."
good,"Lockheed Martin offers a learning environment and the opportunity to move within the company to learn new skills or to relocate. Coworkers are usually supportive, and Lockheed is opening new avenues of product constantly."
good,"good place to work. Best pay in Aviation field here in Coastal Bend. Enjoyed fixing Aircraft, and working with the people."
good,Work as a contractor but found the company very attentive toward employee concerns. Worked for 13 years with company on foreign soil and housing and salary was a big plus.
good,"You don't miss it until it's gone...or something to that effect but needless to say when you look back at your career you'll always relate back to the companies that had the most impact on your professional life. That for me would be Lockheed. "
good,"Great work/life balance, not so great insurance plan. Good 401K match. Co-workers are down to earth and projects are fun to work on."
good,"I was able to start my days at 530am so I could be done early enough to pick up my children from school. "
good,"As far as a salary is concerned, Lockheed Martin pays their employees well for a job well done.   It is a great learning environment to develop new skills, but be prepared to learn on your own.  A typical day at work is loaded with virtual meetings and virtual customer support.  It is a stressful environment and many of the co-workers do not have the time or patience to help others due to scheduled deadlines.  I enjoyed assisting programs with achieving a successful software deployment and also did some project management to ensure completion of tasks.  It is a great place to learn how to achieve great results in the shortest amount of time possible and learn to deal with a high stress and demanding environment."
good,"Excellent communication skills,  very patient with employees, fun workplace, free job training,  excellent pay, good holiday pay and no weekends."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of me designing and analyzing ground support tooling in CREO 2.0. The other employees were welcoming and experienced, however we shared few interests outside of work. The major drawback and reason why I would not wish to work there full time is location."
good,"Lockheed is good company to work for as an engineer.  This is especially true for engineers that are first starting off.  However, over the long term of your career, you will most likely fall behind in current technologies due to most government contract's reliance on old technologies and Lockheed's slow development process."
good,Solid company with good job security. Management is open to new ideas to improve the manufacturing process and increase production and quality.
good,I can honestly say that this has been my favorite job that I've ever had.  I worked on a team of over 40 technical professionals in a competitive environment.  I was challenged each and everyday with new tasks and assignments which is necessary to grow in the Information Technology field.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great technology company in the aerospace filed."
good,"Great place to work and advance.  Non-union environment made it much easier to advance, which was encouraged.  Excellent training on many subjects to do the job.  Great management structure and low pressure work environment."

good,Working for Lockheed Martin can be a very rewarding career. They are a large company with many opportunities and chances for growth and security.
good,There really isn't much to say about working there that I can actually say. It's has a good benefits package and 401k so that's not a bad thing.
good,Come to work get organized for the work day. Learned some computer skills. Management was nice and accommodating to all employees in work and personal matters. All co-workers got a lone to get the job done. There really wasn't anything hard about the job. What I enjoyed most was going to work and helping the employees with their needs and being with my co-workers.
good,"Responded to facilities related equipment and/or infrastructure problems/failures that created down time. Took pictures, interviewed personnel, inspected equipment then performed root cause analysis then mitigated solutions to prevent future occurrences. Presented report to upper Management company wide. Followed corrective actions to their completion. I learned that our Risk Management program worked. The hardest part of the job was convincing Management to procure the necessary budget for mitigation. In the end I did have good success. The most enjoyable part was proving the cost savings as a result of our actions."
good,Lockheed Martin was a good company to work for.  I had good co-workers and received good training to do my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on the Space Shuttle program and being part of the team.  The hardest part of the job was making the program successful on a limited budget.
good,"The work at Lockheed was well planned, and well organized, with a friendly though serious work environment. "
good,I have enjoyed working for this company.  They have trainned me well to move on to bigger and more responsible positions.  It has great benifits and is a great company to work for.
good,"As an Information Assurance Manager, I created the Information Assurance and Network Services department from inception with a 1.7 million dollar budget including annual maintenance agreements, training, hardware and software licensing and resource oversight.  "
good,They need to learn how to hire people that are qualified instead of there friends that are only half qualified. For projects that are in such remote places.

good,"every day was a great day"
good,"Large Company that creates opportunities for employees"
good,I have aquired many technical skills and learned the daily challenges of working in a fortune 500 company. Co-workers and team memebrs have facilitated an easy going culture and amazing team dynamics. The hardest part of the job is the slow pace of the defense industry.
good,I worked as a internal support technician. There's several programs a tech can support like Space and Missile systems. Lockheed employees call in when they have a PC or Server issue and we attempt to resolve it as quickly as possible. Once in a while they allow you to check out their Demo room which has things like flight simulators and vehicle mockups.
good,Was a great place to work and would recommend it to anyone interested.
good,"This was my first job out of college and a great introduction into the professional corporate world.  Lockheed's values are second to none.  They stress ethical values and training consistently and pride themselves in breeding an environment of trust.  I really developed my corporate professionalism and technical skills, and they are very conscious of a work-life balance which makes it a nice place to work while enjoying your family or extracurricular hobbies. "
good,"Challenging fast paced manufacturing environment. I have worked with he same co-workers for the last 7 years, being a team player is what makes the team succeed."
good,"LM (Aero) is a great company to work for! As a former veteran, I especially find the work environment conducive. The executive leadership team is among the best and the work is challenging but not overwhelming. If you can work hard and prove yourself valuable, you are more likely to survive company layoffs which are inherent in this industry because like most major defense contractors, survivability is based on contracts."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience of having participated in this country's advancement in Aerospace Science.
good,"Good on site management team, always encouraging continuous professional development through online or resident training as well as learning through others. For the past four years, I've had a strong management team and have seen several promotions from within the organization, which make coming to work and learning something new every day a rewarding experience."
good,"My manager had to take a leave of absence because of family member illness and a new manager came in her place that did not take the time to read the company policies. Me manager made mistakes she blamed me for (who was with the company for 20 years). She was with the company for 4 months and suddenly I have poor job performance because I would not do unethical things she asked me to do that were in the finance area. From then on everything I did was wrong and she fired me from a company I loved for 20 years. 2 years after I was fired from the company she fired for the proceeding to do the unethical acts that she wanted me to perform and I say no. I moved up in the company numerous time. Started with the company when it was RCA Services Company in Data Entry; Advanced to Senior Administrative Assistant when company changed to GE Government Services; Advanced to Executive Assistant when company changed to Martin Marietta; Advanced to HR Specialist when company merge with Lockheed to become Lockheed Martin Technology Corporation, Inc; then advanced to HR Generalist and end at the position listed. Would love to return to this company if possible."

good,"Great place to work. I met a lot of smart, experienced people."
good,Great benefits and opportunities to advance.
good,"Good people to work for. Facility is nice, but could use larger parking area for when contracts run heavy and large influx of temp workers present."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work for individuals who are focused on quality and customer needs. Pay and benefits are above average, and in such a large company, there are many opportunities for advancement for a motivated employee."
good,"3million btu boilers, low temp refrigeration, vacuum chambers, instructor. Instructor of new incoming mechanics. Air supply & ventilation,  centrifugal chiller trouble shooting and repair."
good,"My group was very productive.  They supported the Automatic Test Equipment for Air Force jets. The mood of the workplace was very comfortable."
good,I love being off every other friday and the amount of PTO we earn monthly to allow me to vacation with my family. Having a paid week off in December is also another great benefit! There are yearly bonus and raises! It doesn't get any better than Lockheed! They also provide benefits to assist families with ICI and IUI procedures to grow their family!
good,"Mostly 8-10 hour days, set schedule, set production schedule. easy place to work. Ways to advance, learned about different departments withing the company."

good,"A good place to work with some interesting projects. I learned a lot, and was given the opportunity to work independently. Good work/life balance, with a fair amount of flexibility to set your own hours."
good,"I don't like making a comment on my typical work day. Showed up to work, performed all my assigned duties per the required tech documents with better then satisfactory results."
good,"Work hours were early."
good,"The company offers a 100% match up to 6% and will donate an additional 4% on their own. This is a significant contribution on behalf of the company. However, much of this is offset by the HDHP that they have transitioned to."
good,"LM is a great place to work."
good,"Monitor, repair and analyze the communications network."
good,"I have been in a two-person security office as the Alt FSO/Program Security Rep; in those 6 years, there have been 5 different co-workers. Due to the high rate of turn over, the tasks of training the new person is/was on me and occasional assistance from the home office. The stress level in our office should be pretty easy but it's very volatile. The rate of persons (government and contractor) in and out of our office requiring assistance is constant with little uninterrupted time to complete tasks. Management does not see it that way of course when you do not complete a tasks when requested or the way they request the tasks without written guidance. Very stressful situations! But overall the employees (customers) and government customers are happy with my performance. But this performance doesn't make it to my reviews."
good,Great company with really great projects.   Designed communication equipment for space projects.  Enjoyed the exposure and the challenge.  Would do this all over again!
good,Loved working for the military as a civilian. I feel as if I'm still serving my country. Being a purchasing agent was a great job. I enjoyed the people I worked with on the base. Working  and preparing contracts was a real challenge but I enjoyed it.
good,"The group I work for is small within the company.  The atmosphere is relaxed yet professional.  The projects we work on are challenging and global with opportunities for travel depending on your role.  All coworkers, including management, are great to work with."
good,"Good company, great benefits. Majority of co-workers eager to share information to accomplish all tasks in a timely manor. SME call back center for 40 systems at the height of operations in Afghanistan."

good,"A good company with lots of resources. "
good,Sikorsky Aircraft is a great company that supports further education and upward momentum. I have worked here 10 years and have been happy with the experience.
good,Enjoyed working in a diverse culture setting. Team members work together by sharing their ideas and skills to help complete the task.
good,"Typical bureaucracy expected with large company but great opportunities for growth, mentorship and learning. The most enjoyable part of my job were my colleagues.  I learned so much from them and the support and mentorship was stellar."
good,"Typical work day is from 7:15a-5:15p, extensive training courses both mandatory and optional, management is slowly moving to catch up with the fast paced commercial business, however defense is just slow. The hardest part of the job are the approval processes they take forever. Some of the positives are the every other Friday off day, holidays, pay, flexibility to work from home."
good,"I have been working on the F-35 for two years now as a Crew Chief, we work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week doing scheduled, unscheduled, upkeep, launch and recovery of the aircraft. I have learned so much about the different systems of the aircraft and enjoy working on the aircraft. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to learn about the different systems of the F-35. I manage a crew of 4 maintainers and we ave a great working relationship with them."
good,"Very professional, hard working co-worker, provides excellent services to our government.  Good environment, provides the tools to due your job and education."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job: Overall Lockheed Martin is a great place to work.Benefits are comprehensive. Pay is competitive. The staff members are extremely professional and focused. Stretch assignments are offered by which employees can expand their skills and competencies."
good,A typical day at work starts off early in the morning before the sunrise. There is never one day at work that is identical to the day before. I manage a group of people that ranges anywhere from 30 to 50 at one time. The hardest part of the job which is also the most enjoyable part of the job is having to make on the spot decisions that there is no script for. You make an executive decision and roll with it  based upon the knowledge you have obtained over the years.
good,"A typical day starts with a Production/Safety Meeting covering our work assignments as requested by management. Training would be provided as needed per the job performed. Re-certifications of training received as outlined by the company."
good,Job required extensive engineering and aircraft knowledge.
good,"Structured"
good,"Nothing bad to say here....great team, learned so much! The reason I left LM was me wanting to be close to my kids here in PR!"
good,Working with managers and clients to drive development projects to completion and get the final solution in place and live with minimum issues and maximum efficiencies. I learned a number of new development methodologies such as Test Driven Development and Continuous integration. I most enjoyed working with the clients to define and adjust requirements and to agree a solution and delivery mechanism.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for. The work itself is interested no matter what aspect of the company you go into. The benefits as an employee are phenomenal. The health insurance is great. Vacation and personal time given are amongst the most generous I have seen. The 9/80 work schedule I absolutely love. Although you have to work 80 hours in 9 days having every other friday off is beautiful. All in all its great to work for with the big issue that they are ""thickining"" the company. Due to recent plant closures the longevity of any position is one to question."
good,Room for advancement and was a challenging job.. It was just too far to drive for me.
good,"Excellent good environment, good culture."
good,"Busy days are good, all around good work environment, helpful employees and supervision."

Assemble crates to contain small parts and Large Sub – Assemblies"
good,"I was able to put my skills to use during my tenure with this company.  I had a great rapport with colleagues, customers and staff.  In my perspective, the company has began suffering from sequestration, which makes it difficult for the employee to move within the company."
good,"Every day was something new, and there were always new opportunities to make an impact. Fantastic job."
good,"I've worked for Lockheed Martin since 1991. For the entire time I was subcontracted to an MIT research laboratory. I've always found LM a secure, solid company with good benefits and sound management."
good,Had to learn a lot by yourself. Great vacation time. Great people to work with. Good at using SAP now.
good,Lockheed Martin is a wonderful company to work for. Management truly cares about its employees and their future.
good,"It's a very large company that deals with government contracts, so things tend to move pretty slowly. The average worker age is pretty high since they tend to keep their employees until they retire."
good,"typical day at work was busy, busy, get it done, meet schedules. 26 years taught me a great deal. Management was great. loved my job"
good,"The time that I have spent with this company has been rewarding! I have nothing bad to say. Wonderful benefits, wonderful management; people who actually care."

Represented Astrolink in Telecommunications standards meetings and reviewed Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Forum documentation"
good,"I was able to work as a CSR on the call floor. Advance to lead, managing my own team."

good,"As a contractor, I traveled around the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico conducting industrial hygiene and radiation surveys at FAA facilities.  I also enjoyed teaching courses in radiation safety and measurement. The program manager in Washington D.C. was very supportive. I learned a tremendous amount health physics and met many wonderful people in the FAA."
good,"Many chances for growth. Excellent management staff. Workday was flexible, to include telework. Great benefits. You're allowed to obtain paid ongoing education both internally and externally to better yourself and the organization. Workday varied because of my research work and loved it!"
good,I enjoy all that Lockheed Martin has to offer. Challenge positions with room for growth. Enjoy managerial structure and co-workers.
good,"Close knit, productive fast pace professional environment. Unlimited knowledge and skills gathered aloud me to be responsible for quality control, Litigation support, administrative duties and training team members. Management was terrific and easy to talk to; treated everyone with the upmost respect. The hardest part of my job was troubleshooting someone else's errors, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being apart of a team that worked well with one another."
good,"Great place to work. Exciting new developments. Great managers and coworkers. Fun ,energetic, and intellectually challenging."
good,Over three decades of successful performance in progressively challenging positions spanning the entire Program Management field.

good,"This was a great job to have while in college. As a receptionist I answered phone calls, separated mail. I assisted anyone in the office as needed."
good,"As a procurement manager, I had the opportunity to grow my team's skillsets and give them stretch assignments. I am very competitive and pride myself on having the best team. I enjoy getting feedback from the team to hear how we can improve current processes and be more productive, ultimately making the company more successful."
good,"I worked as a college registrar for a company that Lockheed had a contract with. I would have stayed with Lockheed Martin longer, but Lockheed didn't renew my contract, thus I lost my job. The job was very easy to do and my co-workers were wonderful and very supportive."
good,A diverse and innovative workplace with a high degree of focus on employee satisfaction. I enjoyed working with the team at Lockheed Martin and had a great synergy within every project team. The corporate culture was aimed at providing excellent external and internal customer satisfaction and training employees were empowered to make the decisions necessary to enable the success of Lockheed Martin.
good,Work at your own pace. As long as you do your job you will have no problems.
good,if you know IT stuff and you are willing to learn new things this is the place to go they treat you like family and they are very understanding when it comes to kids and life.
good,"My typical day would start with checking emails for any critical changes in proposal schedules, company policies or approaches. I would usually attend a few status meetings for various efforts that I would be working on to determine if any action items or concerns needed addressing. My work is prioritized by deadlines and urgency. Multi tasking was a necessity and pre-planning pricing the effort and cost volumes in order to meet critical deadlines for multiple efforts. Through out the day, I would answer numerous e-mails and IM's with various team members. The exciting part of the job is the diverse projects, constant learning from peers and management, submitting a quality compliant product to the customer on time and then the celebration of the WIN!!!"
good,"I enjoyed working for Lockheed Martin Mission Support.  The  Program Managers, and HR Staff supported all of their personnel with the utmost professionalism.  I would love to have continued to work for them; however, I became ill and had to leave their employment in order to recover.  Lockheed Martin still supported me and my family.  They are a very family oriented company."
good,Work / life balance was wonderful.  The job as a support person was not a good fit for me.
good,"was ok, had to work around restrictions placed on contractors to do the job required"
good,Lockheed Martin has provied some great opportunity being the largest Defense contractor with over 128k it has a lot of resources for greater opportunity. It does take a while to get the paper work done to look for other jobs and career changes. Mgmnt tries to maintain a good working envionment. It is sort of difficult maintaining overseas personnel. And inforcing policy. Work is interesing since it provides a working knowledge of the defence working invironement. Its at the leading of technology and a great learning experiene for anyone not accustomed to the corporate invironment.
good,"It was an Honor to work for the program. That being said, It could have been a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately for me, I was mislead about compensation. Very disappointing. I had such high hopes. I Lost several tens of thousand of dollars through the process. The IT team was amazing. They have some great talent. Too bad they are losing so many of them for similar reasons."
good,I really enjoyed my time working here at lockheed.  This company shows difficulty when it comes to family issues.  I experienced this myself recently when it came to working with management about an issue that came up with my daughter.  Personally i would not reccomend anyone working here that is a single parent.
good,"Not a place you want to work unless you want unlimited opportunities and a place to grow, but you'll never go home. Constantly working which can be good for most people."
good,Enjoy working in a safe relaxed atmosphere. Very proactive about safety. Worked a lot of hours with little time off. Management was easy to communicate with. Very enjoyable job
good,"Great 401k great benefits. Management were strange to say the least and undereducated for the position they were in. Everyone that was in management that I worked with looked down on hourly employees and were very stuck up, everyone out for them selves. ""MICROMANAGMENT"""
good,"Challenging work, good work environment. Support from management was minimal. Facilities were not well maintained. Workplace attitude was very positive."
good,"-Im a team lead out of west coast, my management or located east coast its very heard to communicate when they are 3 hours ahead of me, can't get any support with materials to complete my job."
good,Typical day at work consisted of working with the customer on resolving and space related issues. Team cohesion was a big learning factor. Work culture was exhilarating. Hardest part of the job was leaving the friends I've made.
good,Job would have been a great place to stay but the Navy contract was not renewed so I was laid off. HIring process was very easy it just took a long time to hear back from them.
good,"Working for Lockheed was genuinely a positive experience for me.The atmosphere was slightly charged with anxiety,but,what company isn't. The time that I worked there I had the opportunity for my skill set to be put to the test and learn other methods to incorporate with mine on the F-16 wing new build."
good,"The Air Force life is one of challenge, adaptability, culture, and definitely education. If you want to become a well rounded individual open your mind and heart to a career with the Air Force but don't limit or deny the opportunity or adventure in the MARINES, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Reserves, or National Guard. You see there are many people who are limiting themselves in a job and have not found a career. The Air Force allowed me to travel the world while flying and repairing the same aircrafts I traveled on. It combined the capacity for culture in knowing and living among Japanese, Koreans, Europeans, and Americans, also joint ventures with my military comrades of the Armed Forces. Don't complain about what you don't understand when defending GOD and Country. Make a choice to be part of the solution, but not part of the problem whether pertaining to you or a world perspective. Broaden your horizons while the windows of opportunity are open. Aim High. Integrity first! Service before self!, and excellence in all I do. Forever an Airman."
good,My typical day at work is doing perimeter checks and walk through patrols of building. Also handling of any call for concerns their maybe. I've learned how to do all security relative jobs. The management in my department is outstanding as far as going out of there way to help someone how is in need as well as the co-workers. There really isn't a hard part to my job. The hardest thing is just remembering all the rule and regulations that are necessary so I would'nt get a violation. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing im a part of a good team and we meet all the requirements and task that are asked of us.
good,Lockheed Martin is a phenomenal company. At typical day at work is reviewing where we are with you new Fighter Production System Strategy and aligning objectives to meet concrete goals. Then spending time on the communication and adoption of this strategy.
good,Makeing sure the aircraft are save to fly and that the pilots come home eveytime is my day here at sikorsky.
good,"good compensation/benifits.mind numbing,watch your back!"

good,"I truly enjoy working here.  Sometimes the work time schedule can be a bit unrealistic, but other than that I love working here."
good,Was very sad when I received my layoff notice. Very much enjoyed the people and making good friends and really looked forward to getting up and going to work every day. Had the best supervisor in the world.
good,"Most days spoke on the phone with vendors and employees in regards to invoices and submitting expense reports, the most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to work independently to make my own decision to help employees and customers"
good,"This is a solid global company with lots of advancement opportunities in the technical and functional fields. "
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Great company to work for, unfortunately when you are a contractor... contracts end thus, so does the job."
good,"• Provided executive level support for over 300 customers included ( Air Force District of Washington Commander, Andrews AFB Wing Commander, Malcolm Grove Commander)"
good,"As a buyer I was procuring medium to complex items. It wa fast-paced, a lot of emergency requisitions to place."
good,I was worked in QA inspecting Apache helicopter's weapon system
good,"Typically my day started by finding out which drawings were priority then working on them first. I learned new programs, met a lot of great people, commute was excellent and felt like I was a part of a team again working together to create drawings.The hardest part of the job was getting used to all the internet programs Lockheed had for getting access to certain files and programs."
good,"The real world scenario for offensive actions in the realm of electronics warfare requires repeated training for our military service personnel flying everything in the Armed Services inventory. Providing this support requires a core dedication by men and women that can fill the needs of those roles. From radar operations/ maintenance, communications networks, engineering and aircraft tracking, these areas of expertise all require a high degree of profficiency and accuracy. I am proud to have fulfilled those roles for my 5 years with Lockheed-Martin. I felt a great sense of loss when L-M lost the contract."
good,its nice to work for a company like this one I will relocate any place any were any time
good,Working with Lockheed was great. Got to travel the USA going to different job sites and great pay.
good,"Since the core business was based on DoD contracts there was no job security. Encouraged self-motivation, growth. Immediate managers were only interested in appeasing superiors, since the background was either law enforcement, or military. No concept of employee management except for the Directors."
good,"Spent 22 years with them on the atlas,titan and shuttle programs as a elec/mech inspector. Currenty unemployed due to closure of the shuttle program."
good,"This was an exciting job: responsible for constructing small aircraft parts initially, then went on to installing doors on the C-130 aircraft. Managers and supervisors were great ant work environment as well as co-workers were excellent. I liked every aspect of my job and felt there was no part of my job that was hard."
good,Created 3D models and 2D drawing of Orion Space Craft.
good,To much outsourcing of work. I believe that more work should have stayed in house. Management cuts have been hard for the employees.
good,"Awsome company, great attitude and strong skills will take you far here. The union environment makes it feel like a retirment home! Only down side"
good,One of the best companies where I have worked.  Engineering team went out of there way to greet me on my first day.  Interesting project and fully equipped labs for testing your projects.
good,"Lots of company pride and interest in the mission of the program I was working on.  Co-workers habitually go out of their way to help each other out.  Contractor let me down at this job, but management was very graceful about schedule changes and work conditions."
good,A great place with some great people. The organization has some very exciting projects that could be time sensitive and require a great deal of attention and communication with leadership.
good,"Retired from Lockheed Martin in May 2014 after 30 years of service,seen a lots of changes within company over the years ,some good ,some not so good. I was blessed to be there that long considering how many employees started about the same time I did ,but because of layoffs didn't get call back.Over all the pay was good ,benefits, meet some good people over the years. Would I recommend working there. Yes"
good,Loved working at this place. The People and Culture were excellent They have everything on hand to accomplish whatever tasks that you require. Do not have a clue what may be the story today as I left a few years ago. The city of Greenville is a great place to live and always wanted to move back.
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for. High quality job tools are provided. Comfortable work environment. Four day week (10 hrs/day). Corporate support for family, medical, culture, etc. Lockheed Martin is a very stable company to work for."
good,I worked for Guardsmark that was contracted by Lockeed Martin. We provided security for the property and like many jobs there were great  and not so great employees to interact with. I appreciated the opportunity and was able to stay physically active with all the patrolling.
good,"They respect your work life balance, career advancement however can be based on who you know. They respect your time off, no emails or calls when you are on vacation, sick time, maternity leave etc. One of the benefits or a con is the place is huge so you can either get lost in the shuffle or see it as a lot of opportunity."
good,"Will not transition Contractors to FTE unless in Engineering field. Most of HR is contracted out. Heavy, but manageable work load, but contractors not shown appreciation for hard work."
good,"Hard to scale upwards since the company is so large and prestigious.  Like each company, it has it's ups and downs.  The management is quite friendly and understanding, but still quite rigid and inflexible."
good,"My time here was divided into three groups.  For a period of time I was in the factory, giving engineering support working 7 days a week, the weekend days were only 5 hours.  The people were great in team spirit in the truest sense of the word.  There were some upper managers who were micro managing rather than respecting our time needed to be in hustling to get the work done rather than taking time to hold their hands in what was going on and explaining how engineering process works that causes hold ups.  That was the only negative I had in the job.  Even when working 7 days a week I felt I was supported by my lead and manager.  There was respect, integrity and joy in working with the guys there."
good,great experience. Great place to work at. Work life is very balanced and flexible. people and management are very friendly. Everyone looks out for each other.
good,I enjoyed working at Lockheed Martin Corporations for the 16 years that I was part of the company. I gained valuable experience and knowledge about aircraft design and the aeronautical industry
good,Lockheed Martin is a great place to work.  They are very flexible with the employee's schedule and allows the employee to work hours that are best for their families.
good,I really liked the job that I did for Lockheed Martin but was laid off along with a lot of other Lockheed people.  The work as system administrator was my favorite work along with databasing.  I did not have the best 40 hour work week but the job took more time and delivery to our customer was very important.  I would be very happy to go back to Lockheed Martin.
good,The company was always providing their employees training and best practice ideas.  The Shared Service industry was an important role within the entire company.  It lacked job security when the shared service industry always had the threat of closing
good,working for lockheed was great. i learned a lot of new thing and meet different people everyday. the hardest part of the job was staying woke the most enjoyable part was meet new people everyday
good,Working at lockheed has been a wonderful experience.  Culture and management are in line with my own values.  I would recommend Lockheed Martin to a friend
good,When I start each morning I print my managers' work calendars so I know where they are and what meetings they have to attend.  I book travel and do expense reports for the people I support.  I also work in a sharepoint uploading Powerpoint files and granting access to new members.  I am responsible for booking conference rooms for various meetings and ordering lunches.
good,"Testing procedures were overly complicated due to external paperwork issues, due to interfacing with civilian entities and Gov. Most of the day is eaten up with waiting and miscommunication."
good,It was a busy and ever changing company but well worth the experience. My manager provided excellent opportunity for knowledge expansion and growth options.
good,In support of the Army Depot to provide on time material at a competitive price break.  We were responsible to use historical data to forecast next years contract.  And to research and determine failure rate causes and determine new supply levels accordingly.
good,"I have moved within the company and left the previous division that I worked for.  However, if you were not high ranking military then you did not get promoted or moved up."
good,"At my internship always had some great design work. Great environment. I would go back and work there in a hearbeat but I am looking to work specifically around Seneca, South Carolina."
good,I learned about my job from fellow employees. They were friendly and cooperative.
good,The local management made poor decisions.  The company was good to work for. There is no hard in a job you love. I mainly focused myself on the job at hand the customers I loved to support.
good,"Never a dull moment if you work in production/assembly.  Plenty of blueprint reading and measuring/checking layout on the product before the assembler begins drilling or installing parts.  A lot of multi-tasking required to keep the assembly line operating smoothly.  One minute you are conferring with engineers to make a drawing change and the next minute you are working with the production control to check the status of the drill bits that you ordered earlier in the day.  A great place to work because there are so many opportunities to learn new things while advancing your career and working with great people.  Nothing feels better than to watch those airplanes roll out the door after you've poured all your blood, sweat and tears into them!"
good,I loved this job. I only stoped working here because my husband and I had a son. We decided together that I would stay home with him. The benefits were great. The pay was great. Thework load was great.
good,"My experiences cover material management, estimating, financial analyst, contract management, wartime engineering services and problem resolution and vendor coordination."
good,Very structured.  Many opportunities to move within the Corporation.  Fun employee activities.  Work is often completed as teams.  Constantly strives for process improvement.
good,I really love the aerospace field and was my pasion in life. This company worked well with its employees and treated them as such. I would greatly recommend this company to anyone.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Lockheed Martin each time.  The management has always been great and the work culture is very helpful and team oriented.  The hardest part of the job is when the contract you are on ends or you are moved to another position and have to say goodbye to people you have grown accustomed to working with every day.  The seemingly constant changing can be a bit unnerving for some.  For others that enjoy variety, it may be a perfect fit."
good,"Abundant, technically challenging, career enhancing opportunities - not a dull day on the job for thirty-three years.  Learned to work with and manage every type of personality - thoroughly enjoyed sharing life experiences and skills with all.  The hardest part of the job was accepting the fact that the program I was finally tasked with shutting down and turning over to our successor would have continued under Lockheed Martin management had we more skillfully handled our customer, NAVSEA."
good,"I enjoyed driving the forklifts, cherry pickers, and learned how to operate everything else that I didn't know how to operate to help out the soldiers and their units anyway that I could."
good,"I worked for Lockheed Martin for almost 7 years.  The only reason I left was because I was tired of driving 1.5-2 hours to/from work even though the distance should've only taken an hour.  I was also working nights, weekends, and holidays which was no longer desirable.  Where I was working there were plenty of other job advancements, in fact I moved from the help desk to a data analyst just because I asked about moving elsewhere.  They took great care of me and was potentially going to move me to Close Support but there were no openings at that time.  They were willing to begin training me so that when a position did come available I could move into it w/o problems.  However I found a position that was only 45 mins from home with another company.  Shortly after leaving I wished I could go back."
good,Ability to work on special forces projects. Every day requires involvement and new challenges. Many opportunities to advance and learn new skill sets that will set you up for success.
good,"Nothing negative to say. I enjoyed my time there.Unfortunately, I worked in the Quality department and was moved to a logistical position within the Metrology department, and due to my non technical status was deemed non critical and therefore layed off."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is that I've always been encouraged to learn new skills and to think on my own. I've learned database administration, some programming, and proposal management to name a few. My co-workers have always been great as well. They have always been willing to help another worker learn new skills."
good,"Lockheed Martin is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests.It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, in the Washington, DC, area. Lockheed Martin employs 116,000 people worldwide. It is the world's largest defense contractor based on revenue.  Seventy eight (78%) of Lockheed Martin's revenues came from military sales;  It is also the largest US federal government contractor  Lockheed Martin operates in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions, Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems and Training, and Space Systems.  I worked in the Information Systems and Global Solutions section, which was the largest section in Lockheed Martin.  It was a very aggressive company to work for."
good,Most enjoyable part of work was coming to work everyday knowing that my work mattered and it made a difference to many people around the world. I felt great pride and satisfaction in what I was working on.
good,Keep watch and logs of daily base operations and report anything out of the normal daily operation to appropriate military personnel.
good,"Salary and Benefits are good for the area. Need Better communications between Management and employees in the area that I was in.  Co-workers are fantastic.  Except for management, everyone is great to work with.  I enjoyed suporting the team."
good,"Surrounded by some of the most intelligent, dedicated, and skilled people in the Aerospace industry.  Long hours, a lot of overtime, great compensation, health insurance benefits only so-so.  Good local management, but division VP reportedly does not know what kind of products our location delivers, in spite of the fact that it is over 40% of the hardware produced by the division."
good,"Great company, hard for advancement for young people. Learned a lot of skills that will help me advance in the future. Management is good"
good,Work day was layed  back as long as you got your work done learned a lot was my first full blown aircraft job and was told know else  in the country did that level of modifications complete tare down and rebuild to different configuration management was great and help full as was the co-workers nothing seam hard I think im very adaptable and pick up very quickly enjoyable part was they did all they could to keep me as long as they could they found out I could paint so when I ran out struchal work they moved me to paint after I ran out of paint they put me as a mechanic
good,"Will give to Lockheed Martin on my out processing.  I’ve enjoyed working with all my coworkers and supervisors, but always felt like the scheduling department in general would not get the recognition we all deserved.  Except for a few supervisor that did make an effort to get all of us something, I commend them."
good,"Great employer, very good benefits and good people to work with.  Have worked for LM off and on over the last 11 years as a contractor, have enjoyed being associated with LM."
good,"this was my first job after my release from the military so I liked it a lot. great people,  learned a lot."
good,"I love Lockheed Martin and who it serves. However, its culture needs to continue to evolve and there is very little growth opportunity for entry level HR candidates."
good,"Global CI is an excellent staffing firm.  They have contracts with larger companies.  I worked on a contract for Lockheed Martin at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.  "
good,not too much career advancement.  also performance evaluation system needs better way of doing business.
good,"This company has a great community feeling to it. It's a small office in the IT department and the nerds abound. The only problem is that the company is focused on contract work and only has a few permanent contracts. So, if you're on a temporary contact, then the job security is definitely not there."
good,"A typical day is an eight hour shift on grave yards for me that would consist of security checks of secured areas, nightly interactions with personal on campus that are working on projects, and nightly training in either medical, security, or fire responses. Always a good interaction with co-works and other personal on campus. The hardest part of this position is the eight hour shifts over night and would much rather be working 12 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part is truly the opportunities that are provided nightly by the company and my management staff."
good,all in all it was a great to work at but if your a contractor its hard to keep your job cause if they dont like you our if you miss one day they will terminate your contract.
good,"Management was a bit unfaithful to its employees, they always seemed to have their favorites."
good,here you can see all your efforts when you get to watch the F-35 Lighting II  take off and land for the first time.
good,I would work for them again if the opportunity was a good one.
good,Great company where you will learn a lot. Great work/life balance with the flexibility to work from home sometimes. Intelligent and competent people within the organization and promote growth.
good,Great flexibility to take care of the family and health issues. Very understanding leadership!
good,"Nice place to work, contract driven so layoffs are normal. Good benefits, interesting work on new technology."
good,Would design a redundant network and then go implement the network. Have lead multiple teams to do computer rack installs.
good,"Working at Lockheed Martin is challenging, rewarding and a great overall defense company."
good,"Great work environment, management and co-workers easy going and fun to work with"
good,Working with the NASA family at the Marshall Space Flight Center was awesome.
good,The customer was scheduled to have all of the users' workstations upgraded every 3 yrs. It was our job to go and replace each and one. By the time we replaced everyone's it was time to start over. We also went around and updated the latest windows program when the time came. The hardest part of the job was pushing a cart of 21 wks from office to office or building and the most enjoyable was working with a great team
good,"I managed a team of 59 communicators that provided media relations, employee communications, program communications, marketing and community relations for a company of 10,000 employees. The company is very well run by talented leaders. I enjoyed the variety of work that I performed and the people I worked with. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with tightening budgets."
good,"Variety of tasks, never boring interesting mix of persons to interface with."
good,"A typical day is filled with meetings, either face to face or telelcoms along with strategic planning on how to improve current performance."
good,-Patroling the compound
good,Receive calls from people wanting appliance rebates. Management was willing to help with questions; while you're on the phone. A customer service representative is the only point of contact for customers. Co-workers are friendly. It was hard telling someone they didn't qualify for appliance rebates. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new friends.
good,"Work started early, review notes of previous days meetings, took care of all action items, attended TRR,SDR, SRR, ORR, Executive Reviews and meetings, Budget Control meetings."
good," Oversees the day-to-day operation of computer networks including hardware/software support, training and special; plans, designs and implements data connectivity for local area Network and Wide Area Network"
good,The corporation as a whole was wonderful. I gained a lot of knowledge about industial security. I was also able to begin going to school to pursue my degree in Computer Networking System.
good,Hi l worked for Lockheed 92-2002 was great the pay was always on time .And vacation was no problem it was very good n wish them well never had any problems l work was good ..
good,A typical day includes back and forth work between employees in order to get projects done in a timely manner that way we can proceed and accomplish our goals
good,Great projects and great pride to be working to help the security of this great nation. Many opportunities to travel to different parts of the United States and even to counties of our allies.
good,The staff are friendly and the work keeps you occupied. Management always pushes for employee to excel with in the company. The pay is manageable and pay day is weekly.
good,"After five separate one year temporary employment contract work, Lockeed Martin offered me a full time job. Aerospace and ultra tight tolerance work was challenging"
good,There is a lot of great management and they are continually looking to improve their processes and their teams through process change and education. Great company to work for and lots of room for growth.
good,"Safe, Quality and Prodcutive , clean, kind unique people, Team oriented. Detailed oriented, reliable. Responsibility is my first goal and Impression meeting the demands of our customers need."
good,"It was a great experience working in Lockheed Martin. Good team and good leadership. I learnt a lot about project management and delivery when working in Lockheed Martin. Also , i was introduced to Agile delivery model and scrum delivery on one of the projects i was supporting."
good,I enjoyed working at Lockheed. Stress free environment and very organized establishment. The volume of the work load is high so you’re never bored. Great company and I would love to work there again.
good,"Often the behaviors of an organization are reflective of the top.  Our CEO is capable, strong, personable and will not compromise our core values of respect and hard work."
good,Very vast place to work with many moving gears. Its like a titanic that is following a well defined and safe course but also one you cannot change quickly. Plenty of opportunity if you know how to navigate the deck. And plenty of heartache if you cannot synergize with the crew or if you're not fond of the sea. This company will offer you grand success; if you can play the game right.
good,Lockheed Martin is a company focused on doing the right thing for the customer. There are many interesting projects and new technologies to challenge you.
good,only worked on site. had to deploy for each assignment. did not have an office. work was AOG only the pace was fast and at time difficult due to inclement weather
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great place to work for individuals who are focused on quality and customer needs. Pay and benefits are above average, and in such a large company, there are many opportunities for advancement for a motivated employee."
good,"A typical day at work presented me with tasks that included safety walkthroughs, safety training and project management.  I often worked as part of a team especially concerning a major mechanical project that was ongoing.  I enjoyed my co-workers and we worked well together.  For the most part, management used a 'hands-off' approach which entrusted me to schedule and complete the required work properly and on schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the travel.  I visited other airports and airport facilities to provide training to FAA staff.  Even though I enjoyed traveling it became tiring at times and I found myself missing my family."
good,"Setting aside the difficulties of working defense (contracts and red tape), Lockheed Martin provides a supportive environment that focuses on what's important - the customer and the employees (in that order).  The only negative I have found is that some business units are a bit more proactive and offer advanced onsite education (with charge numbers) where as other units will provide an occasional lunch-time-learning (no charge number); engineers strive, by trade, to learn more - give it to them!"
good,"Lockheed is the third of four  employers I've had on the same Government Contract in a 29 year period. I have worked in 47 States, Two US territories, and 2 foreign countries on this contract. Asking my Job Location is irrelevant because the surveyor doesn't allow you to put ""Nationwide"" or ""Worldwide"" as an option. I put the World Headquarters as the location, although I've never been there. I've had job assignments as short as a week and as long as 3 1/2 years. I even changed employers during one assignment because I started the assignment as an employee of one of their subcontractors. I've worked in -40° weather and 120° weather and everything in between. Sometimes I work inside, sometimes outside. The cab of my truck is often my office. "
good,"Working for QTC Medical Service-Lockheed Martin was always extremely interesting and always busy. There was never a dull day at this workplace, fast paced environment. Learned how to triage active duty soldier's cases to provide them with the highest average of veteran compensation. Everyone worked as a team and making certain that each condition claimed by each soldier was considered and never overlooked was priority. Co-workers and veterans were the most enjoyable part of this job and assisting each soldier made each day worth while."
good,"i liked working there because they offered training in different jobs. The people were very professional and polite. there were many benefits  to working there out of all the jobs i have had, this one was the best. Everyone worked closely with each other and helpful, more like family than co-workers."
good,"Paid conferences and travel, paid training.  Team atmosphere, management cared about me personally and professionally.  I was teamed with a mentor who coached me well."
good,"I have spent 3 years working on a project for this company. In most cases it has been a pleasure as well as the ability to provided an excellent space to continue to develop my skills. Lockheed has excellent an working practice are a great example for other companies to follow."
good,"Great people there, miss them. Management was superb. Hardest part of job was micromanaged IT departments and hundreds of queues for different types of tickets,sometimes routing them to the correct one if it wasn't designated for our department but got routed to us anyway."
good,"I love that they paid weekly....instead of biweekly.  I loved working for this company, but did not like a lot of the corporate stuff you had to abide by.  Vacation benefit could have been better.  I did not like that they made you do required training on your own time."
good,"Between weekend updates/upgrades and weekly support of systems and applications, there were new challenges every day. There is a sense of pride in the work we perform at Lockheed. People on the team engage with one another and with development to support issues as they arise, it is a good collaborative environment."
good,"If you value meaningful work then work here. I have worked at corporate places where it feels like you are just working so the owners can buy a new yacht. Here, you are working so that the US and its allies can maintain global security with the latest technology."
good,Plenty of co-workers and Management willing to help you learn everything you need to do your job efficiently. Great experience minus the job is for the government so the job is moving across the country to lower costs.
good,"Working on a contract is different than working in a facility. We were contracted to deploy for the contract so you were subjected to working tours in a deployed location. You have to be prepared for a life on the road. In return you are compensated well and you work a 4 month on 4 month off schedule, so your off time is your own time to do as you wish. You have to be a self motivated individual with the ability to travel to overseas areas. It was a great place to work and a very rewarding job."
good,"Ability to learn new things each day"
good,it is a good place looking to see if there is better. it is hard to move up. very nice people good job but looking to see if there is better.alot of good work looking if there may be better
good,"Was on a 5 year contract, very good place to work . no advancement because of it being a government contract. Pay and benefits were above average. Good place to work"
good,Lockheed's position on hiring from within gave me opportunities to move up the ladder and into new areas of work. They also encouraged higher education and offered tuition assistance to help obtain those goals. I would be very happy to work for Lockheed Martin again in the future.
good,"Cleaning the building, and the bathroom & always be graceful that something will work out better, if you have faith? But have gratitude & not attitude.. I enjoy work ,and learning, how different people are appreciated  then other."
good,"great place to work with awesome 9/80 schedule, 5 days one week, 4 days the next, so 9 days would come out to 80hrs. Good benefits. Would recommend to anyone getting out of college and mechanics."
good,"This is one of the largest companies in the world. It is very corporate and structured. If you enjoy that environment, it is for you. This is not a negative, it is a desription of how the company is."
good,"Excellent company striving to be the primary UK defence deliverer."
good,"Great Place to work , good atmosphere , great people cutting edge work. Work is available in almost any state . Huntsville is where I am trying to get to from new york"
good,having worked in subcontract I have to say that the only thing that struck me is the gratitude of the engineering staff of LM when I reported formal and procedural errors concerning the assembly line
good,"Lockheed Martin played out its purpose for me. It was very strict and goal oriented, and I learned a lot about corporate culture while working here. It was not the place for me due to the managements ethics and office politics. Overall, the company is a great company to work for, and I gained very valuable experience during my tenure here."
good,"The work is usually fast-paced and I always learn a lot from the people I work with. Working as a contractor, you have time off to have a long vacation and get caught up with daily life."
good,Need not be so challenging to get hired on. The people are helpful and are willing to train you peer to peer based.  Management doesn't micromanage which is huge
good,"A typical day was fairly well planned in advance.  Job duties were assigned and the focus was on completing the assigned projects.  It was one the best Internal Audit departments I was ever around, so I learned a lot about auditing.  "
good,I worked in a call center answering calls for our contract.  Most enjoyable part was helping everyone that called in.   I loved my managers and cowork
good,"It was great working for this company, You have to consider the overall program and not the contract you work for, overall the company is great the contract had enough space for improvement"
good,"A typical day working in (Lockheed Martin) United Launch was filled with opportunities and rewarding challenges.  For me as a leader in production management it was very rewarding working with the productions teams to meet the goals that were put up for us to meet.  I enjoyed keeping the team engaged in the problem solving with the team and the great work ethic that we shared.  As with any place of employment I learned that the more I worked to build up the production team, just treating everyone with dignity and respect,  setting realistic achievable goals and objectives, being honest goes a long way.  Management was fair and for the most part worked with all the employees.  The workplace culture was for the most part was a can do attitude with the teams I managed.  The hardest part of the job informing employees of reductions in force. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability of my teams to meet and surpass our goals."
good,Lockheed Martin Corporation provided an excellent opportunity for growth in my career path.  The Management was competent and willing to embrace the many changes.
good,"Brilliant Lean Management that left professionals alone to do the work they do best.  Took care of their employees.  Lean structure was very agile, very profitable, and responded quickly to market demands.  Great small-business culture in a large business, which later disappeared when the CEO retired and the division was merged with another corporate division with a more entrenched culture."
good,This company provides employees with the opportunity to work on interesting and challenging projects.  Employees are generously compensated for pay and benefits.
good,"A typical day could vary from busy to relaxed but work was manageable. I learned great communication skills, worked with a diverse group of professionals, and excellent team work. Management was great but limited due to budget constraints far as career advancement. Workplace culture was very advanced with the technology we used and were exposed to. It was great to work with Astronauts and see their video footage from their personal cameras. The hardest part of the job was dealing with equipment failures when they were critical for production. Delays cost thousands of dollars. The best part of the job was the size of the company and the many opportunities outside of one site. The company is nationwide and do a lot of work ranging from fighter jets to space shuttle tanks."
good,"I am a flight line completion supervisor. I assign the work and monitor the work of 22 employees on swing shift. I learned how to manage the daily workload and flight schedule on C-130J aircraft. Work culture is stressful and busy most days, we work every weekend. Hardest part of job is keeping things organized and running smoothly. Most enjoyable part is delivering the aircraft to the military customers and seeing the completion of each aircraft."
good,"Do Your Job and you will be rewarded. I deployed to Afghanistan after"
good,I have enjoyed working for this company.  Everyone there is great and even when upper management visits our site they are friendly and kind. All locations are willing to answer questions even if it is not their job.
good,"Lockheed provides a great work environment.  I enjoyed working in the hangar with all the airplanes.  Very interesting workplace.  Lots of opportunity to learn new skills.  Great people to work with.  A lot of opportunity to volunteer on community projects and employee functions.  "
good,The company culture is definitely a big plus at LMCO!

good,This is my 17th year with Lockheed.  It has been very good all these years.  Good company and projects and good people to work with.  As with any very large organization there is the bureaucracy of management but it never hindered me in my progression.  Big changes coming this year as the part of Lockheed that I am with - IS&GS will merge with LEIDOS.  Change is all we have - going with the flow.
good,My most enjoyable about the job is the programs. My co-works are great to work with. Management always involves works in meetings to alert what's coming up with new requirements.
good,Launch site work was informative and busy. Good managers & co-workers. It is unfortunate when these projects come to an end when everything is going so well. Looking forward to having a employer of this caliber again.
good,"Great work place and group environment. Company is employee minded that offers a lot of personal educational growth."
good,Was given a position where I knew very little about the application.  Through a lot of research was able to become the subject matter expert.  Was fun watching the site grow from 125 users to over 2000 users.  Also it was satisfying to see the application grow from a document repository to a collaboration tool used by all.  Enjoyed the customer interactions and knowing at the end of the day I made difference by helping customers.

I don't think any part of my job was hard. I worked well with co-workers as we were not only a good team but we considered one another family. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I worked in Property Management and we were able to pass all government audits 5 years in a row. Something that hadn't been done in the past."

good,This was a great place to work. I've kept in contact with quite a few people from here.

good,"great company to work for. fun, exciting and challenging. the people I will miss the most"
good,Lockheed is a place where you are not micro managed. You come in get your work done and there is always someone willing to help or lend a hand if needed. To me there has not been a hard part to the job I am willing to learn new things and catch on very quickly with little or no supervision. I like that every day is something new and that everyone here at Lockheed knows that I am a team player and they can come to me with whatever they may need.
good,Big company and lots of job options to move around trying different things.
good,"Make sure all tool I support are working well and support any issues or problems."
good,"Worked for LM for over 26 years and always found it to be a challenging work environment.  Sometimes the work can take away from your home life and require significant sacrifices, but they encourage you to take schooling seriously and move within the company."
good,"Lockheed was a wonderful, professional company with set hours, time off for lunch, paid over-time, really interesting job, and too bad that Congress cut the space shuttle program budget laying off tons of people.  Lockheed is a contract employee for NASA, although they do other jobs, but NASA was the main employer.  When NASA's budget was cut, many layoffs occurred.  This is very sad for the aerospace industry."
good,Wonderful workplace for twenty four years will miss the people.  I enjoyed interaction with senior management and co-workers.

good,"Good people to work with, excellent management and great opportunities for growth"
good,- Manage daily challenges of numerous and geographically dispersed operations and activities.

We assemble vairous components if a fixture and join them together using various types of fasteners. Teamwork is very important to complete the job on time and under budget, but thats what makes it challenging. I get alot of self satisfaction from doing that kind of work."
good,"Stayed busy all the time, learned a lot about working in an aeronautics plant. Enjoyed working mainly indoors even though I've always enjoyed working outside as I have done most of my life. Management in my department were a great bunch of people to work for. The people I worked side by side with were great too, never a dull moment."
good,"Mangement was awesome,Loved my coworkers,There was really nothing hard about my job learned alot of new things."
good,"Lockheed Martin formerly General Dynamics , when I hired in in 1985 I was thrilled with the opportunity to learn a new skill in Fiberglass Tooling. The benefits are/where great including the pay. I was given the chance to complete some extra training that resulted in advancing my pay a little faster than the average represented employee. My only fault with the company for myself was job security. Being part of 3 lay offs during my career there. I would go back if I had the opportunity and would love to try something new as a part of their team. Union affiliation not a necessary component for me I feel I can offer a lot to the company as a loyal employee."
good,Overall Lockheed Martin is an outstanding company to work for I have no complaints.
good,"My tenure at LM was excellent. The position as Field Staff Engineer was an open position to task and challenge every fiber of your skill sets. Lockheed provides excellent upper management support and rewards ""thinking outside the box."" Macromanagement philosophy and commitment to excellence values."
good,"The people are very supportive and want success for those on their teams. Great place to work. Started as a contractor, hoping to be a full time employee."
good,"In my opinion, Lockheed Martin is a great place to work.  Training that was provided was very good and helpful. Daily routine was consistent with occasional special project requests."
good,"If you like the union mentality, then this is a great place to work as an hourly employee. There is a very hostile climate, however, between hourly and salaried employees. For some reason, the hourly employees think they are better than everyone else, and smarter. Other than that, I have 0 complaints about the Ocala, FL facility and loved my time there."
good,I am one of few people who can say they love what they do. Unfortunately the contract that I work on has come to an end.  Now I have to find another job.
good,Great Company to work for. Very calm and quiet environment everyone there was very helpful.  Only reason i am not there anymore is due to my contract ending.
good,"Excellent place to work. Like any job, your going to get in return what you invest. This is a high energy environment with many moving parts. The opportunity to excel is there."
good,"Good company with wide range of opportunities in multiple locations.  Strong culture of ethics, diversity, and inclusion.  Genuinely committed to core values."
good,"- A typical day at work involves meeting/briefs on how departments are doing with regards to delivery of services to customers on or before due dates."
good,Very welcoming. Teammates are awesome and they are always there to help you. Company has high deductible health benefits. I'm only a casual employee so not all benefits applied to me.
good,"Lockheed Martin was a great place to work for, benefits were good and the work environment was great. However there were no opportunities for advancement without relocating so another opportunity presented itself in the same town had to take it."
good,"Attention to definition of requirements and design were paramount. Followed by meeting deadlines in a time crunch environment."
good,Great culture and plenty of opportinuties to improve. I learned so many things that showed me what an amazing career field this is. I couldn't have wished for a better place to start in the workforce.

good,"Where else do you get to negotiate tens of millions of dollar contracts for really cool things?  Flexible work schedules, ability to telecommute, and fun coworkers."
good,This is a wonderful place to work.  I was saddled with a terrible manager that did not care about subordinates and did not know her job.  If not for that I would sitll be working there.  I would love to go back any time.
good,I have had a very rewarding career at Lockheed.  Everyday is exemplified by pride in the service and products we provide to protect our country and those of our allies.
good,Working in the Field Team Operations was very exciting and challenging at the same time.  Lockheed prides itself on working with innovative employees from all backgrounds.
good,"strong team spirit"
good,"Great atmosphere with career advancement opportunities. "
good,I really enjoy going to work everyday for LMCO. I am so proud of the work we do. I am surrounded by great people and I also love the 9/80 work schedule.
good,"Other than what I was taught in college, my skills and training came from Lockheed.  I learn  how to get ahead with certifications from working with Lockheed. I did not know the importance of certifications before I work there. Working on government installation also played a major part in that. The hardest part of my job were the customers. It was an easy process to move on to other departments/ areas in the company provided you got the certification or even if you wanted to learn or experience another area."
good,"I had the opportunity to work on defense programs which mean working with the arm forces, it was very structured and goal oriented. It helps me to put emphasizes on priorities and deadlines."
good,Overall easy job if you have skills to offer. Hard to advance to a higher position without 5+ years at this company. Sometimes shifts step on each other or have uneven work loads. Awesome place to grow your experience and set a standard for your quality of work. I enjoy working here and would love to retire from Lockheed Martin in the long run.
good,"Lockheed has been good to me for 38 yrs. I have enjoyed working on some of the Nations best platforms, I have worked on classified programs thru out my time at Lockheed and can't talk about them, but I have enjoy every opportunity Lockheed has given me"
good,Lockheed was a very good place to work. I learned allot from working with them. I assembled a Dis-assembled the TF-39 engine.I also work at test cell.   Management was very helpful to there people.
good,"I learned a lot at Lockheed and would likely still be there if I hadn't been offered a position with SSA.  What people from the 'outside' don't seem to understand is that SSA uses their contractors as sources for hiring.  If you are a 'rock start' with Lockheed or Northrop, you will likely be approached by SSA.  Now, if you turn SSA down (and I witnessed this first hand), you will find that all the work that you used to get and all those projects that you could be guaranteed to be asked to work on will suddenly disappear.  So it is 'in your best interest' to take the job with SSA or your billable project time with whatever contracting company you are working for will take a nose-dive.  And  contracting companies only have so much tolerance for people 'on the bench'."
good,Did great work fo this company installed software and Driver’s and othe components. I performed deployments and asset and desktop and workstation assets
good,Lockheed-Martin provided comfort and provision for myself and family. Afforded me opportunities for advancement and educational goals. Provided ample outlets of social networking.
good,Overall I enjoyed my time there.  My only reason for leaving was that my executive retired and the options to work for other departments was not what I was looking for.
good,"Great Company.  Would go back to work there anytime. Great benefits, work culture, mission.   Well managed, motivated, outstanding work force, challenging work."
good,Was great working there. Lots of good people. Management was not in your face all the time and was very fair. I would work there again if given the chance to do so.
good,"Tasked with updating service flow diagrams for entire Eastern Service Area. Task was accomplished with input from technicians and engineers remotely.Service flow diagrams were created by me and used by technicians, engineers and decision makers to route air traffic safely and with minimum delays."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a top organization with competitive pay and opportunities for development and growth.  My role as a Recruiter was demanding, but I had all of the resources I needed to be a productive, high contributor.  I had a great, supportive manager who offered opportunity for the team to stay current on evolving practices in our function.  It was a very fast-paced environment as the business continues to change and grow.  The hardest part of the job was effectively managing the ambiguity that comes with constant change.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the external candidates to sell and enhance the strong employer brand.  There are a lot of benefits that come with a successful, rapidly evolving company like Lockheed Martin.  The other enjoyable part of the job was the challenge of developing a strong pipeline of quality talent to fill current and future staffing needs.  Lockheed Martin's infrastructure supports employee success and I had the privilege of contributing to that success in many ways as a Recruiter."
good,Lockheed Martin provides the perfect opportunity for people to show their technical intelligence and business acumen. They provide competitive salaries an impressive benefits. I feel the work environment for Lockheed Martin provides a collaborative environment led by Innovative managers all working together to accomplish one goal.
good,"It's easy to have respect for your peers when everyone is so well trained and willing to help others. You can pick your own hours, as long as it fits around 9am-3pm."
good,"I enjoyed my position and got all the support I needed to accomplish the mission, I led a tem of 35 Engineers performing 6-hour Simulation Scenarios on 7 day/24 hour support shift"
good,The company is a great place to work after 40. People are unwilling to change the way things were done in the past. I liked the people but some were too complacent in the role.
good,I worked at Lockheed Martin for over 20+ years and enjoyed my time with the company. The great management team and my co-workers were outstanding. Highly recommended to new college hires and experienced employees.
good,"Everything was great, while working on the USPS contract.  Issues only arose when fellow employees goofed around and brought many of us into meetings that ultimately led to the culture changing and personnel being moved around.  It was at this time that I left to start school in a more focused IT based sector.  While at this job, I worked on everything from scales, computers, hotline work and more.  Sometimes requested to work on other military based contracts at the company.  Was very fun!"
good,I was given much opportunity to grow at Lockheed Martin and was also given much opportunity to collaborate on many projects.  Top notch place to work.
good,I was a Customer Service Representative that worked in the Call Center. I stayed at my desk all day long answering phones with headphones on. As soon as you get off the phone with one customer you were on the phone with another one. The only time you were not on the phone was when it was time to go to lunch or home.
good,"Very interesting work, I enjoyed the level of requirement, specifications, standards used by Lockheed thoroughly! Primary specifications were NAVSEA 248/271/278."
good,I have great memories of working on the best fighter technology with all the right resources. The IPT structure is implemented well and engineering process adhered. The LM Aero Fort Worth facility is in a good location for family life. The recreation center was nice for team functions and family days.
good,Great place to work.  The culture was great and the people even better.  The pay is pretty decent and you get to work on great projects.  I would highly recommended applying.
good,"I love working here in Fort Worth for the F35 program.  There is a lot to learn and a lot of cool people to learn them from.  It is moderately paced work environment with there always being something to do.  Inspectors are cool and management has your back.  The only thing I wasn't prepared for was standing through the whole shift up to 9 hours a day.  Overtime on Sundays is paid double-time and there's a lot of overtime to be made.  Great place to work, but hard to get into, or should I say a long process to get in to."
good,Plenty of learning opportunities and support for co-ops to be hired full time. Loved the company culture! Just did not care for the location... Great diverse culture and diverse business units to choose from when you want to make a career move.
good,I had a very good time here as a co-op but ultimately did not end up coming back for a career. I had learned alot about hardware and other design constraints but was not too interested in the subject matter
good,"LM fostered and developed my skills during my time as a CWEP. As a Finance Major, Contract Negotiation was new territory. But with the support and guidance of team-members I was able to leave this expensive with highly refined skills to take into a future career. Awesome place to work and even better people!"
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my job and my coworkers on a daily basis. We all knew what needed to be done on a daily basis, and we got it done in a timely manner."
good,Managed better than other similar aerospace companies. The high cost of living in California makes it impossible to buy a home even though the salary is higher than other states. You can commute to get cheaper housing but expect about 2 hour commute.
good,"I was privileged to work on some of the most interesting specialty satellites for commercial and Defense Department customers."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities throughout the company to explore, both in the classified and non-classified environments.  Competitive salary ranges."
good,I really enjoy working there all the people there were very nice. They worked  as a team. The call came at a reasonable pace and the metrics were obtainable.
good,"This is a great place to work in; however the culture is more related to the program you are working on. Every program is like a company in it self, so you can be in a group that you might not like. In which case ou can look for open positions with in LM and move to another program."
good,"Well Structured Company, good flow, very rare that there were workplace related issues.  My main reason for leaving was the commute from Maryland into Virginia."
good,"9/80 work schedule, good place to work, competitive. Management is good, supportive. Employee benefits are being chipped away. The job is enjoyable and fulfilling."
good,Good company to work for.   This is a good company to work for.  I will like to do some work with them again.  I was employed by Lockheed sometime ago.
good,Great experience. 
good,A typical day would include local travel with several team members and training.  The hardest part was communication with upper management to agree on a solution to problems affecting 3 locations.
good,"If your in the mood for a quick paced work environment, then Lockheed Martin is the place for you. This job is a fun and exciting way to meet lots of new people that will help you achieve your goals of becoming a better experienced sheet-metal mechanic."

good,"Lockheed Martin is a very Good place to work"
good,It was a nine hour day Monday through Thursday and eight hours every other Friday. It was a lot of data entry. The managers did not micro manage you. You were a resource for the company. Most of our counterparts were traveling extensively nationwide. We were the eyes and ears for the organizing during their nationwide University Relations Recruiting Campaigns.
good,This facility and company were what a Defense Contractor Company should be. Highly technical and advanced. The personnel working there emulated pride and professionalism that represents the American people.
good,Good Pay. Good Benefits Caring Attitude Toward Salaried Employees. I worked for these two companies for several years and was able to move up into management as soon as I felt ready.
good,Lockheed lost contract and GDIT picked it up and hired us on to continue the work we started. Wish they won contract and continued on with a great company.
good,"I loved the fast-paced environment.  Gained personnel pride knowing I was supporting the Navy force directly."
good,"Excellent Company, I would suggest working for Lockheed Martin to anyone.  They provide opportunity for growth and are willing to work relocate employees in an effort to retain their talent."
good,I worked on stress and vibration analysis of JSF-35 brackets and support systems. The Lead engineer and Supervisor were very supportive and helpful. Really enjoyed working there.
good,"I was non-exempt employee, base pay was low but did have overtime and extra pay added. The people I worked with were fantastic and I didn't have any drama. Travel is often required, however it was fun and rewarding. Overall it was the best job i've had, and would have made it a career had it not been for low pay."
good,"Was able to utilize the most powerful DSP microprocessor (Texas Instrument TMS320C6201) in a design using processors to perform the design blocks of a high performance L-band radar that was frequency agile, performed target acquisition required for TARS, and performance superior to existing elevated radars."
good,"Lockheed was the best company I ever worked for and would recommend it to anyone I felt would be a good fit for the company, My days were always busy and never dull. I loved my job and my time spent at LM."

good,Enjoyed my time at Locheed Martin Corporation. Great place to start out to work. Corporation assisted with after hour training and encouraged work and personal life balance activities...
good,The LM programs keeps you very busy identifying new ways to improve the sustainment processes and policies. Close coordination with Joint Program Office and representatives to ensure customer value to any changes. The greatest yet hardest part is coordination of cross-functional IPT's to discuss root causes and corrective actions required for tactical solutions back to the customers with delivered aircraft. The most enjoyable part of the job is the autonomy to develop and create new decisions.
good,"I was brought in as a co op, to learn more about government manufacturing. It was an energetic learning environment. Only bad thing is it is all contract work, but if you have been with the company a while you can move around."
good,My boss said that the unions were going to shut us down.  It was an agreement that was misunderstood.  I went over to Lockheed Martin Merietta. I stayed for 1.5 years.
good,Loved working at Lockheed Martin. Learned a LOT working on different programs during my tenure. But times have changed ever since its IT services were sold to Leidos.

good,"Our products are a staple of the military, municipalities and commercial platforms.  People travel from Point A to Point B safely.  Satisfying to know that our product saves lives which is what our founder intended them to do."
good,This company was fantastic and gave me great hands on training and application of financial experience that college could never give me. Look forward to continue working for Lockheed Martin
good,I enjoy working there.  The place I work people rarely leave so It is a good job.  Not much room for advancement since so few people leave but it means its a good place to work.  The only complaint is that degrees are respected more than seniority.  30years is worth less than an associates degree in some cases.
good,Lockeheed Martin offers growth and development to their employees.  It is was an exciting work environment.  It is great place to work with outstanding benefits.
good,"Great workplace with outstanding benefits package, friendly co-workers and fun job. Partiality is shown to workers of different nationalities. Political views are strongly endorsed and even pushed upon workers at times."

good,"Very good place to work, very professional with great benefits and opportunities. my days were varied with slow days mixed with high ops tempo days.

good,Very good corporate culture with opportunity for advancement. Good benefits and compensation packages. Co-workers always eager to help you with porjects.
good,"Leadership transition and next Generation coming on board make for challenges. Prefer to discuss in person. "
good,"I have enjoyed working for the company, flex week schedule is great, management team in recent years has lost touch with employees. My co-workers are hard working and strive to get the best out of each student, bottom line is we protect and ensure whatever ground team we support makes it home. I enjoy when a student finally gets the big picture, we train them for the job they have to do downrange."
good,lots of opportunity to grow and if you don't like doing one job there are always others to go try.  really interesting place to work because you get to see all sorts of amazing things.
good,Exciting work place that brings a big name company with a small town feel.  The company encourages self management and gives many opportunities for obtaining new skills.
good,"Very big and diversified company. I loved working for Lockheed Martin; they are one of the best companies when it comes to policies , standards, and engineering processes; which made it a lot easier to document and monitor progress. The only down side is that they quickly hire and quickly lay off outstanding engineers once they detect a market crisis - job security is not highly regarded."
good,My direct manager was outstanding you could go to him for anything and feel as though he has your undivided attention. My coworkers are very knowledgeable and fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job was not having enough time between some classes to prepare for the next class. I enjoyed going to work everyday with the people I worked with.
good,Great stable company to work for with great benefits. Pay for education. Ability to move around within the company because of the size and diversity of the company

At the end of the day, insure all employees have completed their time sheets properly."

Operating and maintained color and black and white printers and performed all finishing services: collating, cutting, drilling, binding, folding and pad making. Performed large format printing. Prepping files, scanned, printed and saved."
good,"Loved the experience and the culture, the people are vey much dedicated to their work and assignments. Although the work environment provided a very productive atmosphere, the contract business can be unpredictable. That's the nature of the beast. "
good,"We would come in to work a little early and drink a cup of coffee and discuss the days agenda.  If we were testing the hot=gas win tunnel. all hand had to be in deck.

good,"Working for Lockheed Martin provided me with an opportunity of a lifetime.  I learned being a housing manager and being the liaison between the contractors and the base CO is more than just being a body.  I was responsible for the comfort and well being of over 500 contractors some with families.  The hardest part of this job was making sure that every ""i"" was dotted and every ""t"" was crossed.  Reports needed to be on point.  Ledgers needed to be legible and accurate.  Housing payments had to be made on time and accounted for.  My housing team and I worked hand in hand in making sure the move in and move out process was as painless as possible.  It was one of the most satisfying jobs I've ever had the privilege to have.  These contractors helped keep out military safe by providing safe housing and safe roads, they built schools and extra curricular activities areas."
good,"A typical day at Lockheed or DFAS consisted of auditing and analyzing different pay accounts to determine what type of disability programs would be the most beneficial to assign retroactively for our members. After that determination, I would calculate retroactive payments or debts back to 2003 and submit my audit and calculation to our quality assurance team. Each case had to be 100 percent accurate prior to being approved. In addition I processed special monthly payments and congressional cases. I learned to be very detail oriented with this job. "
good,Co-workers are the best group I've ever worked with.  I learned the in and outs of buying/purchasing/negotiating/shipping/receiving parts.  The hardest part of the job is when given a requirement last minute that's needed the same day or next day.  The most enjoyable part of the day is finding and purchasing the required parts that are needed next/same day.

Improvements were continual where needed, to include management at all levels. The most difficult aspect of working with Lockheed Martin was obtaining and maintaining an appropriate work/life balance."
good,"While promotions were hard to come by, compensation was very good to reward performance.  I actually miss working there and realize how other companies do not compare in benefits to employees.  Excellent benefits and a great place to work."
good,"Though it provides opportunities to build on previously acquired skills, your position is under constant surveillance and scrutiny by customers and company supervisors. At times it felt like I was being set up for failure by being assigned tasks that required two people. In other words just like any other aviation company, this one will throw you and your family out on the streets with no regards. Like many that have worked there with me, always look for another job because they will terminate you on short notice."

While at Martin, I started as a division secretary, advancing to administrative assistant for the co-leader of the LANTIRN program. Coworkers were a mixture of everyone you could think of from factory floor line workers, to engineers, to planners, program heads, and visiting military personnel. The hardest part of the job could be some tight deadlines and doing things many times over in order to make a presentation perfect for our military customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing we were working for a great company and had pride."

They pay for you to go to college to obtain a degree in a field that they provide. You can also grow with the company and transfer to another position or location afterwards a year. On the management, there are some good management and then there are the ones that don’t want to allow employees to take off for personal reasons. They only think about getting the products out and working their employees to death with no days off. If they can weave those management out then it would be a good department to work in. "

good,Good place to work.  I have learned a significant amount while at Lockheed Martin.  I have seen great managers and those that should never be put in positions that make decisions.
good,"Lockheed Martin  was a very enjoyable place to spend my working hours.  It is obvious that the company puts a high value on work-job balance.  The employees that I met and/or worked with were all very committed, professional and operated as part of a team.  The work that I did for the Director in the Ethics Office taught me a lot about how a professional organization evaluated ethics."
good,"During the most scientific experience that very few individuals can relate too, my education and growth at Lockheed was in the field of science and outer space.  As a senior manufacturing engineer with my problem solving skills, I was drawn on frequently to design clean room facilities capable of assembling satellite's with a .0001 tolerance.  In addition to facilities design, step by step satelite hardware assembly plans were my expertise."
good,The people and management make it a great place to work. I enjoy the challenges presented by working on multiple projects at a time. The senior engineers provide a lot of help and learning opportunities.

good,Most always a day at work typically entailed various work assignments.  Each new day sometimes brought new particulars to the job.  There were never any out of the ordinary problems with your direct supervisor.  The nature of the beast was to successfully complete your work assignment and in 99% of the time it was no problem.  When nearing the end of the shift it was a little harder to stay focused but it was always manged.  When the supervisors said a job well done.
good,"Twenty years ago there seemed to be a good path toward advancement.  In the last few years, there hasn't been much growth opportunity.  Many people retire and their positions aren't replaced.  IT jobs are being added overseas, but not much in Marietta.  "
good,"I have enjoyed my tenure with Lockheed Martin. I've have multiple opportunities and projects along with multiple test and integrations"
good,"I have been employed by Lockheed for less than a year but already feel like this is where I could retire from. My team is diverse and works well together.

My role allows for a lot of flexibility and working remotely which allows for a great work/life balance. I thoroughly enjoy everything about my job! There are plenty of opportunities for training, mentoring, and networking as well."
good,"I worked at Lockheed Martin for a number of years.  I found the staff to be professional as well as management.

good,"It was very Diverse and Dynamic."
good,"I interned at Lockheed Martin a few years ago, as a rising sophomore in undergrad. It was my first internship, but my supervisors were incredibly helpful and made me feel at ease. The job is very variable based on the effort you're willing to put in, but provided you're willing to grind it is immensely rewarding. I was never treated like a child, and I was surprised how much responsibility they were willing to give me."
good,I able to quickly learn my position. I was able to show my ability to improve the work location with new ideas. knee surgery took me out of work for 3 months so I left. I was working this position as a second job at the time.

I enjoyed the culture of integrity and hard work, the close relationship and level of trust developed between Lockheed and the military, and the political and innovative sharpness of senior leadership."
good,Local location in Marietta is always going through downsizing which creates an always changing and challenging workplace. The environment is fun as you work to build some of the best aircrafts the government uses to protect this country. That is something that never gets old.
good,This company rewards those that work hard and complete all of their tasks.  There is upper mobility for all that give 110% and want to move up.  LM does require a lot to be done and therefore it is hard to complete all of the work in a typical 40 hour work week.  Great culture for fairness to all and expects everyone to treat others with respect.  Benefits are great and management has great vision.
good,There is a good collaborative culture there. A teamwork environment. This is my second time working there. This is a great area to live in. I really don't want to leave this job. I am trying to find another position within the company.
good,"I love the fact that most of my Co-Workers are Former Military. It is easy to be around them and they get the Jokes. There are plenty of ""War Stories"" to go around. They make the day go fast and there is always someone to lend a Helping Hand, even when you do not ask."

Relocation to sustain my current employment status would result in a significant personal financial loss."

good,had my own engine dock to work from / learned that working with the government guys you have to pace out your work load to match theirs / work place culture was rather laid back / the hardest part of the job was to slow down / I am a person who believes in getting the job done on time and on budget and earlier if possible /  getting a serviceable asset out the door for the customer was most satisfying of all /
good,"Work days at Lockheed Martin are not stressful, help is always a quick Skype message away, management is very understanding and considerate for personal needs."
good,"Excellent company with good potential for advancement if you are willing to locate in some of the higher population areas like Washington DC, Baltimore, Orlando or Dallas. Limited opportunities internationally. Cost of Meidical/Prescription Benefits have gone up every year now. Work/Life balance can be tough due to demands of high pace contracts. Solid job security  as a performer. The management is more vertical than I prefer as decision making is being pushed higher and higher in the organization. Good job culture overall with challenging assignments and professional colleagues. "
good,Incredibly valuable experience in production finance and supply chain management. Worked in Missile and fire control on the machine floor and in the tool crib doing inventory. Then did inventory reporting and lead stick out analysis for 15 programs. Learned to write macros on my own which was very leverageable.

good,Very good company with good benefits.  I learned how to perform surveillance exams and earned my certification in DOT exams.  The company is exciting and the employees appreciate our clinic and the services we render to prevent the employees from having to make a visit to their primary doctor.
good,Constantly had the opportunity to learn new technologies.  This organization provides the flexibility to delve into problems and to test solutions.  Movement between cross-functional teams was highly supported and beneficial for each projects sucessful completion.

good,"There are tons of things to do at Lockheed Martin and the only reason I would leave is for personal reasons or advancement.  Job security is great for the most part and there are lots of teams to try.  Your schedule is pretty lenient and having every other Friday off is great.  For the most part, they don't like you working more than 40 hours so work life balance is very manageable."

good,"Working for Lockheed Martin I maintained a variety of equipment for the FAA/ CDLS program. I was exposed to a lot of different equipment that came in for repair, checkout, testing or configuration changes.

The overall success of the program was a team contribution but I believed I excelled working independently."

Although the company size might frighten some who think that they may become diluted in a highly expansive workforce, “LM” is always showing me and my family that “we all in this together”. This has made me a more productive engineer and family man. *** WORK LIFE BALANCE *** Assignments have been rigorous and sometimes almost unachievable. However, going into 9 years (sub-contracted and) direct LM employee, I have yet to miss a deadline. The greatest difference in my experience has been my leadership chain. From vice-president down to my Senior Engineering manager, the focus resonates the SAME message. Many of my contracting partners have joked using our LM clichés’. (Sad thing is,… when we actually deliver the message we advertise, the joke is on them). I am proud of our team and company. Our customers are demanding and I respect their tenacity to expect results. This is another reason LM maintains the level of quality and care on each of projects."

As with all of my positions, the working environment was diversified and I enjoyed working with Lockheed.  My manager was a decent person; but the position was 24 x 7 and I was called many times during the night; and there were times I would have to stay during the entire weekend should equipment fail.  My co-workers were mostly men and I developed a respect for them as they did toward me. "

The culture in a big company is a slow pace environment and but it gave you time to really lean the do's and dont's of how a business operates.

The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people. There was no back stabbing, or other tedious stuff going on. Everyone came in, was happy to be there, had their own work to do, mingled during lunch and helped each other. It was a great experience."

good,"Lockheed is a great company to work for is you are hired as a direct full time employee. however over the years as the company has closed programs and let employees go, as well as laid people off, the jobs that were sold to an outside company contract are now treated less valuable and seem to need to utilize their union often to fight for their rights and to keep their jobs. The upper level executives override union agreements and deny employee rights, it has become sad there for many employees and their families."
good,"I could have improved faster, but this company is the epitome of excellence. I had to leave to evolve to my fullest potential though. Definitely the company for hard chargers and aspirations. Great diversity . Great projects and programs to manage. Technologically excellent."

The challenging part of the job was completing the job the next day if it was time to clock out."

good,"Typical Day"

good,I worked here for 6 years in an off-site contract with a University. My duties included supporting an accelerated BSN program as the simulation/ coordinator. I enjoyed this work however the program can not grow large enough to support LM contract and will end in a few months. I have grown and learned more in 6 years and wish to continue my skills and education. LM has offered to support my employment if possible in a LM facility. Lockheed Martin has been the best organization I've worked for.
good,Worked with very many people on many important defense programs. Really enjoyed my time here and learned a lot. Got to help advance many programs to their max potential
good,"I enjoyed interfacing with multiple people in all engineering departments.  Since I was working on requirements documents, I needed information from several sources to write the requirements correctly.  The people I worked with were respectful and if they didn't know the answer they would suggest someone who might.  It was not an easy job, but it was always interesting."
good,"If you want to work on the latest and future technology with the most talented people in the world, this is the place! The only limit to your next patent is your imagination and your ability to present the business case for your innovative concept and/or invention."
good,Great place to work and enjoyed being an ISSO.  I wish I never left.  A typical day is performing audits on systems as an F-35 ISSO.  The ability to gain a wealth of knowledge is a plus.
good,"The typical day consisted of configuring, managing and testing experimental military equipment which was always fun at least to me. All work and data was TS. The culture was slightly cut-throat but the mild competition for tests was part of the fun. Management (at the time) was fair and always willing to listen or help. The hardest part of the job was actually the daily commute. A 15 mile drive to the office where we would then use a work truck to drive between 80-100 miles to the actual work sites. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see and test military equipment before it's finalized."
good,"Lockheed Martin stresses the fundamentals of do what is right, respect others, perform with excellence. This has been ingrained into my daily life even outside of work into my daily life activities. Although no company is perfect I believe Lockheed strives to live to  those fundamentals and provides the warfighter with the best military hardware in the world."

good,"I still actually miss working here, and would happily go back.  Most of my immediate managers were pretty good.  They usually supported you when you needed it, and set you right when you needed it.  In Plant Protection though, there's the problem of upper management.  These guys are literally out to get you, and do NOT work to support you when it's needed.  They only need to prove that they are powerful."
good,"Lockheed Martin is a great company to work for.  Provided lots of opportunities to excel. Flexible hours made for great work/life balance, and pay was very good."
good,"The work env at Lockheed is very supportive and encouraging. I learned a lot and all of my managers were more than willing to help me get ahead.

good,I worked in several different areas there I was hired as a temp through and agency later to get employed by the companies temp department. Then to move on to be a permanent employee. The management team is describable. (Always praising you for your contribution to the company. The hardest part is the temp assignments land you into different areas after you already felt settled with the current employees. But the jobs up side is you get to add a whole bunch of other employees to your friend list.
good,The job and culture is very warm and accepting. I love it here so much! I learn something cool everyday and have the most amazing bosses anyone could ever ask for. I recommend Lockheed Martin as a place to come and make a career here!

good,I was happy to go to work everyday and was always appreciated by supervisors. Had opportunities for advancement. Love the great communication between employees.
good,"A typical day at Lockheed Martin would start off slowly then progressively get busy by the end of the week.  I was very luck to work with people who were very knowledgeable at what they did and was proud of their work.  Employees were easy to work with and did not have a problem, fixing anything that we found not to spec.  Lockheed Martin management was people oriented and easy to talk to.  Management was always willing to work with the employees to fix a problem without being one of those who always wants it their way or no way.  Lockheed Martin workplace has every type of nationality and culture you can imagine.  Through out the years I have had to work the plant by myself, on weekends, but  by the end of the day you would always find away to make it happen. The most enjoyable part of my job was having management acknowledge you for your work well done.   I loved my job and appreciated every minute being a employee for Lockheed Martin."
good,Great internship with real tasks and great people. I was given the opportunity to run meetings and interact with upper management which has helped me build confidence in public speaking.
good,"After 15 years Lockheed decided to only handle contracts that brought in a certain amount of money per contract year.  I worked on a small contract, and although Lockheed didn't accept the contract another year, they had someone working with us and the Navy to find another company who would pick up the contract.  They found an 8A company who would benefit from a contract like the Navy contract"

good,"I worked everyday, i do not let nothing bother me. Managers, Supervisors, Trainees etc, all wants to be the big boss. Some of them take it to the stream with no training at all. I learned a lot at Lockheed, there was nothing hard about the job it gave training. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my paycheck in the bank. If i was still looking for a job i will seek employment at Lockheed."

good,Lockheed Martin is an excellent team to become a part of. They take care of their own which is hard to find in a Fortune 500 company. I would recommend this company to anyone who is serious about honing their craft with state of the art equipment.
good,"My time at Lockheed Martin was one of my best employment experiences. While I worked at Lockheed I was also in the National Guard and was deployed several times. My coworkers and management were very supportive, helping my family while I was deployed and paying the salary differential between my military pay and my Lockheed pay."
good,"Job security is good.  However, job opportunities are better if you are willing to relocate to another state. Multi-tasking is a must do with these jobs.  Have to be able to juggle routine work with special requests from customers, management, and co-workers/subordinates.  I work with some of the best people willing to assist others when and where needed."
good,This was a Great Job. I was working in the Marshall Islands Launching LV-2 Rockets off of Meck Island. Everything was Great for 3 years and Lockheed loss the contract to Orbital Science.
good,"Everyone's really nice . Very lenient with hours, if you need to leave early on a day you can always make it up. They need to get different management."

good,"This is the kind of place for former military folks to thrive and excel in. Exceptional leadership development program. "
good,"Lockheed Martin is BIG, with offices in many states and countries, and many different office cultures. You'll find a suit-and-tie culture around Washington DC, jeans in the western and mountains sates, khakis and button-down shirts throughout.  Production facilities tend to be very deliberate and detail-oriented; as you need to be when your products are those of a major aerospace company. There are also research labs which are more flexible and tolerant of failure, but bring your A-game if you apply."
good,"Flexible work hours and meeting times. Spontaneous and knowledgeable co-workers. Great manager, no micromanaging. Challenges where to meet client expectations."
good,"Good hours , good work environment, and a great learning experience ."

good,cant talk about this place need to know. work day is easy and can be fun. a lot of walking on some shifts (good thing). i like working there.
good,This was a great place to work.  Only reason I left was I was on a contract and working with Active Duty.  I started to miss really serving and decided to join back in the military.  Overall was a great experience working here.  I wish that I would have stayed at times.
good,"A typical day at work was reviewing any comments/concerns made by the Contracting Officer or the Customer, to include LM management.  I was responsible for eight contractors/sub-contractors on eight separate task orders under the A&AS II contract.  I coordinated on hiring and positioning employees in the right billet for task completion.  I interfaced with the contracting office representatives, and ensured our people were meeting or exceeding what was written in the performance work statements.  I learned how to be a more dynamic person listening to both sides of the situation, and collaborating to ensure both sides received what they needed in a timely manner.  LM management is amazing, and they have a well defined support structure.  My co-workers are/were top notch professionals, and we learned and grew from each others strengths and weaknesses.  The people were and are the most enjoyable facet of this position.  A wonderful opportunity."

good,"I enjoyed working with this company, was disappointed when they lost the contract I was working on. Good pay and benefits, very diverse company with great leadership."
good,"Worked on a secured program, but you walked into work feeling like you were making a difference in the world. Management was great at book keeping and very knowledgeable when it came to asking questions. Lots of overtime was offered. Working at the place everyone wants to work at is awesome. Awesome co workers who meant business. The only downfall to this place is the rocky road to gain seniority. When there are ups they are up, but when things go down, without out the seniority you are screwed."
good,Lockheed Martin truly is a place focused on providing excellent services/products to their customers and taking care of their employees.
good,"Did not have issues with the company or co-workers when I left.  Had the opportunity to move to the Government side to make it better for both LM and Government.  Was able to establish processes that we're not there previously and was able to excel and move up the chain while being with LM.  Since I love what I do, there were not many drawbacks.  Working with a diverse set of people was a plus since I'm a people person and working multiple issues at the same time made me happy as it did not get stale or boring."

good,"Lockheed Martin treated their employees very well, and they never were careless in the handling of their employees.  They made sure to hire qualified people for the contract I worked under and then trusted those employees and did not micromanage them.  The only downfall to working for Lockheed Martin is that it is all contract work which depends on the stability of the federal government, so when the government reduced funding to certain programs there were massive layoffs; however, that can not even be blamed on Lockheed Martin.  I would readily work for LM again any day."

good,"My days at Lockheed R & D were usually spent in the CAD room designing and generating drawings for parts and assemblies of a cryogenic cooler.  The design drawings were sent through a release cycle and then to a machine shop, sometimes in-house and sometimes to an outside vendor.  I was responsible for ensuring that the parts were machined correctly and on-schedule, so I often communicated with vendors and the machine shops. I was also responsible for creating BOMs ensuring that all parts, purchased and machined, were accounted for and would be available on time.  Depending on the part, I often participated on the assembly process, occasionally in the clean room, many times learning new skills (i.e., application of epoxy and multi-layer insulation installation). Certain sub-assemblies were sent to appropriate departments to be tested (compression and vibration); I was assigned to be liaison between the departments.  I generated or edited test procedures, coordinated the transport of the items to be tested to and from the test site, enlisted quality control personnel, and oversaw the testing. Sometimes testing had to be scheduled during swing or even graveyard shifts.  Finally, the proper documents  were processed and the parts transported back to our department.  More analyses were performed on failed parts in order to improve the designs.  "

Most of my co-workers were very generous and took an active role in my learning the ""in's and out's."" I had the pleasure of being cross-trained in multiple departments and the opportunity to transfer my location to better serve the key department of which I was employed. That says a lot for a company if they acknowledge the benefit of a versatile workforce and utilize it for their mutual benefit, especially in a manufacturing industry! It has been a great experience working for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control."

This involved removing a lot of wiring and components and replacing with new wiring and components. We also had to terminate wires using various methods; e. g., connector plugs, splices, crimp terminals soldering, and heat shrink splices. Most of the team was made up of former Air Force members like myself, so we had that common cultural background. The hardest part of the job was working in the sometimes extreme weather (heat, cold, rain). We had a good thing going, and I wished it could have lasted longer. But there are only so many C-5s, and when they're all finished, that's the end of the job."
good,This was an outstanding place to work. Very professional management and good working environment with clear goals.I work there under contrac and when it was up the company laid off all the contract workers.

good,"Typical day at work was clocking in on the job assigned to me and producing a final product. I learned many factors in the aerospace industry. The management was not too bad overall but could have some classes to help them talk and interact with employees. Co workers are like any body else, you get along with some and some you dont. Hardest part about job was trying to follow engineering specifications that were inaccurate. Most enjoyable part of the the job was interacting with others and being part of a team that created something to be proud of."

The quality dept. expected original equipment manufacture (OEM) quality when we were basically doing repair work."
good,Fantastic company to work for that allowed for growth and knowledge of multiple aircraft.

good,I started working at Lockheed when I was in my mid 20's. Although I'd been in the workforce for a few years it was my first expose to real professionalism. I'd still be there had it not been for a downturn in the economy in 2001.

good,"First off, you need at least a Bachelors degree to really make any money. The difference between having completed a Bachelors degree and being a few credits away from completion is about 10K. So wait until you complete your college program before applying, a recruiter may tell you the same thing. "
good,With Lockheed I worked the upper forward fuselage on C-5 Galaxy's. While ahead of my work schedule I worked special projects on many of the top secret projects at that time.

I was given professional freedom as well as mentoring when requested.  The jobs were interesting, challenging, and seemed important to Lockheed's mission to our country.  I earned powerful evaluations and recommendations, and after 5 and 15-year absences, respectively, still maintain good relationships with my former Lockheed managers and colleagues."

good,"Almost every day was an opportunity to grow with electronics publications. Most days were event driven. Opportunities for helping others or attending meetings to jointly make decisions over changing systems. "
good,The day starts with a group meeting on what is running in the test lab and what work needs to be done. Every day is different and can change at any time so we are always learning. Management is always willing to help with any issues and my co-workers all help each others and work as a team.
good,It was fun to work and learn about aerostat and avionics. 12 hours daily work  operating cameras and maintaining the system and support equipment. Responding to the  customer for their specific needs and coordinating aerostat  flight operation with the weather situation locally. Work most of the time as a team with co-workers when recovering or lunching the aerostat.
good,I speak from experience. I worked for the company for 7 years. The money was great. The benefits were great. The opportunity was great. I suffered a layoff due to the contract ending. My life hasn't been the same ever since. More companies should treat their employees the way Lockheed does.
good,"A typical day, I walk in around 7:00, sign in, and proceed to find a work order that I can complete. I take the work order and box (if a box is needed) to my desk and begin to work. After I finish, I simply start the process again. There are 2 15 minute breaks and one lunch break. After working Monday through Thursday, you get Friday off and enjoy a three day weekend. On some days there are hour long meetings in which you discuss various ways that you could improve performance or safety hazards, and you get to work with very skilled and professional people. The hardest part of the job is the extreme detail to which you must pay attention to the boards. Every little thing matters, including the ones you don't think matter. The enjoyable part is that the people are nice, the environment is great, the pay is good, and the jobs change so your not bored at all. A great place to work."
good,"Field work in this country was austere. Well as bad as you allowed it. Lockheed continuously supported remote sites with logistic support. The work was interesting as there was never a simple set of duties. Rather you would end up working a multitude of jobs from building your own housing, plumbing, electrical, in addition to your daily duties. The daily duties would often also be varied as you are responsible for your own security, safety, and maintenance to all aspects of your support equipment. Since all sites are remote, the team environment was a site to site issue and landed squarely on the shoulders of the site management, team philosophy, and execution of that philosophy."
good,I was responsible for illustrating and writing tool instruction manuals for the space shuttle program.
good,Great place to work. Military friendly and determined to meet the needs of its clients. I enjoyed at the end of the day when at least one person was helped and made a difference.

The company has exceptionally good training program on how to perform duties in specific classification as well as on the job training from well experience workers. Management for the company is good work well to keep focus on the production and take care of employees needs. As a aircraft mechanic their is many challenging situation that happen on a daily bases like troubleshooting a system error of the aircraft a few hours before a scheduled flight. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving those problem and figuring out how to accomplish those hard to do task in the proscribed time."
good,"Windmill International is the Subcontractor to Lockheed Martin (LM)"
good,"A compassionate company that seeks regular feedback from employees.   Each of my managers and directors were personally aware and atune to their employees concerns.  "
good,"It's just basic logic; you can make money contracting for the government, but you will not become #1 if you don't take care of your people. Lockheed was named the #1 Info Tech contractor to the US Government for 20 years running.  It's not rocket science... but there ARE quite a few rocket scientists that work there."
good,"Sikorsky is a globally positioned company.  They look inward to promote before going outside. Every Employee is offered 100% re-imbursed Education with a passing grade.  You can take part in all of the company sponsored seminars even if they don't pertain to your arena.  They have a great Employee Medical Plan, with Personal Time off if deemed necessary.  They have a wonderful up to date medical facility.  In my instance, I enjoyed the work I did so it made it a very pleasant environment.  Management always acknowledged their employees.  I would still be working there today but decided to marry after 26 years of work and relocate to the west coast of Florida.  Unfortunately Sikorsky is actually on the East Coast, but too long a compute for me."
good,Lockheed Martin is an excellent company to work for and would hope to continue working for them if there were anything available in the Atlanta or Raleigh area.
good,"A typical day was busy with phone calls, equpment management, inventory control, procurement and material pick up.  I learned so much from the great team I was privileged to work with.  My co-workers were a strong team and we had some great times doing work for all the wonderful military and civilian workers here at the Pentagon.  The hardest part of my job was the various locations involved in managing all the materials and equipment as there were several off site locations that we mantained.  The most enjoyable part was I truly cannot remember a time when I felt so much a part of a team effort."
good,"Love the people and the culture.  Lockheed promotes growth and advancement and will provide the necessary tools to acheive it.  Mangement recognizes their talent and support employees.  This is a learning and growing enviroment."
good,"Great place to work.  I was always learning new skills and given the opportunity to take a new projects with new challenges.  Able to work with different teams and create many relationships with engineers throughout the program.  A typical day at work recently has been testing new software, logging into the system (opening multiple unix windows and checking out processes running on servers), testing each software GUI and trying to find issues with the system (from simple to complex issues), document the issues in the discrepency system, attempting to troubleshoot each issue in order to provide greater detail for a fix to the software developer.  For complex issues we generally discuss the issue as a team and try to figure out the best solution based on the full picture (taking all things into consideration because it is a very complex system).  I have recently learned more about Linux Redhat, AIX, LDAP, IBM MQ, etc.  My coworkers are great people and incredibly smart.  The hardest part of my job is getting others on board with the priority of an issue.  The most enjoyable part of my job is a quiet day testing the system and finding issues.  The best part big picture is seeing it all come together and you can see the system get better and better and knowing that you were apart of that evolution."

The hardest but also most rewarding  part of my employment with LM was learning new techniques and applications, new materials and installation processes and accountability procedures"

I particularly loved working for this ""family oriented"" firm because of their business ethics, integrity and high expectations.
