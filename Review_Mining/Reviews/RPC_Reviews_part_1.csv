rating,review
bad,"This place is by far the worst place to work at, they have this individuals at lead positions and their main function is to get you wrote up for any reason, selfish people that think by steping on other people ( especially the temps) so they can make themselves look good. Forget about the company, the product, the workers, is all about the leads trying to move up all means necessary."
bad,Working with RPC is stressful they over work you and don’t pay enough nor do you have any family time!! They over work you and  expect  Lot more then they ask
bad,I was hired then laid off within a month because they could not find work for me to do when I was under the impression I would be there full time running heavy equipment.
bad,"After working my hardest and learning new and exciting technologies at RPC, there began a period of turnover and employees loss.  In a 5 month period I worked 55 to 60 hours a week to keep things running and our internal customers served.  All this to be laid off a week before Christmas.  I do not recommend this company at all.  They do not care about you, nor the the sacrifice and commitment you bring or your loyalty."
bad,"1 hr feels like 1 day working in rpc. Thats not that bad but when you have 5 inches of snow already on the ground and 3 more expected to fall, they should not expect their employees to drive there for 13$ a hr and thats before taxes. An average running employee car can go from 1,000-50000$$. That would take a minimum of ten 12 hour shifts to replace the cheapest car. Im upset once i found out as a employee that i do not get any sick or vacation days. Overtime kicks in this week and im gonna have to use a unpaid sick day and miss out but not due to health issues. Talked to 6 different people to find this information out. Definitely do not recommend this place at any means"
bad,"Not a bad job, if trained. Agency workers paid a week off as and when and replacement agency workers, they won’t commit to FT contracts"
bad,"My take on this job is it is ok, to pass the time by, it could be ran in a different way as far as management but it is privately own so that makes a difference, they don't have a over head so things can be ran as they want under certain guidelines."
bad,12 hour shifts.  Bosses yelling at people.  Making bad parts.  Everyone wants to leave.  Workers are being replaced with people from Germany and letting American worker go.
bad,"I applied with this company and filled out the packet and later on I got a call by them asking me if I had my application. I left the application with the recruiter and it had my account numbers, SSN and other personal information and then the recruiter told me that maybe the cleaning crew found it. WHAT? I had to change my bank account, cancel all my automatic bank drafts for utilities, fuel, credit cards etc.. Total incompetence."
good,"Ich betreue 30 verschiedene Produktionanlagen und Vormontagen meine täglichen Arbeiten sind die Wartung, vorbeugende Instandhaltung und Reparatur von Getrieben , Motoren und dem Komplettaufbau von Produktionsanlagen .Wir sind auf 3 Schichten ein 2 Mann Team die sich untereinander gut verstehen und bei Lösungssuche sehr gut ergänzen . Leider sind wir 364 Tage im Einsatz aber jeden Tage lerne ich was neues ."
good,"it is an okay experience, but once you have done your three months of working and want to become permanent with the company. They won't make you permanent, they fire you because you are just a temporary employee!"
good,People i work with were brilliant but some managers were a bit aloof and never asked for any employees in put or advice . I liked the 12 hour shifts especially nights
good,I divided my role between the Managing Partner/Head of Insurance and a partner in the property and casualty department.  This was a varied role.  I was recruited into this role by the previous PA.
good,"Good people to work with, however, there is no training by management and some times they leave you to figure things out without giving you any help."
good,"I could develop my knowledge in costs. My team was friendly and helped me to grow in my Accounting professional path, my stay in this company was for a year only because I got into HSBC next year. For been a newspaper do not have to many opportunities of growth in accounting area. But was important in my career."
good,RPC did what they stated they would do. Pay was always on time. 
good,"Gostava muito de trabalhar nessa empresa , porem o horario de trabalho era ruim"

good,"Cudd is a great company to work for, I have been with them for many years. I have learned a lot of great information and met a lot of wonderful people that will continue to grow from their experiences as well."
good,"Great place to work at i workd there under randy mills and i mean the guy knew his job and i performed well and was gradually learning, but not to his liking i believe i wasnt at the speed he was looking for but it would be great to get rehired."
good,Preparing for work day gathering all material and power tools. Make sure all paper work and saftey procaution is notated. Every day there is something new to learn at work. The management is wonderful.
good,My task was to attend to customers when they walk into the print room.Answer phione call and attend to any queries that they may report.Book for engineers to attend to any machines that will develop faults.
good,A typical days work during the wet season was mainly lawns and gardens maintenance. And during the dry season we mainly did landscaping. I had a good crew to work with and a .top boss. It was a very rewarding job were I learn't of new skills and enjoyed going to work everyday.
