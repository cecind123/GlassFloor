rating,review
bad,"the company has no leadership, too many politics.  "
bad,"Excellent workplace to work"
bad,good working place
bad,Dysfunctional environment. Senior Management lacking standards and professionalism. Organizational planning and design was subject to constant change.
bad,"The hiring process mentioned having a mentor and a transfer of info from the project manager. Nothing could be further from the truth ... you are brought in, thrown to the sharks and reprimanded when going to your manager with concerns."
bad,Little opportunity for growth.  Fragmented organization with very little structure.  No consideration of work life balance although talked about often.
bad,"Most of the products delivered regarding feature functionality, the management was constantly in flux (from the CEO all the way down to my direct manager) and then when my manager left, they did a bad job of backfilling and all the sudden the job went from decent to terrible overnight. They didn't care when I brought it up to upper management and the team was in total disarray when I left."
bad,"Management has no plan, focus or objectives. No growth in revenue in years  and no real plan to grow.  Lots of flowery words but no real plan.  Look else where or you will be disappointed"
bad,Mid managers would walk on the backs of lower managers and employees.  When you would try to bring it up to HR they would just turn the other way.  Not a great company to climb in.  Shaddy management.
bad,"Boring work place, Bad Managers who feel themselves as CEOs. Bad work culture and so much work pressure."
bad,"Juniper had an exciting, fast paced corporate culture with many intelligent, passionate people. People were put in management positions who were technical but have no soft skills. As a result a lot of top talent was lost. The NOC's were also greatly understaffed leaving many engineers with 50-70 active cases to work. This was on some of the newest technology. Engineers told me it was impossible to meet SLA's because they couldn't follow up on open cases in a timely manner let alone work on hot issues."
bad,Not female friendly at all. Women are being scrutinized existentially over male counterparts under new management. Prior to that I was thriving in job
bad,Juniper is plagued by mediocre management with lack of management skills. The work culture is very isolated and employees don't feel they are part of the team culture.
bad,"Silo management leads to poor communication of departmental goals and objectives. Poor decisions cannot be challenged as employees will be reprimanded for not following instructions. Limited career growth, low to no annual raises and poor work/life balance impact morale and lead to turnover and dissatisfied employees"
bad,CEO trying to transition company into a software only model and it isn't working. Juniper is now missing the rev numbers for 2 quarters in a row.  Theres no reality based plan to move from being primarily a Networking HW company to being a Cloud SW company. Most folks are just worried about all the layoffs and not really focused on what the VP's or Execs are talking about. There's too many Upper Mgmt types that are all ego and no substance and its dragging down the employees who actually do the work.
bad,"Maintenance Tech, the day can vary from painting, to HVAC repairs, setting up for corporate meeting, changing filter on HVAC units, HVAC round, we have 6 building to maintain"
bad,This company is huge and does not have the fun perks of many startups. Day to day life is a massive land of cubicles.
bad,Hectic to work as there is no stopping to the work. The more u do the more is expected from you to deliver. Never satisfied by the work done by an individual. we get the freedom of flexible work time and work from home but the work culture and management is not up to the mark.
bad,Behind the competition but great networking product company. They need to invent and innovate to catch up with companies like Cisco and HPE.
bad,Too many processes and meetings. Meeting at night or early mornings due to cross sites branches. Work hours are not very flexible.
bad,"This is highly regarded in the routing and switching field not just because of their founders or initial success but also because of the talent pool they have. Instead of picking the right person to lead, they pick the yes man or woman and it' sonly downhill from there."
bad,"Too many managers in different locations. The culture is one based on fear rather than collaboration."
bad,Great place to meet people and make great work connections. Unfortunately the work place doesn't foster growth or job skills.
bad,Nice people to work with but top management does not seem to know where to go. No clear commitment to the plans and  takes forever to make any decision.
bad,Need to make other locations belong to ONE company - not just a west coast company
good,"I was an intern here worked for 9 months. Work was ok . ..intally they paid 26000rupee/ month. However Juniper networks india private limited the story is completely different....Bangalore office is full of Brahmins,Tamils. idiotic senior managers, who don't care about young intern turned contract employees."
good,"a good company to work. it was fun. I made good friends and learnt a lot about new technologies. Campus facilities are good, they have proper cab facility."
good,Some really good things about Juniper are the peers you work with.  Really bad things are things are the miss management at the VP Level.  VP did not empower people to make decisions and did not outline clear levels of responsibility.  A lot of long time employees who created a clique and not open to change.
good,Strong engineering team but company is led by engineering leadership rather than business leadership. Time to market is slow and growth is flat to slightly negative. Overall relaxed environment but opportunities to grow are limited.
good,"Juniper has lot of talent, many experts working in silos. What drives me is to get together cross functional teams to achieve a common goal of getting things done"
good,"Getting anything done there is comparable to moving and aircraft carrier.  Leaders, on a global level, have archaic ideas and strategies.  Political infighting and maneuvering.   Seems like the old guard is putting their own survival ahead of what the company really requires."
good,"Hardest and most challenging part of the job"
good,"Juniper - terminated me after 11 years , 2 days after I had come back from medical leave.  "
good,"juniper pay is better than average.  company performance in the market is mediocre.  stock price hasn't moved in 20 years."
good,"Commoditized industry with little room for creativity. I found management always spoke of taking risk, but it was never implemented. There wasn't consensus amongst management, so the major business groups were constantly on different pages."
good,"Historically a hardware company with most revenue in routing, the company now has switching and security products and network management as well. Transition to cloud-based services and virtual equivalents of hardware products has been a challenge. In the last five years, layoffs have been numerous as strategies shift. Lots of turnover at all levels of management, but still not enough in some areas."
good,"kind of relaxed environment, good live/work balance. however, management is bad. almost everything needs to be escalated in order to get a solution. Don't see the responsibility there. It was like this when I was hired 10 years ago."
good,"Previously worked at NetScreen Technologies - security appliance company that was acquired by Juniper. During this time, Juniper was acquiring several companies to improve its security technologies."
good,Juniper provides a good working environment that is structured yet flexible enough to be successful. I continued my learning curve on eLearning tools and effectiveness. Building the Pre-sales virtual labs from the ground up for the WW Channel Partners was particularly rewarding. This type of real-time learning environment was new to Juniper and has since been incorporated into their Learning Academy Program.
good,Stress free work and can work independently. Have flexibility to work from home. Good compensation and additional benefits. Locations is remotely located
good,"Work life balance it s less  compare to other organisations in the same domain. "
good,The workplace is nice and people there are friendly and very helpful. Easy access to public transportation. We get big discounts at the cafeteria and access to their gym.
good,There are big problems at management and executives level. This company needs a visionary that can lead it out of the mud.
good,"â€¢	Fifteen (15) years of experience in Systems Engineering, Technical Sales Support with expertise in managing large-scale projects of IP convergence (Data Network, video, VoIP, UC&C, Cloud SDN)"
good,Their Massachusetts facility has gone from a good place to work to a sweat shop. With lots of infighting especially at the managerial level.
good,"Appreciated the opportunity to engage with those around the globe. However, the hours this required were often very long exceeding 80 hours a week. Everything was a priority and nothing was ever removed from the priority list. Women are not well represented in leadership positions from director on up. Talented women are driven out through exclusion."
good,Juniper has a strong engineering  culture and many smart engineers.  Juniper has many informal meeting and beer bashes that help building a strong culture. There is also a strong focus on 1on1 meetings that helps getting the organization aligned.
good,"It is tough to advance at Juniper, with constant layoffs and little opportunity with other positions it makes it difficult to stay happy.  Management is always angry and not there to migrate into the Juniper culture.  Everyone is there to benefit themselves and not the organization."
good,"Flexible work hours. Good challenging work. Good people."
good,"Juniper is always looking for opportunity to make money, by doing so they always exploring new ideas trying beat the competition. This at times leads to overwhelm workload with a very short deadline."
good,"Being a product based company No career growth but cool place to work with good perks."
good,"good wfh options."
good,Juniper is a solid company with many challenges in an evolving business environment. Their challenge is the ability and willingness to evolve the company strategy rapidly.
good,"It was good working at this company. My first job. I started my Order management career from here. The pay and the benefits were really good - than I expected. "
good,Juniper is one of the big company. so the culture is big company culture. but the job is relatively stable than cisco and some startups.
good,"Enjoyed the work at Juniper environment it is the process oriented, learned some new technologies and friendly nature of people."
good,"Every I learned new things and enjoyed the worked and trained new trainees and the management gave us a an opportunity to innovate new things and rewarded us and encouraged by giving cash price."
good,"I didn't really get good encouragement /  training to perform. Much of the time, I was idle and trying to figure out the things. "
good,"The Company looks at everything with an eye towards innovation and engages in frequent group-thinks to strategize collaboratively on the innovation challenges we face as a company."
good,Great technical environment with good people.  Juniper does give a level of autonomy to lead projects and decision making.  Juniper is very customer focused.
good,"The company has always been focused on this market and it remains to break the chain. The security market is the company continues to focus on to deploy software-based products which seem to be picking up tractions, after a 3 year period."
good,culture is not attractive.  Job advancement is limited. Top management is not fit. Innovation is taking the back seat. Company is losing the edge to competition.
good,Work day was busy with most interactions done via email.Had the opportunity to manage my programs and projects with limited oversight. Juniper employees are generally very professional and are great to work with.
good,"Overall supportive environment. Bureaucratic, but to be expected from a large company. Bottom line emphasis on numbers and ROI."
good,"It was a fun place to work. Great work-life balance. "
good,Was included in the team effort starting from day one and worked with team. Was able to learn and understand the product details and their modules.
good,"Depending on the current job requirement, the day can wary appreciably. I have been with Juniper for 7 years and I have found it to be very supportive to employees' career and intellectual growth."
good,"Good company trying to do too much too fast. They spent quite a bit of R&D dollars building products without a customer base resulting in great products with no home and quality issues for legacy products. Currently refocusing on quality and cutting on excess product lines. However, it will be a few years before Juniper is back in the growth stage."
good,Fun work place but company has been stagnant for quite sometime. Some there is no growth for employees. Revenues are declining and management is not clear about product roadmap.
good,Lots of processes to created and implemented. Very much focused on how the develop better products from an engineering perspective. Lots of changes on the company culture.
good,"My team at Juniper is an enthusiastic group of talented engineers.  Unfortunately, many of us run into a very familiar situation:  There is no room for advancement, no formal mentor program and no formal succession planning."
good,Tested new network built boards and debug the failed ones to componet level. It fun to work for this company and the maagement are nice to their workers.Co-workers are also good people to work with and I enjoy my work with this company.
good,"Like any other job, work environments  depends on you manager and customers. JNPR have  excellent benefits. It boils down to the person you report to."
good,Outstanding technology and product development program. Service Provider market execution is great. Sales strategy and channel for the enterprise market is weak and inconsistent.
good,"Handling routers and devices offshore. For clients using the devices and application. Working on remotely for user device."
good,"Juniper is an awesome company to work. The work life balance is the best in the industry and people are here for the long haul. "
good,"My role is to manage a services team in support of a large cloud provider.  Juniper is a relationship run organization.  Getting things done is more a result of relationship and influence than process and job title. Because of this everything needs to be driven by you.  you cannot rely on process to work completely."
good,Good Work Culture. Competative salary. Awesome Job Culture. I would love to join them as a full time employee. They should conversion rate for Interns.
good,"I spend my days managing NEBS GR-63 related projects from P0 to production development stages. Planning, scoping and executing is the name of the game.  I find enjoyment in being a solutions driven individual. "
good,I started out as a contractor and within 2 months I was hired to build the PMO and all its processes. I participated in all hiring of PM candidates and acted as a mentor for them - challenging in a dynamically changing environment.
good,I really loved that job for the first year and a half. Then they changed systems and everything went downhill. No one had a clue how to run the new system and it was really just put on us to learn. Complete chaos and the job that I had turned into a job for 5 people because of the slowness of the new system.
good,"Juniper pays for performance. No work/life balance. 12-14 hour days very common.  Management very hands off, run your business and you will make money.  Great people, really smart.  CEO is trying to move company in the right direction to grow.  If they could get work/life balance correct, would be one of the best places to work."
good,"The compensation at Juniper is one of the highest in the Silicon Valley...but for me it was long hours, including spotty hours on weekends. Also, during weekdays, I had to rotate every week with being on conference calls with Bangalore which were early in the morning PST or late at night PST...every week."
good,"The position required knowledge of supply chain and demanded instant results which were given."
good,"I am NEVER going to recommend using Indeed.com as a place to search for work you make job seekers go through this review process.  Applying for work is stressful enough as it is.  When you force job seekers to go through a review process, that really doesn't help."
good,"Working with multiple job sites, long days to coordinate. Good benefits and salary. Flex hours depend on manager. Some groups work from home, others have managers insisting they come for 8 hours to work and watch the clock."
good,Upper management is looking for ways to cut costs.  Innovation is there but it will effect your work/life balance.  Friendly work environment.
good,"Completing calendar scheduling, checking email, working with customers and open to anything else that anyone should need."
good,I joined Juniper as a software Engineering director. I got to manage teams which were geographically distributed. Management job at Juniper was fun. Along with that you will get to do and learn lots of new technologies.
good,"Juniper networks generally speaking is a fair place to work. It depends on your manager. Company policy is good, but manager may not that good. So it's all depends."
good,"Before the entire department was let go, I worked alongside other inside sales teams as our field account managers went on appointments that we scheduled. I gained so much experience working as a team, building the channel, and learning a full sales cycle within the networking industry."
good,"moving from a hardware based to service/subscription base has put pressure on the financials and the management. In my two years there were two major re-rogs, but more stable than cisco"
good,"Challenging environment. Great learning experience and work balance culture. "
good,"Management did not have as much backbone as I would have liked, however, if one was successful at accomplishing goals, one could be quite oblivious to all the negative energy that was present in some departments.  The company was very focused on wooing summer interns on board to assure there was a fresh approach to the company's overall success.  Unfortunately, the senior (age wise) personnel took a hit, as well as a back seat to these new recruits.  They were ignored and poorly paid no matter whether they were overachievers, or average workers.  Management had goals that had to be met - so there were areas that were quite cutthroat.  Overall there were benefits that would somewhat make up for those that were put at the bottom of the barrel, however it isn't an environment that encourages older personnel to desire a continued career with the company."
good,"It's been great working in a company like Juniper Networks, there's a lot to learn  about its products and services, the management and the way they do things. Everyday is a learning process and there are bad days as well as good days. "
good,"1)Juniper network culture is very good "
good,Good company to work for.  Decent benefits. Came across few individuals who were extremely professional and dedicated towards their work.  It was inspirational to meet such colleagues.
good,"good perks for interns"
good,"Big company, relatively stable. good compensation and benefits."
good,"Good, Productive, flexible working hours..good work culture."
good,"Full of projects and new innovation initatives"
good,"Dynamic environment "
good,"I had hands on experience with new technology systems while working there, as well as good exposure to senior management. The work place has great set up and great facility. There's no strict Work Life balance, they give more important to results than your personal life."
good,"Nice place to work. Good benefits and WFH available."
good,Good company in the process of many internal changes as of the Summer 2014
good,"Really good place to work, nice work culture and good people around."

good,Learned a lot. worked with bleeding edge technologies.
good,Excellent Company to work for.
good,Great place to start your career at. Your Learning Curve is very high. Working under across platforms help you gain good understanding of the product end to end
good,"Terrible salary and training for newer employees. When I joined this was still BTI Systems. Management was bad, CEO kept changing but no major changes in working style."
good,"No doubt - JNPR is a great company to work. The benefits are good. The culture is so-so; the folks don't want to share what they know. Good engineers, and managers are not bad either"
good,"Its really good place to work, its bit difficult to balance work and personal life. Major concern is no job security in this company. There are lot of layoff being happened... look will happen in future."
good,Juniper Networks is a great place to work with very talented engineers who are passionate about their work and technology.
good,I strongly recommend Juniper Networks as a great place to work with. Excellent work and life balance. I enjoyed working with the managers in Juniper. The process is very streamlined and methodical.
good,"Juniper is fair place to engineer,but the problem is that there are too many managers,and a few of them have no idea on how to manage the team,also the some department changes the director to frequently ,that is the thing which high level boss need to fix ."
good,"Culture is like a large startup. "
good,"benefits good, fairly relaxed environment, good salaries paid, multi-cultural environment, flexible working hours.  Option to work from home on occasion.  Bonus and ESPP stock plans."
good,"A typical day is very much the same where the work is outlined clearly and things are very much planned in advance."
good,It was a good place to work. Unfortunately the company was struggling and they are always cutting workforce to make bottom line. they have cut a ton of quality people over the years.
good,Juniper is good place to work. They are trying to provide a balance workplace. I do not not my commute hours but that is part of Silicon Valley working conditions
good,"Pros:"
good,It was a typical day work.. learnt Sap SD. and many transaction codes for sap basis administration. As sap is an ERP it was nice to work on it.

good,"My project is super cool, lots of freedom & working on cutting edge stuff. But management has no clue how to do this or what to do with it. So lots of uncertainty all the time."
good,"Juniper is a great company for work/life balance. They allow flexible schedules and encourage you to pursue your passions beyond the company. Overall, it has been a good experience."
good,"open to improvement ideas and the exec level. "
good,Enjoyed working with the people and enabled myself to expand my career knowledge.  Company needs to balance product knowledge transfer to regional personnel in providing appropriate product target market areas.
good,"Really enjoyed the work culture, quality of people and products. But company is going through transition and stability could be an issue."
good,"Though it was disorganized and mismanaged, I enjoyed working with Juniper's Marketing group as a Senior Product Marketing Manager. I felt the focus on certain areas could have been thought out better by the leadership, however, for me, personally, it was a great experience."
good,Juniper Networks is a very good place to work.  Management was supportive as were my peers.  My positions challenged in a very positive ways and enabled me to grow professionally.
good,"Performed support on Junipers Ex product line."
good,Been working at Juniper as Security for quite some time and its been a honer and privilege working with the security team here and seeing great minds of innovation at Juniper.
good,"in general better than most of the company I worked before."
good,I am only called if any problem detected during testing and the test team feels the problem may be at the firewall blocking the traffic. Very little work to add more features and capabilities to it. Check devices if they have mal function so do RMA. Basically a baby sitting job.
good,"Excellent job culture, eminent management and great work life balance. Thoroughly enjoyed working in Juniper Networks. Rewarding  career with challenging work keeps you completely updated with current technologies."
good,Been with Juniper for 9 years because of the people and culture.  Can't imagine working anywhere else.  People are great and work/life balance is highly recommended by the company.
good,"Good work, nice people, strong industry, nice campus.  Stock comp has been low, but pay OK.  Sometimes it can be hard to get stuff done as not everyone is aligned or willing to listen"

good,Its an exciting place providing lot of different opportunities and growth options within the company.
good,"My typical work day requires office maintenance, filling paperwork, scheduling appointment's, redirecting calls, and making sure invoices go to the correct department. "
good,One of the best paces I have worked. I had great management and very flexible working environment.
good,Had a great manager and mentor. Enjoyed working with managers and VPs across R&D groups. Good people. Good culture generally speaking...................this was all true during my time at Juniper: 2013 to 2016.
good,"The company is not looking to become a bigger brand globally. I have worked in this company for almost 6y now and in different busines units and different regions, yet I feel that the culture is only good in USA"
good,Company offers good benefits and generally treats employees well. Mixed feelings about what is presented about the results of the company and what is presented to the market.  Seems less that clear or al
good,"Most presales engineers are teleworkers which offers many benefits and flexibility.  A typical day involves working with the sales team on current opportunities or identifying new ones.  Other activity involves managing existing customer relationships.  Iâ€™ve learned a lot not only in the evolving DC networking space, but also the campus and service provider space.   Juniper is an engineering company and the culture reflects this. The most difficult aspect of working at Juniper is understanding the broad portfolio offerings around enterprise, security, and service providers.  While this can sometimes be challenging, it was  also very rewarding and challenged everyone to be the best."
good,"Juniper is a mid size organization, offering a balance between working for a large company and a startup."
good,"A good place to work. Fast paced. Good management team."
good,"The job is great as far as benefits and compensation go.  I made a lot of lifelong friends at Juniper, as well.  However, there is a lot of job displacement to India and it is clear in the last 5 years that cheap labor is priority over quality.  US hires are rare, and if US employees leave the company, they are replaced by headcount in India.  Most recently, there was a layoff which only affected US Employees.  Many people are leaving the company willingly now, and many people are unfortunately unhappy with upper management.  I will miss Juniper, but it is being terribly mismanaged, unfortunately."
good,"The typical day in my work experience is handle India tax processing ."
good,"Offered me ample opportunity to sharpen my skills and grow a software professional. Also, offered a very conducive environment to work as a team and work life  balance."
good,"Good flexible  work and Good management but work safety will not believe."
good,"I start my day at work with a coffee and reviewing my emails, searching for bugs or enhancement requests that require documentation updates. Move on to tasks that I am already working on such as release-specific documentation, updates for existing issues, and other initiatives."
good,Understands the employee employer relationship. Management understand how to get the most out of their employees.  Layout process is well thought out.
good,"great company to get your foot in the door of networking, good training, and close team interaction. enjoy working on their product line.unique architecture."
good,"Have over 7 years experience in software testing, Software development and Network analysis, support and enhancements for the multi projects wide bug tracking, code review, test case running and bug verification, demonstrated in problem solving, network troubleshooting/debugging and test planning and project management, always be an active member team and contribute to the implementation, testing and customer delivery."
good,"Pros - lower management is very connected with what is going on and they really care. "
good,"good leadership - they genuinely care about the employees.  Strategy is landing,"
good,"Overall Juniper is a great place to be, with an incredibly nurturing environment for both personal, and professional growth. Having no prior knowledge of the IT industry was not an issue as there is plenty of on the job training. It is one of the best team atmosphere's I have ever been a part of. Management leaves something to be desired. A majority of the job is cold calling and prospect finding. The one avenue everyone uses seems to utterly ineffective and oversubscribed. ""Call Blitzes"" only anger potential customers, and damage our image in the minds of end users."
good,I joined the company through 2 acquisitions within 5 months. I was doing revenue recogniztion and worked with a great team.
good,"Good manager, helping colleagues, new project, cafeteria set up, new vendors introduced, clients, employees engagement programs accomplished. Had problems at initial stages in operations of cafeteria but it was getting streamlined with help of my Managers assistance."

We truly care about our customers and their success and we are given freedom and encouraged to deliver the best experience possible to them."
good,"Management is good"
good,"Juniper is reinventing themselves to be a prime SDN, security company. With excellent technology. Lots of training opportunities. Ability to work from home"
good,"Great place to work, good work life balance even though you work US timings some time, top management was very helpful , Growth opportunity may be limited"
good,"Lots of challenges work life balance good benefits "
good,"The company culture is fairly open and collaborative. A little startup like. However, they still have cubicles and for some teams, the manager and the team don't sit together. Which makes it tough to collaborate with a busy manager. In my experience, there are some really smart and enthusiastic people working at Juniper Networks, however, in some teams, you struggle to find the right guidance to learn taking first steps. Basically, weather you adjust well or not depends largely on the team."
good,Juniper is a great place for networking enthusiasts. It has some of the best talents in the industry. Also their pay is quite competitive in the bay area.
good,I work from home and have a great work/life balance.  Management is very supportive of the employees.  Juniper culture is excellent and very friendly.

good,"Excellent place to work. Great colleagues. Great technology to learn. "
good,"At one point, Juniper made great routers, but with expanding into the Enterprise and Security, they've lost their focus. It was a fun place to work and provided good solutions, but lacked the brand recognition in the Enterprise market."
good,it is overall a good place to work. The people working here are friendly and are willing to share information. There are lots of indian co-works as the company itself is founded by an Indian.
good,"Juniper HK located in Taikoo Plaza, closed to mtr"
good,Juniper give employee very flexible work hour and good compensation.  Work force structure are rigid which do not allow employee explore pursuit a right place to fit his skill set.
good,Good company and talented people around. Professional Environment. Work Life balance is there. Target oriented work culture.
