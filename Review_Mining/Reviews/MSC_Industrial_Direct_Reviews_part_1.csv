bad,"This is a private company that masks as a public company."
bad,"Being a top performer makes no difference to these uneducated supervisors. The men tend to favor young females with little or no MRO experience. If a jealous employee complains of a top performer like a first-grader, HR steps in like they have no other work but to ruin the life of the person to which the complaint was directed."
bad,"Maintenance , Horrible bunch of liars . Columbus Ohio is a 52 million dollar cfc that is BOUT to be sold . Build you up with lies of advancement.Pay is minimal"
bad,I'd advise everyone to stay away from this company. Upper management will always be out to get you. Instead of promoting they hire from the outside instead of someone knowledgeable within the company. Favoritism is a huge problem. HR is useless even the HR that came from NY headquarters was useless. Upper management just wants their huge incentive from the work we do. They don't care for their associates unless they're in their inner circle. Anything that is and sounds stupid make sense to them. Overall horrible place to work and be. I'd explain more but I'd go on forever. The company should just be shutdown really.
bad,"If you want to work for someone who MICRO MANAGES YOU TO DEATH!  Or till you want to quit!  This is the place for you!!  Management is a joke!  If you go on FMLA for yourself or a family member,  the HR Benefits manager looks at you like you are some sort of alien!!!  WHAT A Junk PLACE!!!  "
bad,"The associates are difficult to work with. Management is lacking in listening skills."
bad,"Good benefits decent pay. "
bad,"Very depressing place to work.  Upper management makes poor decisions and all associates pay the price. People being let go on a regular basis.   Pay is mediocre as are the  benefits. For the past several years the company has not done well financially and so increases have been cut as well as bonuses.  Departments have been outsourced, branches closed which will continue. They promote and reward those that go along with what upper management wants despite not having the skills and despite their obvious lack of integrity or ability to maintain confidentiality."
bad,"This company lack clear direction, They only want you to sell metalworking supplies, They say they want MRO business but do not know how to get it. If you like micro management and working in CRM ( saleforce) then you will be right at home here. Paper work is more important than sales results. Do not expect a raise and the commission is poor."
bad,"If I knew what I know now about this job I would've stayed away from this place. Management is the worst. My supervisor doesn't know anything about nothing, and it seems as if management is aways out to get you. They're always waiting for you to slip up at anytime. They lie and say we're improving but when it comes time to incentives the pay out is not what they explain it out to be. Management also spread rumors with associates. Favoritism is high as well. If you're not 'liked' sort-of-speak then you're on their hit list. They micromanage like crazy so don't try to even help another associate they will accuse you of talking and slacking off. It's just a horrible place in general."
bad,The culture they are trying to obtain is so unreachable. The culture is anything but positive.  Hidden agendas' and keeping good face to make management look good is the main focus.  Everyone is afraid to tell corporate anything that goes on. Middle management's favorite seasoned employees basically do nothing all day. Don't have any time left to call off to look for another job.
bad,"The customer fulfillment center in Mableton Ga. is the most dysfunctional and improperly run warehouse it has been my experience to be a part of. The hourly associates are hired with no discernible skills or desire to work and most would have trouble working the order counter at a fast food establishment. Hourly associate turnover rates are incredible despite the amount of money the company throws at the associates in hourly pay rates, incentives and other compensation. The warehouse management system (WMS) is archaic and there is no one at the company, in any CFC or corporate office, that fully understands how it works. Training for new hires is near non-existent and the amount of internal problems created by the lack of training with a total lack of accountability for the hourly associates causing the problems is staggering. A customer ordered a name brand drill and received toddlers pajamas (the company does not sell toddlers pajamas, the pajamas were a personal item belonging to a packing associate). Customers routinely get wrong items or wrong quantities. The company spends large amounts of money in improvements but usually every improvement is only half completed. As it was said by a member of upper management about the Fortna system after it's completion, ""we spent 12 million for this, too bad we don't know how to use it"". Upper management micro-manages every aspect of daily work to the point of causing health issues for the supervisory staff and has little to no respect for it's supervisor staff. Human resources has no respect for supervisors. The company is so leery"
bad,"Old fashioned, old system, old thinking and many old ladies. A man certainly doesn't belong in this environment."
bad,"This is the most toxic work environment that you will ever experience.  The racial turmoil and falsehoods that are constantly tossed around without truth are impossible to deal with.  The members of management are constantly changing.  If you are contacted by this company for a job opportunity, run away as fast as you can."
bad,They lied to you and used you. If you didnt work dayshift they didnt care about you. Everything got pushed onto night shift. The dayshift maintenance guys did nothing but talk to office people and fix desks and chairs and change light bulbs. All the pms and real maintenance work got pushed onto nights. And the same stuff that ran during the day ran at night. So they would tell you to get it done or you got wrote up. The pms would back up so far that you would work on pms that where due 3 months ago. I'm glad I left.
bad,The manager is controlling. No training involved in the position position. Very high stress due to the manager and her need to micromanage.Save yourself the time and apply somewhere else .
bad,The management is horrible. They hire their friends and move off them have any type of leadership skills. The associates are the most amazing people. They make the job bearable.
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. The managers are know it alls and are totally disrespectful toward the associates. Middle management tries to control you by writing the associates up. The culture looks good from the outside but when you get inside, you will find out that management is just a joke. They expect a lot but don’t compensate well. Morale is very bad there and management refuses to address it. They think everything is ok. Stay away!"
bad,"empty promises and low moral across departments."
bad,when you first start it seems like a great place to work for. Its not all the employees hate each other. They want to you to almost run to keep up. there is a lot of favoritism going on at msc. what ever management says is the way it is. if your manager does not like you you will get a bad review. no room for advancement at all. they do not promote from with in. the job is easy. the people make it hard.
bad,"would not recommend this company to anyone.  high stress poor pay"
bad,Worked for MSC as an Inside Sales Representative and was promoted to Inside Sales Supervisor. Great team of Inside and Outside Sales representatives.
bad,"I have a customer base that requires I visit national accounts and replenish their fasteners as well as restock the vending units we provide to the customer with all PPE, gloves, safety glasses and anything needed in the ware houses. I have learned how to install and repair these units.  I am putting my feelers out because the lack of training in certain areas is not there and the culture has changed since I started there 18yrs ago. The hardest part is the lack of training as it pertains to fixing these units. You are expected to be a IT rep without the training. my joy is satisfying my customers. I really feel good when I leave a customer satisfyed."
bad,"Diversity is a check box, some are promoting due to ethnicity rather than skills or ability  diversity means finding diverse backgrounds and experience, not just sex or race"
bad,"MSC is trying to wring more and more out of less and less people. They are very silo based with many entrenched employees that just like things the way they are. They are trying to run a 3B business and integrate newly purchased companies using an out dated and out moded 30yr old AS400 system. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the people you work with on a daily basis. The management is the worst part of the job as they do not care to understand what their employees work consists of, they just like to demand that it get done and faster and with no allowance for growth or mistakes. They say they are there to serve you but when you provide evidence for what you need it is ignored, not explained why it can't be done, just ignored."
bad,This company promises and NEVER carry thru. You are a number and everyone is replaceable!  The management tells you each day how worthless you are!
bad,"They put you through a very unrealistic training process and by the time your done you don't remember a thing.Branch management has no idea what they are doing and upper management could care less."
bad,"Overly micro managed by branch manager looking to move up by climbing your back. Co workers excellent but stuck because of current job market. Like to keep hiring more managers and tell you no money for merit raises or customer thank you things like donuts or even calendars. HR and culture talk is deplorable. No repercussions? Sure, just try to file a complaint and see how long it takes to get a write up. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the endless paperwork, redundant reports and endless training modules that is more important than your face time with your customers. Lots of doublespeak spoken fluently here."
bad,The management style was bad and so was the call center sturcture which made coming to work unbearable most of the time.
bad,"Day at work: Stressful"
bad,The job in itself is a fairly simple job and the pay is good along with the benefits but I would not suggest this company if you are looking for good supervisors and or good coworkers. The management is so bad at this company and they try to make you feel like your going to be treated like an equal during your interview but that is most definitely not the case.
bad,"Typical day at work, consisted of logging into our RF guns, putting totes on our carts, scanning totes and then it would tell us the correct aisle and item number to pick. Co-workers were very frustrating there, seemed to mess around more than work. Management was hardly around to keep employees in line, when they were they seemed to correct the employees that didn't need it. Most enjoyable part of the job was listening to music and just being in a zone to get my job done."
bad,I worked in Columbus oh they lie to u management has no clue from one day to the next what is going on the director doesn't even has a college degree worked there for yr with no raise they said people wood never get fired for errors but then they fire people for accuracy they are very shady they want to feed u and give u free t-shirts trying to make it seem like a good place I have worked in warehouses for 20 yrs and I have to say this is the worst place company there is they have a very high turn over rate just in the first yr
bad,"Was a good company...2017 things seriously changed and it was bad and fast.  Upper management changed things mid year in 2018-2019 and made a mess of sales reps. They made the rules but upper management wouldn’t even follow, would change just to help themselves making it difficult for any sales rep to hit sales goal which was unrealistic."
bad,Constant change of direction and expectations.  Does not feel like your feet are on solid ground. Leadership does not seem to listen to the direction provided by the field team.
bad,Do not work here. It will depress you. You will be discriminatinmed against. Managment never listens or cares for your health. The building is bad for your respiratory health.
bad,"Management is questionable."
bad,"if you value your sanity and personal health, do not work at MSC in any exempt role (mgmt.). this company will take your soul. you will be micro-managed and will have no support from upper management. human resources actually runs this facility. it will be you against your manager, the hourly associates and human resources. be ready for long hours, low pay and mediocre benefits AND you will see hourly associates making much more money than you."
bad,"Starting pay now is $15 an hour, full benefits, and two weeks vacation. Most of the job openings are second or third shift. Longevity at this place is not rewarded though."
bad,"wasted 3 years of my life there, management does not run the show very well and takes no accountability for it. employees left feeling defeated and under appreciated. take your talents elsewhere"
bad,I loved working for this company for my first 8 to 9 years and once I transferred to a different position it went down hill. They don’t pay cost of living difference so if you decide to transfer be careful where you go.
bad,"Good place to work, not great. Management is a joke. Management doesn't take the time to listen to complaints nor practice basic management skills, employees dont stay long."
bad,"Unfortunately MSC has lost their way, starting with upper management! No sense of loyalty to associates, the expectations and goals set are outrageous with little or no consideration to lack of resources. Set you up for failure just to point fingers.  Culture died long ago which is unfortunate as they used to be a great company to work for.  If you are looking for a career, look in another direction."
bad,"MSC used to be a good company until they opened the co-headquarters in NC. They do not promote or have a career path for anyone in NY. The benefits are okay, like 401k match at 6%, but be prepared to be in the same position for your entire tenure here. They expect most associates to do the work of 3-4 people and do not compensate or give recognition for it."
bad,"When I started with MSC I really enjoyed it. They assured me I would be promoted within a 6-month period, but almost 2 years later and I had been told multiple times that I would not be. I had tried multiple times to transfer regions in order to grow professionally, but was turned down for multiple reasons. "
bad,"Very limited by this company as to what you can and can't do to grow business, but the sales quota is still there and you had better grow your business."
bad,"Having the benefit of joining MSC when Culture was the leading force of all engagement... respect for all associates, loyalty to those that believed in the goals that the founder built the business upon today “associates” are seen as head count, leaders motivate with words such as  “hate”  “anger” ..... so very sad"
bad,Very little support to help you and a different sales approach every year.  Good benefits and work/life balance but very little room for career growth.
bad,"My dept. didn’t supply training unless the manager felt you were supportive of her.  Not much guidance after hire, and many were misdirected during hiring. A lot of people are unhappy but management isn’t responsive to input. "
bad,Could be a great place for employment but there are always new managers and new supervisors. They can’t keep the same management crew for some reason. And they well send you through orientation quick just to get you on the floor but your missing a lot of information about the company.
bad,"The worst aspect of the job was the pricing issues and being competitive in a given market.  Outside Sales had no real say in price structure to the end users.  Cannot be competitive with an automated system and to get special pricing set up, every item has to be manager approved.  There appears to be no trust for the Outside Sales Team Members."
bad,Held a position of Inside Sales and being the only minority within the office you are shown this each and every day. Manager have their favorites and if they don’t care for you then you are basically let go.
bad,"MSC stopped being innovative a long time ago and now has become an industry follower of the competition. Too many changes across board, leaving both the customer and associates left to figure it out."
bad,"This company is making moves to get away from 'silos', to invest in their talent and grow retention rates.  They are all talk and talk is cheap.  If you are looking to grow with a business, I do not recommend MSC.  If you are just interested in a paycheck, this may be more for you.  MSC has a fumbling rewards program.  I do not feel that my hard work is recognized."
bad,Typical day at work is shuffling tons of paper around for approval and never getting resolution. The hardest part is being micromanaged by supervisors in other states and your own supervisor not having a say about anything.
bad,"Do you like emails at 6 am? Come to my office for meetint at 7am? Frequent emails over 300 words in content explaining why !  Then work for MSC. First 4 months great pay then the hammer comes down. Big deal company car, drive 800 miles weekly and be expected to make 12 stops and 20 people, Ya right! "
bad,The position was a good one for the company and the compensation was fair. The thing is my supervisor was hard to get along with. I endind up having to leave. My supervervsor got demoted and her boss got fired over the situation. It was a real shame
bad,Goals  were unrealistic and commissions were very difficult to achieve.  No real support from managers and they did not give raises . No real support given by management.
bad,"Cons: Compensation levels are below similar companies in the area. A lot of poor management - if you're in the 'club' you stay. 401k match should be better. Health benefits not the best. You pay in alot. Associates not rewarded for loyalty - even after tax change savings of 50 million. Certain percentage of employees are overworked and burdened while others have little to do -- this varies by department. The executive level area associates have a very entitled work environment and apparently think everyone else does too.  Pros: (which can vary by dept/manager) The flexible hours and days have majorly improved. If you do a good job, you can feel fairly secure. It appears they are trying to make positive changes-but it's slow. There are many very professional (not referring to management), talented, and helpful associates in all departments you can count on. You can find a core group to rely on.  You can survive here for a number of years before they wear you down."
bad,"MSC proved to be challenging in some positive and not so positive ways. Most days were typically routine, yet filed with surprises, and the work could range from challenging to very enjoyable, depending on the circumstance. Folks are pushed hard, and in the end the satisfaction came from the when the customer was taken care of."
bad,"You had to work very hard and received very little recognition. Solid company, but minimal motivation. New secondary headquarters located in Davidson, NC. Majority of new hires for office positions are now out of the Davidson office."
bad,"A typical day at work would include scheduling appointments to meet with current customers for new opportunities, while generating new accounts."
bad,"Over the last 24 months I had 5 regional managers and the executive level sales leadership has completely changed over. The new Sr. VP of Sales came from General Electric and has ruined what was an amazing culture that supported and developed its associates. Today, you're a number on a spreadsheet and performance above all else is your worth."
bad,upper management needs help.  they lack a good plan.     no plan for next 5 years.  hard part of job to much jumping around.  people at MSC are good not upper management.  you learn more from vendors than management.
bad,"If you want to work for a company that treats you like a pressure-cooker, with little to no room for advancement, then this is definitely your place. So many politics in the company, but yet they gloat about their positive culture............NEGATIVE!"
bad,"The work is fast paced and exciting.  Always busy and always different.  The biggest problem is the constant back biting that goes on among the staff in the branch offices.  Someone is always running to management and HR to tell them something that they thought they heard someone say or do.  You find yourself tap dancing on the carpet for HR over things that always turn out to be unfounded / untrue.  With all the work there is to be done in the branch, it is amazing that so many people have nothing better to do than to be trying to mind everyone else's business.  A very cliquish environment not unlike being in High School.  Management plays favorites and if you are not a 100% company ""yes man"", you're not one of them.  "
bad,We had managers that prided themselves on intimidating people into quitting or getting fired. Even if production goals and quality goals were met you would be screamed at and threatened with your job daily. Associates were great though and the job itself was bearable. There were some good managers there they just didn't exist in my department.
bad,"Worked in the call center, fast paced distribution, great for those who can keep up, great benefits, room for advancement. Not so good for individuals who practice their inter personal skills, (customers keep you on the phone and its difficult to meet your quota."
bad,"customer calls - sell product - solutions"
bad,It all depends your local manager.  Upper management is completely disconnected from the ground level sales with the customer.  Does not bode well for the long term health of the company.
bad,The typical day at MSC was very busy but enjoyable. I enjoyed every aspect of my job beside the commute from work to home. While working at MSC I learned many different Human Resource functions and work with a great staff.
bad,"Definitely a decent job if you don't want to do the normal day type career. Lots of running around, tons of different accounts and things to do. Get into a groove pretty quickly and keep doing it over and over. Not good for people that want positive changes daily or the sense of pride you get for making a difference.. definitely a good show up, do your job, get paid gig. Direct manager was amazing but unfortunately I needed to make more of a difference to keep me motivated so had to move on."
good,Overall the hiring process was fun. And I HAD a good manger when I was there. But they fired him. But when you get sick they don't care. I had walking pneumonia. And they didn't care j just wanted me to come into work. And even though I had a excuse from 3 different doctors. They still counted it.
good,"Boss was always preaching to work more and to get more but would never help explain or help internally to make thing happen, Was not a good environment for success, Company is too focused on getting stock to raise and forgot about employees."
good,"When I started with this company, they were all about keeping good people so they treated the associates like they were valuable and needed.  Over the years, with new management, the only thing they care about now is numbers...which the board of directors dictate.  If you can't make those numbers then plan on stress levels that physically sicken you."
good,Had the joy of working with some great support people that helped me out by finding products when I was busy. I also worked with them to recommend products for other customer needs.
good,"incompetent and terrible management skills.  They had good benefits but that did not outweigh the above, which is a shame.  Also did not their facts rights."
good,Overall the company is a good organization to work for. Management is a big problem. They have no clue as to how to handle situations and always relying on lead personnel to resolve the issue. Not flexible with family emergencies. Had to resign because I was reprimanded for taking time off due to family emergency.
good,"Met some good, hard working people.  Unfortunately management was not as reliable, knowledgeable, and willing to help others growth within the company.  Very territorial and only seems to focus on management politics.  You work hard so they don’t and you can’t grow in knowledge because you become a threat.  Very sad place"
good,Good for young people! Not very good hours for parents! There is some room for growth but not much! Not much overtime( witch I love) in Fernely so you won’t have that big of a Commute
good,The overall job culture is fine especially with the casual dress code that MSC has adopted.  The associates here a kind and friendly. MSC brings activities to the staff to include everyone in holidays and seasonal entertainment.
good,Too many conflicting priorities for sales team   Sales team is accountable for results but are tasked with too many programs which are created at higher management level with little input in the field
good,"Working overtime every day. Six day per week ."
good,"Overall, a good company.  However, some local and regional managers struggle with providing good leadership.  This company is full of very smart people.  They are in a state of change resulting in lots of disruption and uncertainty regarding job security."
good,"Large distribution Center of Industrial Supplies in the Northeast of America, 400 plus employees. Game room. Lunch area. Huge parking and inside branch store for employees."
good,".I believe that the learning experience is great because its diverse in the industrial field ,by working and meeting new people.Learning different job titles and positions."
good,Company is on 3rd pay plan in 3 years while constantly changing territories. Made account transfer decisions without regard to sellers ability to make commissions
good,"MSC is honestly a great company to work for, you can’t beat $15/hr to pick or pack, or whatever you end up doing all day. But, management never seems to be on the same page, and they tend to have favorites. The work/life balance is rough if you’re on any second or third shift, and there isn’t much room for movement due to almost constant hiring freezes it seems."
good,"I worked at MSC for a little under a year, as a travelling Vendor Managed Inventory Specialist. "
good,"The best part of my job are the people i work with in the marketing department as well as the team I am part of and my manager."
good,Important projects are launched with a lot of enthusiasm but loose priority at the next critical issue.  Management knows that infrastructure investments is needed but it is not a priority.
good,Cette entreprise est moderne cependant la culture au canada n'est malheureusement pas à l'image de celle des États - Unie en raison des dirigent canadien
good,"Company provided car. Benefits are sufficient. Flexibiliy in schedule. local management is strong, but seems to be a disconnect between local support and corporate upper management. Lack of supporting resources/skilled resources. No work life balance. Do not work here if you want a 40 hour a week job. Average week is 50-60 hours in order to accomplish tasks. Too many ""check the box"" activities that take away from proactive selling."
good,Company had so many rules and made so many changes that sometimes it was hard to concentrate on selling. Through it all I was able to overcome all of the internal obstacles and ended up being quite productive in the end. I can say that the number 1 objective at MSC is too give their customers the best service in the business and they certainly did that.
good,There was much to like working for MSC however the geographic distribution of customers never made sense to me.  I could be calling on a customer in an area of California with another potential customer next door but wasn't allowed to call on them because they were assigned to another salesman.
good,A well managed company that measured everything. I learned a considerable amount about the industrial distribution market during my six+ years but the experience lacked a sense of belonging and fun.
good,"My typical day at MSC consists of working with customers to create better sales opportunities; generating and analyzing reports to adjust proper stocking levels of items; and negotiating with vendors on purchasing opportunities. I like the fact that the company has excellent job security and offers annual raises based on annual reviews. However, I believe that management does not always give credit when credit is due, and there also seems to be quite a bit of red tape throughout the company."
good,Overall the associates are dedicated and fun to work with but the facility is struggling finding good management and associates when good associates or management move on
good,"Typical day was working 7am-5pm from Monday through Friday.  There is very little over time, if over time is required, employees are informed at least the day prior.  Breakrooms and facilities are nice."
good,I have been able to move around to different departments and learn a lot of different functions which has enabled me to move up in the organization and to realize the effect my decision have on other areas
good,Customers becaoming extremely demanding. Company is not equipt to handle the stress of the rapidly changing landscape. Our meassage to our customers is stale and needs a drastic make over. Support staff stretched to its limits.
good,Look forward to good work with an unfair incentive protocol. Strict policy that can be annoying at times. That's what I have from working for this company.
good,"new management is making associates feel unappreciated and that problems within departments are not being handled properly, leading to poor attitudes and  causing people to leave the company"
good,"MSC is a great place to learn from out of college. As long as you are hungry for learning, there is always something to fix or be involved in. Advancement is available usually up until the manager level."
good,"Easy work as long as you pay attention to details. Long hair has to be tied up away from conveyors. Work/Life balance is tricky with 9am-6pm, 10am -7pm or 11am-8pm shifts though."
good,Productive workplace with a lot of hard working employees. Supervisors are very nice and considerate of your safety and well being. But breaks are short.
good,"Like every company, it has it's ups and downs. Good workplace environment, management could better as a whole, need to be fair to hard workers and see through those who are not."
good,"Everyone is polite, friendly and outgoing. Managers look after you. Theirs nothing hard about this job, only if you don't ask question or ask for help. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"The place was OK, but each day seemed to be a challenge in terms of getting fair treatment.  The bosses definitely had favorites and if you weren't one of them you were a scapegoat."
good,"A typical day at work was spent on the phone taking anywhere between 50 and 150 calls per day. Taking orders, returns and consulting with our tech team for customers. I believe most of my coworkers were as unhappy as myself at this company, as the management was not very supportive. It was sort of an every man for himself sort of environment and the company itself was more concerned about it's bottom line than about it's employees happiness."
good,"Overall, good organization to work for with many good people who come to work ready to perform each and every day. Much success in your endeavors as you review organizations that you would like to be a part of."
good,"MSC is a 'used to be"" company, it used to be great, now it no longer has the family feel. It still is better than most out there.  The pay is below average when they expect above average work."
good,"8 hour shift in the call center.  A lot of pressure the meet the number of calls and not always rewarded for quality customer service work.  Average 50 calls per day.  Orders, researching products, questions on orders, returns, everyday is different.  Product training to learn about tooling and ongoing process training.  Generally an upbeat, supportive culture except for the stress of the call center requirements.  I do not like having to take so many calls per day.  Would rather do an excellent job with each call.  Many complements from customers.  I enjoy the variety of customers and work required."
good,The amount of work being done was too much for the amount of people in the dept. Software used for this area was archaic and a hold over from an acquired company. Training was sporadic and not organized making the job very difficult. Departments pretty much worked against each other and passed the buck a lot.
good,"A typical day is answering calls from Reps, and customers for different departments. The department I work in seems very hard to transfer to another department. My job at this company anyone can do, and I believe its a great job for someone right out of high school or recent college graduate not for experience individuals because you will find yourself bored and not challeged."
good,The company is going through a growth phase. There are some growing pains and a lot of pressure on branch managers. Training is lacking especially to individuals new to the industry.
good,"In the first 4 years as a Machinery Service Engineer, I would handle incoming calls with warranty issues that could be repaired over the telephone, or would set-up an appointment with a service rep. within the network. I helped bring down department service costs annually. Worked with Import Vendors from China, Taiwan & Japan via e-mail and domestic vendors such as Wilton, Delta, Bridgeport-Hardinge etc., via e-mail, fax or telephone. Also helped expand nationwide network of service reps. Handled monthly service reports for Supervisor, assisted Machinery Sales Dept. and Machinery Parts Dept. when needed. Knowledgeable of Drill Presses, Lathes, Milling Machines, Surface Grinders and Electrical applications for machines."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with MSC. I met some very professional people, some of whom I still remain in contact with. The customer service team was driven to help the Account Managers become and stay successful."
good,"Good Company, good Benefits, but be ready for the world of corporate policy and procedures. Typically this leads to any decision taking forever and never getting accomplished."
good,"MSC offers competitive pay and work-life balance, depending on the job that you hold and your manager.  MSC does use some outdated systems and many roles are highly manual, though they have worked to bring in new tools."
good,"A typical day would include visiting customers that you have broken down into categories A-D. The goal is to build a fence around your business and also take market share from the competitors. I have learned a lot about the skills involved in building fences around the current business, as well as taking market share away from the competitors."
good,MSC is in the process of evolving and providing better overall benefits and experiences to the associate. Some departments have more flexibility then pothers based upon job function. Overall MSC is a good place to work.
good,"MSC is diverse in our culture and always evolving to best serve the needs of  Associates while keeping the integrity of Business Functionality to the highest standards of excellence.  In a tough industry due to growing web competition, it is still a force to be reckoned with.  If you find your niche here, then it is a place that you can establish a career, but find enjoyment in what you are doing and not feel you are just working."
good,"Great position for recent graduates as it builds experience however there is no room for growth. Management tends to lead you on about career possibilities just to make you stick around longer. The company is growing so more responsibilities is being added to roles without considerations for pay increase. Also there is too much traveling, about 3-4k miles per month."
good,The company is very well organized and a good 8-5 job with good benefits.
good,"Great company to work for, but the warehouse doesn't have a/c its very hot in there, has a very high turnover rate, with management, and associate, work is slow sometimes."
good,"And this position I was introduced AS400, McAfee Endpoint Protection and keyfobs.  Aside from those two things the I asked the department was well structured and moderately effective"
good,No learning time and mostly AS400 applications. Meetings rooms are hard find because there are not numbered and there are no campus map.
good,The people there have been there for years and aren't thrilled about taking the time to train new people. The workplace is clean and nothing is denied to help get the job done. Can be stressful at times and not very flexible with outside work concerns.
good,"After the training class, I really enjoyed working at this company. Growing in the right direction. Enjoyed providing service to customers. I would work here again"
good,Great company to work for and a typical day is long hours on the phone. I learned great customer service skills. the culture was pleasant. Management was unfair. The hardest part of the job was customer complaints and most enjoyable was the work incentives and bonuses.
good,"It's a secure job, but there isn't very much growth. Unless you know the right people."
good,"If you are looking for a great place to call home and work join this company. You are well trained and you are offered alot as in a company car, a company cellphone and much more. You work Monday threw Friday and you have all major holidays off. Only down side is you work alot of hours."
good,I enjoyed my time at MSC. It taught  me a lot of useful skills. Not a lot of advancement offered and management doesn't always take employees ideas into consideration. But overall it was a good job.
good,"I was able to learn a lot in a short period of time and I really enjoyed what I was doing. I gained more than just exposure, I also grew a lot from my experience."
good,"I don't work at MSC, I have interview there twice for two different positions. The first position I applied for was a call center customer service I didn't work for that position. So they recommended me for another position that I interviewed for I didn't get that with either. But still I would recommend people work there. They seem to be all about their Associates the suppliers and the customers. And that seems to matter a lot to them. So if I ever get the chance to work there I will definitely take it. I'm going to keep trying!"
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo. visitar mis clientes y crear nuevas oportunidades de crecimiento en ventas."
good,Very physical but manageable job. Always had good group of co-workers. Management wasn't always on the same page. But they did have some supervisors who did their job very well. Enjoyed the company overall. But due to a misunderstanding with personal time. Was released after almost 11 yrs of dedicated service.
good,"MSC is and wonderful place to work, it is a fast paced work facility, you are also on the go, which means there is also something to do"
good,"The daily demands and challenges are stressful.  The hardest part of the job is that we identify an issue and./or a problem and it takes us way to long to correct/fix it. We accept/process customers orders that do not match the customers purchase orders, we are having issues with EDI transmissions and it is extremely difficult, very time consuming and some times impossible to collect.  We need to fix the front end (NSOE system) so that we bill the customers correctly.  Another challenge is the issues with cash application and research in SAP.  There are a number of issues and fixes that have been identified but it takes months and years to fix.  This results in complaints from our customers and extra, unnecessary work. Is also impacts our ability to collect on our open AR and reduce bad debt. We have challenges both with our front end and back end systems.  Resources need to be dedicated to fixing them. This would ensure that we continue to provide the excellent service to our customers."
good,Enjoyed working at msc. Made alot of new friends there. Everyone was very helpful and worked as a team. The management kept everyone on the same page with weekly meetings.
good,"I enjoyed working at MSC however, there was no room for advancement,  You can only advance if you move out of state. Management team was not for the people only for the bottom dollar."
good,"Great company culture. This was not the right fit for me but I do think it is great company with awesome leadership. The feed back for improvement is, better use of technology, change the name from Class C Solutions Group to MSC Industrial Supply, and to put more focus on the Canadian Market."
good,"Location manager is the key.  MSC is a ""box mover"" not an offer of continuous improvement or costs savings.  Not a personal challenge to help US plants be more profitable."
good,Job has changed many times due to not well developed.  It is now getting into its stride and working better.  There are still some gaps in equal business channels.
good,"Fast paced distribution center.  Hard work although your fellow co-workers will be willing to lend a hand whenever needed.  Decent management, competitive advancement opportunities."
good,A great place to work. I enjoy working with my fellow associates. I enjoy the flexibility with my work hours. And the opportunities to grow in your career.
good,"MSC benefits and culture are good. Flexible schedule is great."
good,MSC going thru culture changes. Relocating some out of state.located in Southfield . Some departments have flex time. They also have dress down days. Some departments also have a quarterly bonus.
good,I really liked working here. I had a Company car and good benefits. The people I worked with were good people. I just feel the company as a whole has lost track of their original sight.
good,"It is a good local company to work for. Management has a huge double standard and do not practice what they preach unless corporate executives are there visiting from New York. They consistently talk about how gossiping is forbidden, but never do anything to punish the greatest offenders and let it continue. They know the staff that does not take ownership and they promote them like hero's.Great bonuses and decent raises."
good,Pro: This is a great company with a great atmosphere overall!  Admirable mission and core values.  Coworkers are very friendly. Con: Little room for career development.
good,"A typical day at work starts with following up on emails from our offshore team and/or open items that need to be addressed, attending meetings, supporting my team on challenges from the projects they are working on, and prioritizing my tasks to complete my assignments.   The workplace culture here is great as the people are friendly, supportive and willing to help one another.  The hardest part of the job is the amount of work that needs to get done, but the best part of the job is those that I work with to complete that work.  Everyone works hard and wants to do the best for the projects they are assigned to."
good,People are great.  Leaders are fair and honest.  Work is challenging.  Everyone has a voice and is heard. Company is focused on work/life balance.  Career advancement is in your hands. Success is rewarded. Good health/retirement benefits with plenty of options.
good,Come work for a company where every associate feels like they play a vital role in where the company is going.  MSC Company culture constantly challenges everyone to work together to make the company a success.
good,"MSC has been a great place to work and advance my career. I've been able to develop my skills and connect with amazing people both inside and around the organization. Despite a rapidly changing competitive landscape, MSC is uniquely positioned to continue a long tradition of strong performance."
good,"MSC provides a great work/life balance with flex hours and working remotely as needed, however many of these things are left to the manager's discretion so some associates are left out.  The culture is changing for the better as evidenced by the CEO and HR."
good,"The workload is very high and sometimes there aren't enough hours in the day. Overtime is on approval though, so you get to go home on time most days. "
good,I believe this is a great company because I have been here for a long time. I however have watched some things decline...  I believe our salary is not as competitive as it should be for all the work we do and I am fine with working hard. I believe that our holiday and vacation process and days could be better...  I still believe this is a great company
good,"Great company to work for. Starting pay was low but had great benefits. Have great paid vacations. Regret  not still working there."
good,Being part of larger company we had a great deal of support we could call upon for assistance with technical issues we weren’t familiar with. That was great as it really helped me expand my knowledge. Not so great was feeling like HR didn’t have your back with personnel issues.
good,"lovely place to work would like to retire form here but i want to relocate"
good,"Working with MSC is high pace most days and filled with Customer request and orders. Never a dull moment when the phones are ringing and the emails are flooding into the Branch. "
good,"I was with MSC for 8 years.  For most of those years they showed a tremendous loyalty for their associates.  It is an extremely collaborative place to work and the environment is one that values family and work/life balance.  Unfortunately the company is undergoing a lot of changes, both in management and culture, therefore things are changing rapidly.  Some of these changes are good and necessary, but others seem rash and not very well thought out. Overall, I enjoyed my tenure with the company and I wish them the best in the future."
good,"MSC is overall a pretty good company. They provide good benefits and good starting compensation. Work culture is friendly and laid back for the most part."
good,Very demanding and fast paced. Direction changed frequently depending on company needs. You learn a lot and feel a sense of accomplishment daily. The associates are the best!
good,"Overall good company to work for, though the total compensation is a bit lacking. MSC is a very large and stable industrial distributor, but they are slow to adapt to industry trends due to their VERY thorough analysis and decision making process."
good,They long tenured employees which says a lot this company while it large enough grow it is small enough so employee feel included. Bonus program well put together
good,"Standard, practical and stable company that cares about their people with customer at the forefront.  Slow growth potential with it taking many years to achieve your career goals."
good,MSC has very good work culture with so much diversity.Work environment is really very good. It has flexible hours and management is good. Friendly environment.
good,MSC Industrial Supply is an energized workplace with a variety of opportunities for professional development. MSC also has a strong culture of giving back to the community and offers associates  ongoing opportunities to volunteer with local nonprofit organizations through its community relations program.  .
good,Solid company with a great reputation.  Job security is one of the major drivers here; MSC has a reputation to keep jobs secure.  Company certainly runs very lean which could be a pro at times but also a con given the work load.
good,Good work/life balance. Little room for advancement within own department. Some job insecurities due to recent transitions. Upper management needs to do better with mentoring and developing staff
good,The best part of MSC is being able to contribute beyond the actual position and job description to make a positive impact each day.  There are no limits to what can be accomplished.
good,It is great culture fit. Is is very great company to for work. It is always room for growth with company. My co workers are great work with they take care of the employees.
good,"Company is a great place to work. Great environment. Benefits were great until affordable healthcare act kicked in, now only so so. Some areas are difficult to advance in. Bonuses are also so so."
good,Has a pool table and ping pong table for employee use.  Nice place to work.  Super clean! Open door policy and plenty of opportunity for employee input.
good,The work is either a lot or barely none at all. Management at the branch level are great. they work with you and not against you. Benefits are not that great. The cost is way to high for coverage that doesn't do much. co-workers are great to work with. Corporate is not the greatest. Always pushing foreword policy without knowing what it is like to work at our level.
good,"The work is easy and productivity isn't hard to achieve. The hardest part about the job is the summer heat, it gets extremely hot in the warehouse in the summer."
good,"Great place to work. Enjoyed Co-workers, nice facility, and beautiful location. Not the best health insurance.   Minimal room for advancement."
good,My work day starts at 8:30am. Our supervisor reviews with us our
good,"Good company overall, always looking to grow and go forward."
good,company is a good company to work for.  They are going through many new changes to optimize the stock.  they are heading in the right direction and have to make many tough choices.
good,"MSC is a good company to work for. Positive work environment. The work/life balance is good. The culture is great, cares about the community. Good health benefits."
good,"I'm glad to work for a company with integrity that  does the right thing for our stakeholders: Associates, Customer, Suppliers and Shareholders.  Senior leadership leads by example & associates are kept informed of developments. This makes for a strong culture.  There has been a great deal of positive transformation at the company over the past few years touching most departments.  By doing this, MSC is investing in the future to ensure our continued growth & success. The best part of the job is the people I work with and get to meet through my position.  It's a true team environment and always interesting."
good,"Workplace culture is focused on the customer. MSC strives to have every customer, whether it be a customer, vendor or associate, satisfied.  MSC's mission statement is ""To Be the Best Industrial Distributor in the World as Measured by our Associates, Customers, Owners & Suppliers."""
good,Everyone is very friendly and willing to help. You will learn a lot about legacy systems and some new systems as well. Offer opportunities in other areas of the business if you are not content where you are which is a great way to learn more.
good,"I've been with MSC for over 15 years, have worked with many good people and have great management. We also have a strong culture for everyone to grow as well as the company. Most people are realistic and flexible with work/life balance. While there is still room for improvement, we are working on it."
good,"Pleasant culture here where ethical behavior and collaboration are valued and encouraged. Most managers care about the associates that report to them and generally everyone treats each other with respect. It is normal for people to thank each other for doing a good job and most people share that praise when appropriate."
good,Fast pace environment.  Wear multiple hats to get the job done. Entrepreneurial spirit encouraged. People that work here are very friendly and kind. Great work life balance.
good,"The CEO cares about the associates well being, takes feedback seriously and ensure changes are made for the better.  The work is fast paced and sometimes you feel you could use more hands to help out, but it's still one of the best places I have worked for in my 30 years in the field."
good,MSC truly is a great place to work.  I've been here for almost 9 years and the people and the culture can't be beat!  It's not often a person can say they actually look forward to going to work each day.
good,"MSC is a great place to work because of the culture. MSC is diverse and everyone I have encountered has been willing to go above and beyond to help other Associates with issues, questions, etc. My days are fast paced and vary from day-to-day, but I always leave with a sense of accomplishment. I currently have a fantastic manager. He is very up front and honest. If he doesn't know the answer, he will tell me that. That in itself is sometimes enough. The hardest part of the job is that I am so busy most days that I very rarely step away for lunch. I don't require a lot to eat so it's not a big deal for me, but it is a habit I need to break. The best part is the support of everyone on my Team. I feel that I have the BEST Team at MSC. We all work well together and support each other, sharing new things we've learned, etc."
good,"I believe MSC Industrial Supply Company is a good place to work overall. I can come in when I want, work and leave using flexible hours approved by my manager. I typically come in around 0730, take my lunch, and leave around 1630 to avoid the brunt of the area traffic. My management structure is good and they seem to value me as an employ and care about my feedback. I believe overall MSC has a good culture however, there is some need for diversification in my department. I believe the hardest part of my job is communication, since this is a national company it is hard to communicate sometimes with the right person. I find that the best part of my job is interacting with my team and the company's drive for self enrichment."
good,"A typical day is sort of challenging, and sometimes a mystery.  I love a challenge of solving mysteries.  Management is good, just lack communication at times.  Workplace culture is respectful not always fair. Other characteristics of the culture is Trust and integrity.  Teamwork and camaraderie is a plus.  The hardest part of my job is adjusting my duties with all of the meetings that are suddenly called.  It puts a lot of our associates behind in our work.  The best part of my job is coaching and teaching my fellow associates."
good,"answering multiple calls in a call center environment, checking customer orders, offer products, check for products and ordering, check emails to update customer orders and shipping, call customer to advised there order is in shipping process, resolved customer complaints, transferred calls over to sales department.  I learn the company policy and the management was great, the workplace was nice they had pool table to relieved stress, and I most of all enjoy helping customer and resolving there issues."
good,Great company great benefits and time off. Very nice people. Adequate training. Different positions available and opportunity to advance. Overall a very good plave to work.
good,"Good culture open door policy good bosses friendly workers"
good,"Great company tor work for , good company culture, very good co-workers, pleasant environment ,possibility of growth  very high"
good,"MSC provided me with a good, stable work environment for "
good,Opportunity for self management. Uncapped commission opportunities. Great company culture with open door policy with management and upper management.
good,"I have learned at MSC that Customer Service is the difference in how to support my Customers.  Managing and Servicing Customers needs is how to grow my business.  They value my experience and y respect my supporting solutions on projects and business proposals .  B2B or Retail business, it does not matter.  Customers expect to be treated with the upmost respect and that is how I make my customers feel.  I truly enjoy the support that I give my customer and the feeling of knowing that I have succeed in helping them with their business needs is the most rewarding part of my career.  I also pride myself with my team work and how to mentor and support by peers.  Supporting and advising them on projects and proposals helps me to understand our local business needs and outlooks.  It is important to me that I be a team player and work well with others."
good,My co- workers are very pleasant. A typical day at work involves inputting invoices into the system via AS 400.
good,"A typical day at MSC is one of continued improvement as measured by its customers, associates and its shareholders. I learned that you can not treat all customers with the same lifeline, that is you listen to wha the need of each customer and treat with the level of attention and beyond what that customer needs. No two customers are the same and that you have won half the battle in lending attentiveness and willing to meet the need of each customer no matter the level of business. The culture of MSC was one of respect, support and transparency. The hardest part of this job was some technological challenges but the company in its always wanting to improve spirit, it was great learning systems from the ground up."
good,"I enjoyed my time at MSC. The work was difficult at times and fast paced, but I was compensated well and learned a lot. MSC challenges every Associate to be their best."
good,Aggressive goals but clearly spelled out. Management is very approachable. Goals are quite lofty which leaves little time (on the computer)during work hours to read or complete required training during normal work hours. Cannot come in early or leave late to do the training and not on lunch hour either. Flexible on time needed without use of vacation time. Supervisors are overworked But accessible most ofthe time.
good,Success at MSC will require your best effort.  The company culture and ambition to be the best will ensure you will be rewarded for your effort.  You will learn that serving the MSC customer is the most important part of your success.
good,"I like it. Work from home, company car, and decent benefits. No one looking over your shoulder. Do your job correctly, and satisfy customer needs. No regrets"
good,"I am proud to work for MSC. MSC is a company that cares about it's associates, as well as it's community.  The culture here is exactly what is needed for a great work/life balance."
good,"I've been with MSC for over 9 years and have had the opportunity to be involved with many different projects working cross-functionally with others across the company. It has allowed me to learn and meet colleagues I would not have normally come into contact with. Management is transparent with our mission and goals and how we need to get there. I have 100% confidence in our President that he does what is best for all stakeholders, including the associates. For a company that has been in business over 75 years, we do not standstill. We are always taking on new challenges and growth. Giving back to the communities where we work is an important value here and there are plenty of events to get involved in. If someone wants to learn, grow, be challenged, give back, and have fun, MSC is the place to be."
good,"I love the culture at MSC.  They provide many opportunities to learn and develop through MSC university and the managers I have are extremely supportive, helpful and fair."
good,My close to 20 year career at MSC has challenged me to always do my best and to be prepared for anything. The culture here is what keeps me motivated - I work with associates that are like family and believe in treating each other with respect. I have a very good work-life balance and MSC leaders have implemented many programs over the last few years to improve associate engagement and happiness.
good,"If you are looking for an environment with predictable days and routine operating procedures, MSC is not the right place for you right now.  If you are very comfortable with change and seeking an established yet dynamic company that is transitioning to the next level then this is an exciting place to be right now.  Growing pains and imperfect systems should be expected as the company tracks toward more efficient and creative ways of thinking and functioning however optimistic and collaborative self starters have room to excel and make tangible positive impacts at MSC."
good,I have been able to support a wide variety of operating systems and applications that I was never able to at previous companies. Management is very supportive and try hard to maintain a strong work/life balance. The most difficult part is having to prioritize projects based and the most rewarding part of the job is being able to learn new technologies.
good,working at MSC gives you opportunities to advance and learn.   They offer classes to help you preform better at your job.   they offer health insurance at a good cost and work environment is great.
good,Great place to work! Culture is unlike anything I've ever seen. There are opportunities for personal/professional development and they understand that life goes on outside of the workplace.
good,"Hardest part of day is communication with associates offsite. The best part of the day is walking in to my department and it feels like a family.  Pay and raises are on the lower end, very good work life balance. Work is challenging and always room for advancement if you are willing to work for it."
good,Management is excellent here. The sales quotas can be kind of hard to reach at times. But they seem to be making changes to make things easier here. Nothing but good things to say about the company.
good,"As I work from home, I have a great work-life balance, and can be purely self-motivated with little direct oversight from my management on day-to-day tasks."
good,I have worked for a lot of companies and in various industries throughout my career. I have to say that MSC Industrial Supply Company has to be one my Top 3 places I have been employed during my career in Human Resources. The reason I believe is because they promote wirhin and also have an Associate Referral program that encourages the Associates to refer a firend or family memeber for career opportunities within the organization.
good,"The executive team at MSC is outstanding.  Lead, follow or get out the way as they like to say."
good,"Definitely would recommend working at this company. Has a great culture, management wants to see employees succeed."
good,"The numbers say it all. People are there to make the goals.Good pay and benefits, but be prepared to work like a machine. Opportunities to move laterally or up. Some managers are people-oriented, some not so much. Big enough operation that egos get in the way."
good,Fantastic Workplace culture and work life balance with flexibility.  This company not only cares about its associates but also about its surrounding community.
good,"Great work/life balance. "
good,"MSC prides itself on striving to be the best distributor and employer choice. That can been seen through all of the corporate initiatives and changes that continually take place. Your job and personal experience is going to be based upon what you decide to put into it. There are definitely opportunities to grow and learn however; you have to be willing to work hard and seek out those opportunities. The hardest part of my job would be trying to convince those resistant to change. The best part of my job is helping associates through change and their responses/reactions once on the other side of it. I also have a great manager, flexibility to integrate work/ life balance and opportunities to grow and learn."
good,MSC Industrial is a great company to work for and encourages a great work environment for its associates.    In the few short months I have been with the company I have been welcomed with open arms and educated on all part of the company.
good,"Good work/life balance, culture has slipped a bit over the last couple of years, overall though still a good company to work for. Flex hours and work from home options are a big plus!"
good,MSC is a company with a long-standing reputation for excellence as well as caring for its associates. It has a culture where in passing every person says hello to one another and people are consistently supporting one another as teammates. I have only been here a few months but would definitely recommend it to others. There are many opportunities for growth whether trying out various departments or advancement within one department.
good,My everyday work day is fairly simple for me. I know what I have to everyday before I start working. The hardest part is when I take vacation. I never know if anyone has filled in for me and what area look like on my first day back.
good,The benefits are well above average.  The sales team is very kind and customer driven.  Very ambitious company with high goals and expectations
good,2 different break rooms pool table ping pong satellite television warmer or extremely hot days got an extra break company would ice cream truck come to warehouse and have ice cream for free company outing and carry in lunched on a regular basis
good,Good workplace. Pay was decent. Promotions were not as easy to get as had been promised. MSC advanced people based on their college degrees instead of on actual work experience.
good,Great place to work at. Management was awesome. Fun atmosphere. fats paced. A lot you will need to lean about the industry. Study that catalog.
good,MSC was a great company to work for with many benefits to the employee/owners.  There were company advancement opportunities and job security. They were excellent in their review process so that you always knew where you stood as an employee/owner.
good,"I worked both 1st and 3rd shift and the benefits you receive are great as well as the people who work there are caring and helpful.  Sometimes loads of walking/standing, lifting also, but the benefits outweigh this part of the job."
good,Work Life/Balance is great. Culture is nice. Management gets the job done and is very understanding. Great place to be and to work! Lots to do! I am proud to be an associate.
good,"Good job, great culture. pay is decent but you can get as much overtime you want. off weekend unless u choose to work and great benefits and bonus checks."
good,"MSC is a great place to work. Great benefits, lots of change but hopefully for the long term good. Oriented towards a genuine effort to help customers become better at what they do."
good,"En el tiempo que colaboré con esta empresa,, tuve todo el apoyo profesional y personal por parte de mis asociados en general."
good,"Great employer, great benefits and Management was easy to work with.  I would recommend this employer to anyone looking for a career.  Location of the warehouse is in small town with very small commute time."
good,"Great hours, work load fast passed but manageable, great peers that work together to get the job done."
good,Working as an Outside Sales Associate with MSC is great job that gives you a lot of freedom to work. MSC provides its sales associates a lot of resources to find new opportunities.
good,"A typical day has the same routine."
good,"MSC is a great company to work for and we are growing by leaps and bounds.  We are the largest industrial supply company in the world and we distribute metalworking, maintenance and repair items to all kinds of companies from manufacturers to federal and state facilities."
good,"After punching in for the day you would immediately log into your phone and computer so that you can being taking sales calls as soon as your shift started. I also answered customer emails and made sure accounts were up to date."
good,i had a good time working here met some friends too bad i was only here a short time because i moved wonderful place to work.
good,"I met Many Wonderful People, I gained alot of experience working there."
good,"MSC is overall a good place to work. Company paid training & small branch office environment. The pay & benefits is very good. I left due to unconventional things going on behind the scenes with my manager, however I'm sure this was an isoated incident. Too bad, it was a nice job. I would recommend."
good,"It is a very fast paced environment but everyone works as a team to make cut off times. You stay busy so the time goes by fast. As a Merchandise selector you get a cart and grab totes, scan the totes into your handheld and it tells you the locations of the products you need to complete the orders. Then you scan the totes off place them on a conveyer to send the to packing."
good,We do have to clock in and adhere to our work schedule.  Company is good with bringing in food when we have to work late or breakfast when coming in early.  The company does pay for ALOT of our insurance.
good,Highly recommend. It offers a very unique culture. Great benefits. Great inside team. Very fast paced and very competitive.  Multitasking is key for success in this company.
good,Beautiful place to work.  Warm friendly environment.  Management team working to improve systems. Looking forward to working here for many years to come.
good,I have experienced career growth throughout my tenure with opportunities to try new areas of the company as well.  I enjoy the associates I work with and also that the company allows participation in volunteer events throughout the year.  Great place to work.
good,challenging and productive environment. company provided free lunch almost monthly. fast paced. paid time off for vacation plus paid sick time........
good,I really enjoyed working for MSC. I learned new strategies about providing solution selling techniques to my customers. Everyone in the company is very supportive and willing to teach and assist others.
good,"Learned a lot while there and enjoyed all the inside personnel there."
good,"I was normally one of the first people to arrive and the last person to leave the department. The sales tax team was very very busy. The tax dept consisted of income tax and sales tax associates. The dept was very divided and this made some members of the sales tax team uncomfortable with the environment. Some members of the sales tax team didn't really get interaction from the managers or VP of Tax. Personally, I am an individual who doesn't mind working continuously and kind of blending in the background. I am there to do a job. Others in the dept prefer to feel as if they belong."
good,"MSC is a world class industrial distributor with a vast inventory of products for the industrial consumer. "
good,"Training was great when I signed on, they made sure I was equipped with all of the necessary product knowledge I needed to perform the job well. A typical day involved driving from one customer account to another, checking in orders that had arrived the previous day and putting the product away. Occasionally special projects would come up that required a bit more attention."
good,"MSC has a strong culture that is reinforced each and every day. A great team atmosphere...I would strongly recommend MSC as an employer of choice- both for individuals just beginning their careers, or more seasoned professionals looking for a team to join that respects their experience and knowledge."
good,"MSC is a great place to work. If you're willing to put in the work and effort, there is great career growth or opportunities to move laterally. Benefits are pretty standard. I think we could use a few more holidays but really can't complain... it's fair."
good,"MSC is an excellent place to work. I have had the opportunity to work on many different projects since joining MSC. With each project I get to work with different departments, data, and tools in order to complete the project. Which makes each project an exciting opportunity to learn new skills and new things about MSC."
good,"I believe those who are generally negative will see the faults and not the benefits of the company. Its a family owned company who values their associates. The make strides to provide professional development, they have updated old systems, there are incentives, activities, committees. We are quite spoiled. Yes there are bonuses and great benefits. It would definitely depend on your department and  manager. We make it what it is...the company has our best interest at hand! Cafe is a perk...they have awesome food for super super cheap prices, great staff too! Yes, free Starbucks and Seattle's Best and Tazo teas on every floor. Giveaways every week for concerts and sports events!"
good,"I've learned a lot here at MSC. I had no knowledge of tooling, machinery or sourcing. However through my time with MSC I've learned all about tools, drills, end mills, taps and inserts. Not to mention how to look up many vendors for many new items customer require in the manufacturing field."

good,Every day at MSC brings something different.  Certain days can be challenging but also rewarding. I have learned quite a bit here at MSC.  I have been involved with the implementation of 2 finance systems in the 25 years I have been with MSC.  Working on different teams and collaborating with other associates gives you a better insight of how the business runs.
good,"I've only been an employee for five months but thus far I love the company and all it stands for! Compensation, benefits, a clean secured building and great employees are only a few things that makes this company a great place to work."

good,MSC fulfillment Center focus on serving directly to the costumer; orders are place thru a call center and past to the fulfillment center to get process; is a very smooth and precise operation. Friendly place with a great and fair performance review system and twice a year employee bonuses. Small management with good people skills.
good,"I started with MSC in 1988, in the warehouse picking orders. By 1990, I had advanced to the branch, formerly in Deer Park, Long Island, in the sales office. In '91, received my first transfer to the Baltimore branch. In '99, was promoted to new hire trainer in the Reno NV facility. By '04, was transferred to the facility in Atlanta. My biggest mistake was leaving MSC. EXCELLENT training, excellent culture, good management and opportunities IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK FOR THEM. Nothing comes easily, but hard work IS rewarded here. Have tried to come back several times, but they do not ""rehire"".....hmmmmm.... I know several that they HAVE rehired, but all the same, and excellent company to work for. It was not just a job for me, it was a career. I LOVED THIS PLACE. "
good,Company has adopted flex time and pays for school.  Good place to work. Pay is decent.  Benefits are good.  I have had fun working at MSC for the past 8 years.
good,"Very hard to get on with, but if you get a job there... keep it! The benefits are phenomenal and the pay is competitive. Culture from top to bottom is very much about collaboration, mentoring and building people and careers."
good,"Great place to work, the people are super friendly, and the job is pretty simple. You do need to be able to keep up with their standard though, that is the only hard thing about the job."
good,Was a great place to work.... Only left because personal life got in the way. The bosses were great and the coworkers were fun to work with. The only thing that needs to be kept in mind is that swearing was frowned on. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a typical warehouse.
good,Productive and great place to work. I would highly recommend MSC to a family/friend. I love what MSC represent and I stand behind their culture of business.
good,Very collaborative culture with a customer service focus.  A learning experience daily and feel consistently challenged throughout my tenure.  There is a higher degree of change within the past few years to navigate through which was needed for the organization to remain competitive and to support continued growth.
good,MSC is a great place to work. The work that we do everyday is appreciated by the management team. Work/life balance is great. Better raises would be nice.
good,"MSC has excellent work/life balance with very good benefits.  We have a benefits exchange so that you can pick what works best for your individual situation.  The managers I have worked with thus far have been wonderful.  They encourage having a proper work/life balance and work with associates to achieve their potential.  My current manger and team all work together, and often work with other departments to make sure everything is done completely and correctly.  Changing roles within the company to learn the business is encouraged and happens frequently, allowing for lateral and vertical movement."
good,"MSC is very focused on the well-being of their associates and decisions are made based upon ""the right thing to do"" rather than driven by external factors.  The CEO sets the tone of the culture and has a long-term interest in the health of the business.  Very good work-life integration and genuinely nice environment to work.  I have been recognized for my contributions and given great career opportunities for development."
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for.  MSC has a wonderful culture where diversity is valued in a relaxed work environment.  "
good,"I liked every one there  ,the benefits are great and management is very fair. I learned new skills while there. The hardest part of the job was if I had to wait for the products to get to my station,  but most of the time I was busy and I like that as it help the time go by fast. the lunch room is very nice and is kept cool in the hot summer days. I only hope that I may some day return to work their as I did like my job"
good,Generally felt good about my time there. It was a time of local and national transition and realignment of goals. Some signs of growing pains but the culture was always positive and support was always available.
good,"If you want a place where they genuinely care about their employees, this is your company. Just an example- when my son was born they sent us a FREE brand new car seat and a blanket with his name etched in it. Company vehicle can be driven like a personal vehicle and your spouse is also permitted to drive it as well.. well"
good,The benefits packages are absolutely incredible! If you are into sales there are limitless positions to move into. MSC is one of the best companies I have ever worked for!
good,MSC is a wonderful place to work. The companies culture is amazing. MSC celebrates diversity in not just people but thinking as well. Overall great place to work.
good,"Among the best things about working at MSC are the opportunity to learn and how much the day-to-day can vary.  Empowerment, the opportunity to try new things, and the ability to grow with the company are key to MSC's culture.  Advancement opportunities are there for those who strive to continuously learn and contribute to the company's overall success."
good,"I have worked at MSC for over 10 years, and I love the company and the culture.  The CEO is the grandson of the founder, and is very approachable and a genuinely good person who cares deeply for the associates and the community.  My fellow teammates are always willing to help, or explain solutions.  I haven't found anybody that wants to 'hoard' information to protect their position like I experienced at other companies.  There is schedule flexibility, and a good work/life balance.  There is also good stability ... if you work hard, the company does not have layoffs every time there is an economic downturn."
good,MSC has given me the opportunity to learn and move forward with my career. I am always greeted by friendly associates every morning which is a nice way to start the day. Management makes it a priority to check in to make sure everyone is happy in their situation.
good,MSC provides excellent work-life balance and a great corporate culture. They have competitive benefits and salaries to what I have experienced at other companies.
good,"Incredible opportunities at MSC!  If you are in sales, this is the best place to work.  Fair pay and unlimited commission potential.  New Business Development is HOT and right now is the time.  If you have a resume, update it and send.  Nothing else to say.  Love working for MSC"
good,"This was a great place to work, but was not meant for me. I had a hard time with the emotional baggage that comes with working in foster care and welfare. Great co workers, good compensation, easy work schedule and great culture."
good,msc  is a friendly place too work.very nice culture.great benefits!!! comfortable salary.
good,"Great company to work for. Entry level pay is way above min wage. They promote from within, they help you further your education. great benefits."

good,"MSC offers opportunities to grow and build a career. We always have lots of projects in progress, from full digital transformations to small enhancements. In the past few years I have learned key elements data analysis, cloud services, and software development.  Management is open to hearing diverse perspectives and always nurtures new ideas. It's a great place to work!"
good,Overall a great place to work. Located on the west side of Columbus its a bit out there but its a newer warehouse and they keep the building clean. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,The job was fast and repetitive but the other associates made it fun. I enjoyed working there for the time being but it did take them forever to hire me.
good,I loved working here and I was very sad to leave due to family circumstances. Everybody was always there to help and service was never an issue for the customer.
good,"Great environment "
good,This company never ceases to amaze me.  I work in the warehouse and everyone just got a huge raise.  They also changed the starting rate of pay to $15 - holy cow!  They are big into helping the community and we do stuff like make a wish and just brought back paks in to help kids who need help.  Picnics and cookouts and all sorts of stuff.  Yeah it can get hot in the summer but they always provide extras like gatroade and icepops.  some people complain about the place but I swear they must not have worked anywhere wlse cause they dont know how good we have it.  I dont plan to leave.
good,"The workplace culture at MSC is the best I have encountered within my life time thus far. The HR team is amazing and they truly go above and beyond to meet the needs of associates. Management is fantastic and are very accomodating and flexible with their associates. The hardest part of working inside the warehouse is the heat during the summer months. However, the company and team provide hydrating fluids constantly throughout the day and also offer extended heat breaks. The company does a lot of fun activities with their associates and they also have a yearly picnic. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and the opportunity for growth. MSC participates in the Make a Wish Foundation among other charity groups throughout the year as well. MSC is a great leader in our community and it is a pleasure to be in such great company."
good,"great pay, benefits are average - good work life balance - great culture - departments work together - facilities work together - great vision for the future -"
good,"Great management, many opportunities to excel and move up. Great pay for what you do, and great work environment with diversity and culture. Also compensation of bonus's for exceling in your job."
good,"This was a great place to work. I started as the Office Manager and when I retired I was their Vendor Sales Rep. As a distributor and in a manufacturing State, this program was designed for a win/win. I would label the customer's stock room with part numbers to match our products and on their timeframe would inventory and place an order based the min/max quantities that they had set. This company did continued education on products and culture. I enjoyed this so much because I was on the road traveling to the tool and die shops but also was interacting with the customers management as well as the associates."
good,this company is a good company to work for. their pay scale and time off policy when I worked there were very antiquated.  It was very far from my home and I wanted to be closer.
good,MSC cares about their employees. They take the time to get to know you. They are flexible with hours or if you need a day off. They will work with you. The management cares about their employees. Truly an amazing company to work for!!
good,Great on the job training & friendly atmosphere. Room for advancement.Flexible work schedule.Your co-worker are always willing to help.
good,I enjoy the atmosphere that I work in. Great people to be around. Customers are all long time customers and I have made some very good friends over the 16 + years with MSC. I
good,I enjoyed working here very much. I was always learning something new. I learned how to pick and pack items for everyday customers and military bases. I learned how to properly handle hazmat materials. I learned sales and how to work hands on with customers that came into the store. I also learned how to operate a variety of forklifts. I enjoyed working with all of my co workers. The best part of this job was to see the smile on a customers face while helping them find what they where looking for.
good,"Placed orders approximately 5-600 orders a week,I learned how to analyze budgets, the pros and cons and what solution would work best to clear up any issues,I learned how to negotiate with suppliers"
good,"Fabulous place to work and I miss it very, very much.  I loved everyone and the culture of the company and the department I worked for - if I could have stayed there I would have!!1"
good,"good place to work, very fast pace and the co-workers were a pleasant to work with"
good,My job was very diversified - I was enabled by my superiors to get involved with many special projects and was pushed to do my very best!
good,On my feet for a minimal of 8 hours a day selecting goods for the customers
good,"Fairly standard summer job, had me working most of the heavy lifting parts. I did get a great opportunity during my time here however. I started a few weeks before other new hires did, so when the later new hires started, I was tasked with showing them the ropes. It was a great learning experience for me because I got to demonstrate my leadership in a place outside of the BSA. From then on, I was able to shift around to new locations within the warehouse, learning multiple roles in the section I was in and training the new hires when they got to that role. The hardest part of the job was most likely the most enjoyable part as well: the constantly busy workday. Everyone was always working their hardest to keep up with the flux of orders, this is one of the reasons I was capable of noticing a time saving procedure. By slightly altering the order a package was registered and loaded, a few seconds could be shaved off on each order. This would cause a good amount of time to be saved per day, let alone each year. Other than this, the management and co-workers were excellent to work with!"
good,I learned a lot of different jobs while working at MSC I was giving a chance to show and prove myself to my supervisors and staff.
good,"A typical day at MSC is running error exceptions for the previous day, receiving in product, transporting product from ones side to the other of the warehouse, putting product away, cycle counting, picking, and packing the product to ship."
