rating,review
bad,I wouldn't work form them if they were the late company on Earth. If you don't get paid enough they don't even worry about you. They say they give raise but IV never seen it. They don't fallow o.s.a regulation and they cry if they get there feeling hurts. All around bad company
bad,"For an experienced roughneck would have to be your last option, management cares nothing about the boots on the ground !!! The guys and gals in the field is what makes and breaks a company and when you sht  can em left and right your no better than the mom and pops company’s who pay minimum wage"
bad,"No room for growth and advancement. Good-ole-boy culture still exists and management doesn't try to change it. If you want an opportunity to start on the ground floor and move up, it's worth it."
bad,"Discrimination,racism,unsafe practices and if you say anything about it they get together cover it up and put Are you in a hostile work environment and hassle you until your run off"
bad,"This company is hard to work for and be satisfied. The only workers who seemed happy were mid level managers who never left the office. They are willing to sacrifice safety and well being in almost every aspect.To be fair, their aquisition company was a different corporation."
bad,This is a very dangerous place to work. Would not recommend anybody to work for this company. Patterson-UTI management are very disrespectful to you. Bad place to work
bad,"Constantly berated on job performance . Constant screaming and hollering from supervisors regardless of skill level. Attitudes changed when upline supervisors on floor or of in ear shot  all out terrible company to work for, ........................................................"
bad,"This by far was one of the hardest jobs I have ever had.  The pay and benefits were great, however, the traveling and hours are long.  You would work 12 to 13 days for two weeks, then have two weeks off, that was nice as times."
bad,Terrible dishonest place to work  filed bankruptcy shorted a lot of their employees out of pay just a terrible place to work fired people no reason brought people in from out of state worst place I've ever worked
bad,was a good place to work great benefits and good work hours. had a lot of overtime to offer its employees and had great benefits for their employees. great place to work
bad,"Poor living conditions, the mancamps are dumps. Extremely poor upper management, treat you like garbage unless your one of their buddies that they got jobs."
bad,"My typical day at work at  was to stay safe."
bad,"Poor management, poor crew running, safety of crew wasn't good. Bad company the sold out real quick after I started working for them."
bad,I liked this company at girst but later in my career I would come to see the poor management and unfair treatment of employees. Hiring friends for advancement before eligible employees that deserve it.
bad,"After being an employee for 6 years, I got laid off when the oilfield crashed form one day to the next and without any benefits"
bad,This company don't care about their employees they always make you feel like you can be fired at any minute and replaced the next day I felt very unsafe towards the end most of the managers that they are promoting don't know how to do their job they promote people by how much of the policies they know and not how good they can do their jod. You have to halfhour or more to the drilling rig
bad,"Talked  about people over iron. Mess up once, and you are gone. Rig managers can work 24 hrs a day, with no relief. Hard to promote unless you have been on same rig the longest"
bad,Hurt my back. Payed 100% out of my pocket saving the company only to be sent back to a different rig round trip fishing crashed casing every day. Broken tools they throw away(employees) @8 yrs with patt. Post tour meetings were ripped off all most 2 hrs per week overtime.violation withe US dept of labor
bad,I was actually excited to work here when I first started then over time when new managment took over then I could see a big change and the moral tanked with the crazy amount of micromanaging. The management honestly doesn't know it's people and the communication is non existent except when anything affects them then it was put on us with the field is never wrong mentality and not truly sticking up for the employees. There's also certain employees who've been there for a year or so with no raise. It's very cut throat and clickish. Favoritism and double standards are rampant.
bad,stressful with lack of help unsafe practices. company preaches safety but when safety slow down work it goes out the window. not a very good company in my opinion
bad,"This is really sad to say cause initially I was excited to work for Patterson. After having been there for over a year and applying for advancement opportunities, I was denied at every corner. The management lies constantly and will do anything to make sure they don't get blamed for things they are responsible for. Some say this is true in the oil industry across the board but I have worked for three other companies and didn't have these types of problems. Regardless what the name of the company is and how big it is honesty is the best policy and if your managers aren't being honest you can expect that their subordinates aren't being honest either. It starts at the top though. The management wants you to be honest but they don't have to be, they will twist what you say to cover them selves every time."
bad,only hire realitves or friends of there familes// no exer needed
bad,First time I worked for them was treated badly after an injury second time only reason I worked for them was because they bought out my company afterwards they treated all the people from Nomac like we were idiots and didn’t give us any respect
bad,"Patterson was a cut throat work environment.  Having worked in other industries it was amazing to me that in such a toxic work environment anything ever got accomplished  Upper management did make an attempt bringing in life coaches to coach the management teams, however the roughneck mentality drove the company form the top down."
bad,No one wants to train you and everyone thinks your out to take their job housing on site sucked couldn’t get sleep all you hear is trucks and the rig all night
bad,great work long hours and great pay. no more work because the price of oil is down and wont see a rig for a while. nothing that will change
bad,Found working for Patterson's was a unsafe company they didnt take safety as seriously as they made it out to be they never used stop work authority  so was unwaited safe
bad,"Takes a hardened type of person to work here, messes with you mentally and physically demanding. The yelling and stress to move 100mph a 150% of the time can break you down. Only work here if you are single with no kids...."
bad,"poor management and disregarded safety...stressful surroundings coming from lack of interest in great performance on the job, management were unprofessional and used foul language and degrading remarks to belittle performance of each employee"
bad,"long hard working day trying to rig down or up.Depending on  readiness.I learned alot on safety & preventive measure's on incident's' injury's etc.poor communication could have been better when preparing  for rig moves.With my co worker's i met alot of  good people as well as bad.I always thought if you live by the golden rule it would make the difference.Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.Their's alot of others that just don't care. Now i have learned to walk away and let them be what they are.The hardest part of the job is being left without transportation  not being able to eat due to lack of vehicle's.The best part of the job to me was to put all my efforts in being the hardest worker,doing my job with a hundred and 20%effort and shining at the end of the day for my work ethic's.To me  that ment i gave an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.I also enjoyed when we use to take time out to talk safety & and orientations all day .Then have a big B.B.Q and get together like family that i miss. They quit doing that."
bad,If your not mexican or speaking the language  stay away  if you have  problems  you are on your own please this is why roughnecks know them as splatterson
bad,They are starting over no old hands left inexperienced people only. They over work all employees call them in on days off always short handed.
bad,You do one thing wrong and you have everyone in the office and higher up breathing down your neck waiting and hoping for you to mess up. That’s the sad part
bad,Do not work here!  The company does not care about you at all.  If you like working in the rain or -20 degree weather without a break then you might like it.
bad,I will not go into a lot of details about this company because I might have just clashed with them but I will say I will not seek employment with them again.
bad,Bad place to work as a seasoned professional.  Everyone in field is treated as a roughneck.  Bad communication with foreman.  Expected to work 16 hours every day.  Travel days not paid.  Expected to be able to work on all equipment electrical & mechanical beyond your comfort zone w/o training or assistance.
bad,There is a difference in the upper management talk about how well they take care of and treat their employees and what actually happens.
bad,fast paced and some of the drillers had no interpersonal communication skills. it was all about how fast you could drill a well. there was not much job security.
bad,This work environment one of the absolute worse I've endured with no training background and poor work ethic drug induced innovative techniques that astounds tool pushers lucky to be alive.
bad,"Work 13 hrs a day outside in all weather conditions. Safety, how to manage rig and crew. Management was weak. Instead of helping to try fix problems they found someone to blame. Coworkers good. Working with management. Getting to see all the diffrent places and nature."
bad,"Working for Patterson-UTI drilling can be very difficult at times, The one good thing about his company is there is a lot of time with my family, One of the hardest things is it is very difficult to be noticed by management, wages are low for some people and high for others for doing the same work."
bad,"As for what I think about Patterson UTI, It use to be a good company to work for but over the years they have forgot the most important thing. There employees make the company."
bad,"Would work for them again, if I had to. I havent worked for them in a few years, they might have turned there act around. But I dont believe there was enough pressure for safety."
bad,If you like to stay away from home a lot then this is a job for you.  After you work your 14 days be prepared to work over because someone has decided to drag up after you have already given the company half of your life to them.
bad,"If you aren’t a kiss up friend of a pusher you’re treated like garbage. Cut throat environment, watch your back. If you get lucky and end up on a decent rig it could be good but there isn’t many good rigs."
bad,I worked for Patterson uti for 10+ years they where always fair and honestly company. In the last year its been who you know and not what you know it should always be work performance not WHO you know.
bad,"Making repairs and doing preventive maintenance"
bad,"Well since I cant complete this application with out my review of Patterson Uti. I will try not to be to jugmental.Compensation / Benefits are pretty good for what I here.Management,Culture / Values and Work / Life Balance. Leave alot to be desired I am not saying its this way through out the intire company but in west texas managment has a strangle hold on employees. Expectations of employees is not realistic and they are willing to make heads roll they operate out of fear and intemidation and have a extremily high turn over rate. That is why advancement is pretty good but job security is uncertain. I hate to be so negitive about this but this is exactily what happened to me and my recent termination of employment. Sincerly John doe."
bad,"Typical Day at work, Have safety meeting, set expectations, give them the list of things to do, inforce safety and policies. Manage and coach. Order supples, equipment"
bad,"Used to be a great company to work for, as of late i would not recommend this company any longer. Management have become liars and truly do not care about their employees anymore"
bad,drove myself 20 to nearest hospital. while my body started to shut down from heat exhaustion. then transported to nearest ER by ambulance. safety was not top priority
bad,"safe company money isnt great."
bad,This company has a strong leverage on the Drilling Rig Contractor market and uses this position to ensure that they will be successful in strategic locations.
bad,Started out as a great place to work but as they tried to expand they bought a bunch of old broken down rigs that were a nightmare to work on due to something always being broken.  Along with these rigs came the employees that allowed the rigs to get run down.
bad,"i enjoyed it, we drilled alot and cleaned daily. it was the first top drive rig i have worked on. it was also the first set of st 80s i have ever used. i learned a lil from this experience"
good,hardest thing is being gone a week at a time away from family and dealing with the weather
good,"This company could be so much better and truly corner the market in land based drilling if they invested in thorough training for employees and cut unnecessary expenses. They also need to lean heavily into automation. Supporting jobs is cool and stuff, but making money for your shareholders and junior-senior level professionals is cooler. They spend over $300 million a year in payroll and waste millions in housing/travel that could be saved with proper investment in automation and corporate housing."
good,while working at nomac drilling i experienced alot of favoritism towards certain people . I worked there on and off for almost 25 years and seen alot less qualified people move up before me.
good,hard work and long hours. twevle and half hours a day  seven days every other week. Good money and lot time from home.
good,"The term micro managed is stressed throughout the structure of this company. Over managed in every aspect of every job. Safety is an integral part of the industry but they take it to the point where proficient work is prohibited to be completed. Thus, straining relationships with the operator to a point of no return."
good,"good place to start your career,but not very reliable for long term needs,"
good,"Great place for training and understanding equipment, hard work ethics and great people to work with. Management needs a lot of work with managing how they work with their employees. The employees are all afraid of their jobs and it tends to cause a lack of trust with upper management. It is widely known that you are easily replicable and no second chances no matter who you are."
good,"When I was injured, I was let go after 90 days, and no one has called to see how I was or anything. I would think that they would be a little more interested in the welfare of there employees after they are injured on the job, and required surgery."
good,"A lot of favoritism going on throughout company, could work on management and actually keep the employees that really want to make a career of working on the rigs."
good,I supervised crews and made recommendations on alternative methods or equipment when unusual situations are encountered. Coordinate deliveries of materials to the rig to make sure it is available when required.  Ensure the rig equipment is properly maintained to avoid down time. The hardest part of the job was working a extremely long and hard day and them having to go to my office and finishing all the paper work that they expected. I really enjoyed working with everyone on the job sight we where like family.
good,"It's a drilling company, better than some worse than some. I spent 6 years with the company. You will work in all weather doing manual labor. 14 on 14 off, days off are the best part."
good,"The job I had wasn't hard but long hours on the road. It was not too bad of job great benefits, vacation, sick time, bosses  not too bad."
good,A day at work is not hearing from your drilling superintdent. Having to do what it takes to fill crews and avoid down time.As a rig manager I had no help from the office. All I had was talk. Then having to fill out my rports and all data with no help from the office. the most enjoyable part was getting help from the orginal superintends that were let.
good,Patterson didnt have a very thought out rate of promotion. They wanted you to stay where you were at so they didnt have to find someone else for your job
good,Nomac has many quality/talented hardworking people full of innovative ideas. Unfortunately many of the ideas are never realized because of the restrictive nature of upper management. As a wholly owned subsidiary they developed the poor business practices of their parent company which has had its fair share of difficulty over the last five years. Do your research. Pay particular attention to the failures parallel with runaway industry boom. Research the services group spin-off followed by the bankruptcy.
good,The Chesapeake rig teams were great for the most part. Only issue with one team chief operator who wanted to verbally force me to break policy.  otherwise the guys were helpful and willing to teach. However the same could not be said of the Nomac team members. They're life choices just did not match mine.
good,I made a high wage with good insurance and 401k match and had plenty of time off. Downsides are living out of pocket at remote drilling locations two weeks at a time and management that will wait until the last moment possible to give notice of layoffs.
good,It payed well but you have to travel with the rig and they will conceal impending layoffs until the last moment possible. Unless your company utilities a man camp you live remotely out of pocket two to four weeks at a time on land rigs.
good,The company wasnt really that bad. Made good money. Learned alot from other people that worked there. Long hours on feet but you get use to it. Had good co-man on locations.
good,"Decent company to start with. Fairly competitive pay, mediocre benefits. Like most oil companies, you are treated well when they need you, but they quickly throw you away when they are done with you. I once needed a form from the Midland HR office in order to receive family medical leave. After leaving messages with the HR office for an entire week and being hung up on by the receptionist, I finally had to call the corporate office in Houston to get the paperwork I needed. Made me feel very unimportant and expendable."
good,"• Transport oil rig parts, such as drills and drill bits."
good,"Not very carring of employees lie to employees,employees work hard to be just talked down too"
good,"At 6 am we would start work at the break of dawn. you are the working pieces of rotating machinery all around you. mistakes lead to serious issues because of heavy moving iron all around you. i learned not to take safety for granite. I also learned the meaning of a hard days work. i learned an important life skill. how valuable life really is.The hardest part of the job was the responsibility for others. If something was done wrong it would be dangerous for others, and mistakes happen. the enjoyable part of the job was you had two weeks off before next stint."
good,"Management was stingy about keeping spare parts to keep rig running. First experience being on location 24-hours a day. Management didn't always keep full crews, and complained about downtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with crew members who cared about the job, and teaching inexperienced crew members how to do the job."
good,"There are no ""typical days"".  Everyday something new is bound to pop up.  "
good,"it all depends on what rig you end up on. it varies greatly on the attitude and quality of hands you work with. I was on one really good rig that I really enjoyed. the last rig I was on is the reason I left this company. poor management, sorry hands, poor housekeeping. overall it wasn't a good place to work for me."
good,Always challenging environment. Constantly learning daily. Management very respectful. Co-workers always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was constant policy change. Most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge.
good,"During the Oil Boom in west texas, Patterson was a great place to work if you wanted advancement opportunities because they hundreds of operating rigs and wanted to promote everyone as opposed to hiring people ahead of you.  The hardest part of the job would have to be staying gone from home for 2 weeks to a month."
good,Good company with a safe atmosphere and lots of possibility to move up. Work long hours on the clock with barely any holidays off. Good compensation if you are lucky enough to get with a good energy company. opens doors within the oilfield but relatively low for getting out of the field.
good,Drill for oil in southern New Mexico.  Keep the motors running 24 hours a day.
good,the company needs lots of work and more training. Rules and regulations along with policies constantly changing the employees spend most of their time doing paper work or learning the new policies in order to not be fired for breaking them that their actual job duties and training are neglected and cause bigger issues down the road...
good,Wasn't a bad job just looking to be more local the people are all good to work with you come across the usuall jerks but the work itself is pretty hard so you have to be willing to work
good,Management is competing with each other instead of working together. They require you to do everyone else's job plus your's because they hire incompetent and lazy people.
good,I started under NOMAC Drilling with Chesapeake Energy. At first being part of the is company was busy and I looked forward to growing within the company. The downturn was an eye opener as to how this industry functions. We recently merged into Patterson Drilling and it has been a major adjustment. I have learned in the last 7 years that I do not feel stable in an environment that is not always that way.
good,"Patterson,is good and tries to be safe but hands play a big part in safety,,,rules can only do so much common sense can take you a long way..I injoyed my job with Patterson."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, I learned a lot. I didn't like being away from home, and having to pay for my on travel expenses, the company should have helped out in this area."
good,"They are good job, and the schedule is great for working class familes. they provided housing and had a fair benefits package. They made training efforts and all in all well rounded."
good,"Always productive and interactive job with complex machinery and something new to learn everyday. Excellent work environment, and co-workers. Hardest part is being away from home and sometimes the hours. Most enjoyable part was a good busy and productive day, the pay and days off."
good,"My typical work day was an average day roughnecking. I learned many man valuable skills such as organization, importance of being punctual, and respect of fellow workers. The supervisor were very knowledgeable and supportive. Most days were hard work if you let it be once you learn to "" work the iron, don't let it work you"" the job seems to fall into a rhythm. Hard work outdoors was the best part of the job."
good,"Good pay (not as high as other companies for the same position but you get a schedule instead of following rigs)"
good,"2 weeks on, 1 week off 12 hour shifts, on oil rigs. "
good,Great pay.  Hard work.  Very safe company to work for.  Unfortunately management could be very unprofessional at times.
good,Operating drilling rig equipment and maintaining drilling motors on oil and gas rigs.
good,"The company has the foundation to values but throw them out the window when its crunch time. As far as job security and advancement, advancement wont happen to many lazy people filling those positions the management apparently isn't worried about. The job security part of it is shaky at best. No information flow of the changes that take place."
good,Good work week a lot of work hours overall a good learning experience. Pay was good as well as benefits. Meet good individuals with in the field will to train and implement good work habits.
good,"They would be a good company to start your oil field career, as a young man come out of high school or college. I was bumped back to floor hand  so that my Tool pushers cousin could have my position as a new hire. I was not pleased."
good,"Decent enough career. Just not the one for me. The pay is nice and the time off is great, however I would prefer to work in an office or in a shop where I'm not in the weather."
good,It's a great start if you've never worked in the oil field. They have an extensive new to industry program protecting new hires. Hours are consistent and Rig Managers are very helpful with knowledge and training procedures. Lay offs are yet to be determined since I'm on a list of rigs to get stacked out.
good,Senior operations leadership is strong but support staff was not very developed.Need more top down leadership accountability. Would not recommend this job for someone new to the Oil and Gas industry.
good,"No,ihad,a,good, experience, so,when, we,werent,working,the,floor,or,motors, we,stay,busy,doing,house keeping,then,checing,for,any,leaks, like,air,,or,oil,leaks"
good,Buena empresa buen equipo de trabajo buen sueldo muchos días off
good,"A typical day at work was 12 hour shifts with hard work, but rewarding. The hardest part of this job was working in another state for 7-10 days and away from familly."
good,work culture was good good management learned a lot went from floor hand to driller meet a lot of good people hardest part about job was moving back down because of lack of work to keep job
good,"A very good place to work.  great insurance, 401k and benefits. Lots of holiday, vacation and sick leave. Would go back to work for them."
good,"A day in the oilfield; wake up between 0400-0430 to get ready for the day. Report to pre-tour meeting by 0545, there we'll review safety alerts, discuss days events, our daily goals and any major issues that need attending to. From there make relief with person in same position as oneself then move along to getting any paperwork needed for the day done; it'll be reviewed and signed by each member on the crew. At that point on next 12 plus hours will consist cleaning work area, inspections, preventive maintenance to equipment, mixing and handling chemicals, etc."
good,We had good employees & good equipment. All supervisors were good to work with ( some better than others ). NOMAC DRILLING is a good company.
good,"long hard days or nights, co workers help the hitch go by quicker. 14 days of work 14 days off. Winters were challenging. upper management is bad, our pusher and superintendent  is awesome"
good,Loved the job here and the people just not all of the direct supervisers were up to the job they were doing. Over all the work exsperiance was good and i really liked it.
good,Was always treated fairly by everyone. there were things that could have been done better so that you felt more like a team. Managers tried to make everyone feel involved.
good,This company is very demanding. Job attention to detail is required at all times and being in physical shape is required also.
good,"Management difficult to work for"
good,"General floorhand and derrickhand duties- tripping pipe, moving rig, and all aspects of daily operations. Physical labor daily, swinging tongs, sledge hammers etc.."
good,"In beginning job was great. I got promoted from derrickhand to driller. When things were slowing down and people were getting laid off, rigs stacking and people including me were demoted to lower positions. When I complained of harassment I was laid off."
good,As a Floorhand with Patterson it was basically like any other place you had your good days and your bad days
good,"Competitive pay, opportunities for upward mobility. Good benefits, good working environment."
good,"Very good pay and benefits,  overall a very good company to work for."
good,Patterson has plenty of work but they make lots of promises of bonuses and advancement in training but you later find out that there are very few rigs that bonus and I haven't seen advancement often.  Pay is ok but not worth it if you have to travel several hours because you end up spending so much in gas that you don't make more than you would in a local job.
good,nice enviroment to work in tools very accessable.majorioty of people very nice to work with
good,"It's a job that takes you away from your family a lot. Extremely corporate. There's constant policy changes. I would recommend this job to someone without a family or having to drive 13 hours to work and 13 hours home after working for 12 hours. Family is important and i think the main motto should be, don't get so busy working that you quit getting busy making a life."
good,I learned a great deal while working for Patterson on the oil rig.  My job advancements were based on how much I learned while on the job.  I went from entry-level to motorman and work as a derrick hand as well.
good,"I planned on staying at PTEN for another career but the quailty of life was poor. The information flow was poor and I was a key figure and held a key position. The was no real chance for advancement unless you knew someone or were a favorite. Standing your ground for whats best for the company is not the right thing to do and definitely do not trade respectfully with a higher up as you are not ever going to be forgiven, backs will be turned on you."
good,"Patterson uti Drilling is a a unsafe company to work for they work sloppy and do not care abut one another, they do not understad what team work means."
good,"company was good while it was nomac drilling ,once patterson bought us out and they started forcing polices down our throats and threating to run off good experienced employees , one rig manager was great . the other one had his head stuck so far up managements butt and was a two faced brown noser"
good,Patterson UTI Drilling is a large oilfield company.  Working with good people throughout the states was a very rewarding experience and can continue to be thru any career in the future.
good,Physical work and paid very well. Was told during orientation that we did not have to worry about being laid off witch due to the huge dip in the economy was false. But overall was a good company to work for and when thinks pick up will defiantly go back.
good,I worked hard and showed ambition and dedication and was promoted early after showing I was Capable of Handling Responsibility. Sad thing  was when the oil prices feel they let go people not based on Job Performance but based on Time in Service. Needless to Say I was laid off.
good,"Key fob use to enter building, each employee other than managers share a 2 desk office. Most co-workers would drown out any outside noise by keeping in earphones. The easiest part of the job was the work itself, I enjoy data entry. The hardest part were the excessive overtime hours and having 3 children waiting for me at home."
good,overall Patterson is pretty dangerous an treat their employees pretty badly for the most part. a lot of name calling a lot of bringing people down an making them feel stupid an worthless when they don't deserve it. this does not happen to me but I've seen it plenty of times.
good,"Energy company's are paying 6 man crews and 1 bunk house isn't cutting it. No room for groceries, you have to wait to shower, lack of sleep, my whole rig is looking for new jobs. There is plenty of extra camps from stacked out rigs this is crazy we are packed like sardines in one camp even smaller outfits like sidewinder and precision have diffrent style camps or 2 camps for the rig hands..."
good,"great people to work for, fun leadership opportunity to grow, i didn't like that we had to stay at the job sight for weeks at a time without seeing family"
good,"Micro managing, Learned to listen to employees in order to find a solution to keep moral up due to the down fall of oil prices.  The hardest part of this job was the to micro manage our employees and keeping a customer happy due to the market down fall and moving employees around.  My most enjoyable part of the day was visiting a clean and safe rig and being able to coach employees instead of cleaning a rig up."
good,The turn over of upper management is too high. It has caused too many unhappy employees because I not promoting within instead of raising up within the crew that stood by during slowdown times.
good,"Patterson is a large drilling company who has undergone many changes for the good of the company that has helped them become a leading drilling contractor in the US. That being said they should allow more time for changes to take place with employees and policies, there is a general tendency to change things faster than can be incorporated in the operation as a whole."
good,Good place to be lots of advancement opportunities. People were willing to train and teach so that you could become better as a person and a hand.
good,"No problems, I know the job and I do what I am required to do plus more"
good,"A typical work day consisted of a 12.5 hr schedule for 14 days in a row with high amounts of physical labor."
good,Patterson UTI wasnt a bad place to work when I worked for them from 2003 T/2008. I left Patterson on good terms to further my career for a drilling position.
good,"A typical day at work for me making a walk around the rig getting a to do list for  my crew,checking all well control equipment before going up to the drillers cabin. I learned the math need to kill a well after a influx of gas,oil,or saltwater entered the well bore. Management could use alittle work their was alot of saying one thing then doing another(not sticking to your roots). My co-workers all had a positive attitude always looking after one another leading a helping hand instead of walking away,commucated with one another clearly. The hardest part of the job for me was being away from home alot. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was that we where providing gas and oil to millions of people,"
good,"I loved this company I moved up quick, got paid well, and enjoyed the rigs I was on. However some of the people higher up are less then be desired."
good,Morning started with a safety meeting. Take inventory on trucks to see which trucks where on the line to decide which trucks needed to be serviced for the day. Once trucks were serviced make sure proper paper work was completed to show that they had been serviced. After lunch assist other mechanics with current jobs that needed to be finished. At the end of the day clean and ready the shop for the next morning.
good,"good place to work but low pay. a lot of good people work there but some are as you say buddy buddy. and if your not there buddy they treat you like dirt and I don't believe in that, and the rig manager always gets mad if you need him bt that is his job. they do have some lazy people"
good,you never know when the next lay off will come. Move from one state to another with little or no heads up.
good,"It is what you think it is. 2 weeks on 2 weeks off. Hard work, make what you want of it."
good,i started when it was thomas drilling then bronco drilling then nomac drilling at first it hard but i had to learn new thing roll over or buy out came with new rules and but i have to say when nomac took over the pay was good
good,Patterson UTI is a progressive drilling company committed to pleasing their public shareholders. Work sight safety is a core value. A usual work day involves production operations and vigilant maintenance upkeep. I gained many mechanical skills and greatly improved trouble shooting skills as well as people skills. Balancing the latest priority with completion of previous assignments was always the greatest challenge any given work day.  The most difficult part of the drilling industry is the politics as anywhere and increased with responsibilities. I personally enjoyed the work schedule.
good,"a typical day at work consists of  a lot of hard labor, very fast paced and nonstop.  at the end of  a  12-14 hour day  i  will be wore  out  but  ready  to get after  it again the next day.  i  normally get along really well with all my coworkers, we  are all there to  get the  job done safely and efficiently.   the  hardest part of my  job  is being able to push myself beyond my limits to make the job of my coworkers easier and the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with good people who want nothing more than to be able to work with me and go home with all appendages and digits that we came to work with."
good,i learned alot working for patterson uti drilling i wasnt pleased with the way i was notified about being laid off. hardest part was trying to find something new to make the type of money i was being paid in order to keep up with my bills and family.
good,"We had good moral on the crew that I was on. We worked very well together, but did have a lot of down time due to faulty equipment. We would all work together to get the job done to the best of our abilities."
good,hard work and never expected anything different. i learned alot of new things working for patterson. managment was good to us. getting off after a hard day at work.
good,Good company to work for. The job was fast paced and dangerous. I would recommend this company to anyone. I had to travel 14 hours to get to the drilling rig.
good,"long days,hard work,very fast paced. pay is good and time off is nice. . you learn a lot of different things and learn to help each other."
good,Maintaining a drilling rig and safe operations. Most of the work is manual labor but with motivation one can move up decently quickly to a best job.
good,"summer days are hot"
good,"I worked in the trucking department, I had very good management. I was working as a temp, I only wish I could have been hired as a full time employee."
good,"Pay is comparable to others "
good,"Good place to make a living cares about employees."
good,Patterson UTI allowed me to get into the oil and gas industry without any experience. Worked my way up through every rig bssed position. Good Safety culture. Competitive pay scale. Multiple training courses through elearnings and instructor led courses.
good,Management could use some training on how to promote production. This was a very satisfying job. It was very fast paced and there was always something to do.
good,it was a great job and i truly believe that i would still be there if it werent for the layoffs. The job payed well and the time on vs. the time off was pretty good.
good,"Old school mentality on location. Culture shift and paradigm switch at corporate level. You must be willing to work with people of all different points in their life and socioeconomic backgrounds. After about six months people feel entitled to only do certain aspects of their job, leaving the real work for those who came after them. Depending on the rig, safety can be a real issue. It stems from poor leadership."
good,"A typical day consists of hard physical labor for 12.5 hrs a day without breaks."
good,Long hours. great pay. if you have a good crew then you can have a great experience. be careful of anyone that chooses drugs to get the job done. I became a better person for having worked with them.
good,Physical job in the elements. Work 12.5 hours a day for 14 days then have 14 days off. Job is cut throat and not for the faint of heart. as long as you're willing to keep pushing and learn you'll be ok.
good,"It's a hard job. Not for all types of people. The work life balance ins't very good, they are always calling you in on your days off."
good,"The company wasnt bad to work for, I was there when Patterson bought Key Energy whom had a lot of junk iron. When better quality rigs started showing up it was a nice place to work."
good,"A good job in a generally friendly but highly professional, demanding corporate environment.  I loved doing my everyday work, but the environment did not fit my personality or background. Do your research on the company first.  Typical oil and gas company, but not buttoned up and running like clockwork like some of the larger companies."
good,Corporate and field responsibilities with a very high travel volume. In constant transition of leadership style. somewhat unstable
good,"Great entry level pay. Hard being away from family members for weeks at a time and job can be unstabel at times due to market conditions. Other than that, a good place to work"
good,"14 days/14 days off. Hard work, good pay, good benefits. Job security based entirely on market demands.  Good place to work and gain experience in the oil and gas industry."
good,Safety meeting and job list on what needs to be done to operate a rig.  Use of hand tools and equipment to keep the energy company happy and get the job done.
good,I enjoyed this job the workers were great and I learned so much from everyone. A typical day could range from so many things from tripping pipe to rigging down and moving the rig to new location and rigging back up.
good,"Very good place to work, family oriented place to work. The upper management take good care of you and treat you with respect."
good,"Typical drilling rig stuff.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Expect you to work while your on the clock, don't put up with lazy people.  Good job in my opinion."
good,"Perform Daily Maintenance on all equipment, clean work areas and practice safe work practices. I learned how to efficiently maintain all equipment and function properly. Managers were great to work with, they were not only managers they were teachers. Everyone I had to work with was hard working and polite. Long work days and being away from home. The people I worked with and the things that I learned."
good,I would work 12.5 hours a day. I learned how to work the floor during all operations of drilling. I was also able to learn how to work Derrickhand for 3 months while our hand was on medical leave.
good,"For oilfield companies, Patterson UTI is one of the most organized and safety-conscious employers out there.  They also make sure their employees receive continual training through outside classes.  The hardest part of the job is staying away from your family, but the benefits of extra time off are worth it."
good,"To build and construct oil rigs from the ground up. "
good,"Descent company, in the beginning but per diem didn't work out.  I worked out of state and had to buy plane tickets for travel.  That got to expensive and I couldn't afford to work for them anymore.  I was working for money to keep working for them and couldn't keep up.  I wished they would bring more jobs back to Oklahoma."
good,Patterson is growing everyday. Work as superintendent for 7 years.
good,Fast tracked to Motor Hand and received an excellent working knowledge of drilling operations
good,Patterson UTI is a prideful company with very strong safety requirements and a lots of operational advancement opportunities.
good,"I learned how the Kelly Rig worked.. Learned how to throw Thongs, Latch Elevators, Set Slips, Throw Chain. Watch for potential pinch points, Slip/Trip Hazards, stay clear of rotating equipment, B.Y.B.K"
good,lots of room for advancement steadily growing company and always try to help there employees in any way they can
good,Just like a lot of rigs you had a good pusher and a bad pusher.
good,Patterson uti is a great company very big in safety and plenty of room for advancement hard work pays off..put your best foot forward and fill out an application online ..good luck
good,"It was a great paying job that was challenging, physically demanding. I enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere. I enjoyed the learning curve. It was a job with little guarentee for stability."
good,Hard work and dirty environment in all weather conditions. Must be willing to work day or night. You could be on call and work extra shifts.The reward is the pay off.
good,This job requires long hours and hard work.  Pay is decent and must be willing to travel.  Time off is nice and makes it easy to make plans with family  and friends
good,"Good benefits, compensation. Most people got along except a couple who were bullies and no discipline was given. Plenty of overtime during certain times of the season."
good,"Our Team daily task consisted of Hazard hunt's as a team. Daily risk assesment's. Proper hand over note's and communication with employee leaving job sight. "
good,"12+ hours days. Good organization and mostly friendly people. Some long hours in the logistics department as they work a rotational schedule, but had unpaid time off."
good,We worked 12.5 hr a day or night depending on the hitch. The hardest part was pulling slipps and tripping pipe. I learned a lot about how the oil field works and wouldnt change my experience for anythin
good,at patterson wwe felt like real men doing a manly job and we had a small crew we worked alone and supervised ourself we worked 7 days a week every week so we worked every day and the work was very dangerous i had friends die. so i moved on.
good,Wake up for meetings everyday to know what's going on. You learn something new everyday. Management could be better. Working outside is great not to feel cramped. Overall it's a good company to work for
good,Great place to work and advance. Very competitive and rewarding. Great for learning and enhancing  skills. Great leadership  and a fun workplace.  Pay good and good time off.
good,"Patterson was a great place to work when times were good. I moved up fast and got a lot of attaboys. However, as of the past year with oil prices dwindling down and work isn't there people have a tendency to become cut throat. Its not patterson it is just the industry as a whole."
good,Constant cleaning and maintaining of equipment. Always busy with all sorts of jobs ranging from scrubbing floors to troubleshooting complicated computer systems. Incredible amount of invaluable skills learned. Hardest part of the job was working 12+ hours for 7-14 days straight being a long distance from home. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet so many people from such diverse backgrounds and getting to learn about them.
good,"0430 wake up to complete personal hygiene and prepare myself for work. At 0545 we hold a pre tour safety meeting discussing expected days events as well as  any safety alerts. Once out of our safety meeting you'll find the person you're making relief with gathering information from him or her as well. After relief get your daily paperwork together and in order. Next conduct a walk around the work place checking for any issues, spills, tools / equipment out of place. From there depending on what you found during a walk around or what the manager put out in your meeting; you begin working on those items. While working on items that needs accomplished you'll have to report to the floor to make a connection every hour or so depending on drilling. An hour or so before shift is over you take the time to clean the work area and replace whatever tools has been used."
good,"Good company,  some management was hard to work for.  Alot of great experience in the HSE"
good,"Hard Labor"
good,Pushers treat you with respect and are not afraid to get dirty. Great people as co-workers. But safety personal and upper management are a joke. They talk to you like your stupid and lie to get their way.
good,"Long and hard labor mostly, learned many life skills, management is great and focused, culture has an inclusive mindset due to work environment, job is very physically demanding, and the pay and benefits are the best part."
good,For the most part I enjoyed working here. It's pretty fast paced work. Really physical so if you don't like to work this probably won't be for you. Safety oriented
good,I was a derrickman on an oil rig so I worked out of town. Job was good as I was single and away from home half the year. very good pay as it is standard for all oil rig companies
good,"You will definitely feel welcomed the minute you walk in. Everybody from top senior executives to your office support will make direct eye contact and will greet you. Now that is something you don't get everyday! If you are vocal about wanting to be challenged and the willingness to learn on the job, this place is for you!"
good,"Safety had been concerning issue with this company. The equipment is good and reliable. The amount of rigs blowing out, fires, etc, explosions, been very concerning."
good,"Waiting for phone calls to handle desktop, laptop, tablet issues with users throughout the USA. Learned how to work within a team setting. Management changed from great management (communication was on key, training was helpful) to not so great, poor communication, unhelpful, no training."
good,Patterson is a contract drilling company they pay about the same as  there compatension and are a fairly good company to work for.Benefits start after 2 weeks
good,Management was not fair at times likely get wrote up without warranting some the workers were bias some of our meals were catered by the company man 2
good,Patterson has a good safe work environment although I wasn't able to move up here I transferred to Oklahoma and moved up all in all it's a large enough company to take care of you I would recommend working there
good,Fast paced. Was lucky all crews worked well with one another. Rig moves on days off was the worst part for me. All though i enjoyed the money. Would definetly go back
good,Working at Nomac Drilling was always an adventure when on duty.  I really enjoyed the different places across the US that I got to work and most of the people I got to work with as well.
good,"I last worked in the yard wiring electrical motors/components for new rigs being built."
good,Patterson allowed me freedom of responsibility.  I was left with a list of tasks to complete and was happy to delegate and successfully complete them efficiently and safely.
good,"Challenging job, full of surprise on a day to day basis never expecting the expected, instead things tended to be unexpected and then getting to work through the issue or problem doing whatever it takes along with the help and group effort of my co workers. The oil busts are the bad part."
good,"Working on rig floor"
good,Working as a team with 3rd party companies and meeting new people all the time. Is what i miss about working for Patterson
good,"7 days on / 7 days off schedule worked really well for me at the time."
good,"Patterson UTI has been a good company to work for from my experience, I've been given the opportunities to move up withing the company.Everyone i worked with was safety minded just as I.Due to having to spend the last 3 years away from my family and daughter ive decided to try to look  for something that will allow that."
good,"Met several really intelligent folks while working with Patterson, unfortunately most of them were not in management positions while I was employed there. Things have since changed and I believe they are a great company to work for now."
good,They always took the time to work with everyone so that we all felt like we were part of the team and not left out. it was a great place to be and feel welcome.
good,"Patterson is a great place to work, with great people. Advancement in this company is harder than I have had to deal with before.  The hardest part of my job was leaving my family to be away for 2 weeks at a time but it was all worth it in the end financially.  Patterson did give me the opportunity to get my well control certification and I am thankful for that.  Overall it was a great place to work."
good,"Long days, but go fast when you stay busy."
good,"This has been a good place to work I have become a stronger leader so that I can further my career in the oil and gas industry. They offered a lot of classes so that everyone could learn and better themselves. Learning how to better lead people by setting expectations, getting feedback, and getting results."
good,a typical day involved maintaining mud and working the board. keep mud pumps running and shakers shaking. good place to advance
good,"good equipment,worked up from floors to drilling,for the most part enjoyed working there"
good,"it is a good place to work,and learn alot of new idea's, safety culture is good, they do care about there people."
good,"Both Bronco and Nomac the job duties were the same.I would wake up make my rounds,take my readings enter them into my data work sheet print the sheet annd get it sighned by the rig manager. I would inventory and stock parts for three top drives. I learned several difrent rig types and new top drives. The people that I worked with on the rigs seemed to be very helpful we all got a longe pretty well.The hardest part of my job was the hrs some times I would work 28,30 or 38 hrs with no rest.The best part of the job was when the compantman would cater in food."
good,a typical day we would start out at the meeting room go over our assignments ect worked untill shift was over sometimes their werent any breaks to much was going on very high pace job fun.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Patterson. It's a good place to work.  Knowledge and helping you learn and grow are very important to management and other members of your team
good,"the work environment creates a bonding among employees considering we are around each other 24 7 for 14 days."
good,"Not to many people promoted within  lots of outside people hired , turn around rate very high, steady work with major companies......................."
good,"Large company, nice equipment and very high safety standards. There are advancement opportunities but you have to be serious about your job and the safety of you amd your fellow employees. Overall a great place to work."
good,"great company to work for, I worked on a rig with the company, it turned into a really safe company and I really enjoyed working for them.  I would really recommend working for this company"
good,drilling fast and productive how to work at fast pace but yet safe management is always available to answer questions sometime ahead of the plan sleeping on the top bunk and having to get down to go to the restroom going home on pay day to my family that I`ve missed all week.
good,i loved the every day challenges of never knowing what the day will be like. the work was crucial some days and other was very easy.
good,I have worked for Patterson-UTI for going on 12 years and have everything about the drilling industr.  They have a great culture of safety and the men that work for them are the best at what they do.
good,Day to day is normal. If you have a good crew that treats you like family a lot can get done. Not a lot of room for advancement unless you know someone who is higher up. Great place to work of you are looking for some good money.
good,They focus on safety all the time with this company always taking the time to inspect the rig and getting to know everyone that works for the company. One of the better places I have been for not just being a number.
good,Working for Nomac Drilling was a great experience. Taught me a wide variety of skills I did not know that I possessed. Great people to work with and they became like family to me. Too bad the oilfield is an unstable career and I was laid off due to lack of available work.
good,"Nomac was a great company to work for.  The rigs we worked on were designed and put together to breakdown and set up quickly.  The weather was bad to say the least but they had heaters set up to keep everything thawed out.   Everything was set and structured to provide the employees the chance to move up but not too quickly.  Safety was the most important thing about Nomac, it wasn't a good job if you couldn't do it safely."
good,"Reginal Technicial Service Manager was very good. Working in Alaska was a very good experanice, worded with good people."
good,"I have worked for Patterson UTI for nearly a year. I have never had a job that I gave that much to. I was paid well and worked hard for my money. The men I worked under were very experienced and excellent supervisors who were not afraid to get their hands dirty. If I had a gripe about Patterson it would be their utilization and assessment of their employees.I have literally had to train hands with years more time with the company than I had. Patterson bases promotion on time in rather than ability and performance. I am no scholar but I can see no good resulting from this policy. Good hands are going home while ne'er do wells and incompetents coasting on ""seniority"" are still making paychecks. All in all I loved working for Patterson. STAY IN THE DIRT 266!!!"
good,"Working for Patterson was awesome. I enjoyed the work I did most of the time as a floorhand, between scrubbing, making connections, tripping in or out of the whole, changing the bit, or doing daily chores."
good,Managers seemed to want to help create smooth working environment due to the high volume of hires needed to staff locations. Days could be long but always productive.  Always a lot of work to be completed with deadlines each day but it wasn't as stressful as some places are to work.
good,"safety is very important to Patterson 326, its a great place to work with great people, shouldn't have left, wishing the pay was a little better and opportunity to move up faster. hardest part of the day is probably rig move. easiest is tripping in/out."
good,"Managed two six men crews, on a 12hr shift"
good,"Some of the best people and worst people you could imagine work for this company and it kind of makes it even out. If you have never worked on a drilling rig before Nomac will teach you what you need to know. You work 7 and 7 or 14 and 14, 12 hours a day."
good,"Floor hand, Patterson UTI Drilling Company, Oklahoma City, OK Aug 2011- Present"
good,really good safety oriented place to work. Friendly atmosphere. lots of knowledge through management.  they have really good equipment to work on. good benefits.
good,"Work with Patterson  is a career, not for everyone. It pays good with benefits to meet your needs. Long hours in inclement weather.  But payoff is worth it."
good,"Pay as an Operator could be better, but our supervisors care enough to make sure we dont lose our job. If you communicate. The work is not hard if you use common sense."
good,Time at work stayed very quick paced so time went by fast. There were very hard days but also days that where more laid back. I enjoyed my work there and wouldnt have left but got married and wanted to spend more time at home instead of on the road.
good,Typical day on a drilling rig involves day to day tasks keeping rig clean and running efficiently. I started as floorhand and in my seven years working on patterson rig 1 i became a driller
good,"Trip pipe, clean and maintain rig and equipment. Drill wells to customer plan. "
good,Working for Patterson on an oil rig pays really well.  The schedule is two weeks on and two weeks off.  This allows plenty of time to be home with the family for days in a row.  Management wasn't the greatest but room for advancement was there.
good,"10 years working for the company. Good Safety Training and experienced workers.  2 week on and 2 week off schedule. Bi weekly Pay. Fast paced, hard strenuous work."
good,"since I work there I have been able to take their way of thinking home with me for a better way of living I really like their hiring knowing people around me will be safe and they hire from the U,S.A. military safety went a ,little over board but if my kid had to work there I would know he was in  good hands"
good,"Great job to have when the economy is good. Make enough money as an entry level than most. Tough environment to work in, most dont last long. Building a trust level with my coworkers, we are accountable for each other."
good,"This is a good company to work for, a month after I left I immediately regretted leaving the company.  They are very safe in a lot of thing and I felt very same when I worked there.  The pay is decent and the benefits are good as well, (Blue cross blue shield)."
good,"When i started working here, there was no days off. They did begin adding an additional member to each crew, and added another crew to start a days off schedule. They offered good wages and benefit packages."
good,"As a leader in the drilling industry, they are able to offer work in many regions of the country, with great wages, benefits, and incentives. They are serious about the safety programs of the company."
good,Patterson was an amazing place to work. I would not recommend to someone who simply wants a paycheck handed to them. The pay and time off are practically unbeatable.
good,"best place I have worked in my life so far, hard working place and they are not afraid to promote if u earn it. good management , great schedules and no shortage of work if ur working and willing to work"
good,"Good place to work. A lot of focus on safety for employees. Lots of polices that protect employees and the company. I learned a lot about transportations, working safe, working with team members, and learned how to become an efficient and loyal manager. Management was helpful in teaching and helping employees grow in the company. The hardest part of my job was working out of town for the last four years. The best part of the job was getting to coach and develop employees talents into something they did not know was possible."
good,Very professional and rewarding company to work for. Outstanding safety and HR departments also. The people at Patterson truly operate with the family first motto.
good,"Lot of good guys here willing to help and teach. Miss this job and wish I could do it again."
good,"13 hour shifts"
good,"Working with others in the workforce I have learned patience, comardery, knowledge of the job i am doing, I love work  to and am not afraid of hard work.  I can be depended on to show up on time and complete every task."
good,"Great job, great money, lots of time off after 2 weeks work 1 week of to relax, travel, and basically anything else."
good,be safe work as a team know what your about to work on what are the hazards what can I do to reduce the hazards sometimes got lunch catered and get the task at hand done in a timely fashion
good,"The rig i worked on was awesome.  The management at the rig was amazing. But, the management  at the office that made all the decisions, was a little less to be desired."
good,"Exelente compañía, tienen muy buenos beneficios, muchas pólizas de seguridad para cuidar a su personal, lo único malo es que necesita pagar un poco mejor."
good,All drilling companies are the same besides the safety standards. This company has a ton of paperwork and safety stuff. Your rig managers will either make you quit or stay at your job.
good,This company is a real good company. Great benefits at resonable prices. Never had a problem with this company or its supervisors. Human resources was quick and efficient with any and all issues.
good,Even with my rig experience Patterson hires you at bottom and work back up. Due to stacked rigs i wasnt able to move up as there plan for me and worked floors for 6 months until Neck pain that been having for over a year increased and had to take leave of absence unpaid. Spent 2 months seeing a surgeon to have injection in my neck and had to wsit additional 2 weeks after injection to be released.  1 week before dr visit Patterson laid me off so they can fill my position with full time employee since we didn't have exact date to return 100%
good,"The company as a whole seems to care about the safety and well-being of the employees, the compensation and benefits are pretty good, and the work home time is excellent. Provided housing is pretty lackluster, I have heard that some of the newer rigs have better housing though. Overall the company has been fair to me and my family."
good,I had a great time with the company. Good rigs to work on. Given the nessacary items needed for repairs. I am reapplying at this time. Worked all over the U.S.A.
good,Company was good to work for. Always having good training meetings. Upper management ( office personal ) is hard to trust. All rig personal were great to work with including the tech people. During slow down periods the office personal were very unprofessional in some of the ways people were laid off or let go.
good,"Good company with great benefits! They match up to 4 percent on 401K. Jobs are located all across different states throughout the United States. Texas, Ohio, N. Dakota just to name a few."
good,"Good work place, housing was provided, you can easily move up positions, worked about 4-5 hrs from home. Worked a 14-14 on and off schedule rotation from nights to days."
good,I worked lead tongs then moved up to motorman and I was always eager to learn the work was at times very physically challenging as well as mentally but all in all it was a great job with great pay and very safety orientated
good,Crews worked together. A lot of experienced workers. Great benefits. Rig Managers open minded and helpful in situations. Yearly classes on rig specific training.
good,Nota bad company need more safety and better management better training room for advancement better pay not to employ so many new hands better equipment more training
good,"Good Drilling rigs, worked with good employees. Keeping work areas clean, maintain equipment. Had fun and enjoyed who I worked with. Great Rig manager, always kept us informed."
good,"Working with Patterson UTI Drilling, LLC was a day to day adventure."
good,Patterson Drilling as a Land drilling company was a great company to work for. The company office personnel knew most of the employees by name so you felt like an asset to the company.
good,Need to be able to work long hours of 12 to 16 hrs a day. With 14 day straight schedule. Working days or nights doing this. Work outside all year long in all types of weather. Need to be able to be gone from home and family for this whole time because not all rigs are close to home. Get to meet new people from all over the world . Patterson Is committed to safety and safety practices
good,"I hate working repetitious jobs, if there is no chance for immediate advancement. very safe-oriented. good pay. good benefits. good boss. wanted to work closer to home"
good,Great place to work. Great people. Lots of good training and experience. Great for a travel job in Oklahoma. The work is great for younger employees also
good,Excellent toolpushers always made sure we had everything we needed to insure that the rig and the drilling process was never impeded. Would sometimes be awarded bonuses for early completion of a well.
good,Nomac Drilling is a good company to work for that takes good care of their employees.  They have great benefits and a great 401k program.  They are a safe company as well.
good,"I am seeking a position that offers a challenge, responsibility, and opportunity"
good,I've worked for Patterson UTI for several years. there is nothing bad that can be said about this company. The treat there hands with the highest priority
good,"I liked working on Patterson rig 24 being a roughneck and llike to do it again on another rig some where else. I liked being out in the field and making a living for myself and family. it gave me new experiences in the field, I've worked in the field moving rigs for years swamping on a bed trucks and picker trucks even on them big trucks called commanders. I started as a leasehand for a couple months and made my way up to be9ing a roughneck which got to be more interesting cause the work was more to my taste which is always keeping busy and always moving."
good,"Typical day: early morning safety meeting, make relief and find out what operation is taking place that day, Fill out safety JRA's related to operations being performed. Make connections of new pipe going into hole, clean while drilling and or conduct visual inspections on equipment for proper and safe operation of said equipment. As motorman check the 3 generators ensure working properly check air tanks, hydraulic lines, mud pumps checking fluids."
good,Safety meeting is at 5:30 a.m. shift change at 6.  Relieve workers working nights ( or vice versa ).  Find out the job at hand and if there were any issues the night before.  Resume with what the other crew was doing.  Normally it will just be making connections and drilling operations.  I learned a lot of about how many variables there are to drilling a 20000 ft hole for the production of gas.  I learned leadership skills and patience.  There were 5 man to a crew and really to me are best considered my second family.  Hardest part of the job would be working out in harsh weather mainly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing everyone work together for a common goal.
good,Patterson UTI started off as a rep company for injuries but turned it around with a new revamp safety program that change alot of ways of doing things and was generally fair to everyone.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, was employed just short of 10 years.  Worked for same crew many years, good employees that were reliable and knew what they were doing.  However, the down side, was stuck at the same position for many years."
good,"Having worked for this company I had the chance"
good,Typical work day was anywhere from 6 am to 10 pm. The thing that I learned the most to improve may management skills was root cause analysis in the event of an incident. My peers were all very professional and dedicated. Hardest part of the job was never having time off. Always tethered to the phone. Most enjoyable part was a very real sense of achievement.
good,Good safety minded company to work for always took care of their people. It was nice to not be another number in the system.

So I can take action to what ever is going on and be a good team leader to do what ever it takes to get the work done safely in a timely manor."
good,I loved working there they always gave me my time off. Great insurance and benefits not much bad about them. I was singled out by a manager that I trained and liked to obtain his position. He came to my rig looking to get me fired because I knew he wasnt qualified for his position and wasnt even my superintendent and said I was unsafe to leave in charge because of a cup of caustic soda on the ground that was in the middle of being cleaned up.

good,"Good drilling company to work for. I was scheduled 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off. My management were great. However, paying for my own airfare and meals ended up being the reason for changing jobs."
good,"Job was extremely physical, required thick skin common sense, intelligence and muscle endurance. This is not a job for the light of heart I have seen grown men cry, throw up and quit in just a few days. I have also seen a 140 lbs woman do everything that I did, pressure washers, wrenches, hand tools and hammers."
good,I really enjoyed working at Nomac I worked a 2week on 2week off schedule good balance of work and personal time the crew and management at the rig worked very well together we were very safety minded yet our rig held every production record E.O.G. had in N.D. and Wyoming

good,Patterson UTI was a very challenging job in which i managed to accomplish all job tasks handed down to me. I managed a team that excelled in all aspects of job. Unfortunately as the industry goes when it slows down people are let go but there is always an oppurtunity on the horizon.

good,Best part about my day is getting to pump a slug start tripping pipe then seeing my relief walk up the stairs. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people that thought they where gods gift to the oil field.
good,Great team work all around. If anyone needed help all you had to do was ask. Everyone's safety came first over the job at hand.
good,"Its a great place to learn about almost anything there is out there, the team leaders are always happy to train the new employees and teach everyone about the next job."
good,I liked working for Patterson was a very safe place to work i enjoyed the 7 0n 7 off and i was close to the house so it made it nice
good,"Large turnover rate. Great supervisory team. Do it right the first time team. Room for advancement. No per diem, travel pay or bonuses, makes for a difficult transitions."

good,A typical day at work is getting up and productively drilling.  
good,Patterson is a good company as my previous company i Worked in Middle East as an Assistant driller with Middle East leading oil and gas company Gulf drilling international. I have over 7 years of total experience working in this field.
good,A great day working with great people is just a learning experience you never know what's coming at you next. The main deal is ending the day safe.
good,"I really enjoyed this job. Stayed busy and they pay was great, however the time I spent away from home, family, and friends was not worth it"
good,"Laid back atmosphere. Different scenery, travel the world."
good,A typical day at work would be doing everything your supervisors expect you to do. I have been on drilling rigs for about 8 years so I know a few things. Our management is ok. The hardest part of the job would be working in the winter time. The best part of my current job is I work 14 days and get 14 days off.
good,3 an half years experience.. for Patterson and Trinidad.. can throw tongs or operate st 80... can work on topdrive or Kelly rig
good,"Working in the oil field is a good way to earn a living if you dont mind being away from home for weeks at a time, but it can be short lived because lay offs come easy and often."
good,"This was a great place to work, if your willing to work hard. The compensation and time off was amazing. The only issue with this profession is the lack of job stability. Also, the crews are extremely intense and may become intimidating and/or uncomfortable to work in the environment of an oil drilling rig."
good,Oil field specialist. Just ask if you would to know more. Minimum 12 hour day. Two weeks straight. One week off. Just need more words
good,The atmosphere was good and safe. We had a safety meeting before every shift and after the shift. Most of the management was concerned about us employees and how we are as people.
good,Just depended on my co-workers as to how our day went but still got the job duties done.
good,"A typical day might be: Setting up, tearing down and moving drill rig. Cleaning drill rig, rig maintenance, making connections, tripping in and out of hole,mixing drilling fluids and some heavy equipment operations. The hardest part of the work was the winters  and everything freezing up. The best part was that you drilled 22,000 feet in the ground in record time.   "
good,"Management treated me right from day one. All co workers where willing to share knowledge. Just like any oil rig job not much security in the long run, but have no complaints about the company."
good,"if your looking for great money and long hours this is the place to be, but if your looking to just sit around and think that your not going to have to work then this isn't the place for you. hard work but great money."
good,I think that Patterson has the best land rigs in the industry. Really good hands and hard workers. The company has good benefits and the pay is fare. I enjoyed working for this company and would go back to them and work in a min.
good,Taught me alot in my 5 years at Patterson UTI Drilling. The equipment was good the Hands an manegment was great. Id still be there if it wasnt for the slow down in the oil field.
good,"Steady but hard job with good pay & benefits for many yrs. Due to down turn in industry, I have retired. I was in charge of rig 24 hrs. a day for 14 day hitch. I trained & mentored crews, reported to office & dealt with oil co. personnel.  Staying awake around the clock in times of hole & equipment problems. Working with excellent crews to solve problems."
good,"Good rotation 14-14 "
good,"Great place of employement, would highly recommend this company to a person looking to grow in a company.  If a person is willing to travel this is the field for you."
good,"From working 12 hour shifts, to acclimating with the environment, the day to day challenges of working on an oil rig can be challenging. It is fast paced, and analytical at times and that is when I work the best. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the differing ideas of many men all at once on any given subject in the drilling process. A typical work day for me is dirty, wet, grueling and yet rewarding. I am a mans man kind of guy who appreciates and values a harder work ethic in providing for his family. Patterson allows each man the opportunity to either make or break themselves while staying safe."
good,Good company that is vey safety conscious. Rig management is good about handling issues that come up on a daily basis. Rig crews work well together to accomplish jobs that need to be done.
good,"No complaints and great company  no major issues  Oil and Gas industry has its positives and negatives. A great job to have to take care family. Senior jobs are stable and high turnover on the rigs.  still a great company, try to work as much as you can before economy slows down the Oil and Gas business"
good,Patterson UTI is a great company to work for. I would definitely work for them again. Overall very safety conscious company to work for. Good pay and compensation and benefits as well.

good,patterson is a great company to work for with good benefits and a fair schedule. keeps up to date with saftey regulations
good,"Thought,planning and confirmation is required when working the cost can be great if it not correct. You are required to think ahead for worst case scenarios and be plan for it."
good,Great company with a huge family first base.  They value there employees greatly! A typical day consist of a pre job safety meeting to go over what's going on and the days expected events.
good,"A typical day is long, hot and tiring but learned a lot in a short period of time from some really experienced pros.  The down turn in the energy industry caused Nomac to lay off field employees otherwise would be going back there for work.  Left at end of last summer to go back to college in the Fall."
good,"12 hr days decent management learned a lot of team work skills, having time off (7-14 days) Lots of time to spend with family"
good,This job will test you mentally and physically. I loved everyday and I was sad to see it end.
good,"General maintenance of drilling equipment"
good,"This job is for some athletic people, who can handle working long hours and stay focused while you do it! Mistakes in the oil field lead to injuries and even termination."
good,"Need more advancement. Leadership. Higher wages. Really enjoyed the 2 week on, 2 week off schedule. Would like to be closer to home more."
good,Was a great company to work for. Work there for a long time and climbed the ladder in the company but got layed off and decided to go to the electric field.
good,Great company and great job up until everyone got laid off when the market crashed. Had good benefits and plenty of room for advancement with this company.
good,"You basically work 530-630 day and night tour. I never met a bad crew or manager in midland or pecos Texas. Work with your crew all tour everyday, go to town to eat with your crew, or cook in the onsite trailers with your crew. Sleep in bunks in onsite trailers with your crew. You see what I am getting at. You get to know each other like family and lookout for each other while doing dangerous work. Everyone on my crew got along and made sure nobody got hurt. They pay great and give you two weeks off straight. You can stay over as much as you want or you dont have to. I personally worked the 90 hours per week plus 40. Management, HR, Internal Development, and Superintendents are all great in midland. It is a very dirty job but they give you all ppe and 4 pairs of coveralls and boots. They also give you the option of attending classroom courses to learn rig knowledge, usages, safety ideas, etc. They provide hands on step by step instructions of every aspect of drilling with mock rigs and equipment setups in the yard. I hate classroom training but found this to be very beneficial once I started working in different locations. If you want to move up the ladder and receive more pay then you gotta learn new positions. Patterson encourages this heavily and you can move up within weeks."
good,I truly enjoyed rig work. Hated that there was lack of drilling work. Was not happy to draw unemployment. Enjoyed working with all my crew and tool pusher.
good,better then average for drilling contractors most of the time! Friendly work environment most of the time everyone works as together but not on all rig's or all crews.
good,"good company to work, safety first. good benefits, 401k, health insurance, good pay, bonuses, clean and nice bunkers to live at the job site. excellent ambient to work."
good,Great company to work for and work a 7 on 7off schedule. Must work away from home quite a bit but you are only working 6 mos out of the year and you are paid extreamly well with great benifits
good,It was a good company to work for I just went back with guys I had worked with for years at Nabors Drilling. The pay is good tho and the rigs are sharp.
good,Often over 7 hours from home. Live on work site in trailer with 6 other guys.Work 12 1/2 hour shifts rain or shine with no breaks.
good,"it was one of the longest jobs i ever had in my life. i enjoyed doing what i did. Had to always be safe. They made us take courses, to get our certificates. To make sure that we were competent at what we did for work"
good,Amazing experience with this company. More like a family then co-workers. My boss and safety team was top notch and everyone worked incredibly hard and well together.
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and compensation package. Great 401K plan. I would recommended this company.
good,"Take control of the drilling fluid system. Maintain drilling mud add mixing an mix chemicals. Keep mud pumps running an fixed any issues that they would have. Working with chemical was the worst part of the day. The co workers were the greatest part we were like family. I learned the best leadership skills working with nomac. The managment at nomac lead by example. "
good,"I was always happy to go to work, where I was well utilized and appreciated. I learned several different techniques in efficiency from the operators and maintenance categories that I had never seen before. My immediate supervisor was a very good manager and good to work for. My coworkers were the best crew I've ever had. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rivalry between crews to be the best at what we do. The hardest part of the job was completing all the paperwork necessary to comply with OSHA regulations."
good,"Work no matter the weather 24/7 operation, learn great team building, management is very solid, co-works are very welcoming. hardest part of the job is the time away from your friends and family,"
good,"Nomac Drilling was an all around excellent place to work for. I stayed employed with nomac for around 7 years. you work half the year with great pay.great management and great co-workers, the job can be stressful, but enjoyed every minute of it"
good,"Typically work a 14 day rotation hitch.  12 hour work days, usually longer depending on production for that particular day.  Lived onsite and worked with a crew of guys that developed into a family like bond."
good,"Make relief a 530 every day for two weeks. you check your tools and equipment at the begging of the day and check the cellar. Then you would go up to the rig floor and check the tools up there you would then go to the dog house and see what the Driller had planned out for you. You would work on the list that he gave you and come up occasionally to make a connection. that's where you would have to floor hands one would prep the top of the pipe and the other would tail in the other pipe with a rope you would stab them and then one of the two floor hands would run the st-80 spinning it up and torqueing it the right specifications which was usually 15,000 psi you would do that all day until relief cam at 530 that morning or that evening depending on if you were on night you would go back to the hotel and eat sleep then come back the next day and you would usually pull the whole string or be setting up to finish the well"
good,"inspecting all equipment to ensure oil and fuel levels, inspect all safety items throughout to make sure we have a good score on our CRI, train floorhands and lend myself to new jobs."
good,"i got an opportunity to serve in many different rolls including my primary management roll with the company. Each of those rolls allowed to build on skill set, and is still of great use to my career field."
good,Patterson UTI is a great place to work. They have a great understanding of work/life balance and allow their employees to manage time well. Projects are challenging and rewarding. Manager feedback is a positive experience.
good,"I would highly recommend Patterson Uti.   They are a great company to work for, people and equipment are great.  When my rig stacked out they made room for me and my crew on another rig"
good,Everyday is different for the most part. Long days in all types of weather conditions. Work 14 days and 14 days off. The people I work with are all good guys. You live with the guys you work with 6 months a year. This is not a job for everyone.
good,"During my job experience i had a lot of on the job training to make sure that i was up to speed on all of the operations of the rig. I was learning to become a derrick hand and to mix mud for the drilling process. The management was very in tune with the crew members and kept a open line of communication at all times. The workplace culture was very competitive and made sure that you kept up with the pace of the job requirements. The hardest part of the job was being away from my family for long periods of time, but i got used to it quickly. the most enjoyable part of the job was assignment completion and knowing that we beat a deadline by 21 days in most cases."
good,Patterson is a good place to work with many benefits and a great working schedule and great competitive pay. Management is willing to work with you and the two weeks off is great.
good,Two weeks of work and then two weeks off sounds great. However it has its ups and its downs. I would go back again if I was a single man who wanted to make a ton of money and have a ton of time off to spend that money.
good,Great job in Pennsylvania. This was interesting to move rigs and work on multiple types of land rigs. this was also a place where I could take practical knowledge with me to other areas.
good,"My work schedule was 7 days on and 7 days off. Challenging job but as long as you are physically fit, willing to learn and advance one can strive at Patterson-UTI. Always pay attention to everything especially if its something new going on or something you not strong at. Co workers are typical co workers when a bunch of men work together. When its hot its HOT when its cold its COLD. Yes its good pay but if that's ALL your in it for you will probably be miserable. Have it in your mind that you'll have to come to every rig move (usually on your off days) All in all its a great job as with anything you have to take the good with the bad and keep pushing."
good,"this job was one of the best jobs I ever had great pay, 2 weeks off every month, great management just sucks because the prices of oil dropping resulted in me being laid off"
good,"I learned a lot with Patterson UTI-Drilling never being on a drilling rig it was new to me but, I learn quick and I have a drive of someone there to prove a point and make a difference. It is more mechanical work which I have been in construction for years more so on remodeling and services type but, I learned a lot quick from repairing equipment, such as pumps, iron-roughneck, tongs, setting up rig when moving or relocating etc, also operating heavy equipment and machinery. One thing I can say is this company is extremely big about safety which meant a lot to me they really care about prevention and people not getting hurt or killed and implement it and procedures everyday. We have great crews with hard workers making the work balanced and more appreciative to be working together. It makes a world of difference to not be the only one out there giving it your all and not have some lazy guys sitting around watching you or asking you to do everything for them we had a great team with great support for each other. The hardest part of the job for me I would say is it is what you make it, if you make something hard in your head it will be some days you just have to work harder then others but, in my mind it balances out some days are full fuel pedal to the metal and others may be a little more laid back but, never expect a lazy day out here period. The best thing about this job was working a week on week off and making over a couple grand for the week very convenient and well paid for your hard work and effort."
good,Great company. Great working environment and schedule. Really awesome pay. Laid off due to oil prices. I would recommend Patterson UTI Drilling to anybody wanting to work in the Oil & Gas industry.
good,"day started @4 am.got reports sent in.5:30 safety mtg with crews coming on.safety mtg with crew going off.conference call 8:00 withers,shops,and area mgrs. did walk around.took notes.discussion with driller.call me for rig service.ordered parts and supplies.talked to company man.took phone calls from various patterson people.went to snyder shop to get some parts."

good,Working as a roughneck is fun hard work and the people you work with are like family and you always make sure the other is safe and always look out for one another.
good,Best job I have ever had!!! Great management and great company! Wish i didnt have to quit but i was away from my family too much!! My wife and kids mean more to me than money!
good,This was a great company to work for. They promoted within and helped mentor you for the next position. There was clear set goals daily and their people meant something to them as a company.
good,Not much to say but they need to do better at investigating / analyzing when something happens and how to go about it. Management was ok and all but definitely needed to pay more attention to the workers that were new on a crew.
good,"While working with Patterson UTI my normal work schedule was 7 days on and 7 days off. It provided good medical benefits, and the pay was good also. I learned a lot in the drilling industry, and would recommend to others."
good,I worked for Patterson UTI from a floor hand to a rig manager. I enjoyed all the training programs and the people doing the training. Upper management gave me every opportunity to make my own desitions and helped when help was needed.
good,"Great place to work,  good management,   got plenty of hours,  good pay,  fair management,  awesome people,  awesome benefit,  room for advancement,  drug free,  no tolerance on drugs"

good,Nice quality diesel electric triple drilling rigs. Safety culture unmatched. Really well organized mangement. Small family culture makes you feel like you are well taken care of.
good,Great company to work for. They always keep you working. 2 weeks on & 2 weeks off is the schedule. They have got rid of pre diem and pay hasn't changed.
good,mix chemicals run a 450 gallon mud system. Make connections and run pipe. work 80 to 90 feet in the air to stand pipe up to trip in and out of the hole
good,Was good and very good I like working there just got laid off because when gas prices go down to job go away we had to make a break before we had the trip type in there what would we have cleaned up .
good,When I worked at this time i had a good crew that I made sure they were taken care of and the pusher was good to all of us. We worked good together and there was nothing any one of us wouldn't do for the other. The company man was always there for us.
good,Working go by kind of quick moving around staying busy it's more of a team efforted of been safe. most of all it's the right job to provided for a family.
good,Enjoyed my time here. Advanced quickly and was able develop my abilities and pass on knowledge to less experienced coworkers
good,"everyday before going to rig floor I do a walk around. I check on equipment & people. Make sure everything is running correct & that hands are good, see what needs to be done. Ive learned how to handle all kinds of situations & how to take care & maintain the equipment & the people. Management gives each employee opportunities to advance & learn all they can, they learn to trust drillers with personnel, the rig-getting the job done correct & on time."
good,"nabors was a good company to work for.  I had good equipment, and if I needed help I would get it."

I will say, the work can be a bit overwhelming, in the sense that one safety adviser may have 5+ rigs to look over-- that happen to be hours away from one another.
