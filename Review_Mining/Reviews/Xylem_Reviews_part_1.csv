rating,review
bad,"Xylem is a company that cares more about their shareholders than any of their employees. They also have a CEO that is more worried about social justice than he is the actual culture of his facilities. He injects his political views into employee's everyday lives with nonsensical emails and initiatives. The company is more worried about college degrees as qualifications as opposed to skillset, work ethic and performance. This causes the management team to end up being incapable, yet educated seat holders that do nothing to advance the company's potential. The morale couldn't possibly be any worse among the employee family, yet the company hides it by opting to ignore any of the flimsy surveys they hand out on occasion. They also look to cut overhead every single time anyone leaves, retires, or is let go. They simply add that person's work to the most capable person they can find and abuse them daily. Decent pay, and many great employees are the only things that could possibly make a person hang around for any sort of extended period of time."
bad,"busy"
bad,"All I can say about this company is the management operate to a unethical stanadard to suit there individual agendas . Also they use next of kin information to spy on there employees family members. This company Is not how it presents itself ."
bad,"Xylem is poorly structured, management is too busy to assist with proper training and day to day running of the company. They allow sales rep to be disrespectful and rude to customer service reps. Management is catty and cut throat."
bad,While my time at Xylem it seemed like the place was kindergarten all over again. People there seemed to rat out other union members just because they didn't like them. One investigation in their terms leads you having to retake a drug test. Why? the place is a complete job and the union is as well
bad,Very poor management  dont know how to keep there regular employees  that have been there longer they will take your hours away and give them to new sse which is not fair to the ones that's been there for  a few years
bad,Another manufacturing company that doesn't care about their employees. Be ready for people who think they deserve to treat you horribly. No job security and look out for the knife in the back.
bad,"Didn't work here, won't work here. Applied, went thru a screening, had a phone interview, was asked to appear for an in-person interview. That's where it gets ugly. After waiting 4 weeks for travel arrangements to be made, I was informed that they had already filled the position with a local candidate. Very unprofessional and unethical. My advise: Don't post a position on a national job board if you're only looking for local candidates. Don't ask someone for an in-person interview and then leave them hanging for weeks. Don't trust them."
bad,"Kind of like being in high school. If you're not part of the cool kids club, it sucks. But, blah blah blah blah blah. Hopefully management has changed since I've been there."
bad,The company doesn't have a great work life balance and people are not that friendly to work with. No basic training of any sort of help with anything.
bad,Correcto ambiente de trabajo en el que se fomentaba el desarrollo profesional
bad,Worked hard for them for years and then treat like dirt. There is a click In the management & supervisors which needs sorting if you complain to one it goes no further it will be covered up by the click. If you complain to another top manager watch your back as one person has already mentioned. Will want you to work like mad but rob you of money where they can.
bad,"management nasty, vindictive and happy to knife staff in back to save themselves. I was only there for a short while and saw a lot of excellent staff walk away due to terrible managers, other staff pretty much constructively dismissed on lies told by senior managers. Work here for a short while if you have to, but watch your back."
bad,"Hold management accountable for their short term goals and conflicting goals."
bad,The role is an extremely busy and target driven . Xylem water solutions purchased Pims group approx 2 years ago.nhunhunhu
bad,"The engineering dept in cheektowaga is horrible! You will work long hours for little pay. Resources go away and are never replaced. Until the current Director (who couldn't manage his way out of a wet paper bag) is gone, things will continue to get worse. Xylem Cheektowaga is not a good place to be for the next few years."
bad,"Terrible Manager. Was trying to juggle 6 projects with no help. Awful life/work balance. Always considered your time their time. 3 days after my mother died they suggested I work overtime for the days I missed. My suggestion, run away from this job. Huge turnover in this position, they haven't kept one yet"
bad,"The union protects members that it would like to protect, whilst leaving other members out to dry, fighting their own conflicts. The company lies to new hires promising them specific grades/classifications after set time periods and then fails to do so, the company fights the union for reduction of benefits and lower wages, and demands a quick pace with no rewards. The environment is not safe as you are working with steel, iron, brass, chemicals, forklifts, constant materials laying in aisle ways. The company is unethical and takes advantage of any opportunity that they can to lie to their own work force."
bad,Toxic environment.  Professionalism at its worst.  Management belittles people in front of others.  It is all about making the monthly/ quarterly number at whatever cost.  Most team members are decent but overwhelmed with too much work and not enough staff.
bad,Good name recognition but lots of instability. Poor morale up and down the ladder.
bad,People of color have no chance of advancements or fairness in this company. Mgmt turn their heads on prejudice afraid to speak out without the fear of losing their job
bad,"The worst union shop I have ever worked in. The company is extremely political and favors certain employees. When you ask for union representation the company hates it and punishes you. You are nothing but a number to that company they donâ€™t care about their employees not even ones that of been there 30 years. Extremely poor management and extremely poor human resource, employees should not be afraid to go to human resource department"
bad,"they have good benefits, balancing job / life is not good, no job security, no management, job culture is non existing.  i do not wish to give a review on this company."
bad,"Very hostile working environment, teamwork is generally not considered, lacking in qualified management.  Would not recommend working for either the company or union"
bad,The company talks about change but does nothing to change it.  Management stifles any new ideas.  There is no one leading the company.
bad,"The pay is good but the benefits are quickly slipping to a minimum to maintain a better ROI for the company.  Family/Worklife balance is non existent and you are expected to work around the clock. Company as a whole is very short staffed so expect to be overworked.  Customer base is eroding due to companies inability to serve them.  Regional management has an incredible lack of required skill set and simply maintains a ""Yes Man"" attitude.  Expect to be harassed and micromanaged if you take a job with this company.  There are still many good employees in this company, sadly few of them have Management in their title since the great purge of qualified employees."
bad,"There is extremely high turnover in R&D, with some new hires only lasting a couple of weeks.  Management is poor; projects lack direction.  The goals used for job assessment are arbitrary, vague, and constantly changing so that you will get a so-so review no matter what you do.  Yearly raises are 2%.  Achievements are rarely recognized and never rewarded.  Originality is punished.  Software tools are outdated.  Management is paranoid, so they will often watch over your shoulder and second guess.  Project schedules are arbitrary and have no basis in reality."
bad,"Worked here on the shop floor for 2 years, and was glad to get away. Badly managed from the top down to team leaders. Work area, tools & equipment not good enough to fulfil work output required. Kept pointing out on a weekly basis how things could be improved, but nothing done. Management openly encourage employees to snitch on each other if they were breaking rules/correct procedures, which caused bad feeling and falling out. My team leader had no clue how to lead a team, no clue how to treat and talk to people correctly, and they were not liked by the vast majority of workers. Not a nice working atmosphere at all, because people were unhappy working there. I spoke to people who have worked there a very long time, and they said it used to be a lovely place to work, because it was managed correctly, and people felt valued."
bad,"Please don't apply to work for this company. From management down it is a den of thieves, liars and etc. The benefits are great but again management is the issue.."
bad,"Opinions can be misconstrued.  I have my own and for my own reasons but suffice it to say, it's not the most pleasant place to work since if you don't agree with how things are being run, you'll be shown the door quickly."
bad,The company does not know how to train their employees and have zero knowledge about their own procedures and systems. The manager demands a good job even when he does not know how to do it or do his own job.
bad,This was a very toxic environment. A culture of mistrust and finger pointing that had been this way for quite some time. This didn't improve with the new manager who was not at all supportive. There were a couple of good people but most I have no desire to ever see again. It was common knowledge that you need to CYA.
bad,"Place was #1 water  transfer in area in my opinion until management hired in all buddies then I saw company going down hill and losing work cuz those buddies ran it poorly and didnt know how manage staff nor the work. Lot of good hard working people left already before you know it this branch/ divison will be done with oil/gas."
bad,"Communication at this facility is horrible. The atmosphere is cut-throat and there is no formal training program. If you make a mistake you are written up. The Service manager is has an ""I'm always right"" attitude and is very temperamental and boisterous, provoking arguments. The Branch manager is seldom available and has no clue of whats going on within the work/shop area. ""Working from home is the norm for all management at this location. Even though the pay and compensations are great, I would not recommend working for this Branch to my worst enemy."
bad,"This place is full of over achievers that are not qualified to manage themselves. It's a meaningful job with the ability to make a good quality product but is ill managed.  The HR department is a joke and shows favortism to its ""star"" employees. There is a huge lack of communication between shifts and especially management to production employees."
bad,I was promised to be put into the paygrade I am supposed to be put into but management hasn't kept their word. I do way too much for this company to be swept under the rug like this. I have been in the wrong paygrade for almost 2 years.
bad,"It's a okay place to work. Health benefits are the worst I have ever seen with a corporation this size.  Unprofessional office management is ridiculous.  Management has no morals,  and s. harassment runs the office everyday.  The safety person in charge does not enforce corporate safety policies.  And when they do it's to their benefit.  "
bad,This by far is the worst place I have ever worked! Managers cursing at the employees and HR doing nothing about it. Employees being treated like 2nd class citizens and scared to speak up because they may lose their jobs if they do. I only worked there for 19 months and I was terminated doing to my manager back stabbing meâ€¦I was one of the lucky ones to get out and not one of the poor saps that have to endure the trouble treatment. A blessing in disguise when I was terminated. Thank you!
bad,"Aucune gestion de l'atelier, travail au coup par coup dans l'urgence des demandes des clients, au lieu d'organiser les postes de travail."
bad,"Initially this started out as a great company to work for, however after several changes to the director of operations (4 in six years) and other upper management positions Xylem has become one of the worst places to work in my opinion.  No Job security, constant layoffs, no integrity with regional managers and above.  The management style is harassing, threatening, and has no focus.  It is clear they do not know what they are doing and have no long term goals for sustaining a customer base.  They push out people that are knowledgeable and successful and promote/maintain people they like.  They micro manage and make personnel accountable for their bad decision yet upper management takes credit for every success and rarely gives credit to deserving staff.  They have laid off a large portion of their work force, struggle to support their customer base, and the workload is unsustainable for everyone from branch managers to inside sales and service.  They have lost their focus on the customer and are more concerned with internal image."
bad,Management is selfish. They really don't care about the low level workers. Also I think they maybe shutting down because they are super slow and only working 40hr. They are not communicating we the lower employee s about the security of the future!
bad,"I worked at godwin pumps for 8 years and when xylem took over the company it went bad quick, I loved coming to work everyday until the branch  manager who couldn't manage a dollar store started there. he leaves all the time never ever helps anyone and most of the office personnel talks badly behind your back and does what ever they want and thinks their the best, and they don't give credit to the people that actually get the job done- the shop and yard personnel. the only thing the manager cares about is how much the branch makes and how much his bonus check is going to be and never wants to give the employees the money they deserve at raise time or never wants to put money into new equipment or vehicles just ONLY cares about himself, as a example we use to have company picnics and Christmas parties now we don't get anything even after busting your back all day and then getting called out in the middle of the night and then starting work again a couple hours later. instead of doing things for the employees, this year the manager decided to remodel the front office, not hire another driver or throw the employees a picnic, which we all looked forward to. the front office got brand new offices, new bathrooms (which we weren't allowed to use at first), and get this, they bought a new fancy keurig coffee maker that the shop guys weren't allowed to use. we desperately needed another driver, a mechanic and a yard boy and don't get me started on needing new trucks! so instead of putting money into hiring more people, giving raises to the people that deserved them, and upgrading the"
bad,The company is understaffed in Canada and everyone struggles with daily work loads. Due to operational restructuring the work culture has fallen apart. Management is struggling to maintain control of Canadian operations while still appeasing US management who are unfamiliar with how business operates in Canada.
bad,"I can't speak for the work culture at the other business units of Xylem. Godwin is a bombastic mess, with probably the worst work-life balance of any company I've ever encountered. "
bad,"When you enter the building you are immediately struck by the total silence.  Most people sit in their offices with doors closed or in their cubicles and don't engage or speak with each other throughout the day.  In fact, when there is an all-staff meeting, some people will sit in their office or cubicle and call in to the meeting rather than join in person in a conference room.  The particular brand/division I worked at had 37% employee turnover in 2017.  And while 2018 is seeing less turnover, there still is the underlying problem of people not collaborating nor engaging with each other. "
bad,"The leadership over software from the lacks the ability to put out good, quality software products. They even have trouble putting out bad products in a timely fashion. The culture and process for development is broken and divided."
bad,"The work is quite easy, enjoy the work . Management not very helpful with problem solving . Lots of favouratism goes on. Ok if you keep yourself to yourself . Good pay and some good benefits."
bad,"Xylem pays much above the market standards. However the inter company relations are heavily political. The structure of the company is based on exerting stress on individuals based on blame culture for achieving personal objectives hence the company have been going down significantly over the 2017-2019 period in the MENA region. Continous hire-fire policy creates further stress within the employees hence people are always on the job hunt, scared to make mistakes or enemies, hence working passively."
bad,There is to much work for one person to do and they don't hire head count and try to make one person do everything. The lack of training in the software they use.
bad,"Interview process was disorganized, management seemed disinterested in answers, successful conclusion of interview was a below expected pay range exploding offer, I should have run away ..."
bad,"Xylem was a spinoff of ITT and unfortunately, the bad culture came with it.  CEO will tell you that the primary behavior they require from management is ""compliance"".  Nuff said.  "
bad,"a company good for benefit, but too much stress. management not that good.after i left a company and cut a lot benefit and over time."
bad,"Fast paced, productive and enjoyable environment.  But has little room for growth within the company. With being a 24 hour emergency service company it makes it difficult to balance work and life. Benefits within the company is desirable."
bad,"Guelph location is wonderful, corporate needs to focus on employee engagement rather than just sales.  Guelph has wonderful leaders, and culture -- Canada Xylem is wonderful."
good,"GestÃ£o lenta e sem aÃ§Ã£o. FuncionÃ¡rios nÃ£o sÃ£o proativos, esperam que os outros resolvam os problemas por eles e nÃ£o entendem suas funÃ§Ãµes para que executem o trabalho de forma fluida e sem problemas."
good,There was little to no management that you could walk up to and address a problem. There was no team building and it was a very toxic environment. Extremely quit office.
good,"it's a ok company if this your frist job but need to working on keeeping good workers with better pay. The work is easy it""s a fun place to work"
good,"Always punishing those who follow the rules, must be a yes person to be promoted. Overall very negative!! The constant daily stress"
good,13 years for what... working hard at pull parts w/c ups ect. I was doing a two man job. with little help.when they laid me off ship went down by alot customers get mad...
good,The market has increased competitors because of former employees leaving the company.  The competitions know Flygt trains their sales to get the order.
good,"Employees are objects, not people. Great story to get you there, but not to keep you there. There is a great push to find talented people, but the door in and out is spinning. With no discussion, no warning, employees are let go."
good,"When I began at Xylem promises were made, prospects seemed good, the reality is department division, white collar vs blue collar, no real opportunity to advance and relatively nonnegotiable salary depending on who you are or know."
good,"people are dropping like flies here. they hire temps only. they show no loyalty to the people who have worked 25 yrs plus outside of firing them."
good,"i working this company last 2 yr but i think first yr my seniors are very good , helpfull and thinking abouts us like increments and others things and lesions us but after they ression no body things and helps us."
good,A typical day at work is for sure to be stressful. Xylem does have regular training and updates as required. Management is not easy going or do they even bother to ask if there is any way they can assist you. Workplace is all about margins. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all of the many meetings per week that are scheduled. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving it to go home.
good,"Xylem is a great place to work if all you are looking for is really good pay and benefits. Thats about where the benefits stop."
good,"Good place to work, stable company.  I've been here over 9 years.  At times, this job is fast paced and other times it's stagnant.  The rental industry is tough in any field."
good,Good pay and benefits but work loads are high stress and burn out is common among the staff. Leadership is disconnected from the actual people doing the work.
good,"great place to learn, lot of responsibility, growth plan, development from trading company to manufacturing company, good team downward, challenging upward"
good,"There is a lot to learn if given the chance. However, Legal has a nepotism problem as the GC hires and promotes her friends instead of qualified people."
good,"this was a great company to work for with great benefits and good employee relations the company had a big family feel to it even though it was a big corporation you did not feel like a number."
good,"Great Company to work with and for. Coworkers were great, I learned a lot in sales and dealing with customers"
good,I feel it is a good place to work if you want to learn some tools to progress further in your career.  They expect a lot out of you and I am busy all the time.  I even get home work.  The communication is lacking which makes everything a mystery. It has gone under a lot of changes and still is changing.
good,"It has a highly political environment, with issues against its own core value of Integrity. Most of the people there are great to work with though. However the top management does not prioritize people."
good,Benefits are very costly. If you are young it may be OK. The company has gotten large and the management is confusing at best. Directions can come from any direction.
good,"Xylem used to be a good job.  It has turned into a major corporation with way too many upper management level employees.  My major concern is how bad the benefits are becoming in January 2019.  They won't even be worth having.  People go to work to receive a paycheck and benefits.  At that point, there will be no point in paying out of every paycheck to receive horrible quality benefits with a deductible so high that they will never kick in."
good,"Typical day at work: A person has to do the work of 2-1/2 to3 people and as soon as the work load (aka backlog) decreases to where you only have to work for 1-1/2 to 2 people, they are ready let you go!"
good,The company has a great vision and is very active in bringing water to everyone. It is very driven by meeting wall street demands over longterm growth. Competitions are more aggressive in this market.
good,"Candor is not appreciated. Any 'negative' comments are frowned upon, bring your Rose colored shades."
good,"Helt okej! Bra arbetskamrater,jobbar fritt under ansvar."
good,"working at xylem was a learning experience, I job is not that hard but what creates a problem I believe is the organization of the warehouse and their inventory. most of the time we did not have all the parts available to complete building the orders, and when we got the parts management would rush us to build the costumers orders. most of the employees from the dept. did not like the manager because the way he manage the warehouse."
good,"Great support from supervisors for challenging the limit."
good,"Ambiente agradable hasta que comprÃ³ la empresa una multinacional. A partir de ahÃ­, reuniones, reuniones y mÃ¡s reuniones. Un comercial debe estar en la calle y no dedicÃ¡ndose todo el dÃ­a a atender call o webconferences. Inaudito pero real!"
good,"empresa comercial con productos fÃ¡cil de vender..buen seguro de salud complementario, muy pocas mujeres trabajan en la empresa"
good,"Une entreprise Ã  taille humaine avec de nombreuses agences en France qui a de beaucoup de qualitÃ©s."
good,interesting place to grow and learn from management; a interesting working environment; no micro-managing.
good,Very Corporate focused management group.  Very little local presence from the management team as a whole.  Very little preservation planning for the workforce to exist long term.  Very good compensation package if the goals are attainable.  Very little input from the saleforce when budgets were being established annually.
good,Fast-paced job. a good place to work and the pay was really good. the union didn't seem to do much for the employees though and didn't look out for the union members like they should have. overall it's a great place to be
good,I learned a great deal at Xylem when I worked there.  There were also many challenges as the company culture changed and decisions were being made to adapt to those changes.
good,Typical Corporate Environment. Fast paced with high volume sales activity. Senior Management is generally good with focus on pushing sales daily. Work pressure is therefore high.
good,Company is dedicated to helping it's customer base with any pumping or job setups needed. Employees work very well together to make sure customer has all items needed to complete their task.
good,Great place to work.  Some positions have flexible hours.  Located in a nice area.  Great company parties. Okay pay for the Dayton area.  Interesting company.
good,"Product management challenging, as company did not provide necessary resources to support business growth strategies.  However, Xylem offers a very competitive benefits package, including relocation package."
good,Old systems and strategies are in the midst of being replaced. Mom and Pop systems and mentality.  Not enough new strategies deployed.  Not enough training.
good,The company is overall a good place to work. A lot of dedication can be required as the service team can work long hours as they operate as an emergency breakdown team. If you like to be constantly on the move and in a fast paced enviroment this is for you.
good,Lo mejor de mi trabajo era el trato directo con los clientes
good,"autonome dans notre travail"
good,"ambiente inestable y con muchos cambios, no recomendable para alguien buscando estabilidad"
good,"Un trabajo en la que me permite aplicar mis habilidades de trabajo, y desempeÃ±arme en mi carrera. falta orgaizacion en el area y definir funciones, lo mas dificiles el timepo adicional despues del horario de oficina sin ser realmente productivos todo el equipo de trabajo en un cierre, Lo qu emas me gusto es el sector de la economia."
good,"A generally very good company focused on solving the water problems of the world. With the right people in various startegic positions, it could really improve further."
good,Great industry to work in. Plenty of varied daily work and responsibilities. Plenty of vacation time. Holidays are nice.
good,A fast paced work environment with many opportunities to learn many aspects of manufacturing. A typical day at work involves many different tasks that hold a new challenge every day. Management and Co-workers are hard working eager individuals that work together to get tasks done in the most efficient way possible.
good,"learned to load trucks in a timely matter..."
good,"Had good sales growth in my one year with the company."
good,Buena empresa con estrategias de negocios manejadas desde estados unidos
good,I had opportunities to learn a variety of things while employed and the opportunity to collaborate with a globally diverse team.  The company is beginning to move from an old manufacturing based company to a technology company.
good,"rÃ©alisation des chiffrages, rÃ©pondre aux appels des clients, rÃ©activitÃ©,rÃ©ponse aux appels d'offres"
good,"i must say this is a good company to work for, just like any company theres everyday drama and strain, but over all it was definitely a good company to work for. benefits are good, they use to be excellent, pay is good if you get hired directly onto the company and not through a temp agency. if your willing to go to work everyday, do whats expected, and stay to yourself and put work 1st then you'll do great here."
good,"Xylem is a big name in the water pumps industry. I had a summer position as an admin assistant in the office as part of an internship program (mainly copying and uploading files to a digital archive), but I know the basics of how the company works outside that little bubble. They have a very streamlined managerial system, but sometimes that means cutting product quality and customer satisfaction for cost, which I guess is like any other company. The pay's fine, but for people who actually have a full-time position, the work is frustrating, mainly because of communication issues between departments."
good,Une sociÃ©tÃ© oÃ¹ le travail communie avec une ambiance agrÃ©able et propice Ã  l'Ã©panouissement professionnel.
good,It's an okay place to work for.  Good pay and it is a union shop.  Management seems to clash with each other repeditavely.  People are relatively happy so workers get along great.  Hardest part was all the different jobs I had to do.  I did like learning all the different positions i was required to learn.
good,Management team trying too hard to punch above their weight. But the businesses run pretty independently and it's hard to get everyone on the same page. Management team missed an opportunity to set/define the culture for the new company after spin-off from ITT. Employees pretty confused about the direction the CEO wants to take the company - as she is unsure where she wants to go!
good,"Not a good place if you want rapid growth. But if you are  good at what you do this is definitely a stable place to work. Work culture is Ok, and changes based on your manager, but generally not very stressful"
good,Miss management of the business and work culture is a daily occurrence. They do not handle their Supply Chain operations correctly. Inventory is constantly miss handled and never correct. Each position is constantly micro managed by upper management instead of your individual bosses. Low raises.
good,"Work-life balance is really good. Somebody wants to have a relaxed job then this is one of them."
good,"Built my management experience through mix of sales & operation. Sales part was the most enjoyable, meeting and negating with customers and consulting engineers."
good,"One of the powerhouses in the water industry with some the best if not the best products available on the market."
good,"Director of the company built himself a nice new office in front of building, while having to lay-off personal in other departments. No bonus anymore."
good,"The company is amazing and truly works hard to create an environment of success across the everything. However middle management was very poor at helping anyone advance unless you were apart of them. The Watermark charity was doing amazing things. The company did want you to work as many hours as they could get you too, but often times it was a work more and enjoy life less type of place."
good,Internasional company. lovely people to work with and very helpfull
good,Company is under constant scrunity for performance by stock holders. Decisions are based on cost and not on growing the business. Some good people there but everyone is scared of losing their job. Morale is very low.
good,Flexible work environment. Positive leadership. IT team works hard. Sustainability focus is moving forward this year. Company is poised to be leading in water.
good,"Enjoyed working there. I had plenty of opportunities for advancement, and had opportunities that I would have never had at other companies. It is a business that requires lots of travel, so you have to be willing (in some positions) to accept 50% to 80% travel, both domestic and overseas."
good,"El rubro es muy entretenido y dinÃ¡mico, pero la empresa no tenÃ­a una estrategia bien definida y no sabÃ­a con claridad hacia donde iba, por lo mismo no es mucho el empoderamiento ni la posibilidad de tomar decisiones"
good,"excelente empresa, algo especial en el ambiente de trabajo"
good,Xylem Kalgoorlie was a fun and enjoyable place to work. The company gave me plenty of knowledge and confidence.  I learnt a lot from working here in the rental department
good,My position at Xylem was very technical and gratifying.  Managers left a lot to be desired.  I am not sure I was ever managed with a style like I was at Xylem.  The division of Xylem that I was employed in needs to evaluate their performance criteria.
good,Avec ce que cela impose comme dÃ©fis. La culture doit Ãªtre constamment revue et corrigÃ©. Les objectifs doivent etre regulierement revus. .
good,"Quite possibly the easiest, best paying work/wage in this town.  The turnover is insanely high, where the work isn't difficult at all.  Coworkers are nice."
good,"Learned a lot, was able to move to different areas to learn new skills. overall a very fair place to work, very laid back and easy to work for. Only issue I had was first shift was always selected for overtime even though generally the time was wasted by that shift."
good,"Xylem-Leopold was a great place to work. The workforce at this location are like family. They've been in business over 90 years so there is a mix of new and legacy projects that present new challenges daily. You could work on a new plant design and also answer customer questions about 40 year old equipment the same day. The tight deadlines could sometimes be a challenge, yet rewarding when you do what's required to meet them. Culture has changed slightly since becoming part of a publicly traded corporation but overall a satisfying place to work."
good,Xylem is a very good company to work and the management supports for your career growth as well as in your well being. Colleagues over here are very supportive. Work is very challenging and yet very interesting to address those challenges.
good,"I am currently rolling out the Purchasing program at Xylem.  Oracle is now the software used since the end of October 2013.  My duties are  assisting with the implementation and administration of the Procurement tools and strategies for Indirect spend for both on and off catalog, managing requisition assignments and problem-solving invoices that do not match the purchase order value, expediting requests, responsible in assisting in managing the Bank's P-Card Program."
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits package and easy going environment.
good,I am customer focused and enjoys helping all customers.  The atmosphere at Xylem is great and would enjoy t stay around.
good,Fast paced facility that allowed your training and skills to be utilized
good,very fast paced with lots going on.  You need to stay on top of everything and know what is happening. Everyone is very nice and helpful. it feels like a small family business.
good,Its good to work for this organisation. u can learn many things here regarding to your field.U can balance your personal life and professional life very well.
good,"This is a fast pace, stressful, and competitive company to work for.  You will put in long hours as a salaried employee.  You will be required to work on Saturdays regularly.  Be prepared for every decision you make to be questioned.
