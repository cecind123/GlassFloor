rating,review
bad,Supervisor was horrible she was all about her personal life and provided horrible training. She would tell you to do something one way then get mad at you and say your were doing it wrong.
bad,"Absolute worst location at Nucor and ALWAYS HAS BEEN. The GM is a putz and the management are a bunch or unprofessional idiots with napoleon syndrome! They are not loyal to their employees, all they care about is the dollar. Horrible they give out surveys then falsify them! The roll mill crew is a joke! They can’t keep anyone that’s decent for long (and are lewd, unprofessional and racist)bc of the manager and daylight supervisor. The melt shop crew is probably the best if you’re going to work there."
bad,"The people are pretty cool there more than willing to help for the most part,the owner on the other hand is  a special individual,will pull off jobs to sweep floors,or whatever he can make up at that moment, doesn't like to give raises unless your a so called brown noser, work a ton of hours,not a company that likes to train it's employees,a lot of favoritism to the machists ."
bad,"It was good job with decent pay. However, I did not quite agree with the beliefs of some of those in charge. That is, however, a personal issue of mine that does not quite reflect on the company itself."
bad,"I currently work at Kankakee plant, we are paid for performance, which means your only making money when your running steel. You barely make minimum wage when your not.The steel industry  is a dying one.Vacation pay is  a joke,when you take a week of vacation you only get half a weeks pay. Holiday pay is based on 8 hours,but you work 12 hours a day.Management is bad, they can't make a decision to save their life.They change the formula for getting paid so much that you're constantly getting screwed.So many millwrights and electricians left for CSL Bearing it's not even funny.Yet management is so stubborn they won't address it or offer something better for the maintenance workers.Im currently looking for another job."
bad,"Nucor steel Connecticut wAs a terrible experience right from the start. The company feels they come first, not your family or anything else. There bonus pay structure is terrible and not what they tell you it is. You will be working a tremendous amount of hours for time and a half of your base rate. When you hear about all the great salarys at nucor remember most of those people are working 80 hours a week. Not 4 on 4 off like they promise everyone. You will work 12 hour shifts , most of the time with no lunch or breaks. If you are one minute late for something completely out of your control they take a bonus day from you. After 4 bonus days they take your production bonus away from you for the whole week even if you are late one minute after busting your hump all week. Bonus days get used if you are late,sick,or leave early regardless of the situation. Remember 60% of you pay is production bonus so they take more than half your check for even one minute. They use intimidation on people when they get hurt so you dont report it and it makes them seem like a safe place to work. They even have the o site nurse lie for them. Stay away trust me!"
bad,"So called ""team"" work environment, everyone there was all about horse playing and grudges. Management held better terms of discipline based on seniority. Never made it equal to all employees, favoritism. No regard for constant harassment."
bad,"Benefits and weekly pay were the only good things about working here. Once my middle management changed, work quality went down the toilet. If you are a free thinker that uses logic in your decisions, look out. And God forbid you disagree with the experienced guy or the ignorant management in your department over a minor issue! Their (often incorrect) way or the highway. They will find some trumped up reason or lie to try to force you to quit. Failing that, you will get fired a few days later. If you are a workaholic that likes to work a mandatory 60+ hours a week, feel free to apply. You will love it here! Anyone else, seek better employment with a company that actually believes in a work life balance."
bad,They wasn't professional at all. You can be a hard worker and they wouldn't notice it. You always had to watch your back there because someone was trying to start trouble and would lie and do something professionally.
bad,"Do yourself a favor and don’t work here. Yeah the money is good but the managers and hours are terrible it’s not worth it. The company as a whole is good but Memphis is terrible.Managers are unprofessional uncaring and ridiculous like teenagers mentality. I see them bring someone in with 15- 20 years experience and purposely try to break him, man that dude knows more then them so they "
bad,horrible place to work...would not suggest for anyone to work for nucor. save your time and dont ever waste your time with horrible management and get treated like a number
bad,"The only reason I lasted 2 years at this place is because it took me 1 to land another job. Mediocrity runs rampant here and is basically in charge of everything. Management is uneducated about a lot, i.e. engineering, chemistry & environmental but are unwillingly to at least learn the basics. They send others to training to help stabilize the plant but won't even give the employees a chance to implement their training. The pay is good but the environment, working & professional isn't worth it. No matter the department, you're constantly chasing your tail because they cut cost corners a lot. And cheap equipment breaks often."
bad,"The job pays better than most but also can be a way more demanding than most. The steel mill already provides a harsh working environment, so having to deal with bad managers makes it suck that much harder. I mainly learned about troubleshooting motors and hydraulics. There are a lot of negative aspects of the job but there were also some times when it was pretty awesome. Some of the guys I really miss working with, others not so much. Many of the crew were ""unprofessional"" to say the least, lots of trash-talking and all that, which some people may like but that just ain't me."
bad,Management says one thing an does completely opposite . No promotions based  on experience its whoever is related to the person responsible for filling the position . This would be a great place to work if it was UNION then most of the BS wouldn't happen !
bad,I was with the company for several years and I regretted staying there that long. All but of the original management has either relocated to other locations or been demoted and replaced. They have of serious turnover issue there also. The average time an employee stays is 6 months to a year or until they find a better job. The pay is too unstable and you have to live a frugal life style. I had the hardest time getting a mortgage due to the fact of the bonus system and low hourly pay rate they give you. A good bonus you may make low $30s an hour but that's a rare. Average bonus will yield you $20ish an hour and no bonus is roughly $10 an hour. It looks good on paper but when your bonus is low your making pennies there. Granted they don't lay employees off but they will put you into bankruptcy. They refuse to have comparable pay with nearby plants so many people have quit because of that. They expect you to budget your money but it's very difficult to budget it when you will never know how much money you will make weekly. One week it can be $300.00 and the next week it can be $1000 a week. You never know. There's no sick days so if you come down with the flu either you come to work sick or stay home and receive no pay. You can't take vacation unless someone is willing to work for you. If no one will work you can't take vacation days that you earned. The management is clueless and have no idea how to be management. They always try to cut costs and make very bad financial decisions. The company has invested over 1.6 billion dollars to start up and they haven't ran successfully for
bad,Nucor works you to dealth so you dont have no time with your family. Nucor has good benefits but you dont have that family time that everyone needs. I was not happy at nucor because of the management team.
bad,I love working there tell I got hurt then  Management showed their true  Colors I know I bid a good job. It was very (hot) that's part of being a weld
bad,"production bonus varies to drastically , rotating weekly is difficult, no family life and low pay, short handed , need more maintenance , vacation and holiday pay seems to make you not want to go on vacation"
bad,"they are intimidated by intelligence"
bad,"Job started out good. Then we went to very short and almost no hrs per week. Work schedule is always shady, meaning the management will lie to your face about the actual hrs you will be working that week. Management team was very incompitant from the GM all the way down to my lead man. Some of my co-workers were good friends, others would stab you in the back in a heartbeat just to make themselves look better. It would be a great place to work if they would get rid of the buddy system in management and actually put people in charge who knew how to run a business! The only reason I gave one star for an overall rating is because I had to!"
bad,This place is awful!!
bad,"Terrible company to work for.. expect you to work after hours in management positions with no extra pay.. required to have a work phone 24/7 with no extra pay. They never upgrade equipment and barely maintain very very old equipment.  No trust.. asked multiple times for safety measures to be put in place and then terminated after morethen 2 decades for not having the safety measures in place. Cant trust anyone, employees regularly complain behind your backs.. terrible experience and a waste of a huge part of my life!"
bad,Lies lies lies. God forbid you do anything wrong during your probationary/ learning period. Better not mess up at all. Plus mind reading is a plus for this position. Bad pay for the job tasks. Other guy you work with is impossible and your boss takes his side on everything. Your lead man tells him everything bad you do!!!! Under paid for what you do and who you work with.
bad,"Immediate supervisor was on friendly and didn't have an open door policy."
bad,There’s a strong feeling of the good old boy system in place.  One of the manager even admitted this is probably true.  There’s no movement for change.  Still rooted in old processes and methodology.
bad,"Not a company who cares about it's employees. They view you as a number, not as a person. They care about getting the project out to the shop fast, but if you are late, then you get in trouble, but if you make a mistake because you rushed to get it out to the shop they get after you even more. It is a damned if you do, damned if you don't."
bad,"Working with some of the local mills can be a benefit as there are a lot of great people working for Nucor. The main problem is middle to upper management poorly handling ""teammates"" as a resource and unwilling to properly support their teams. You will be overworked and underappreciated. You will deal with extreme schedules and stress. You'll get a pat on the back and sent on your way. If you disagree with management and try to hold your ground you'll be fired. Untrustworthy company with horrible practices towards handling teammates. They are NOT who they claim to be. Avoid at all costs."
bad,"Worked 60 plus hours a week with a 20 minute lunch and few breaks a day. We worked 10 to 19 hours a day back to back against OSHA. "
bad,The processes Nucor develops to work around automation in its systems are amazing.  The company will install a new computer system then spend time and effort to find ways to make the processes more manual than the way it was done before.  Some of the policies are completely insane employees walk around just shaking their heads.  If an error occurs the process dissembled and over engineered to cause it not to happen again. Thus causing multiple unnecessary steps and employees.
bad,"Good people work here.  Factory assembly line type work, doesn't take long to become bored.  A lot of long term experienced guys that should've advanced but haven't because they don't meet managements predisposed qualities for what they are looking for.  In other words even if your the best, most experienced and knowledgeable at what you do, and you have 15 yrs in, you still wont advance."
bad,If you like working your life away this is the place for you one day off a week you think you are making good money but really it's just all the hours you work during busy season but you need to work the long hours to save all your money for the months that you only work 20 hours a week production pay is based on tons out the door walking into the shop is like going back in time everything is way out dated so working efficiently is out of the question their solution for everything is just more labor and more hours they don't believe in working smarter not harder. But if you have no life family or friends and want to drink the corporate kool aid and believe all the bs they feed you this is the place for you but if you have a brain and can think for yourself stay away
bad,The company use to be a great company but has went downhill. The upper management isn't trustworthy and the company is all over the place. I wouldn't recommend working for this company.
bad,Nucor boasts of a culture where the employees are empowered to make decisions.   It couldn't be further from the truth.   Kankakee Management has a long way to go.
bad,"its a work place, very loud and dirty. job consisted of installing hvac units and answering service calls. did trouble shooting on units and maintained different equipment"
bad,"Stay AWAY if you Can  ! Mgmt an most supervisors Have no backbone an would throw you under the bus to save their own rear ends . Your Opinion only counts if it polishes the EGO of the Management or supervisors . Safety First is what they preach , but when the paint dries Its Profit Over Production . People have DIED because of this place  . Shut down clean up n keep running !! Your Better Off Being A Contractor In The GMs Pocket. Its really nice when your Boss has 0 experience in your Dep. but a test score said He\SHE is a perfect fit an you have to train them !"
bad,"Nucor has great culture and is focused on producing, producing safely. "
bad,"Was promised security and long-term work, worked the summer and got laid off."
bad,A great place to work with excellent management and a positive work environment. It is a company with great potential and great potential for its employees.
bad,Not good family oriented place. Will kill the family based on scheduling. I did not enjoy the shifts. Some managers were very ineffective yet some did really care.
bad,"Nucor values are high."
bad,Pay was excellent but the teamwork and training needs a lot of work.
bad,"It was an okay job. Good pay, it was a good job and they care about others. Good attitudes and I was on time to work so I didn’t get fussed at. Good job."
good,"Job security minimal, heavy turnover.  Personalities taken over principles. Not in a WE type of atmosphere, but more of an I type atmosphere.  Would not want to work there again."
good,"Been here almost twenty years. Used to be a great place to work now, it's just another job. Company used to be people oriented, but has become more big corporation like. Money now pushed to the executive level at the expense of the workers. No sick leave, you are punished financially on holidays and vacation days,  very long working hours with sometimes weeks without a day off. If you are young and looking for a career, look elsewhere."
good,It is difficult to move up within the company.  Many positions are filled by individuals who have been with the company for 20+ years who have no intentions on retiring.  This makes it difficult for entry level employees to advance.
good,"NUCOR Steel Louisiana is a great training ground to seek experience in the industrial atmosphere. This location is different from other locations where NUCOR is the big fish in the pond. In Louisiana there are several major players in the area leaving NUCOR really a training ground for the competition. The Management team is less than subpar. Production is first, SAFETY is an after thought. The GM is out of touch with the day to day operations. The leadership style is REACTIVE instead of PROACTIVE. The employees that they hire have no mechanical experience, and are not properly trained once they are hired, they walk with an experience person for about a week then they are placed in a area and have to figure it out on their own. NSLA has had 3 Safety Directors in four years as well as Environmental Directors, controllers and other administrative people. I was the 3rd one in four years. Extremely high turnover rate due to the competition in the area. For every 8-10 new employees they hire they loose the same, its a revolving door.  NUCOR Steel Louisiana pays on a production bonus. It works in the steel mills but in LA, its different because its a plant. So if the plant is not running you don't get your bonus. Down time could go from a week to a month. Incompetent maintenance team, real lack of knowledge of how the plant works. A CPA is the HR manager who is clueless as to what or how HR works. No accountability at all. If your looking to get experience and move on this is the place for you. Don't drink the juice about the culture. I had the opportunity to visit other locations."
good,Swing shift work weeks. Holidays weekends and nights. Hot or cold weather dependent. Manual labor intensive. First 10 years vacation time is 80hrs.
good,"Good pay, but very stressful and demanding.  Long hours and very fast paced. Always had to be alert and ready to jump in when needed."
good,"sit in my cubicle, draw/draft building plans"
good,"It was a good job just to bad they didnt have enough work for everyone."
good,"12 hr shifts..Hot in summer and cold in the winter its a Steel mill,The new management made a big decision on why i left.It was their way or the highway."
good,"The work is good and compensation is best, but money isn't everything. There are meetings on top of meetings. The only way to advance is to be a boot licking, yes man, that is less intelligent than those doing the promoting in order to make them look good. Management has no integrity.  After years of proving I was the best in my field, even setting an unofficial production record, they were only too happy to let me leave. After bidding to relocate and being told I was getting that job. One person who gave me a great endorsement, upon getting contacted for my release date, started to bash me and lied. They took the offer back. Even stated in writing it was medical history as to why they wouldnt take me. The persn that bashed me was demoted. After seeing ex-coworkers after I quit I heard management was telling lies about what happened. I contacted lawyers and they said even though I would win the case, it wouldn't be worth it in the long run.  I recently started working for another company and found out Nucor was a part owner. I quit there almost immediately. I would stay as far away from Nucor as possible."
good,Overall Nucor's culture is fantastic but the Marion Ohio division does not follow the same culture. I've worked at other divisions before transferring to Marion. Benefits are fair - not the best but certainly could be worse. Dealing with managers is the hardest part of the job in Marion but that could change at any time. Advancement depends on if managers like you. Job does require a lot of hours on employees part but pay is good.
good,"Employees get pay based on a Production Bonus System - no production = no bonus - Oh and P.B. is more than half of your pay. This system penalizes employees for things out of their control (weather / acts of God, utilities & supplier limitations, market conditions, management decisions)"
good,"expendable,  if not in a position that is a leadership role. the amount of work expected is not worth the pay. they are reactive not proactive. but they do work with your schedule."
good,Nucor is not easy work but there are opportunities for training.  I was able to earn my Welding certification during my time at Nucor.  The hardest part of the job was there is no temperature control.  The summer is extremely hot especially for welders.  The most enjoyable part of the job during my tenure was the learning experience.  I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge in the Steel Industry.  The company as a whole was good to the workers.
good,Working swing shift is very difficult but required for Nucor employees in the mill.  Since working for Nucor for 30 years it is very difficult to sleep and have a normal schedule.
good,"1st call for breakdown calls of overhead cranes, mobile and support equipment."
good,lots of confusion not very organized. Under new management and they are not working in a very efficient way. New plant management is ot sure of his duties
good,"This job can either be the perfect one for you or your worst nightmare. Room for advance off of the floor is pretty small sine there just aren't a lot of position past the floor and they are filled with a waiting list to get into them. However, you will be able to pick up an amazing amount of skills and knowledge here if you apply yourself. Best part of the job is your co workers and the worst part of the job is the environment and management."
good,no warning on overtime cant make plans. safety policy written in pencil. Bad management. No diagrams or manuals. Nothing is labeled. Everything is run in red wire. supervisors will not back you up. The steel mill is where you want to work not building systems.
good,Great company but the bonus pay structure is a huge downfall.
good,Nucor is a fun and fast paced place of employment.  They have seasonal work schedule as the cold weather and snow shuts them down until springs.   Overall good company
good,No family life work a lot of hours.  No vacations unless you find someone to work for you. Bonus time is good.Would not recommend for anyone with small chidren and family.
good,"Pretty laid back, yet major responsibilities. Long overnight hours, surrounded by nothing but guys so you have to be prepared as a woman to understand men will be men. Overall great job for extra money, or steady money if it's what you prefer. Slow nights, busy mornings. A bit of paperwork"
good,"I was a temporary employee, so most of these questions do not apply to my situation at Nucor--regarding benefits, etc.  However, I can say that they are very safety focused, and this is obvious in the culture which is very evident everywhere in the workplace."
good,Nothing to say at all. There is a good environment work in that company.
good,"Nucor was a great place to learn. The work shifts are at least 12 hours. I worked several times where the next shift mechanic didn't show up for work and i was expected to stay his shift as well. I worked as long as 22 hours in a row on more than one occasion."
good,Too many people in management who didn't know what they were doing resulting in inefficiency and long work hours. A lot of good people but developed into a culture of fear and intimidation towards the end of my tenure.
good,"Good pay, okay benefits.  Unrealistic expectations and no training structure to get new employees up to speed.  No feedback on your own performance and more is communicated through rumors than directly to the affected person."
good,"enjoyed working here  no issues at all, the envirenment was great and the co workers were always will ing to help, management took care of there people i.e. christmas parties  family outtings"
good,"Management of sales and market share growth in the Upstate New York, Vermont, Massachusetts & Connecticut, through a network of 17 building contractor dealerships. Establish new dealership agreements. Represent, market, maintain, and increase, pre-engineered metal building sales. Recruit and establish new dealership agreements Provide monthly, quarterly and annual forecasts for sales. Provide new pre-engineered metal building estimates, specifications, sales and dealer agreements. Evaluate structural and architectural drawings for pre-engineered metal building estimates. Very demanding and challenging"
good,"As for as my qualification and experience is in maintenance and services and marketing related I should be engaged in service head,Business Devilopment of Hydraulic and Welding related product"
good,"The work is good and honest, easy to stay busy. Easy to move up if you blindly follow, don't ask questions, and repeat catch phrases. Management is the weakest link, they promise the world and deliver little. Very cliquey, to the point of making a new job title to put some one ""special"" in an office. Some cranes still in use are WWII era, some even derail. Very diverse workforce. Worst part of the job is there is absolutely ZERO regards for how much or how well you do your job. Best part of the job is the schedule. 7 days off in a row every month."
good,"Nucor is an industrial manufacturing company, which they have become very good at. The issue with the DRI plant is that they are running them the same way. This is not a manufacturing facility, but a chemical plant combined with the materiel handling side of a mining operation. Until this is realized there will always be high turn over and struggling growth."
good,"Nucor day was very productive from start to finish daily. The management offered many resources to learn their system,This job was a temporary  position offered during peak season."
good,"Developed team mates to a higher level, promoted some to a higher position within the company.  Developed their skills to achieve a better qualified team.  Reduced downtime due to preventive maintenance.  Managed budget."
good,very good but very hot long hours but a real good pay when you hang in there then paid over which is great and they are not holding back they also have food trucks that come to you on break all types of food..
good,Nucor was a good place to work. Conditions and benefits where good. Pay was fair.The company sold to a Canadian company and they closed the doors after reassuring us that this would not happen. The former supervisors where very good and fair to all of the employees.
good,Overall a great experience! Learned a ton! Definitly recomend for other interns! They intentionally throw you in without direction to see if you are a self starter and take innitotive to find projects to do. Great safety culture! Production driven.
good,"It's a dirty, hot, cold, and loud steel plant. Paid well for the work but the work isn't for the faint of heart. Hours are long and shifts swing every week."
good,During my tenure at this company I was introduced to many new challenges that my skill set could tackle.  Being a troubleshooter allowed me the freedom to resolve many tasks and prove myself a valuable asset.
good,"Hard and hot work, especially in the summertime.  Able to earn good pay and plenty of overtime available (normally more than you want).  Depending on which department you work in will determine chances of advancement and general enjoyment of your work.  Some managers like to make it miserable and have turned it into a cutthroat environment.  Others truly care about you and want to help you and the team succeed.   Friends are routinely promoted over the most deserving and this has created an environment that requires you to play the political game to have any chance of moving up.  Certain supervisors try to lead their crews through fear/intimidation.  They like to get one or two write ups on your record so that you don't have any room for error, sad the way they've made certain people to come to work everyday scared for their job.  This is not the case with all though and there are several who will stand up for what they believe in and take care of their team."
good,Mine was a sales job.  Each month I had a quota to meet and the management was constantly reviewing progress.  The product is a high dollar one and sales don't happen every day therefore there are time lapses and not much consideration given to the non sales days.
good,"I was in this job for 3 weeks. I had to wear a half mask and a hazmat suit and work with asbestos and chemicals, tearing down drywall and cleaning up. Hard labour, can get really sweaty and hot, working outside is easier. Management is alright as well. Overall didn't mind it that well."
good,"Days are constant movement, production line environment. Employees are expected to be at their work areas at the beginning af their shift in order to keep the production line in motion."
good,I've been with the company for 20 years now (through the hard times and through the good times).....I've learned a lot about people. It's a really great group here and has been a pleasure working with them all.
good,"Good company for steel industry workers"
good,I enjoyed working at this company especially with such a diversified background of people who were employed there. I enjoyed learning a lot about general contracting as well as what exactly goes into the projects that they were awarded
good,Great company. Never closes promotes family. Professionally an individual should never say and or write bad reviews about a current or past employer. Therefore I will not say anything else about Nucor Steel Memphis.
good,"Learned a lot, made me a better leader and co-worker.  They provide a lot of perks, employee dinners, game nights etc....  Depending on who you are you could make a mistake and get fired or you could make several and get a promotion.  Very anti-union.  If you mention union too much you will be fired but it will be for something else that the lawyers can get away with.  I would imagine that after working at a place like this your life expectancy after retirement would be short.  A lot of hazards in the air that don't make the pay worth it not to mention the explosions that you constantly have to avoid when the steel process goes wrong."
good,I work with a great bunch of folks who strive daily to give the customer what they pay for in a timely manner.  Job can be very demanding mentally but that makes for a short day keeping so involved in your work.
good,I come in and I sit at my desk and take care of all the issues that are going on.
good,Working for Command Labor. We had to wear tie vest suits to keep from getting our clothes dirty. We pressure washed equipment inside the Nucor mill and used a suck pump truck to suck all water and debris up that had to be hardest dragging the hose from truck to inside plant.
good,It was a pretty easy going crew. I enjoyed learning new thing. How to operate a cutting torch. Learned alot about cranes and safety and rigging loads
good,"Nucor is a great company to work for as long as you have experience wokring in the metal building industry. If you do not, then good luck being successful within this company. Especially in the Project Coordinator role. "
good,"Great benefits at nucor.  If you are not outgoing,  don't even think to apply.  Doesn't matter if you're hardworking, dedicated,  or motivated.  Must be a Walky talky to get by."
good,"Some foremans are not properly educated.   Somewhat unorganized. Difficult to get a raise or move up within the company.  Too much drama at work. "
good,This is not a career for an entry level designer/detailer. The pace is extra fast and jobs are paid by the customer's contract. Bonuses are very good if you last long enough to receive them.
good,"Fast-paced and innovative culture. High risk/reward pay structure. Good culture. "
good,"Good growth company that tries to be progressive,pays well and has a good profit sharing plan, 401K and health benefits. Advancement is readily available if you are qualified and meet the Nucor profile."
good,"The culture is eroding.  I can tell even though I have only been here 5 years.  Management is becoming more and more like other companies as the hiring practices and culture erodes."
good,"My day begins with ensuring activities scheduled are completed. Guiding on complicated customer/manufacturing issues can be challenged based on management style that is prone to change every 3 to 5 years where the politics can be deadly. Every now a then Nucor cleans house of older employees regardless of success in my opinion. We all would wonder why you'd see a lot of vacancies at a site, like a bomb went off and everyone had to be replaced. Hourly employment is great as long as you comply with the rules you'll have no issue."
good,"Compensation is good. Maintenance Dept has weak leadership and lots of supervisors that think only of themselves. Company has gone downhill over the last several years, putting profits over people. It wasn't always like this."
good,Short and strict deadlines with minimal help. Highly stressful with very low quality work/life balance. Judgmental management and work environment. All mistakes are broadcast to entire building.
good,Enjoyed it for the first 15 years but just became very bored with it and was ready to do something else.  I would recommend this jobs to others as long as they don't mind manual labor.
good,"Worked for a friend of mine.  Learned how to send lien waivers to vendors and how a construction company works.  At times, things would be disorganized and people would get yelled at."
good,"Nucor Construction is located in NYC"
good,"If you are a systems developer or in support of any of the IT systems.  Make sure to always have a bag packed and ready to go.  They will send you to meetings all over the country.  You will find that your best friend is your set of headphones, a hardhat and a pair of steel toed boots.  Once you are in a position you may stay there until someone dies, or you say you want to do something else.  They won't terminate you, more specifically they may leave you in a powerless job pounding salt, until you just give up."
good,"good opportunity, but not the right opportunity for me"
good,"I would start my day at 7 P.M and work to 7 A.M  2 days on 2 off 3 on 3 etc what they called continental shift it worked out to be every other weekend was a 3 day weekend.  My shift started by looking over what work was lined up to run then going through what the previous shift operators were running and talking to supervisors to get the list of product that was needed.  I ran belt furnaces with 2 other people 1 of us would run the holecroft and 2 of us would run 3 straight shot blet furnaces and we would rotate who did what each day whether it was loading and unloading or cutting and checking parts for quality"
good,"Birmingham, AL Division - Great company to work for, but the Birmingham division is very up and down though.  Management makes very questionable calls at times and just because you go out of your way to help them, doesn't mean they will return the favor.  Require you to work swing shifts and results in extreme difficulty maintaining a normal life.  Great pay with how little manual labor that is involved in most jobs, as well as great benefits.  This division of Nucor is awful at taking the considerations of how managerial decisions effect the lives of their employees.  Furthermore, its really about who you know at this place when it comes to advancement and your overall treatment as an employee.  If the employees' overall best interest, including the affect of decisions made on their personal lives, were truly taken into consideration, and if every employee had the same considerations for job advancement and placement, rather than being based on how good of friends you are with certain people or supervisors, it would be a great place to be... except for the swing shifts that is.  Never the less, that is not the case here.  It is still a fairly good place to work, but there is no question, Nucor Steel Birmingham has more than plenty of room for improvement, even after the new GM was hired at the beginning of 2018."
good,"Great company but I feel like just a number. Feel like we have to walk on egg shells and there is no trust."
good,Small offices have issues that need to be addressed. Training of new employee should be done by mature competent staff
good,The hardest part of the job is to get other divisions to work efficiently with each other.
good,"cutting metal, great supervisor, scrap metal is cut to melt and produce new sheets of metal so you have to be able to use a oxy acetylene cutting tourch."
good,Really great experience. Great culture and people. Learn on the job work. Steel Mill culture passed throughout the whole company. A good place to work !
good,"The production employees stand to earn good money, and the earnings are less tiered than administrative positions.  Clerks earn little, but different clerks earn substantially more than others, with caps depending on the title.  In administrative positions, there is the ability to learn more, but not always the opportunity.  Preference is given to inside candidates when hiring, but more specifically to candidates with the most experience as the biggest driver of the choice.  It seems somewhat difficult to move up into a position.  The culture is highly political, and managers have a large incentive to keep pay down for employees despite their own salary being multiples of those beneath them.  There is an overt focus on profitability over people.  People without a degree seemed more or less stuck at a certain level in administrative positions, as a degree was given much focus in hiring.  The difference between production and administrative cannot be overstated.  Profit based incentives were a nice bonus, the problem is that managers get a bonus multiple times larger than those under them, so they have yet a larger incentive to keep wages down."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nucor, everyone was always friendly and helpful. The work I did as an intern was meaningful and had purpose. There was always something to do or work on."
good,Company is very decentralized with a small corporate center. This gives each site a lot of autonomy and ability to make decisions. Not much investment in technology so a lot of processes are not automated.
good,"I did almost every job in the mill before moving into management.  The company as a whole is very solid, however it is one that does not promote retention of older people in the physical work force."
good,The people there were stressed a lot but always got their work done. Did their job without any question. Not very good communication between workers in the office.
good,"This was the best job I had ever had until the economy went bad in 2008. Suddenly, all that talk about a ""family culture"" went out the window when we started losing money. Nucor became very cut throat and hostile very fast. They lied to justify firing good employees. They also fired employees after they were diagnosed with cancer."
good,Start up of plant was very difficult.  The pay was good at times but was based on production.  The plant was not operating most of the time due to engineering failures.
good,Nucor is a great place for a career if you want to work hard and smart.  Nucor will always find work for you even if demand is low.  Overall Nucor is a great place to work and to retire form.
good,"be prepared to work long hard hours. The average day starts with a focus on safety. This is followed morning production meetings then once you know the days schedule planning preventative and corrective maintenance around this. There is a lot of last minute and off the cuff planning to work around operations."
good,"Great pay,  A lot of upper management turnover at the plant level.  If you do not have a college education this job is not for you if you are looking to get promoted."
good,Our team worked off site and on the campus of Purdue University mostly. We were in touch with the staff to make sure we were on track.
good,"Was the sole IT employee for a steel building manufacturing plant -- I was the Helpdesk, Network administrator, phone administrator, etc. -- I took care of everything technical in the plant from employee provided cell phones to the network servers"
good,"creating bills"
good,"Nucor is an awesome place to work the culture is Focused on safety, quality, production."
good,Lots of hours. Good pay when running. High caliber people. Pay for production. Physically demanding. Learn valuable skills everyday. Fortune 200 company and a top 100 ranked company to work for.
good,This is a high-paced environment where work is self-motivated and independent among the team.
good,Worked as an intern with the mechanics at the plant to design tooling and helped reduce scrap rates.
good,"Rotating shifts, high profile repairs, very busy work pace ..."
good,great compensation and hours to work not too much time off but the pay is worth it..
good,Excellent internship learned a lot about the company and how operations are conducted. Gained administration and clerical experience. Great atmosphere and employee communication.
good,I operated an overhead crane loading flatbed trucks and railcars. I also became a 1st Responder during my employment. The company supported the idea of teamwork and allowed it's employees to be proactive and promoted that the team mates take ownership of their area. The 4 on 4 off rotating days/nights 12 hour shifts was difficult to adjust to because your sleep schedule was always changing.
good,"Working with Nucor was a great experience, I was exposed to all aspect of the construction. I estimate, budget and manage a wide range of construction projects, I bid, negotiate and identified and reviewed subcontractor's bids and prepare all change orders"
good,"In my time at Nucor Steel Seattle, I got to travel to several of the corporations other facilities. The Nucor culture is great, unfortunately that culture did not exist at the Seattle mill.  "
good,"The shift rotation is rough. It's 4-on, 4-off switching every cycle between days/nights. It wears you down fast when combined with the fast-paced work culture of a for-profit business."
good,"Great pay during good times, good pay during bad times. Depending on management, there is either freedom to lead yourself or micromanagement. Work/life balance is not great."
good,"I was the general laborer in Litchfield Il before Nucor Grating shut down. Pay is great, lots of hours, and overtime was optional for the most part.. The sad thing is the way the company just shut down out of no where. My teamates and I showed up to work one evening and on the front door was a piece of paper stating they were closing down the plant in our city, we had a meeting a bit after, then we were on our way."
good,"Competitive work environment, Great desires to exceed the customers expectations. Great Team Work, annual bonuses, safety bonuses. Not to stressful or difficult to complete assignments"
good,"Low stress. Inconsistent routine across divisions and between managers. "
good,"Great pay, great benefits, long hours and stressful at times.  Corporate life can be difficult, their are a ton of rules and regulations to follow, its a different culture over there.  At the end of the day, your just a number to them, they push you and work long and hard until you burn out or move to a different department or different job."
good,It's a good paying job with a good safety culture. I would say that there are opportunities to advance in this company if you know how to present yourself.
good,Great place to work. Hard to spend time wuth your family. Great money a year. Management is ok. They are fair about advancement. Have to relocate to move up in the company.
good,"worked there for over 9 years and lost my job due to Nepotism.  the overall company is fantastic to work for, NUCOR Steel is the best company I ever worked for."
good,Nucor is a small firm that specializes in interior renovations in NYC.  The company has open lines of communication to the top management and the day to day operations are run by the principals.  The days are long as the amount of work the company is trying to get continues to increase. They will bid every opportunity that comes to the office. There is a chance to grow within the company and stay with them for a long period of time.  Overall the company is a good place to work and cares about their employees.
good,"Any typical day started with going over contracts or project designs in order to get a job started. "
good,"Good safety culture, with great benefits.  Paid by performance and attendance. "
good,"Nucor is a good company. Most of the schedules are 4 on/ 4 off and swapping from days to nights every week. Nucor does expect a lot out of its teammates, but the compensation is good."
good,"I have worked here for 2 years. Coming to this company with no outside experience in the metal building industry, it was a steep learning curve to gain knowledge of how customers and the company like to operate. Training for anyone without Nucor experience is practically non-existent. If you have metal building experience, this is a great place to work. If you don't, then I would recommend looking somewhere else."
good,"It was okay, I was only there for part Time, we did different maintenance things everyday, like cleaning, sand blasting, cleaning oil spills and keeping a safe work place."
good,"A typical day of work in production is coming into whatever situation you have been presented by the previous crew and adjusting on the fly to ensure that we continue to make tons of steel with safety being the main priority.  "
good,This place is a good place to work.  The work is good.  Great family like feel.  Average 40 hours per week. The hardest part is end of month which required overtime around New Years and Christmas
good,".12hours a day"
good,"Nucor is a good place to work. Paid time off and a personal day. At times it is slow paced around the beginning of the year but given the industry, it is expected."
good,Nucor has been the best company I have worked for. They really care for their employees and the benefits and pay show. Unfortunately my plant is closing.
good,"Run a overhead crane, Feed the lines with steel and do inventory once a month. ship decking on flatbed trucks. unload deck plant line and put in the stock area."
good,Nucor was a great job but when the economy had a down turn the pay went down with it. The hours were long and the shifts were not my favorite. Swing shift was no fun.
good,"good company return on profit could have been better,over all ok cres worked together to get job done correct work safe safety first then production iso  work  safe smarter all times."
good,Nucor is a good company. The pay is excellent when the steel market is great. Never worried about layoffs because Nucor does not believe in laying workers off.
good,"our boss would tell us to continue on pollying the walls and seal everything leaving no air pressure.I learned allot especially handling with tools ,such as glue can ways of spraying glue or cutting Polly.Then when everything seems to be ready we suit up for the task such as removing Espestos. The management its okay ,were told of the safeness at the beginning of our job , I enjoy everyone of my co-workers who don't mind my approach. I wouldn't say the is a specific hardest part of the job , i see it as a challenge that we can overcome and learn how to achieve it.The most enjoyable part of the job,is when we work together and then ending up finishing the job ,and go home earlier then expected with jobs pay day.."
good,"hard work decent pay, the market is slow right now but earning potential is huge"
good,"Typical day at work was like most manufaturing company, be on time & leave on time. I leaned more at this company than anywhere else, company wanted people to stay healthy and be long term employees. Management changed hands often. Co-workers got along very well and were focused on making production goals. The hardest part of the job, there was none due to the help from others. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting recognition for doing a good job."
good,My experience at Nucor played a crucial part in my career as a customer-focused technician. My mentor there first introduced me to basic troubleshooting concepts that I have successfully carried throughout my jobs since. I found the culture to be surprisingly alive unlike a stereotypical steel factory may seem. I was encouraged to take the reigns of several projects out of the gate which gave me validation in the work I did there.
good,If you perform you will be taken care of. Opportunities for advancement are rare unless you wish to relocate. Fairly decent benefits and bonuses if the company is profitable.
good,The schedules are a bit to get use to bur not bad once you get the hang of it. The pay for anyone is great. The rules are very strict as far as everything is combined together. Maintenance should pay more because of the job market.
good,The team I worked with was great and were always helpful in teaching and assisting when it was needed. The sales division has more job responsibilities for the roll compared to the other divisions of Nucor. Management can tend to have a focus more on self preservation instead of working towards individual and team development.
good,"Great workplace culture, great pay."
good,"Nucor is interesting and Dynamic.  There is a lot of opportunity, excellent pay and benefits, and interesting challenges.  The only downside is the workload, which is very high."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits, good pay. A lot of opportunities to advance in the company. Truly cares about its team members. Safety first and foremost"
good,Competitive environment that is fast paced. Family oriented and ensures that employees has numerous benefit options.  Currently working on a project that requires long hours and being away from family.
good,"Nucor was a very safety oriented workplace. They were very focused on producing good product at lowest cost possible. It's a great place to make money if you don't have a college degree, and if you do the detailing center pays well, too!"
good,Nucor overall has a great culture that promotes a bottom up management style. Giving the opportunity to individuals at all levels to make decisions and improvements to better the company. Nucor has taught me how to be an effective leader. You have the ultimate freedom but this freedom comes a great amount of responsibility.
good,Good place to work many people 25 plus years of service. family friendly company.
good,"Great co to work for, good pay, good benefits and some of the highest motivated employees I have ever worked with. The only down side I had with this company was the hours, it was 12 hour days rotating days to nights every week sometimes 5 to 6 days a week."
good,Hard work but it pays well. The team members are great to work  with. Management is a bit controlling. It was a good experience for me but I was ready to move on to a career where I could retire without being crippled.
good,"The benefits are good and they are family orientated. They take care of their employees. The production team has a full acknowledgement of what is expected of them. They work as a team, so in the end they succeed as a team."
good,Nucor was great. Learned a lot during my time there. Lots of opportunity for training. I would recommend. I departed due to pay structure that is based on a weekly bonus.
good,My mill promotes and demotes people weekly. There isn’t a real benefit to being promoted because the pay isn’t much more but the stress and demotion are much worse.
good,"Management should be more interactive with employees."
good,"Good company, Managers are hands off but we are given goals to achieve.Safety is very important, considering being on job sites and in our own plants. DSM's are given the job to help teach inside sales associates about customers and their needs."
good,"Company was great, most people were great.  Some people in management roles should never have been in those positions.  Good pay, good benefits, good culture."
good,"Nucor takes care of their employees. While it may take time to advance, this is usually due to no one leaving. They have provided a good living for me and my family."
good,"when I started thisjob I was a temp,but in 2 months I became fulltime.swing shifts  a lot of over time.the copper plant has came a long way since I left."
good,You are made aware that all employees are critical to the success of the company.  Managers treat everyone fair and offer opportunities for advancement.
good,"Company had good wages and schedule, coworkers were great management was good. Very hot environment dealing with molten metal had to pace yourself to not become dehydrated. all in all a great place to work"
good,"Very stable job.  Not very family friendly.  People you work with are great.  Nucor allows for advancement based on actual skills and talents, not just seniority."
good,Great company with great benefits with potential to move upward. Great leadership fundamentals. I am currently the captain of the EMR team. Our leadership support our team 100%.
good,Enjoyed working with the Nucor team. Safety is their number one goal but some Manangers are very slow to accept new ideas
good,"Manager of the Cafe at Nucor steel was a great job. I was in charge of about 15 employees and my duties included scheduling, ordering, managing, cooking, preparing, menu's, etc."
good,Values the team over education and experience. Compensation fluctuates too much to allow long term planning. Culture is definitely different than other industrial facilities.
good,"Buena empresa, solo que al estar en crisis la industria petrolera ya no me volvio a contratar."
good,Nucor features a production based compensation program. So the amount of salary made depends on a crews willingness to produce despite any mechanical or electrical issues that may arise from time to time.
good,"Typical work schedule is 4 days on, 4 days off, rotating each week between days and nights. "
good,"Safety culture is top-notch...pay potential is way above area average...mgmt is only okay, with questionable decisions that have resulted in a drop in job satisfaction, especially for the metals lab, where they made a difficult job even harder"
good,"I have been working at Nucor-Yamato Steel full-time for more than a year"
good,"A typical day at work in my role as a shift electrician usually meant walking in to relieve the previous shift in the middle of a breakdown.  The day started quickly and was usually a pretty steady pace, which I enjoyed.  I learned a lot about how steel mills make properties and how machinery works.  We were on call at work for 5 different production lines with literally thousands of moving parts, motors, sensors and instruments.  We were going through somewhat of an organizational change and our management was doing the best they could to make the move as smooth as possible.  I very much enjoyed my co-workers and found them to be some of the hardest working people I have ever met.  The hardest part of the job was, due to the fact that we ran so lean, I worked a ton of overtime on different shifts.  It was easy to get days and nights mixed up and that affected the quality of my time at home with my family.  I work hard and have never been one to turn down extra hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always something new to learn and a skill to apply."
good,The company is very family-oriented. I enjoyed working with a team that cared. We all were team players.  My co-workers was very easy to communicate with. I learned when you apply yourself to perform the task and work hard you can definitely succeed. The management team truly work hard for the employees. The hardest to me was not able to complete some assignments when scheduled. There's always room for improvement everywhere you go but you have to take the good with the bad.
good,this was a good job it was just very far from home took about an hour n a half to get there
good,"A typical work day included controlling the flow of traffic through out plant site, receiving loads, checking for radiation in scrap metal, generating bills of lading, talking over the CB radio. I learned a lot about the steel industry and how it works, how rebar is produced, what is considered a good heat based on the strength and tensile a bar has to have in order to be considered good product, sales, contracts, account receivable, what it means to be a team player. Management was punctual, understanding and very knowledgeable in the positions they held. Management promoted training and continuous education and self development, the hardest part of this job would be the mental agility that a scale operator has to possess, because truck drives can be very unruly, but the most enjoyable aspect of this job that you met new people, there were rarely dull days and you could always expect something new to happen"
good,"interacting with customer, making sure product is received in a timely manner. unloading and loading ups, fed-ex truck. interacting with accounts payable to get invoice processed"
good,"Safety is Number 1. This is a good place to work, especially if you are just starting out, or need to gain some experience while you are going to school. Keep in mind that you will need to be 100% accurate with only being given 80% of the information required to do your job."
good,"Pay can fluctuate depending on bonus hours and production goals being met, but even on the worst weeks they still paid better than most. An average or good week will pay way more than any similar jobs in the area. 401 match was next to nothing and you took a big pay cut when using vacation, but the great pay more than made up for it."
good,"good company to work for, tool and die, cnc machining, good paying job, friendly people, fairly clean. VERY SAFETY CONSCIOUS."
good,Nucor prides itself on finding teammates that will be dedicated co-workers and long term employees. There are lots of opportunities for those who want to advance their career as it is a large steel products company
good,Nucor is committed to investing in their employees and provides stable employment opportunities with consistent advancement as long as you're willing to relocate to where opportunities present themselves.
good,Great and motivated people to work with. You will learn a lot about the rebar and flat bar industry. VPP Safety Program which provides you up to date Safety Rules and Regulations with OSHA.
good,"Great people with awesome benefits. Doctor onsite 4 days a week, Chiropractor and massage therapist one day a week. "
good,The work was challenging and most employees were respectful. The machinery was impressive and it is definitely a one of a kind place to work. Pays very well but is very dangerous.
good,"Most of the time me and my crew were given the task of scraping floors, but we would also help around the shop by doing delivers or cleaning equipment."
good,I typical day at Nucor. we would start with a morning meeting with the maintenance and production team. We would talk about the previous shift and try and get good overview of plant conditions 
good,I was hired in as a temp thru man power. The job i was asked to do was noving stacking bens of nuts and bolts. I also sorted thru bens to save good product.
good,I was responsible for the sales in CA WA and OR.  Some days were spent on overtime that required 70+ hours a week.  This made time with my family very difficult.
good,Nucor gives a lot of opportunities for self motivated individuals  The enjoyable part was the freedom to make choices and influence decisions. Hard part was lack of proficently trained  new  team mates.
good,"Leader on the environmental operations team focused on managing daily department activities, coaching & mentoring teammates, and creating maintenance & operation plans for the department."
good,Work consists of reading contracts and other documents. Creating drawings in 2D and creating 3D buildings in 3D computer software. Doing checks on prints to ensure they are correct.
good,"The projects go through your hands fast, with constantly changing deadlines. You're mostly in charge of how your project flows through the system, so you have to stay on top of things. However if you're in need of help there's always someone there. The people that work there are really friendly and helpful. The structure changes every few years. For a few years we relied on a pool of co workers that we would work with then it changes to assigning us with co workers. There's a lot of opportunity for growth and people often go from one department to another. Which has it's pros and cons to it. You have to be able to adapt. This place is good for someone that loves fast paced work and doesn't mind putting in extra hours to meet deadlines."
good,12 hour shifts. Long days and constantly rotating shifts from days to nights. Some supervisors give others benefits and perks and play favorites with them.
good,"We learned how to work with all sort of different tools"
good,Great Job Learned A lot Of New Things. Great Co-Workers Management Is Consistent   ..the hard part was the pipe woke but some times it was easy but I got the hang of  of the the job in it worked out just fin.the most enjoyable part was the people im am a good peoples person I make friends easy in im always in a good mood
good,"Throughout my career with Nucor Steel I was taught to work Safe,  teamwork, leadership, to lead by example and to be a positive influence. Great place to work."
good,"Nucor Building Systems Indiana is a great place to work. Management is kind and available with true open-door policy."
good,This is a great place to work if you want to work like a dog. You can make a lot of money here.
good,Learned a lot about recycling and metal for an automobile industry.
good,"Physically and mentally demanding, fast paced heavy production environment with the foremost importance on safety."
good,"A typical day began with equipment safety inspections in material handling/shipping of coiled steel. Shifts were 12 hour/rotating , 4 days on/ 4 days off. I learned safe operation of pole trucks and overhead cab cranes in loading coiled steel onto OTR trucks and railcars. Management and co-workers joined together to continually meet or exceed shipping deadlines. The hardest part of this job was adapting to the rotating (days/nights) shift. The most enjoyable part of this job was establishing friendships with people whom I had never known!"
good,"Good place to work. If your not use to the industrial environment, then you better prepare yourself. If the hands on industrial environment is your thing, then this is perfect."
good,Nucor has taken care of my family during our time of need. I dont want to leave but I need other options. Everyone who i have spoken to has played or operated in a team setting and that is how our culture is. They train us in every aspect of our jobs
good,"• Responsible for constructing anchor bolt floor plans and details"
good,Nucor is a great place to work expecially for a young person. But if you ever have a accident or a cross word with anyone out there they will not let the past be the past
good,Great managed company that respects employee through their benefits package and being family oriented.  You know what direction your career is progressing through mid and year end reviews.  Spend a great deal of time on training and safety of employees which is great business practices.  Learned good business ethics and how to properly coach employees.  Best part of job is knowing there are other team members that are their to handle their role and support one another as needed.
good,The only problem I had with Nucor was that they hired me for a job and once they seen I had other qualified skills they wanted to use me for that to Train others with no pay raises.
good,Lean management structure with unlimited freedom (at all levels of seniority) to implement creative solutions to production. Ability to actually create new positions within corporate and local business locations.
good,"this was a great place to work. people are nice but stubborn. great benefits and opportunity. it could get hot, stressful and otherwise miserable, but everyone is and we all work through it and celebrate on the other side."
good,"My day starts checking all core equipment then auxiliary systems, I have learned how to build and run a DRI facility."
good,it was a fun productive place to work. I loved the environment and the co-workers.
good,"I have the chance to work with a very good and nice people, I was always introduced to the company in a professional matter and I did my best to complete projects ahead of schedule, and all my concerns met with friendly atmosphere"
good,Enjoyed my contract job for this company. Everyone is friendly and helpful.  It is a very pleasant place to work and my understanding is that they have great benefits.
good,"I enjoy volunteering with and working along side Nucor. I have never actually worked in the company, I have just volunteered. They are very friendly people and they work you hard. But it is nice because they are volunteering and working right along with you. (I cannot change the Start and End dates because they are marked as required. Let me clearify again, I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY WORKED FOR NUCOR; I only volunteer for them)"
good,Nucor is a stellar company with good benefits who actually cares about its employees. One thing to consider when you go to work for them is which mill you are looking at. Work for one of the newer Nucor mills....not an acquisition.  I was in an old school mill that had an old school mindset and was not the typical environment for a Nucor mill.
good,"Great company to work for, but moved department out of the country. Offered great benefits and pay.  Also had plenty of overtime hours to supplement salary."
good,"Amazing company, they are very lean on management which allows teammates to drive the company.  The culture is amazing and Nucor knows how to treat their employees."
good,Interning there was great I was able to learn a lot over my summer and was able to bond with the I.T. Team and the other Interns.
good,"Lmp was a great place to work. The days went fast, and the co workers are great to work with. Management is great and treat their employees with respect."
good,Nucor Tuscaloosa is a fantastic place to work. It's very safe and they do a great job of grooming willing individuals to be leaders.
good,"Nucor Yamato Steel is a great company to work for. They really take care of their employees and always strive for excellence and improvement."
good,"Responsibility is one of the most important fundamental  concepts that I learned in this job. This jobs requires that tasks be completed on a timely basis, as efficiently and safely as possible, with the consideration of the client and other people as well. When working in already established work sites, professionalism is noted in workers as to not disrupt the working environment of other professionals."
good,"Co-workers were great to work with."
good,"•	Responsible for the Design, Development and Delivery of all the modules."
good,"At Nucor Steel you are surrounded by people who want to work until the job is completed. This is mostly because they work on a production bonus, the more steel produced, the bigger the bonus. There are many good work ehtics that I learned while employed with this company."
good,I loved working there and it was hard work and the people are friendly! I like the company and the pay! I got attached to my crew we had a good hard working crew I enjoyed staying busy and cleaning and socializing with people.I was looking forward to getting hired on full time.I loved working 12 hour shifts. I came to work white and left looking black from head to toe because I worked so hard.
good,"Working at Nucor was like working with family."
good,I don't want to write a review. I only worked there temporary due to job placement. I was also pregnant. Before I had the baby I was told they were going to ask me to come back after the baby was born and make me permanent. I never heard back and I contacted them a few times.
good,"Work culture was like family because you worked 12 hours a day. "
good,"On a typical day I would go in,have our little meeting to find out todays goals and what needed to be done.Very organized place and the it was never just you and him we were all a team and that was the best part about the job is showing what we could do as a team and what all we can get done."
good,"Great place to work. Teammates are smart and driven people."
good,"Nucor is a secure company to work for within the metals manufacturing space. They are constantly growing through M&A which creates opportunities for individuals to grow within Nucor. Since each division is different and they prefer promotion from within, this makes it difficult to jump between product groups. A majority of opportunities are mill based ( not in the best of locations). They have a lean management which is great, but that also means there are not a lot of growth positions for various roles (not all). Strong leadership culture, long hiring process (a good thing), lots of decision making freedom, great teams."
good,"shift exchange, check product being run Q.C.  "
good,Nucor takes good care of their employees.  They have a no lay off policy which is good.  Hourly bonus rate varies.  The advancement critieria is not what I had expected.
good,Pays well but goal focus is off base.  Definitely has headed in the wrong direction. Too many supervisors doing nothing.  I feel as if the focus of the company has shifted in a horrible direction. Do not keep you posted on company changes. Communication is horrible
good,"Fantastic everyday all day. I've learned about structural reinforcing and concrete (i.e. different grades of steel, psi concrete mixtures.. etc.) Management is helpful and coworkers are polite. Hardest part is interpreting drawings per details, sections, elevation, and plan views.  I love that the coffee pot is always full."
good,"Good place to work. Pay is good for the area. Schedule is good for time off but it is a rotating schedule from days to nights, so that is the downside. Insurance plan is ok. Good 401k plan."
good,"Great culture that asks for input from every employee. "
good,Good company but they don't fully stand behind their employees. And the pay is based on production so save your money. Feast or famine with them. And a steel mill is a dangerous place to work. So be careful.
good,A typical day is spent running successfully and safely because at the end of the day i'm there to make much money as i can. SAFETY is the number one prior and it teaches you to carry it home with you.the culture is A1.  Do not let yourself get complacent because of doing certain things over an over again. Going home the way i came in but also made myself as well as the company money because that is the common Goal
good,I've been a content Nucor Employee. This is a great place to work - employee empowerment and safety focus is beyond any other steel company. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you realize that your teammates will do what they say and the team will have your back.
good,"While working as safe as inhumanly possible, this amazing company prides itself on the quality of its workers and its builders. While here I worked as a structural steel detailer which is a fancy way of saying I was a drafter on steroids. While working here, I took files that gave the encompassing information about buildings that were being designed for production, interpreted the information, and put it together to create a full model and functional reports to send out for fabrication with the end result being the parts used to make steel buildings. This company has the feel of a mom and pops company while being a large corporation. The pay was exceptional as well as the benefits."
good,"great company, learned a lot about the steel industry, met great people, interacted with many departments daily, traineed all new hires for scale house, implemented training manual they use today"
good,Everyday was a test of patience as the site I worked on had daily breaks and small problems caused by other company's that needed to be fixed. It wasn't a bad thing just constant work which is better then waiting for work. This was a great experience and I enjoyed seeing all the work I put in come to reality and seeing the systems I installed working the way the plans specified. Coworkers made the job even better as the work environment was healthy.
good,"My day consists of organizing preventive maintenance programs, keeping production downtime to a minimum, upgrading and redesigning equipment, ordering parts through vendors, telling machine shops what parts I need and when, plan outages from cradle to grave ~$500,000 projects, develop maintenance team and production team in order to get everyone in a team mindset and on the same page. On top of all these I do repairs as well as a mechanic. Equipment such as hydraulics, pneumatics, chains, gearboxes, rollers, bearings, fans, pumps, compressors, dryers, cylinders, valve stacks, etc."

good,"Nucor is a great place to work.  We make the best steel in the world and no one comes close to our quality.  I'm in the maintenance department as an electrician and when we aren't out on the floor fixing something we are working on our own personal projects for Nucor or developing our skills as electricians/programmers/automation engineers. We work four, 12-hour swing shifts followed by four days off. The night shifts are rough but if you're up to the challenge you can make a lot of money in a short amount of time.  Excellent place to work"
good,"Nucor empowers everyone to take ownership of their ideas. The leadership team believes in engineering leaders. Therefore, everyone is afford the opportunity to take the lead on their own projects and implement them."

good,Open communication with Executive Corporate Management.  Compensation is driven by performance.  Family-like atmosphere.  Dedicated to ongoing training and development.  Safety is job 1.
good,"I was not advancing due to it’s all about who you know out there. That’s why I quit. The only great thing about working at Nucor is the pay and benefits, and that is something you will not find anywhere else in the job industry."

good,The job requires long hours but it does pay fairly well. Good work environment with supportive management who are understandable when you ask for time off. Would recommend working here in a summer position or as a long term career.
good,"I never worked for Nucor but I went there in Terrell for an interview, boy did they put on show! Although for technical reasons I could not take the job, the company culture and the people there were so friendly. From the moment I walked in, there was a personal and professional connection. The interview was not the typical type of meeting with an HR person and they deny or accept you. I took a short competency test to show that I have some background knowledge of engineering. Then, I had a chance to meet the people I would have been working with, understand what the company does, tour the fab shop and tell them what I think. I spent more than 6 hours learning and interacting with the staff. Ultimately, I met with the project manager who is awesome. If there is good team to work for and with, it is that group of engineers in Terrell. I will miss them."
good,hard work but paid well wasn't for from home most all people there was good to work with
good,Very good pay but you will work shift work most if not all your career

I only left when I was contacted to go back to an old job that was offering me more money and the chance to go back to school to attain my ATP certification. I would highly recommend Nucor for anyone thinking of getting into manufacturing."
good,"Working at Nucor I always felt someone had my back. Whether I was walking through a new area or practicing a new skill, there was always someone who was willing to help and most importantly show me how to do things safely. At Nucor you also have so much freedom. If you want to cross train in a different department, it is totally allowed and in fact encouraged. The management can sometimes be harsh, but they're just trying to maximize productivity. If you do well, the management makes a point to reward/recognize you though."

Great management and co-workers. Long hours were tiring but the respect you gained from maintaining 24/7 production was probably the best part also"
good,"The work will destroy your body if you let it.  The most important thing is to remember its all worth it.  The compensation is beyond what is available for any other type of work of its caliber, period."
good,Working with this company has been a tremendous experience. Learning to manage several projects at once while keeping track of all the coordination involved becomes a job of its own on top of actual drafting/detailing. The management style here is very open and supportive.
good,great place to work lots of advancements very very safe place to work
good,"Enjoyed being the Project Engineer on many large multi-million dollar projects. Had opportunity to attend numerous schools, seminars, and conventions across the country.

The best part of the job were the many different challenges."

This in addition to mentoring and coaching my employees are the things I enjoy most of my current role. During the last 12 years of my employment with this company I have learned countless things especially with how to manage employees."
good,"Nucor is full of employees who take pride in results. Nucor is the nation's leading recyclers of Steel. The ouput(end product) determines pay. While interning in the summer of 2010 I worked as a Power Engineer for the Melt-shop.A typical day at work went as follows: Meeting in the morning, employees are given task, and then everyone goes home.

good,"I've been an employee at nucor-yamato for over 4 years.  It is my first job out of college so my experience outside of here is limited.  That being said I feel that I will never be able to find another place like it.  Sadly I'm being forced to leave because my wife isn't happy with geographical location.  If it wasn't for that I would plan to work here the rest of my life.  I'm a young profesional and the steel industry is old so lots of room for vertical movement exists.  The pay is second to none but the work is physically and emotionally demanding.  The people are a hard working and dedicated bunch that go out of their way to take care of you.  Still, don't wear your heart on your sleeve."
