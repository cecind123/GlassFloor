rating,review
bad,"I’ve had better, the money is great. Otherwise choose a family oriented job that will help you grow instead of envying you for having the gift to sell. The older associates hate competition, and will steal your sales! They will get away with it because management does not care. It’s all about the dollar"
bad,Management can't careless than they already do.  Human resources don't know how shifts are strctured.  Hiring manager lied about amount of hours someone will get week by week.
bad,Horrible- been there 10 yrs & in last 2 yrs all has dramatically gone deep into bowels of retail heck with removal of benefits low pay HR brain dead no stock in what sells and buckets of stuff nobody wants. Senior management is focused on stock price only and everything else is out the window . Ratched. ratched.
bad,"horrible work-life balance. management is completely confused at what they are supposed to focus on. One day it's your sales goal, the next day is strictly how you interact with the client and make sure to find as much out as possible.  not a fair pace in who is up next and no one whats to be held accountable. will expect you to overwork without overtime pay. when I started with the company, the companies work-life balance was amazing. they actually treated you as a person, not a number. now they could care absolutely less about who your name is only what you're bringing into the store. And they make you compete with your own company, meaning its absolutely so easy for a client to purchase something online and return it in the store. whereas other high-end retailers will make you return the way you purchased it.  they will hire from outside the company instead of within. and will tell you that you don't have enough experience yet they don't help you grow."
bad,New labor management process being implemented where you are trained on all positions. Cannot master position for your title; constant movement which fairs poorly on yearly review making it impossible to exceed except for favorites. No room for growth or promotion except in management.
bad,"This place is nothing but drama. I was here for almost 6 years. Management is terrible! No one cares about you, you’re just a number, they’re abusive and will terminate you with no warning if they need too. Everyone is injured and they send you to a subpar PT and expect you to move on. They force you to work OT, lie to your face, and use you for anything they can. Do NOT work here. This place is a joke and they’re producing terrible jewelry that has holes, is hollow, and doesn’t meet standard."
bad,"Tiffany and Company management do not promote healthy and collaborative work environment. The company is understaffed, therefore current employees are spread thin."
bad,"The only people Tiffany & Co care less about than their employees are their customers."
bad,"I was wondering why the permanent employees were saying I was a veteran because I made it two weeks at the company. I quickly realized, the environment made you feel like you were in a prison even on lunch break, the outside area was fenced in like you were being confined and you are limited with the dress code. No cell phones were allowed unless you were in management."
bad,"When you interview for this job they will tell you it is sales, $14 hr plus 1% commission. What it REALLY is : some minor sales some operations. You make $14 hr HOWEVER, they also tell you not to ""sell over the full time sales team"" meaning you can't sell anything until everyone else is busy and even then, if you are in the middle of a sale and a full time SP comes up to you and says ""can I help you with anything?"" you are supposed to give them the sale. I don't know what customer would want to be treated that way. Management is ridiculous. Working there was a joke. The most you will ever make is about $16 Hr..and that is if they don't stick you in the back in operations. The only good thing is the company E-Store discount (Which they cut off the SECOND you walk out on your last day.)"
bad,People aka  other employees are very nice. Management is a joke. Everyone walks around like they are on xanex. Hired through a temp agency that gave wrong information on working from home. No chance for permanent position. Training was childish. Overall a bad experience except for co - workers.
bad,"The review of this company is simple. The less you know the further you go. The higher the person you know is the better your time at Tiffany's will be. If management talks directly to you it's a miracle, otherwise you'll never hear about a situation and be able to handle it properly. The company used to be great but has since fallen off and become a joke. Don't waste your time working here, the blatant lack of respect and extreme expectations with lack of compensation is enough to drive anyone mad. Also to anyone reading and hoping to work here, no matter what the customer will win over you. They could tell you 2+2=5 and if they make enough noise management will tell you 2+2=5."
bad,interacting with customers was great for me. Management was horrible.
bad,"Unless you’re an Asian female who speaks either Japanese or Chinese, don’t expect to be hired despite your experience or skills. "
bad,"In the beginning, I really liked working for the company. It was great. The training is 5 weeks long but the trainers were cool so it was a breeze. I loved the caf and the beautiful corporate building. Everything was good! Until.... you get out on the actual floor. They had leads walking around for 2-3 days to help, but you are on your own after that. It got REAL stressful REAL QUICK. You would think since the training is long, you'll be equipped with the knowledge. WRONG. Most of the calls I got had little to do with what I learned. EVERYTHING was ""situational."" I started noticing the leads, my manager and my senior did not care about me. If I asked for help from MY OWN senior, she would flag someone else to help me. Like she didn't want to be bothered. The time she took flagging others down, she could have just helped lol. The people there are so shady, passive aggressive, and ultimately rude The manager is a female dog.  It took me a month to notice that the niceness was just passive behavior lol. I started hating going to work and hating this cold & toxic environment. Nothing was fun. Everyone was usually quiet or if not, were talking to their cliques. And since you are a newbie, you are not in the clique. The pay is terrible compared to the THOUSANDS of dollars they push you to sell. Don't expect no more than $850 every 2 weeks.The hours are trash and even if you are full time, you only will get 35 hours a week. All they care about is money. The only reason the prices are like that is because of the name of the company. It's really just cheap china."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. There is definitely a hierarchy in the company. If you are not the top seller in your store you are treated differently and those under you are treated very unfairly. If you are not part of the Sales team or the management team you are seen as beneath them. Operations is a thankless job, they will make sure you know and make you feel like you are not important in the company. When the ""higher ups"" i.e. market director and vice presidents they won't even acknowledge you if you are not Top sales professional. I remember walking in and being polite on their visits by saying hello and would get nothing back not even a handshake. Most promotions are based on who you know and how friendly you are with them not based on your work."
bad,"Ho fatto l'addetta vendita da Tiffany per qualche mese. Mesi nei quali praticamente non ho più avuto una vita, mesi nei quali ho dovuto avere a che fare con una serie di pazze che erano le mie colleghe, tutto questo a Natale, momento di massimo lavoro. Avevo difficoltà anche ad organizzarmi per farmi uno shampoo. "
bad,"Na empresa era muito produtivo, todos que trabalhavam lá, sempre que podiam ajudava uns aos outros. E assim o serviço sempre rendia."
bad,"This is by far the worst retail position I have ever worked due to inexperienced management. The management team is extremely shady and there is no accountability; HR support and checks and balances are non existent. The culture at the location is very outdated; male management is egocentric, uneducated, and sexist. The female mangers below him are merely puppets that do the work he should be doing."
bad,"I was employee as a Tiffanys' Security Officer in Vancouver. I can tell the your the company has great values, but my store was very poorly run. Very high school like with tons of favouritism."
bad,"Please do not make the same mistake we did. Many jewelers moved to Lexington KY thinking this was a good company to work for. We soon found out how big of a mistake we had made. Management lies, bullying, favoritism, and high school behavior from co-workers, HR and management. This is not an opinion it is a fact. We have good hard working jewelers in their 40's and 50's. Some have had their own businesses but are being mistreated and disrespected as if they are dysfunctional, incompetent troublemakers. The common feeling is ""I can't believe a company like this allows this to happen."" To make matters worse supervisors and some management are being hired from Toyota! We are talking everything from supervisors saying and being inappropriate with coworkers to bullying and retaliation, all the way to keeping tools from some and buying extra for some others. And if you report it, you're the one who gets in trouble. Forget raises and growth opportunities. They'll just make you want to quit."
bad,"The store is created by tenured staff consisting of 2 managers, 2 sales professionals who have worked for the organization nearly 20 years. The challenge is breaking through the ""old regime"". NO training or support. Praise is only given in small amounts and only for a success. No leadership, training or support. It is defiantly ""Trial by Fire"" culture."
bad,"While hopefully the horrible management is not elsewhere, the Austin location’s management is a complete joke. HR has multiple validated complaints by the staff on management  there, but they just keep letting it go on and on. "
bad,"Management team will micro manage you. People are treated unfairly, favouritism with best sellers. Sales targets are not adjusted if you are on holiday."
bad,Very disappointed with the managers being so unfair. They do not help us with all the customer issues do to poor quality jewelry. Losing sales since we do not have the product in stock in the store or warehouse and the other store locations will not release the product. Managers will not support us in so many ways.
bad,"Without a doubt, I can say working for Tiffany & Co. was the worst experience in my career. The internal culture tarnishes the legacy of the brand."
bad,"the hardest part of this job was dealing with their racist management team. my intelligence a problem for them. They tried to keep me in a box, never wanted me to advance."
bad,"Welcome to the real life set of mean girls. Worst store director on the face of the earth. Secretive, catty and totally unprofessional leader. Set a horrible tone for the back of house staff and worked to pit everyone against each other.  You have no autonomy in your work and are constantly micro managed. The director and her operations minion are the two most hated people in the store. She is a bully and a nasty insecure excuse for a leader. I absolutely hated every minute of that job."
bad,"Horrible place to work, Horrible environment unfair, not fit to work for them"
bad,i worked for tiffany for two and a half years in everyday on time always better then expected work performence. laid off due to lack off work.cents then applied ten or more times to get my job back when they were looking for help.never hiring me back.i don't understand why they are treting me like this. this location of tiffany is in R.I.
bad,"don't apply to work here ,it;s a night mare , if you a security you are an underdog , they ask you to do everything ,managers ask u to do your job .cause they are lazy ."
bad,"Sehr großer Druck von Oben damit Umsatzzahlen erreicht werden. Mit Management muss man garnicht sprechen , es werden keine Lösungen angeboten oder man wird in Typischer Weise ruhig gestellt mit irgendwelchen Ausreden ,Wege werden erschwert . Verkäufer werden zu Verwaltungsangestellte"
bad,"The turnover is high on the manufacturing side. Those who are deserving of the positions never see them. Managers out for each other and a lack of true understanding to those on the floor actually doing their job is clear. If you're looking for competent leadership and feedback, don't work here. If you're expecting equality amongst peers, don't work here. Clear favoritism and a lot of rumors of inappropriate and biased relationships with managers and subordinates."
bad,Look for other positions within this company. This is a dead end position that will get you nowhere in your career. This positions kills the hopes of ambitions people.
bad,"horrible place to work.  very unfair pay and commission structure with managers that hassle you rather than support you.  very petty and catty, lots of drama and high school nonsense"
bad,"Managers are perfect example of ""Failing Up"" through promotions that they should have never received. They are terribly unorganized and unprofessional. They set unrealistic goals that none of the sales staff meets. They abusive and tacky."
bad,By far the biggest mistake of my life taking this job. The issue starts and ends with Management.
bad,"They do not promote from within unless you are someone's favorite.  They will hire a ton of new people in IT, realize the company isn't doing well, and lay off all the people that have been there a long time.  It happened many times in my tenure.  Hire a lot, lay off a lot, with a bad severance package, yet keep people on who are seriously worthless."
bad,"The store manager plays favorites, and looks the other way when top producers are in a relationship which is against company policy. I would not work for her again."
bad,"Tiffany has amazing benefits and history. However, it is work environment with constant turn-over, instability and poor leadership."
bad,"it was not a good experience working for Tiffany and Co New Orleans and was very toxic work environment, Management was toxic and not helpful to employees and never promoted anyone over 5 years I was working their."
bad,"Poor training and and a lot of stress about production. Terrible division between shifts and management does not care about it. "
bad,"Profit margin is much lower that necessary due to incompetent leaders. People are allowed to keep jobs and be promoted because they do what they are told. Jobs are not earned and/or kept based on competence or job performance. Job requirements are ignored for some, but not for others. In other words, some people are promoted to leadership positions without having the required educational requirements."
bad,"Management wants you to be as sharky as possible, making customers feel like they are in a used car lot. No real guidance at all, or any consistency."
bad,"You will develop skills needed to work in a luxury retail industry. A typical day in this position includes managing all customer service requests, record retention, and inventory. The training is quite poor, so be prepared to assume responsibility for things you are never trained for. Any misguidance will be documented and remain on your record. Overall it would have been a decent job experience had there been proper management control. Unfortunately at this location management was very unsupportive and disrespectful, and the lack of leadership led to a very discouraging environment."
bad,"Don't expect to advance in Security in this company. Most management security positions have been eliminated. Security is treated as a jack of all trades, expected to mop, fix, answer phones, clean up, oh and yes sometimes security work too. "
bad,It is unfortunate that Tiffany and Co is not what expected. No room for growth. Great benefits. Lots of internal Gossip. Hope Management takes care of issues.
bad,the management was not the best there was to much favoritism going on. to much money was spent on things the department did not need.A typical day at work was to get what ever product your working done right and sent out on time.what I learned  there was finishing and polishing bigger silver product like some of the pro sports trophies and larger table top items working with my co workers was great we had many laughs together the hardest part of the job was the pressure that sometimes I got but after a certain time of that I was able to over come it .The thing I enjoyed was working with my co workers And at the end when I found out that my department was relocating I enjoyed leaving at the end of the day.
bad,"If you like to be micromanaged then this is the place .Words will be twisted and you will be set up for failure. If Management does it's just OK/ normal. Frequent payroll issues and always have to track down your hours. In this day and age , to have this to happen it is pathetic."
bad,Payroll Department has a large turnover rate.
bad,"Fun locations for work if you like adventure."
bad,Great people to work with wonderful experience. Great security and great place to grow. I wish I could have stayed with them longer. The experience was well worth it
bad,"un azienda di lusso? è l'immagine che abbiamo di Tiffany vista in Tv, nei media. Farei complimenti alle varie campagne pubblicitarie, pagine social, direttori marketing. "
bad,"Tiffany's was a great experience to learn what to do and not to do in life. To hardcore on targeta and sales , completely crazy after clients. "
bad,"If you have a passion for high-end fashion retail, certainly can use Tiffany as a career starter, helps to launch into other luxury brands down the road. But, be careful that their pay structure is not rewarding to the more senior employee. The only way to get a raise (not the quarter difference per year) is to move around brands."
bad,"Mağazayı ziyaret eden misafirlerimize gerektiğinde danışmanlık sağlamak, mağazanın finansal yönetiminden sorumlu olmak, mağaza personelinin idari işleri, çalışma çizelgelerinin ve izinlerinin düzenlenmesi ve yönetilmesi, günlük, haftalık ve aylık mağaza satış hedefleri belirleyip bu hedeflere ulaşmak için gerekli ortak çalışmayı ve yardımlaşmayı sağlamak..."
bad,"The management doesn't really train you and most associates are there to only help themselves. There isn't really a sense of unity. Associates will not help you out even if you are new and you're their mentor unless they get something out of it. "
bad,"Con:"
bad,"All tied to numbers, very competitive environment.  No job security, and employees are expendable."
bad,"Unreasonable demands for workload, with the threat of write ups and termination if requirements are not met. While the coworkers are good people the anger and stress levels are so high that it is a miserable place to work. Management doesn't know what the other hand is doing. Every day they are trying some new idea on us to see if it works."
bad,"The managers sit in their offices all day offering you no support.Their overall contributions include:"
bad,Sales based.  Get your quota or your out of a job.  Good part is you get discount for purchases.  Bad part is if they dont like you your out of a job .
bad,"Has such great potential but sadly falls way short. The corporate culture does not value it's people. The company forecast has been soft the last two years and budgets are tight - Directors expect employees to do 120% with little recognition or reward. Work life balance is very poor. There seem to be a few pockets of employees that are satisfied but, at least in the IT Dept, few and far between."
bad,"If you get a job working here, you better hope you become a favorite of management, because you won't be held accountable for anything you do or don't do.  Otherwise, expect to be lied to and gossiped about. Management played staff against each other over and over again.  The politics are out of control.  NOT what you'd expect working for a luxury company like Tiffany & Co.  This environment was like working  in a sorority house with very immature teenage girls, the angst, the drama and the gossip!  Horrible leadership as management actually encourages the staff to lie and gossip about one another and report it back to them like it is the truth. "
bad,"Typical Asian work environment with unbelievable low salary, and scheming female co-workers, each employee is responsible for two or more positions, always OT but not necessary getting OT paid. However, very productive, gained lots problem solving skills, meeting vendors, professional academic events and definitely a fast-paced learning environment!"
bad,"This job has no stability however, They will use you and let you go jut as easily as you were hired. It takes years to become full time. They have minimized hours to about 4-5 per day. This is not a job you can further advance."
bad,"Management expects 4 teams (of 3) to work 12 hour shifts, 24/7 (including all holidays) while the entire company gets to spend time off with their families!  What kind of culture and greed is Tiffany all about? If your 12 hour shift rotation falls on Christmas Eve and day, you have to work both! I'm sure the CEO and board of directors are enjoying their eggnog and pocketing all of the profits for a very happy new year!"
bad,"Pay was lower than average and was not a team oriented environment at all, management did not have effective people skills. No IT support and supervisor would state ""I don't feel like working"" and acted unprofessionally."
bad,"Overall the staff is great to work with, the fallback is upper management and entitled customers. Pay is decent, and benefits are offered. HR is not always the most helpful."
bad,"tiring and enjoyable day,shifting schedules (day&night) good communication, good, it was fun. having problem sometimes, creating good memories with my co workers ."
bad,"Behind a brand that promotes love is a heartless company that has none.  What drew me was the product, the art, and the legacy.  What drew me away was the failed opportunities, management's delusion, the toxic workplace, and the practices they had.  Like the year they founded, they are antiquated with their practices, systems, and direction.  Job security is apparent; however, retention is low.  Those who stay are some of the most disgruntled, cold, childish employees seen.  The company has great potential and a strong future; not with the people they have now!"
bad,"every week something changed. management had favorites, and it showed. The bad thing is that they didn't care if you knew."
bad,"•	Distribution replenishes all Tiffany and Company domestic and international retail "
bad,"Great name in the business - but very set in their ways when it comes to doing business, ways of work."
bad,Tiffany & Co tries to give the illusion that it is a great place to work yet the management only cares about numbers and will not help you advance within the company. They have incredible benefits but the stress that your co-workers and management give you are not worth any of it.
bad,Typical day alternated between CAD work and meetings. I learned how not to run a group. Management suffers because they are handcuffed to corporate. Workplace culture is robotic. The hardest part of the job was knowing a better way to do things from decades of experience and management deferring to less knowledgeable people to call the shots. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people in my specific groups.
bad,"Management does not care about you. They only care about sales and bottom line. There is very little to no chance of advancement within Tiffany & Co. The good things are the benefits, employee discount, and employee store."
bad,"Tiffany's is an icon.  As such, you feel privileged to get to work there.  There benefits are tremendous-- 50% off everything 1x/month.!  You can't beat that.  Management is a problem and has yet to be fixed."
bad,This company does not want Security Professionals. Not a good place for an experienced Security Professional.  Much better for a someone starting in Security.
bad,"Stock of all stores merchandise supply"
bad,The product produced is beautiful and admired worldwide.  The NYC offices that were opened about 2 years ago are beautiful.
bad,committed to ensuring that customer/clients needs are always met.
bad,"Tiffany is a great place to shop if you have extra money to spend after paying your mortgage... but not so much if you work there. It is extremely stressful, you worry every hour on how can you make your next sale!"
bad,"The job and the pay are great. Work/ life balance is good, sometimes you have to do close/open, which is not great, but other than that it's good. Management is absolutely terrible, they are lifeless, they never smile or bring positive energy to the team, and the store director is given so much power over the store, it becomes a sort of dictatorship."
bad,"Overall a great place to work, no benifits witch is a downfall, great with schedueling around hours. Management is terrible tho, i was given the keys and told they seen potential in me. Then a few weeks later was fired as ""people are saying youre rude to customers, and after 2 months of you being here its just not gonna work out"" everyone knows im the nicest person... i was not asked or talked to about any incident nor was i given a situation for the exscuse.."
bad,Job security is non-existent and advancement is driven by how close you are to the management team. The company taunts a robust EOE program but finds it hard to advance minority employees past the junior management bracket i.e. supervisor roles.
bad,There are some very dedicated employees who generate large volumes of work each day. It is difficult to transition between departments. It is difficult to be promoted or receive anything other than a minimal yearly pay increase. Management does not seem very appreciative of the work that is done within their department. They just keep expecting more work from employees who produce high quality work.
bad,"While this company has many opportunities for sharpening your abilities, management is in a frenzy trying to figure out the company narrative at a critical time. Data operations issues make intelligence a major deficit."
bad,"The HR has great programs and benefits programs, but actual work life really depends on how the managers manage each location. Staffs could be bully and it all up to how good the management is."
bad,"A typical day at work would be described as follow :"
bad,I learned alot working for Tiffany and Company especially in the areas of my computer skills. I have enjoyed the various types of customers I have had a chance to meet and enjoy making them feel comfortable and pleased with my service. Management can be fickle to deal with as there are 4 managers and very few employees.
bad,A great company that has excellent values and vision. Lack of leadership at the store level. It provides great benefits but does not pay competitive salaries. Lack of opportunities for career advancement.
bad,"Tiffany&co what a great company to work in, although! it could be so much better! if their were better management teams, Tiffany&co. would be such a better place to work at! i gave 3 and half years of my life to tiffany's and learn so much from it! from carpentry to Engineering and electrician, had great teachers! i wish i could've retired from this company but do to the lack of management judgement lots of things felt through the cracks, i always said a happy worker performs 100% but a stress out none appreciated workers would only gives 50%"
bad,Molto stressante con obiettivo ed è molto stancante.
good,"Amazing company discount. Employee store only available for employees.  Normal vacation, sick etc... Work traditional retail hours and pay. Work pretty much every weekend."
good,The company has changed for the worse.  Management is abusive and there is no work life balance or regard to life at all.  Management works you until you crack and then they kick you to the side and bring in someone new.  This pattern is obvious yet no one acknowledges it.  Bad all around.
good,Terrible management. Mandatory overtime every Saturday. Trying to become computerized but at a snails pace. Yearly raises are dismal. Tooling is almost impossible to get. Wealthy company that treats its employees like trash. No bonuses ever.
good,"Biased management fail to recognise achievement."
good,Not the place for a Security Professional.  Other job assignments takes you away from the job you were hired to do.  Management at the regional level is lax at best.  Senior Branch Security Officers as promoted due to affability with management rather than experience.
good,This is a wonderful company that offers great benefits and compensation. That is off set by very bad low and mid level  managers who promote their favorites and are poorly trained in employee interactions.
good,I wouldn't recommend working here if you are trying to advance in a company.  Pay is low and Management and HR are unreliable.  Workflow is patchy too
good,"I have worked in a Tiffany location in the Southeast and then transferred to one of the New York stores after a year. This was my first foray into the jewelry world after having sold everything from lawnmower to high end large appliances. First off I will say that the products are absolutely phenomenal from the perspective of craftsmanship. I have learned a huge amount about jewelry and gemstones but that is due to my own pursuit of GIA credentials rather than any particularly comprehensive training. The stores are gorgeous and in general the clientele is far better to deal with than the typical retail types. "
good,"The company is storied and has a lot of brand recognition.  However the management leaves much to be desired and is at times, quite overbearing.  The potential to make a good income is there, commission based but in my opinion not a fair comp structure."
good,"Director of Sales is rude and insulting, interferes with selling, hovers over customers anxiously. Management is out of touch.  Authoritative degrading leadership style and also changes expectations several times in the course of a day. Management competes with sales team for attention. (Start date other than listed in this review for anonymity)"
good,The call center was very stressful and you were monitored every second of your shift.  I understand it is necessary for a call center but it was not fun or enjoyable.  Upper management had their favorites and it showed.
good,"typical work day busy and smiling, learned about material handling and data entry. management needs major improvement in communication with employers,co-workers excellent"
good,Tiffany's is a good job. I would say its a large company with a small family. Each department seems very personal and connected. Lots of behind the scenes politics and unknowns which is expected when there are so many levels in a large company. All around it has been enjoyable.
good,"Overall, it's a great company - respectful peer employee relationships, good benefits, environmentally conscious company.  "
good,"No work/life balance,  worked every weekend and employees never got along with each other.  It felt like everyone was for them self.  NO TEAMWORK."
good,"Better than average cafeteria,   exceptional employee discounts, excellent people and work environment.  Very positive experience.  Did i mention Better than average cafeteria and   exceptional employee discounts. "
good,"working at tiffany is very stressful. I wish that this place would function more efficiently and smoothly, and work ethic would be higher. I wish people would be treated adequately and fairly."
good,This was a nice part time seasonal job but would never work there permanently. The product and store is true to its brand. The attitudes are very pretentious. The sales associates for the most part were nice and fun to work with. Management on the other hand were condescending and did not treat people equally.
good,"Team spirit and effort."
good,the communication at this company is extremely lacking and people who are less experienced get the grunt and are blamed for mistakes of higher ups.
good,"The daily change of priorities in a fast paced environment of fashion creates challenges not seen in many companies in achieving long term goals and projects. Most people will be amazed at the product that comes out of the factory, from trophies for events you watch on TV to product you know will amaze and create memories of a lifetime. Another key part is that the company will invest a lot of resources improving product timelines and cost.  "
good,doing 6 jobs at once but getting paid for only 1.. The company has great potential but you work retail hours and higher management is often disorganized and never have full support of staff
good,"Having been employed by Tiffany and Company for nearly a decade, I can honestly say that it is not the same as when I started working there. The major drawback for TCO today is that it can't decide whether it wants to remain a luxury retailer or become part of the mainstream."
good,"Growth opportunity non existent. "
good,"The environment was overall pleasant, but a few things like management and such could be changed to make things run smoother. The people who work and are in management positions are very kind and helpful."
good,"Choose not to provide much detail."
good,"I enjoyed aspects of my job as Ambassador such as meeting people from all over the world, and of course being surrounded by beautiful merchandise. The company does provide information about company initiatives,food at staff meetings, free lunches. The process of advancing was difficult however, with little or no communication about status of applications."
good,I Believe that the unique history of Tiffany is valuable. I Also believe that in accordance places like Tiffanys should maintain a positive working environment . The best thing I gained from tiffany is the different customer experiences and the fact that you get to work with people from all over the world.
good,Have been with Tiffany fourteen years. Company with great values and security as far as insurance goes. Having good co-workers and management listen and offering ideas to help better the progress on the individual and the company.
good,"It has become hard to work there, where employees are treated more like a liability than an asset."
good,"You were given a order to fulfill with a certain product , open up boxes and wrap the product in bubble wrap. I learned time management and also how to work under pressure . My co-workers were ok just like any other job you get along with some more then others . The hardest part of the job was if an order was to large"
good,Management didnt care just didnt ever want to rock any boat but were nice enough. Other sales associates tho are complete sharks who dont care if it is your customer and will insert themselves in your sale and take over the sale without any prompting from you for 'help' for anything.
good,"If you are in a small store, everything depends on the strength or weakness of the management in that store. This supersedes the management of the company in general."
good,Once you show you're good at something they will do everything to keep you in that position. They hype up the yearly bonus but its very minimal. The people are great and the facility is diverse
good,"Decent pay and good benefits, but little to no room for advancement or job change within the company.  Production expectation is intense and stressful, includes scanning each work order for workplace tracking and publicly-posted efficiency percentages. Management is commonly cold and unapproachable, but supervisors and co-workers are usually supportive. The hardest part of the job is not being able to exercise all my skills and work to my fullest potential. The most enjoyable part was training with co-workers and working with new products.  Good experience, but not good enough to stay."
good,Tiffany's is a great place to work to earn luxury retail experience. The company has a great discount and benefits. Not a good work life balance but it retail.
good,"Good vision from management, however IT workers lack enthusiasm.  Very segregated IT groups, which leads to very little team collaboration."
good,Not That Great. The hours are long. You have a very small to complete the jobs. Its always rush rush. The company is well know and established as a high end jewellery store. They could afford to hire more people to ease the pressure on the jeweller.
good,"Typical 9 - 5 job"
good,The most rewarding part of my job is working with employees to help them achieve their healthcare goals towards wellness and being a productive part of our team.
good,"I've come to realize that this is a place where you're not recognized for what you know, or how hard you work, or the quality of that work, but for who you know. The management in the San Francisco market is a joke. I was told by my operations coordinator to lie to a customer whose pendant had lost a diamond while being cleaned. I was also instructed to delete emails from other branches regarding merchandise transfer requests. "
good,I'll pass on this question. I'd rather speak directly with someone
good,Tiffany is lucky to have such a strong brand. People from all over the world are excited to visit the NYC store. It is lots of fun and ever changing but can be very tiring.
good,"The department was amazing to work for when I started, however a change in management changed a lot. The feeling of value diminished a great deal. Expectations increased by the year but, compensation was very minimal. The pay was unfair and complained about by many."
good,"Company with a great history. You can meet a lot of interesting people here (many employees are overqualified), and customers from all arround the world.  But micromanagement is not effective and fair. One of the biggest problem is lack of communication. Training program is poor. Managers don't care, how their team works. Work and professionalism are not appreciated. Managers have their favorites: if you're in their circles you can do nothing, but still be more appreciated, than anybody else, who works hard."
good,"Sales professionals held to unreasonable standards, held to high sales goals and reprimanded for not meeting them even when there was simply no traffic in the store."
good,"In my experience, and I'm hoping its purely anecdotal and not a snapshot of the entire company, the training is poor, they tend to believe the best talent is outside of their doors, and goals can be skewed if one sales professional has a phenomenal year. On the flip side, the base pay is good, and commission has the potential to make a big difference in your take home."
good,quickly I was hired as seasonal was told permanent! after. 6 month as 2 weeks before 6months they fired me ..co-workers are excellant
good,"Some locations are very laid back, others are stressfull. All depends on store management. Not a horrible place to work"
good,"Conducted security checks of alarm systems, camera system, vault doors, store surroundings, etc. "
good,"The company as a whole, runs very smoothly, and is well managed. They offer competitive salaries and benefits. The overall environment however in the distribution center is very unprofessional and prison-like. Very high security and low respect for the lower-end employees. Workers who do not do their jobs well and who behave poorly to their co-workers are not held accountable. We are all treated as children who can't be trusted to manage ourselves at all."
good,"Good benefits - healthcare, vacation time, fitness reimbursement."
good,"The company's reputation and prestige of course is what makes you proud to work there, but the individual stores all have bad seeds in management positions. You never feel like managememt trusts you to do your job and you are always competing to be their favorite on any given day.  The pressure is unbearable and I have seen coworkers and managers quit because the work load and expectations are unrealistic.  I have also seen great assistant managers who were humiliated, under appreciated and eventually managed out because the other managers felt threatened.  I would not recommend working for this company... Sad but true."
good,"They don't care how much the customer loves you or what client base you have. You have to meet their numbers or you're useless. Must be VERY aggressive on the sales floor. The more, the better. Management will love you. Run over your co-worker for a sale-they couldn't care less."
good,The years spent working diligently for Tiffany and Company were some of the best I had.
good,"Very clicky, managers who don't manage.  And people who want to be managers but don't know how to be, at least in my opinion.  It also could depend on the department in which you work"
good,Enjoyed working there for almost 10 years.  Job title was eliminated.
good,See resume. Job security. Tiffany experience is excellent. Truly a great place to work.
good,"The sales plans are quite aggressive for the sales department, but the other departments like Operations do not have those quotas. It is a prestigious company to have on your resume, and they offer a lot of training and some opportunities for advancement."
good,"Good health care benefits, qualified coworkers, great product, including engagement rings, and intense online learning programs, has to improve management approach,"
good,"Friendly staff, fun working environment. However they should provide more training for the stuffs on the merchandise and should  guide the staff on how to handle the merchandise effectively"
good,"A lot of people would still have a job if TCO Senior Management would not make promises they can't keep.  Instead they lay off tons of people.  Also a lot of money was wasted throughout the year on trips that weren't needed, and on projects that weren't needed.  Then to make up the higher costs they just lay employees off, employees that have been with the company for decades."
good,it was a fast paced company with multiple jobs to be done at hand. i learned how to work with groups and underpressure. i had to be fast on my feet while delivering customers satfisfaction. it was a fun job that made me learn different aspects when it came to sales.
good,Liked the work. Got a chance to Learn about point of sale systems and. work place culture is good. There is no hard part in the job. I enjoyed employee benefits to purchase Tiffany products.
good,"The best parts of working for Tiffany are the benefits. Otherwise, it depends on the person you report to how much you enjoy the job. If you are okay with complacency, you'll be fine. There are a lot of terrible leaders who aren't held accountable for anything but sales. Senior leadership marches around stores from time to time but don't scratch the surface. Career advancement is seriously contingent on if your leader likes you, not much is based on merit. Education won't help you here, neither will innovation. Training is at best mediocre and completely theoretical. It's a good starting off point, you'll learn a lot primarily from the experiences you'll have and out of necessity."
good,"the job is competitive great discounts at employee store over time if wanted every day."
good,"TCO has taught me great strengths in communication, management style and structure."
good,"I enjoyed working for Tiffany & Company, from the people to the different opportunities that were offered.  Since I left the company I certainly miss everyone I worked with."
good,Tiffany & Co. is a fun working environment they really try to involve everyone and assist their employees however it  is clear you are replaceable. I believe with some upgrades and better management and increased pay it would be one of the greatest places to work. But much is to be improved as far as employee satisfaction.
good,"Short term assignment - stressful to complete the job.  Managers hounded the staff.  Worked around the clock so some people had the overnight shift, which was hard."
good,Managed my own work schedule and the work was ok. I wish they gave me full time. I would of never left. 
good,"You work with different types of people. Love the people that I work with. Dealing with customers was difficult at times. They are flexible with hours, but you do work major holidays."
good,"Hours are long and you work a majority of the major holidays. To be successful you have to work overtime. Build relationships and grow your own business as if you ran the company. Many opportunities for sales professionals. Limited opportunities for operations, security, and management. Great discount and great paying job if you earn it."
good,It was a different environment than I was used too. Very quick-paced but easy to pick up and learn as you go. It's a learning job so you're always learning on the job.
good,Culture differs depending on which group you are in.  Some groups are micro managers and others have good work/life balance.   Make sure to also interview the specific team you'll be working with.    It should be a two-way street so you get insight into the culture
good,at first the job was fun and exciting I could not wait to go to work everyday. This lasted for many years until management changed and it became a living nightmare the new managers were racist and treated the employees as objects that are easily disposed of instead of human beings. Management need human rights training.
good,"So weit so gut. Wurde nur langweilig, da es keine große Herausforderung gab."
good,Tiffany & Co. is first in its line of business on security management. The security focus is on the employee as well as the merchandise. Tiffany & Co. is a good place to work if you like retail.
good,"Good tools and process for customer service.  People are not helpful and do not consider advancement. There is no motivation for working just merely working and then going home.  Sadly, there is a lot of potential in the work process."
good,"Management could have been a little better. Beautiful store, great merchandise, sales professionals are very competitive. Other store staff is hardworking and polite."
good,"Productive and fun."
good,"Tiffany is a great place to work. All the staff are friendly and professional. However, the sales plans have become nearly impossible to meet."
good,Learned a lot while there but job security and promotion are not guaranteed with hard work and diligence. Some have said you are considered a number there. Head of team with work demonstrated without being offered a full time position.
good,"Bonne ambiance"
good,Yorucu bi işti fakat satış anlamında öğrendiğim bir çok bilgi var.yardımcı olan arkadaş ortamına sahip bir şirket
good,"Good hours (typical 8-9 hours a day) which equals to good work / life balance, A negative is that Management Team is constantly changing from year to year."
good,New leadership is taking the human element out of what was an exceptional company. They are investing heavily in marketing and brand management while cutting jobs at the retail level. Drop in quality of service will result.
good,"friendly people"
good,"Great people, with productive and knowledgeable staff and management.  A professional atmosphere with open communication.  Unfortunately as may corporations the numbers are more important then the people."
good,"This company is well established and does cater mainly to the upper class population."
good,"Learned so much as a sales professional there, but I yearned for the leadership role in which I was trained and poised to be."
good,"On a typical date day work, I attend creative brief kick-off meetings and I follow up with a production schedules.  I lead my team as well as other departments to make sure various advertising materials (print, digital, emails and website) are delivered on time and addressed any urgent issues prominently. I also work closely with Creative, Media, Production, Regional leaders, to trouble shoot, resolve timeline, and coordinate information. "
good,"This is a great place to work, you get to combine your love of luxury retail, and meeting clients from all over the world. Plus learn the language of your choice. Mine was Italian."
good,"Great company with amazing history. Very good benefits, possible advancement."
good,The environment had a very optimistic attitude and a successful surrounding within the job place. I have learned to better myself in communication skills with others. The management enforced the standards and objectives of the workplace helping me do the right thing at the right time.
good,Great benefits and a culture built on pride and a long history.
good,"Company offers good benefits and the re-location is a plus."
good,"Checked incoming merchandise with packing slip"
good,"•	Coordinated incentive and recognition programs for major corporations."
good,"Reviewed,researched, corrected and posted suspended retail transactions to Sales HIstory for financial recording for 185 stores. Reviewed, researched, corrected and posted suspended over/shorts for financial recording for 185 stores. Assisted responding to incoming phone calls and emails. Assisted with reviewing incoming departmental mail.Assisted with month end closing and financial reporting. Researched and reconciled GL account. Participated in yearly ""STEP"" programs hosted by a representative from Cornell Mayo provided by company. Participated in several off-site day classes to improve job performance. Worked well with other departments to resolve issues and maintained a good work ethic with co-workers within my department and outside of my department."
good,Working for Tiffany and Company has been a great experience because I've learned a lot and I continue to learn more and more each day. This job is very tedious and requires a lot of time and energy because you not only do everything back of house but you also have to help customers with jewelry repairs and servicing. Being able to adapt to change and being a multitasker is a must when perfoming the every day duties of an Operations Professional. The biggest dissapointment would be Mgmt because they dont trust there employees and theirs a lot of micro managing that happens on a daily basis.
good,Great company but too big for me comfort. Entered invoices then was switched to a different position.
good,"I been working there as a seasonal, they asked to do a full time interview, I left and never heard about then anymore. They don't care, just pretending they do their job but afterward they don't even answered any emails."
good,the workplace was extremely competitive as you would have to be more dominant and rise above your coworkers. the pay was really good and i enjoyed making sales.
good,"Everybody knows Tiffany And Company. You to see some pretty fancy things. Not too many people know this, but they make the super bowl trophies in Parsippany."
good,"High pressure job with cattiness throughout the organization. Creative company to work for, but still struggling to stay ahead of the curve. The brand is lacking and a turnaround will be needed."
good,"Tiffany's has great employee benefits. "
good,"Continual Management Changes resulted in changing priorities.  "
good,Emphasis in achieving sales results through self marketing and relationship development.  The competitive nature that accompanied the commission based environment was not something I found enjoyable.  I did enjoy the opportunities to connect with clients and build long term relationships with them.
good,"I had not worked in a Corporate Retail environment before and I found there are several challenges that face management in regards to getting things done.  The Corporate Retail environment is similar to working with the Government as there are a lot of channels to go through to get things completed.  As it was, it took 3 months and six interviews for me to get my placement.  After 3 months, I still had not received my expense reimbursement for my training expenses.  So be warned...there are a lot of hoops to jump through."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount. The most challenging part of it was working with managers who were inexperienced and unprofessional.
good,Tiffany & Co. had great benefits for employees. The draw back is the retail hours.
good,Loved the people I worked with...but managers were not on the same page. They were very clique’ish...unprofessional at times...but wanted to work you to death. Enjoyed the holiday season...they do feed you to overcome the holiday rush. Overall...I’d give it a high 3.3. Work there as a stepping stone to luxury retail.
good,The Compensation is on the upper scale especially for the jewelry industry. There are efforts to grow as a company and evolve into more modern practices. This will take time to establish but for now the culture is very hierarchy driven with not much flex-ability or opportunity for collaboration or sharing of ideas.
good,"A really great starting point for a career in merchandising, but overall there is very little opportunity for growth. Management has been here forever and is very afraid of new talent."
good,"When i just got my job there in 1999, in was a excellent place to work, i use to just love going to work not because i am being paid, but enjoy the work environment. New management took over and the place just went to the dogs. They got rid of all the good employees that were dedicated to their jobs and go above and beyond to get the job done especially people that have have been there for many,many years. They wanted save money so they got rid of the people that invested all their lives to that company, because they were over 62 and making a lot of money for their years of service, and they got new employee that don't care about the job as people been there for years."
good,"Beautiful history and culture with Tiffany & Co.! Pro's: The work/store hours are great they're not open too late, so work/life balance is attainable. You get to work with beautiful pieces and have nice perks with working for the company. Cons: management is generally not on the same page, you can see who they play ""favorites"" with, most sales associates are snobby/greedy for sales. I was given the ""run around"" when working for this company and although I worked so hard and took as much initiative and responsibility as possible, I still got laid off. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine was, good luck!"
good,"Need to be more structured around the department. "
good,"I loved working at Tiffany & Co. for the majority of the time I was employed there.  There was a major shift in senior management and the business model changed.  The commission sales enviroment changed to one of greed and customer profiling, which I could not participate in.  "
good,"Learned about high jewellery including diamonds"
good,"Management was great. Most of the staff was great to work with, as well. I enjoyed the structure and dedication to training. However, the cut-throat, ""you-re never enough"", corporate expectations and somewhat unrealistic sales goals made it a stressful and toxic environment."
good,Tiffany is an extremely corporate office.  With that you have many pros and cons.  Pros: amazing work life balance and benefits.  Cons: top heavy on senior management and not a lot of room for advancement.
good,müdür yardımcısı kendini genelde cok kasıyordu ve kendini müdürün yerine koyuyordu genelde müdüre bile emir vermeye kalkıyordu.
good,"Tiffany & Co is an excellent company to work for. Excellent benefits, salary, company values, quality product and procedures. Unfortunately, a retail environment allows very little work/life balance, requires long hours, many or all evenings and weekends and very difficult advancement opportunity."
good,"Super nice company to work for. It's alive. Clients come all day long from opening to closing, you don't have time to see the day pass by."
good,Great job. The management is great. The co-workers there were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was leaving.
good,My day at work started with daily jewelry count follow of reports and helping clients. I learned about diamonds and jewelry. There was great atmosphere between co-workers and management.
good,"All day interaction with clients, client meetings"
good,"The energy is great but they care more about service than sales. Not a lot of vacation days which makes it harder -- retail is exhausting in general, but there is growth within the company."
good,Every year I go back around the holidays to work at Tiffany’s for the season. I like it I work from 6 PM to 10 PM after my full-time job Monday through Friday. They pay is $14 an hour and it’s Opportunities for overtime and  double time. I enjoy it but not as a full-time job you be standing on your feet all day prepping products and packing them to ship out. It’s great for the holidays though.
good,"Its all about Sales Sales Sales of course. You learn the back ends of the jewelry industry, how to clesn the jewelry, how to fix an item, etc. Some co- workers are incredible but very catty. Everyone seems to talk behind everyone. The hardest thing is that you can nnot be sitting down. The only time you are able to sit down is on your 10 minute break or your lunch break. The thing I love is how much of a discount you can get on the jewelry."
good,"Information Technology decision making is primarily politically driven, strengthening job security for consulting agencies while severely weakening employee job security."
good,Cross-trained in many different departments.  Able to interact with many customers and expand on customer service skills.  Helpful colleagues.  Ability to learn a lot and gain experience.
good,this company is a great company with good pay and benefits. work and home life balance is a challenge with children though.
good,The work there can be fun due to the constant change and high pace nature. Working with beautiful jewelry always a plus as well as the discounts. People (hourly) are amazing but when i was there senior management at the facility was miserable. Expected to work 10-12 hrs a day plus saturdays were mandatory and no comp for it. I hear that the management has changed and would consider going back because the job was that good.
good,Great Company but the people that run the company are stuck in the 60's. Management is reactive and completely out of touch with the current luxury market.
good,"This is a great company when it comes to training the employees to be the most aware of the product that they are selling to assist with the completion of a sale. Most of the management are willing to work with you and understanding, though under corporate incentives."
good,"Management would talk bad about everyone behind their backs. I seen a young girl get pushed out of the job just because management ""just didn't like her"". She never did anything wrong though, you cant really expect tippity top employees for $5 an hour. (they hire a lot of people under the age of 18)"
good,"I am always busy or finding things that need doing to stay busy."
good,"-Family like atmosphere from hourly employees"
good,"Very professional and high class environment with high as expected, expectations. Great experience in clientele management."
good,"- Most of the management were good, Just a select few that destroyed it for the rest of the team."
good,"I serve as a full time sales professional on the sales floor.  Daily tasks include handling walk-in business, following up on leads or potential business, continuing relationships with long term clients, daily outreach activities, and assisting management with any tasks that may arise.  The main focus of each day is providing the best possible customer service to each customer while achieving/exceeding sales plan."
good,I think it would have been a wonderful place to work if it hadn't been located in a dying mall with sales diminishing year by year which led to increased pressure applied by management. I did like the training opportunities at conferences in DC
good,It can be fun but taxing sometimes because of the hours. It is hard to become full time after being a seasonal worker but then again that's everywhere.
good,Great culture  working environment.  Office and work conditions above average.  Great location in the city.  A lot of opportunity to learn and enhance your skills.
good,"The staff at Tiffany & Company are amazing. The company treats you well,  takes care of benefits and has a positive work environment. They also invest in your education should you want to pursue more learning information."
good,"Autonomy, ability to speak directly with employers, friendly coworkers, convivial workplace culture, room for advancement, three weeks vacation per annum."
good,"I loved working for Tiffany and Company. I worked mostly in the back end, setting up the displays and updating inventory changes. The pay was pretty good and the company offers a lot of extra perks."
good,"I worked the night shift which was from 6 pm to midnight and enjoyed my co-workers. More relaxed setting in the evening, worked with west-coast, worked closely with many departments."
good,"Management is constantly changing and while some are great, others are not. Room for overtime. Growth takes quite long. Always new hires. Products are great and so are the talented engravers."
good,"Very competitive company to work for, however a door opener due to high standards of customer service and very detail oriented work culture. Sales and clienteling skills are a must."
good,While abroad living in London I worked part time in customer service and loved every minute of. It’s been a while though since I have worked there and I’m not sure if this review even helps.
good,"Unless you are in the corporate side you will find it hard to balance your work life and family life while working at Tiffany and Company. The management team varies per location and so does the company rules policies and procedures. Each location seems to have ""their own"" way of doing things. Great benefits, pay is decent and the product is absolutely wonderful! Overall a great place to work."
good,The management needs help on how to train and develop their direct reports.  Unfortunately good people do not get promoted until someone above them leaves.
good,"If you are looking to earn your keep and learn all sorts of new technologies this is the place. "
good,"Tiffany and Co corporate office is a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately, I was brought on as a consultant for a year and a half and was never officially hired. It seems to be their method to get around giving their employees real benefits.  Their store design department seems to be in constant flux with hiring and firing people. "
good,"The company has a great history and life at the corporate level is amazing. Inside the stores you get little to no recognition and you tend to work really hard for little pay. Also, they tend to hire outside rather then promote from within."
good,I enjoyed my time with Tiffany & Co.  I learned a lot of things that I continue to use in my day to day life and for all future endeavors.
good,Its understandable that the jewelry industry would be most meticulous and stringent but Tiffany's takes it a bit further than is comfortable. Feels as though someone is always breathing down your neck.
good,"Very important that you are a good match with your local leadership team. Relationship building is essential. Benefits are excellent. As any place, your growth and development require good navigation."
good,not much advancement in this company in ohio. l love the company but hours make home life with children difficult. great benefits and pay though.
good,A great company going through some changes with the evolution of the luxury market. Such an Iconic American company and a true American institution.
good,"The company offers great benefits.  Overall a good company to work for as everyone is nice and always willing to help."
good,Great company with many years of heritage. The blue box says it all.
good,All the co-workers are very helpful. I enjoyed my first day of training and was able to fit right in with the co-workers.
good,176 year old company that truly represents class and luxury.  Every employee is valued and the potential for growth is endless.
good,"This was my first time in charge of people and work results. I ran shipping/receiving and flow of work between departments. Also took care of verifying costs and discounts of all carriers, ordered departmental supplies and scheduled forklift service, among other various tasks as assigned. A real team spirit between all of us."
good,"Tiffany & Co. proved to be one of my best sources of customer service knowledge. They expect nothing but the best. A typical day was spent in my home office on the phone and email securing appointments with potential and existing corporate customers. Working from home did not allow for as much social interaction as my personality needs. Management and co-workers, for the most part, were extremely professional and guarded.  It was a difficult place to really get to know people because there was always a fear of not complying with the rigid expectations.  The most enjoyable parts were meetings and luncheons with my customers.  Being the front of house Ambassador in the store during busy times of the year, and helping to organize and host special events, awards dinners and charity functions."
good,"Enjoyed every minute here.  Worked with good people. "
good,The company is a great retail environment.
good,I enjoyed this seasonal position! It was great experience for me; the work environment was great and the people were so nice!
good,"A typical day includes thinking fast and problem solving on my feet. I have learned to delegate, which is important in this fast paced environment where no single person can run the entire store. I enjoy the teamwork among the store team. The hardest part of my job is realizing that retail management is not what I would like to do with my life. The most enjoyable part of my life is that it is impossible to ever have a dull moment with a full schedule and a staff of 50."
good,"Good company to work with if you can accept their initiatives, some are not business related, while exceeding production and client contact goals. "
good,Fun place to be.  Administrative offices were over the actual store.  Interaction with the retail side was interesting and fast-paced.  Many different people to work with and interactions with many different levels
good,"Joined Tiff's for a temporary holiday position which was initially to last a few weeks. While a temp the training was good but there is no way one can learn everything there is to know in a 2 week period. Most co-workers were very nice, friendly and helpful. ..upper mgmt encourages this. There is a group on every shift that is favored and are very competitive. The temp employees are held to the same standards as permanent hires but you get to feel used. The carrot is constantly dangled if you are interested in staying onboard. There is no way a temp hire can be held to the same standards of someone who has been working there for at least 10 yrs. Which most employees have been. Often Supervisors dont know what is really going on in the DC and one gets the feeling they may not care as long as productivity goals are met. As previously stated, good for a temporary job, you will get 40 hrs a week, there will be OT if interested and the discount is great. "
good,Overall this company was very good. I worked in the DC.The staff was very friendly and easy going. Barely saw the managers and supervisors were not helpful in solving any issues.
good,"Typical day is review escalated tickets."
good,Pretty cool place to work for a short term. its very hard to advance into a different area of work. the management teem can be very favorable when it comes to employees.
good,"Seasonal position's ends quickly, but it gives you an opportunity to learn more about the business structure of this iconic brand and a gives the temporary employee a small window into the great employee discount. It was an experience that I wouldn't trade for the world!"
good,"My everyday task at Tiffany and Co is welcoming customers, listening to their gift giving needs and providing creative solutions using your art of styling. Most importantly, I will seek opportunities to exceed customer expectations in every transaction and help the store exceed sales plan."
good,"Overall it is a good company. However, since 2008 though it has been in a constant flux. The company has had several layoffs and job eliminations. This has resulted in stores with too few employees, and not enough support staff in corporate to deal with the continued growth of the stores."
good,"I worked there for two and a half years, it was a good company to work for, They treated you like how you as the employee should treat the customer. My job was to open the store assist customers and make the place feel warm and friends"
good,"I really enjoyed working for such a reputable company!  but I did't enjoy retail hours/schedule. Management was good, great group of people great coworkers, great discounts."
good,Nicht gut kleine lohne.Urlaub 10 tage.ein tag frei in der woche.oder keine
good,It was a ok job but little room for advancement. Great management team and awesome benefits. They are a family company and hire from within. Overall great company.
good,Comfortable environment with excellent training tools for new hires. Training was over the span of 7 weeks total. The staff is a majority of females to male ratio.
good,Very friendly and fun work environment. Commission based sales plan which can be competitive but the team works well together. Truly dynamic place to work.
good,"I loved it . I had no problem there, due to me always doing/trying to finish my work for the day to provide food for my family. It's a good place honestly you'll enjoy it there"
good,"Great job for people who are extremely detail oriented. Most difficult part of the job is juggling multiple tasks and requests at once - especially when multiple high priority customer requests are taking place at the same time. Good discount, great product, and an all around fantastic place to work."
good,The culture seems laid back and easy going. Compensation is questionable for a company in the high end jewelry industry.
good,"Team work is what makes or breaks the store."
good,"This is a good company to work. I gained great administrative expertise working in two very challenging departments. The compensation package was satisfactory. My co-workers were great. The most enjoyable aspect of my job was coordinating the fitness programs which included fresh fruits once per week, this had a positive impact on employees."
good,Working for Tiffany was a life goal.  The culture and team were fantastic.
good,The setting for a work environment is very nice.  Retail hours can be long.  The hardest part is the sales quotas.  They are taken very seriously.
good,"I prefer not to recommend this company as a place of employment.  While I have a deep respect for the Company, it's history and products, I have little respect for the corporate aspects."
good,A typical day at work was supporting two vice presidents in the Merchandising Department with daily needs.  There was heavy calendering and travel. I learned a lot about the industry and fine jewelery.  My coworkers were detailed oriented and vey nice to work with.  The hardest part of my job was learning the lingo of a new field.  The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about different gemstones and metals.
good,"I learned a lot about sterling silver, diamonds, and other luxury goods."
good,"I enjoyed my 9 years with them. I was able to go from Jeweler, to QC, and then to management. I had some good leadership along the way, and some bad. They have great benefits that start on your first day. The pay is competitive for Kentucky. But overall, it was a great place to work and I enjoyed my time there."
good,Its alright so far and not enough benefits. Needs more benefits and better management. Employees are treated very well with all respect. Offer day job or night job.
good,Tiffany & Co. is a fun place to work.  The camaraderie and collaborations make ithebrelationshios friendly and not competitive.  The management team is well structured and helps make the store a great environment.
good,Working for this company taught me what corporate companies expect from their employees. I was young and did not know how to use discretion with conversations and mannerisms.
good,"Setting up jewels"
good,This is a great place to work!  You learn a lot about management and customer service. Some of the best customer service and luxury retail training you can receive!
good,"As they adopt latest technologies and best practices, I had a chance to learn a lot."
good,"I enjoyed the seasonal work at Tiffany's. Everyone was there to do a good job because Tiffany has a great name and products. We had days where we could wear different clothing according to a prepared calendar, if you wanted to participate."
good,"""We've always done it this way"" phrase heard far too often. Tenured staff that in many cases should have been turned over long ago. Not up with the times in retail technology and struggle to implement change."
good,"Although this was a temporary position, working at Tiffany & Co. was a great opportunity to not only work for such a well known company, also the customer experience (from my point of view) was amazing."
good,"Assist customers with immediate needs while in store.  Answer questions and concerns about jewelry.  Guide and advise on care and handling of merchandise and direct them to customer service area when necessary.  Take phone calls and order merchandise not in store from fulfillment center and other stores.  "
good,"A great place to work and make lasting impressions on those you work with on a daily basis, both client and co-workers. A truly magical place to work"

good,management sucks! and there rude. but over all co workers were very helpful. it very compeditive here.
good,"What I valued most at Tiffany was it's commitment to investing in people, offering training, education, and opportunities. It was a highly effective work environment with challenging and rewarding project work. Each day was filled with a variety of meetings, fostering frequent communication and documentation. I had the opportunity to present to senior management on many occasions, held international conference calls and cross-departmental forums and webinars. I enjoyed meeting and working with people from various departments and learning about new aspects of the business and industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was posing significant operational efficiencies and being able to see them through to implementation, giving me a sense of accomplishment. The hardest part of the job was speeding up the change process."
good,Working a machine
good,"I enjoy manufacturing jewelry but there is a big lack in communication within the facility. The pressure to keep efficiency up is sometimes unrealistic. They want to be efficient but when we are faced with a new problem to solve or are attempting to be efficient at other aspects of our jobs, we get push back or we are lacking tools"
good,"The company is an overall good company with managers that are responsive to employees."
good,"I enjoyed my time at TCO.  I was treated fairly, paid well and respected by my superiors.  The company culture has changed and the new regime doesn't seem to consider security as a priority."
good,"Like every successful company, change is needed.  Unfortunately Tiffany's has changed for the worst in my opinion.   This used to be a fun place to work, but in recent years they put more emphasis on making sales at all costs, I understand sales is what drives the business, but when you start giving goals that are unattainable, this makes it more difficult to really enjoy what you're doing because you're so stressed about hitting that goal.  There are some good managers but a lot of them are are out of touch because they don't have any sales experience."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people and making lasting relationships.  If some one is interested in doing something fun, a seasonal position is a must. A dream opportunity."
good,Excellent brand and company to work for. Very high caliber talent and opportunities to learn about different areas of the business. Highly recommend for those seeking opportunities in retail.
good,"My career with Tiffany began in NYC in management.  I loved my senior management as well as my direct reports.  After 6 years in NYC and the downturn in the economy in 08, Tiffany hired new upper management and took a new direction.  I left the company for a few years."
good,The company took a big interest in their internship program. I met with many senior level employees who took a genuine interest in what I was doing and how I ended up there. I think it was a great company to work for. They pay well too.

good,"A typical day at work involved evaluating and treating employees for work related injuries, non-work related injuries and illnesses. Learned increased assessment skills, management and communication skills."

The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the amazing jewelry and helping people."

good,Tested the website for every country and on multiple platforms both android and ios on different versions.  You also get discounts to the company store.
good,"With the right focus this could be a good place to work but there is some cut-throat in play at times. I enjoyed working here for many reasons good benefits, I like the hours, we had store discount on merchandise, some co-workers were pleasant and the diversity of the jobs were introduce to such as returns, per-wrap, customer fulfillment, special events like the year we did the rings for the Giants,"

good,Loved my experience working there and learning about the culture. Very good background knowledge before going out on the floor and selling the products and the Tiffany experience.
good,"Working for Tiffany & Company was a pleasurable experience that offered daily challenges and the management support needed to advance. The company has a deeply rooted tradition and a reputation for excellence. They boasted a state of the art cafeteria and workspace equipped with the latest technology. We were offered a very in depth 6 week training program to further hone customer service skills and acquire knowledge of the computer systems used. This position was, however, seasonal and there were no benefits offered to temporary employees and opportunity for advancement was limited in a non-permanent position. I did, however, earn an award for outstanding customer service in my first month of fielding live phone calls."
good,"Tiffany & Co. is an excellent company to work for.  They offer many employee benefits, and if you are open to relocating career growth can happen quickly."

We deescalate any customer service issues ourselves. I love that the most. It shows me each time that I am capable of holding my own with irritable customers. It is a great place to mature professionally."
good,"I worked as a Sales Professional at Tiffany & Co. for almost four years. It was truly an honor and a privilege to work for a company with such a rich heritage and loyal client following. I learned a lot about jewelry and diamonds and other gemstones and had the opportunity to study about them through the GIA. The store that I worked at was a smaller location so I was very close to all of my fellow colleagues, the management team and the back of house and security teams as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was the clients that I got to assist everyday and being part of special moments in their lives. It was even more special to me to develop relationships with them throughout my tenure there. I would have to say the hardest part of working there was the two weeks leading up to Christmas since gifting Tiffany jewelry and the famous Tiffany blue box is even more special around that time of the year so it tended to get overwhelming sometimes regarding the crowds that we would get and the number of hours that we would work but it was still  a lot of fun."
good,"gain a lot of important information about the main field that i consider "
good,"Friendly co-workers, did multiple tasks; shipping and recieving, worked with customers, worked on the computer, etc. Geting to know clients- when I got to help people translate, it was a good environment to be around. hardest part was it was I had to work over time for long hours inorder to finish the tasks I was assigned."

En effet, c'est une entreprise dans laquelle je serai bien resté s'il y avait eu un poste libre."
good,Working as a team is an art and working independently a rewarding challenge.
good,"This is an excellent company to work for. Unfortunately, the work life balance is non-existant. I was unable to see my children and I was completely exhausted on my days off. After 5 years, I decided to leave to have more quality time with my family. But besides poor management at times, it is a wonderful company and I would reccommend it."

good,Excellent place to work. Great management team and employee population. Highly dedicated and supportive work environment.
good,I have learned a lot about who the customer is and how they read the product. From a marketer's prospective this is imperative to how you communicate with the customer. Before relocating to New York I was based in the head office in Australia with little customer interaction. Having the opportunity to be in a customer facing role allowed me to understand the customer behaviors and how they react to our marketing campaigns.
good,"Sul posto di lavoro ho imparato ad usare attrezzi da bar, gelateria e caffetteria tra i quali la macchina del caffè, crèppiera, macchina per fare i waffel.

I have learned that in order to be productive you have to push yourself to the best of your potential and abilities. The management team are truly down to earth and expect for your job to be done with minor errors and expect for your production to be high at the end of the day. I don't consider the job to be hard as for I have learned all that I needed to learn for my job to be completed easily and correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job, I must say is the 15 minutes of stretch time given daily to relief any tension acquire during the day, if so."

good,Tiffany's is a great company to work for. Not your typical retail job. They treat employees with respect and allows you to mange your growth. Tiffany's has various levels of management within the stores that allows you constructive development in all aspects of your job. The training program is unlike any other that I have experienced. Tiffany's prepares you for success.
good,"Every start of the work day there would be a company meeting about the things that need to focused on. Then you'd go to your assigned work space and take care of customers order according to instructions given. Atmosphere was great and co workers were helpful or easy to get along with. Everyday I would learn something new in the system allowing me to be promoted to help out with larger customer orders that were handled in different area. Management trusted me to give orders to a team of at least 5 people to finish projects that had short amount of time to be finished. Hardest part of the job was when there was nothing to do. It would make my day feel longer, I prefer to stay busy so that my day goes by faster and I enjoy the work day more. I enjoyed taking on tasks, projects, meeting deadlines, etc..."

good,"The work was simple and the people were easy going and friendly."
good,Great company. Long hours on your feet. Great management and co-workers. Great additional learning as well as GIA classes. No room for advancement. Difficult to move into corporate jobs.

good,Job satisfaction is easily attainable and the work environment is up to par.
good,Work is busy...but pay is good. I would work there again but at different hours.
good,"Tiffany & Company is a wonderful place to work, and probably will be one of, if not the best and most lucrative retail jobs you can ever have! Your success depends solely upon you (for the most part) and it is now definitely moving away from a customer service based environment to a selling environment. As long as you have awesome coworkers and a good management team in place it will be the best place you have ever worked at. The sky is truly the limit and you can have access to any career path within the company as long as you are in good standing and have a great management team supporting you. I can finally say I have a job that I love and therefore it doesn't feel like work."
good,I loved this company and the people working there     It taught me many new things and opened the door to luxury retail   Unfortunately due to downsizing I am no longer with the company but would go back in heart beat

good,I had a great experience... I was seasonal.. the pay was fair and the schedule was consistent.. there was some mandatory overtime but the schedule was given well in advance. You get great discounts on product... but if you aren't productive. you will not last.
good,This job was a seasonal position that taught me the luxury retail. This is a fast paced job during the holiday seasons. Training is very specific and hours are not really fair when you have responsibilities outside of home.
good,Low stress but plenty of boredom.  Tiffany & Co. is a destination retail establishment and in a downtown location customer traffic was not always what it could be.
good,supportive staff and relaxed work environment 1st job with continued growth towards retail management experience towards my career journey. management staff was very helpful with learning perspective towards improvement.

good,Would take in and send out up to 25 items a day for repair. Would have to give detailed description of item and repair required. Learned how to spot knock offs. Co-workers were very supportive. Hardest part of the job was telling customers an item was a knock off and not a Tiffany item. Most enjoyable was delivering engagement rings to the customers.
good,"Great customers, funny moments, weird and wonderful. Tiffany is a place were dreams are made and fulfilled, it doesn't matter if you're spending £100 or £100,000,000, in Tiffany you're treated like a king."
