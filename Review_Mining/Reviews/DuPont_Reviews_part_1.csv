rating,review
bad,I don't recommend because the management changes hands to much. Management ask you to do something but no one backs you up when you try to complete that task and you get reprimanded for it.
bad,"It was not a bad place to work, enjoyed the hours and how flexible they are, the atmosphere was also not too crazy.  In my position I was able to get my own work order and go complete it."
bad,"No security, dangerous chemicals,no  good benifts, can be let go instantly to save money. All about money, DuPonts. As a contractor at KBR, ZERO benefits. NONE, Nothing, not even holidays. Must produce, even if no information to do job or gone."
bad,I was hired as a manager I received 3 weeks of training did not receive computer or access to programs for 3 months after 2 years of nonstop service and work hours I was relieved and replaced by a less experienced person due to badmouthing from 2 other managers and an HR rep who was very close to the male first line who was to be let go however after they and a female first line got together next thing I knew I was out and he was in so they do not care about facts just gossip and non proven badmouthing
bad,"Management is horrible, only looks out for themselves. DuPont about to shut down anyway. If you have a chance to get out, leave now. Don’t trust anyone."
bad,I enjoyed my work there. I learned many different jobs and like working with  the other employees. If I had the opportunity I would go back there to work.
bad,Do not work at this company.  Terrible management that constantly changes direction just as soon as you start to make progress.  Hopefully the merger with Dow Chemicals helped management figure out a proper strategy.
bad,The atmosphere was great. Loved working for the company. We were bought out by another company and most of the employees were laid off. My managers were very fair and nice.
bad,I didn't really like it due to being a contractor and no one caures about contractors at that plant. Now I would go back if I get hired as an actual employee
bad,pay is ok but hours no and managerment poor never like to help be understandable. Disrespectful people never like to i wouldn't recommand this job to no one.
bad,"Cut-Throat, Greedy, Poor Management, Extremely Poor Work Morale, Special jobs for special people who are not qualified.  No more college tuition refund.  Benefits taken away,  No raises, No bonuses"
bad,Worked as a limited time employee. Was in hiring pool till company went with contracted employees.Was a great job while it lasted.Company never lived up to the hiring process
bad,"we had percks, golf, recreation, boat launch, weight room, basket ball courts, picnic grounds. slowly degraded of years, now it is like most companies."
bad,DuPont treats people horribly.  DuPont runs companies into the ground after taking all their profits and then has to sell them. Killing careers along the way. Dirty business people. They hide behind their fictitious core values. Eliminate positions with highest competency.  They trick into a conference room thinking you are just having a normal meeting when you get in you find the HR person with your marching papers and gag order to sign or you get nothing.  Embedded in the paper work are several copies of their core values and respect for people that everyone that works their knows is false.
bad,"Wrongful termination. No ethics policy or procedures which lets them operate with a gestapo mentality. Hidden agendas, Drink the koolaid or you're out!"
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance - If you have to work weekends, too bad, you've worked more than 40 hours so you don't get paid for the work you must complete on the weekends."
bad,"Hiring process was very long.  Atmosphere was good when the site actually had lot's of employees, then layoffs started and the halls and labs became deserted."
bad,"Co-workers scared of management, FIRE oriented , no job advancement"
bad,"Worked there for thirty years. Company shut plant down and left a lot of good people short on retirement. very little assistance in moving to job openings on other side of plant. Money was good. 24/7 operation including all holidays. missed a lot of family time, kids growing up because of shift work, unable to get time off or vacation time."
bad,"There is no opportunity within the Hopewell film plant for advancement, management is about the sorriest I’ve ever seen. All they do is play on the computer, you ask them to do there job and it’s a problem. Try to get a job at the Spruance site not the Hopewell site!! Worst mistake I’ve ever made!!! Don’t do it you’ll regret it!!"
bad,"Bad management, terrible hours. n regard for family time or quality of life. "
bad,"Very stressful place to work."
bad,Direct harassment from management and fellow employees of opposite gender. Highest of management and HR were given black and white proof and nothing was done. Hostile work environment. Pay is not worth the mental and physical trauma you will experience.
bad,"Favoritism, favoritism, favoritism...if you do not play the game, you will not be accepted. If you enjoy a greed driven work culture, phony antics, backstabbing, railroading and manipulation...this is the job for you."
bad,This is the worse place to work.  Management gets rid of you because they treat their contractors unfairly and replace you without any warning.  They work you to death and don't care if your a good employee.  They are prejudice and get away with it.  Worse management ever.  The place is going downhill.
bad,Do yourself a favor and look for employment elsewhere. They are looking to reduce everyone's salary. Management treats you like you're subhuman. Very poorly managed
bad,"Dupont acts like safety is the most important thing to their company until something actually happens to you then they toss you aside like you're nothing, they put cameras all over our facility so you can't make a move without the whole management knowing about it like you can't be trusted to do your own job"
bad,"The Managers there abuse their power whenever they can. If you do one wrong thing they get all over you trying to find any other little thing you do wrong. Rumors spread as well making it even harder to advance or get on anyone's good side. Pay was good, sometimes forced to work 16 hours a day, which made pay even better. Just horrible horrible management."
bad,You ever get the feeling someone is watching you?  You don't have to worry about that at Pioneer... THEY ARE!! Breathing right down your neck!
bad,"The least supportive environment. Everyone looks out for themselves, no teamwork. A lot of arrogance and negativity.  Management is self serving. Arrogant technical fellows with mental issues constantly berate co-workers and do not get reprimanded.  They manipulate and take work away, then complain when you don't meet your 70% billable goal. "
bad,"The company is a very good company to work for, if you like to be a very small fish in a large corp fishtank ??."
bad,"I loved my work, disliked the culture, the alienation, the bullying, the favoritism, sexism and retaliation initiated by employees after management enforeces policies or procedures some employees consistently abuse. There is no ""protection"" for integrous line managers at this organization. "
bad,"I started with Coastal Training and the company was a great place with great management and benefits.   "
bad,"My experience with Dupont Pioneer was very poor. I was part of the maintenance staff on site and we endured constantly changing schedules, very poor workplace moral, a social hierarchy that I could not imagine in any other workplace environment, 60 plus hour work weeks followed by 15-20 hour work weeks to balance overtime. I would not recommend anybody to go to this company for any other reason but the paycheck. I was well compensated for the job I was doing in the area of the state I was working but other than that, there are very few positives  about the facility as a whole. It was one of the most depressing and horrible workplace environments I have every been a part of and I gladly gave up around $20,000 in annual salary to trade for a workplace with a more positive environment."
bad,"People telling other people to tell other people who have experience, how to do a job that they've never done. Meetings to have meetings and more meetings."
bad,"Management made you think they wanted your ideals, only to be shut down. Plant lacked communication and organization.  Was told training would be available, but more concerned in producing product.  I understand that is the goa;, however, employees are more productive if they are included and trusted and they can believe management.  -- Plant closed after the DOW/DuPont merger.  DuPont seems to be good at down sizing and letting good valued employees go!"
bad,The other employees are great its just the managment that sucks. Its cut throat and micromanaged and they use the buddy system. Benefits are good if you can put up with the drama and terrible management.
bad,"Old style management, no room for advancement,core values and safety are so rigid it interferes with job completion."
bad,Management is horrible the people they have in management should not have a management role they lied to you in your interview about working half a year and in the been over a four year work with all the overtime they post because they can’t seem to keep employees and The morale there is So low that everyone hates to come into work for 12-16 hours a day the Equipment is old and nothing gets fixed
bad,"Great pay, back breaking  labor,  cant see family much. Would not reccomend Dupont to anyone. Alot a discriminating factors, buddy- buddy system. Management is always right"
bad,Started off over loaded and more work piled on.  Multiple meetings per day. Expect to be unappreciated and lack of breaks. Any success was rewarded with additional work as they downsized. Too high stress for not enough money.
bad,"The location is very into themselves and thinkno ones better, if you don,t fit thier little group, you will be the outcast. They post jobs on line to cover thier butts and hire friends and family who have no qualifications or skills for job. Very poor management and zero leadership in this location. Word to the wise, not a pleasent place to be unless you are looking for that type of enviroment."
bad,"Use to be a good company. They say all the right things, but do not practice methods and procedures they preach. Talk about building a professional culture, but moral is typically low."
bad,They told everyone why I was off for.. strangers asked me about my personal health issues and what tablets I was on.. they have no regard for the people who work there.
bad,"Many of the seasoned and competent employees left after the merger with Dow, leaving the ""B"" team to figure out how to move through the spin out of the ""new"" DuPont. Dow employees coming to DuPont were not made to feel welcome or valued."
bad,"I was excited to begin working for DuPont at first, but quickly realized I had made a mistake. I was underappreciated, denied training that was promised to me and they couldn't retain qualified E/I Technicians. The benefits are great but the pay is on the very low end and not to even be considered as competitive with other local companies. Management is very arrogant and often wrong in decision making on critical elements of a successful job plan."
bad,Danisco / Solae merger never really happened and with DuPont ownership that has turned working for a good company into a disaster.  Lots of very bright / good people so all is not bad.
bad,"I worked at the DuPont Spruance Plant in Richmond, VA.  This plant is not well managed.  There are many employees who do not work very hard and I do not know why the Company continues to operate like this.   There are race relation issues that people can not seem to rise above.  People are not treated fairly or consistently. If you try to do the right thing you will not get very far in this company.  You need to play the political game and be good at throwing your colleagues under the bus to survive.  This Company was not a good fit for me. Human Resources is weak and has no backbone.   They are not good at Labor Relations and let the Union walk all over them. The people in the factory are overpaid and take advantage of the Company by not being effecient or productive to get overtime. Company struggles with any continuous improvement initiatives."
bad,The job that was posted was grossly mis-represented. Job responsibilities were far in excess of the job description and far in excess of the qualifications they desired for the position. Several pe OP ple had abandoned this job prior due to the same issues.
bad,"Great smart people to work with and plenty of opportunities to learn from senior fellows and managers. However, you either have to create your own upward opportunities or know the right managers that will support your growth."
bad,"bad management, not a great place to work. the pay is good. i would go else where for a job.  co workers are nice people.  i wish i could think of a better review."
bad,"take stock of whatever units may need filters or pre-filters,this done on daily basis,learned to work with different crews as needed for job at hand,for most part management supplied the filters i put in system to be purchased,didnt have co-workers as such,hardest part was getting filters to and from rooftops,most  enjoyable was knowing keeping air to systems and humans clean and clear best possibly could,took a lot of doing as cared for all units on both sides of street all way to clubhouse,worked with others on different things also,steam traps, heat transfer liquid,and freon just a few things also ."
bad,"I spent 35 years with DuPont.  In the early days it was wonderful.  Lately, it's been horrible for even the employees left there.  I do not have a positive opinion now."
bad,"Did not enjoy working for this company very much. I had personal belongings stolen from my work locker on several occasions. Working indoors is not a well liked thing for me, i would rather be working somewhere outside or for a better company."
bad,"arrived at work ,run a bag line and a box station. worked on a computer and used scanning devices. Pay was good,benefits good."
bad,"•	Collaborate with suppliers and company manufactures to negotiate agreements that achieved the lowest cost of materials balanced against quality specifications, reliability and on time delivery to meet company performances metrics"
bad,"it was an ok place to work, you went to work, did your job, went home and got paid.They have a lot of rules, I mean a LOT. Overall, it was better than not having a job."
bad,"I worked for a subcontractor of DuPont and was wrongfully dismissed by the subcontractor I worked for.  That company was not managed well and I think since that incident has lost working with DuPont.  Working at the plant itself was fine, But communication between the subcontractor Eagle One was terrible and they only promote their long time friends."
bad,A typical day of work starts with a cell lead that  had way too much to drink the night before. Then walk by a couple of narcissists that only know the job they do. Anybody that graduated high school could make them look like fools. It's just plainly outdated.
bad,"DuPont is a monster company if you follow the rules you will surely serve your time an retire, but if you get caught up in the politics you will be purged from the system.  Vonore does not exist anymore."
bad,"Pioneer was a great company for 7 years until corn hit $8 a bushel.  Then DuPont, who has zero experience is the ag business started to replace Pioneer senior management with their own management who honestly had no clue about the ah business. Pioneer lost significant market share to our competitors.  "
bad,management is not on your side one mistake  and your fired. not good place to be socially conscious...ppl smile in your face then try to get rid of you...
bad,Big company but poorly ran. Management treatment of employees is substandard and all to willing to cut corners on safety with high turnover rate leading to new supervisors having zero clue of what to do.
bad,"They are closing down , Work is slow , supervisers dont care about your needs."
bad,They do not follow corporate  and treat people with no respect. Upper management do not understand there roles and responsible for there job and just pass on there job to lower management and hold them accountable for there job.
bad,Not a very good place to be right now if you have 35 years of service or less than 5 years of service.  The company is in the process of arbitrarily eliminating positions that they will have to back fill  in 3-5 years once they figure out who they let go.
bad,DuPont is not the company it use to be. They are in the process of selling off various divisions. Management does not respect the employees of treat them as they should.
bad,Working for united dc sabine i was a operator i was incharge of operating several types of machinery and gauges.
bad,Job itself is a piece of cake but management is the worst I've ever had. Absolutely no work/life balance even though they always talk about it like they care. Have to work mandatory 10 hour shifts every week (Monday- Friday) & sometimes 8 hours on Saturdays. Manager lies to us 96% of the time. Pay is decent & co-workers are great people to work with. Horrible Aetna benefits.
bad,"Numerous mass layoffs, constant fear as peers were let go. Long hrs, low morale, distrust, & lies from management were the norm. "
bad,"The only good thing about DuPont is the pay! It used to be a great place to work, now it’s all about production . They will force you into work on your days off all the time . If you take a job at DuPont say  goodbye to your family because you will make good money but be prepared to practically live down there!"
bad,There is constant change and no opportunities for advancement.  People there are hard to work with.  The pay is good.  It is a live to work type of environment.
bad,If you enjoy a stressful work environment and poor management within a company this place is for you.  They have changed the pay rates and if you decide to work here you can be making less than the person you are working with by $5 or more an hour.  Lots of overtime and people are being forced to work on there days off. So that being said if you want to work all the time with no time for family go for it.
bad,Not a good balance of schedule constantly rotating schedule with days and hours sometimes you are forced to work sixteen hour days up to four days in a row
bad,"Stagnant Management not really encouraging promotions in work life. Good facilities amidst of work to rejuvenate self, like Snookers, Chess, Carrots, Beverages. Optimum Safety measures that are bound, will make you safety oriented all the time"
bad,Could be a great place too work if management could get their ducks in a row.  Normal schedule for maintenance is one or two jobs a day.  Once you get past the probation period just get to work on time and follow the safety rules.
bad,"Working at DuPont's project in Nevada was certainly an experience, not for the faint of heart. There has been a massive amount of turnover in both operations, lab, and management. Safety culture is decent, but it is mainly enforced for contractors, not DuPont employees who mess up just as much. The overall culture is awful. Morale is very low and there is open discussion between employees about other jobs and opportunities to ""get out of Nevada..."" Management is clueless, and I feel sorry for the couple of good managers there. The other management staff is pretty worthless and spineless, always saying they can't do anything about problems. So, if you want a job you can collect a great paycheck and decent benefits while you sit for hours with nothing to do, then it is a good place to work. However, if you are driven and looking for a career with advancement, pass on this place. I learned the hard way!"
bad,Job would be great if management did a better job. Woring as a contractor is better than full time employee. Once you become a full time employee they look for all kinds of ways to fire you. Other than that the pay is great and overtime is frequent.
bad,"Once an excellent place to work the company is downsizing before a major merger with DOW Chemicals. This has created a negative work environment. I cannot predict how it will be in a few years, but currently it is not advisable to work there."
bad,Horrible benefits and job security. Work 9hrs+- per day typically 5 days a week. On call 24/7 for outages and technical expertise.
bad,"In DuPont India and not for overall DuPont. DuPont is great company but not DuPont India definitely. No job security and advancement, management worst. Very very bad job culture."
bad,"Things were great when I worked for DuPont until my unit was sold to Kuraray. Things changed for the worst,we lost a lot so I have decided to dedicate my career to another company.Most enjoyable part about the job is that the nonexempt workers had a good time and were all very helpful with each other. Like a second family atmosphere Mainly on nights, weekends and holidays of course."
bad,As a L.S.E we was told that we will be offered a job in the future where people quit there job which offered benefits in the end people was laid off whenever without pay NO BENEFITS AT ALL
bad,Dupont is a great company however they hire through onboard which is a horrible place to work for. very demanding underpaid over worked. not many days off.
bad,"if you want to make money, and have no life, this is a good place. work nights, holidays, and 12 hour shifts, along side unfit managers, and mental defectives."
bad,Job involved the assembly of circuit breaker parts. Job was not challenging and provided no chance for advancement. Workplace atmosphere was not team oriented.
bad,"Each day brings different challenges as the tasks to be done reflect the time of year. During the growing season the job is very fast-pace and there is a steep learning curve. As a result employees are granted a lot of independence to get work done, but are also expected to pull together and work in teams to accomplish target goals. Work becomes life during these busy times and rewards are minimal. Advancement opportunities almost do not exist."
bad,No benefits when you retire. Pensions are froze now. Managwment is horrible. I highly recommend not working here. They don't care about their people anymore.
bad,This place is a seasonal workplace once the corn is brought in you are done working temporary through Perry personnel very hard place to get hired into
bad,I enjoyed working with most of the IT teams within the organization. Many tools were not used to full potential.  The company does not follow true agile practices.
bad,Working staff are great training is slack and the job requirements are pretty extreme the job itself is extremely dangerous and could be injured or killed at anytime
bad,DuPont in Beloit has a lot of employee activities and events like cook outs and other events but they do a very poor job of making there employees feel appreciated. The plant manager wants all the problems solved his way and I not open to new ideas. DuPont has safety and environment as a core value but the company will not make improvements to systems that support these core values. Finally the management team is corrupt and continues to manipulate numbers and figures to make the facility appear better than they are and to hold the employees to un achievable goals.
bad,It was a hard-working place with no room for anything but working... the managers constantly complain.. all that goes on is people complaining and wanting to leave early
bad,"Company turned a lot of hands, hostel take over, job security is poor. makes it stressful work place for staff. I built my staff up to have them lose there jobs."
bad,"Management is largely the main issue when working for this company.  Experienced, hard-working personnel are regularly ousted or held back by incompentent, inexperienced workers that are friends with higher ups.  Probably nothing new to most but it is worse there than anywhere else I have worked."
bad,Don't mention any illness or you will let go. If you have health issues just keep that information to yourself. Management or Union don't want to hear your issues.
bad,They change your schedule every week without letting employer know about the change. If u tell them u can't work then hours they will flat or tell u find another job
bad,I had to use a pipe cleaners to clean the thread holes it is a huge sewing machine that made carpets.  I got to watch a robot do some work not sure what it was doing just know it came. Out of a door ran on floor looking at the machine
bad,"Anti-customer, antiworker environment, consistently rewarded unethical behavior, falsifying research and safety data to get promoted. Leadership cannot handle any constructive criticism when projects fail, constant reorganization often going in circles, departments pitted against one another. Parent company constantly sends email propaganda to cover up decades of environmental and health disasters."
bad,I can get a lot of overtime.. I was experience in different Departments .I got my forklift licenses.. It was a 12 hr rotate shift.. And I also had perfect attendance.
bad,"Worked with a scrum master who treated the scrum team poorly...often cussing at and harassing team members, especially those who were leaders. The scrum team repeatedly talked to management about the scrum master's behavior for well over a year. The scrum master was never removed from her position--and she was a contractor. Only after several team members left (the body count was at least 7), she was assigned to another team. Now she's been hired as a full-time IT manager. One of Pioneer's core values is to treat people with respect. I never noticed that core value being executed the entire time I worked there."
bad,The company does not care for there employees..Your just a number and the only one they look out for is upper management.So if you have big lips and can play golf..Your golden..Women supervisors are only there because of there gender.....They don't care about company just all mighty dollar.....Been there 18 years gone like the wind...
bad,A typical day would have to be in my opinion very stressful. A lot of backwards and double working throughout the day. Not able to do your job without being told how to complete your job.
bad,"I enjoyed being the receptionist,  I liked greeting and welcoming clients, answering the phone calls, and replying to emails. I worked with a friendly and fun team."
bad,Shift Work
bad,DuPont itself is just another corrupt corporation in America. The plant itself is an ok place to work . It can get very busy sometimes and other times there isn’t much to do besides get caught up on training.
bad,Not big on employee’s.  It is all about the numbers.  They are not big about keeping people happy. This stems from not being consistent with operation discipline
bad,Communication was lacking when it came to changes in SOP's. Certain people were favored over others. Very little opportunity to grow or be promoted in the company.
bad,"Antiquated equipment, dirty and hostile work environments, working outdoors year round and nasty co-workers pretty much sums up my experience at DuPont."
bad,"This company is very good quality of this products and Dupont Coragen Product is Highest Sales in India and as well as Maharashtra "
bad,"The DuPont leadership team had no clue how to manage the organization.  They claimed they were industry leaders when in fact they were years behind.  They preached collaboration but then ruled with iron fists and intimidation."
bad,"Pioneer was a great place to work 5 years ago, the company took care of their employees. Had catered in meals to business relevant meetings, company Christmas partied, even gave away turkeys for thanksgiving. The last 2 years has been a rollercoaster ride with the current management regime. It has simply turned into a what have you done for me lately company. They came up with a matrix tool to use for promotional advancement only to later choose other people and claim management discretion was more important than a numbered metric. There are people you can and can't trust and it becomes obvious once you get some time in. The company always wants you to do more without extending any extra pay and slamming you with no raise or bonus when review time comes around."
bad,Extremely long hours in the spring and fall.  Working conditions in the summer are sometimes less than desirable walking through a corn field in the middle of August.  Management makes it feel like your in high school again.  Some coworkers are great while others will throw you under the bus in a heart beat.  I do enjoy how the job changes through out the year.
bad,The people are great to work with but management at all levels does not care to understand what the employees actually do. Short sighted objectives trump long term thinking at every turn.
bad,"All day on your feet Under appreciated work, Never good enough. Orders overbooked. Miss managed severely. Major managerial disfuction."
bad,poor management. too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  boss is always riding you about something whether you do it their way or not.
bad,"Good work place, friendly staff and a genuine ""try"" at making it a good workplace. However, the company spends so much time and money telling you why you SHOULD be happy there instead of saying it with a paycheque. Very, very disappointing yearly raise which did not even cover cost of living increases made it impossible to stay on with this company no matter the circumstances. Still, a enjoyable time spent with good people stuck in underappreciated roles."
bad,"-Utilize Computer skills such as; Excel, AutoCAD, & SolidWorks eDrawing Viewer"
bad,"Dupont use to be fun, we had days where everyone got alone and got the work done. I do not know what has happen but i hope things can get back to normally soon."
bad,working there was ok. pay was good. felt like I was losing my skills. bored most of the time. too much red tape to do anything there. management ignored needs.
bad,"DuPont was once a great company to work for. Lately, they have been chasing profits and market fads way too much. The company is trying to re-invent itself almost yearly. Sad."
bad,"Worked at DuPont Sustainable Solutions. Poor management. Insignificant, erratic, unpredictable growth and profitability. Business being dramatically downsized. Does not appear to be a business that will remain core to the new Dow/DuPont organization."
bad,"Union site, with some animosity between union and non-union workers. Job security issues stemming from the DOW merger. Poor work/life balance for those on shifts due to a rolling and rotating 6X2 work schedule."
bad,"DuPont was a fabulous company that I was proud to work for for many years and who in these challenging times, still truly cared for and respected their people. "
bad,Not much to say about this.  This is a good company that is going in the right direction but there is a lot of people that have been here for a long time and stuck in there ways.  They don't take to change very well.
bad,For IT professionals only! This review does not reflect the business side of Pioneer!
bad,"I've been a contractor with Dupont three different times and never again. They tell you its a year or maybe even three but if production and money totals isn't where they like it, they will cut you loose without thinking about it. I can't even get my things out of my locker, they are so crazy about it. It doesn't matter how hard you work or how dedicated you are, they will mostly never make you a Dupont employee."
bad,"Leadership is in flux, technology is embarrassing, no metrics, no reporting ability, poor reputation, compensation is good but not equitable. I can’t wait to leave."
bad,"Relax company to work for, some friendly coworker makes the working day goes by smoothly. Upper management should be better at acknowledged lower level researcher hard works and produced result for the company."
bad,"I truly enjoyed my coworkers, job responsibilities, and the research I worked on at DuPont Pioneer. I was also highly compensated in terms of salary & benefits. Because of these reasons, I stayed at the company for a long time until I was laid off."
bad,"The company was great to work for at first, but the pressures of constant layoffs and top heavy management led to a somewhat toxic work environment across many business groups of widely different fields."
bad,"I believe my review may be biased since my division was sold.  However, the people that I work with are top notch Petrochemical operators."
bad,Last but not least i need challenging and growth of work in any companies.
bad,DuPont-Market driven science company with worthy core values and occupied with Highly talented scientist.
bad,"I worked at Pioneer, a division of DuPont. The parent company did not care for us, and during webcasts, the CEO at that time was very condescending towards Pioneer management. "
bad,A typical workday in my position is very demanding.  We have strict goals and deadlines.  I have learned many good and valuable things working at Dupont.  The management that I've had to work directly with are awesome.  The hardest part of my job is making sure the customer is satisfied.  The most enjoyable is knowing i work with a great group of people.
bad,"A lot of changes at the parent company that then passed down to the local companies.  All of the changes are good for the parent company, but were not handled in a manner that was easy to get done throughout the organization. Communication was non-committal and weak."
bad,"Keep site employees safe, so that they come home to their family."
bad,"Smart people.  Technology is dated.  Big and slow organization.  I have had several promotions, but not as quickly as white male and female colleagues."
bad,"In 6.5 Jahren gab es 6 direkte Vorgesetzte, außerdem 5 auf der EU-Ebene und 4 auf der globalen Ebene ein ständiges Kommen und Gehen. Die Fluktuation ist sehr sehr hoch in der Firma."
bad,"Historically, Pioneer valued their employees very highly.  When DuPont took over and converted upper management to focus on short term profits, the atmosphere of the company changed completely. Some of the changes has had the benefit that the company can adjust more quickly to adjust to market changes.  The main drawback is that the long-term vision has been lost.  A company based on crop breeding needs to have a Long Look -- when you're working with biological systems you have to."
bad,"I understand a plant environment can't compete with a research environment but I was shocked and amazed at the level of unprofessionalism.  DuPont (and yes, I do blame the corporate culture) seems to have managed to raise up an entire crop of employees who feel no responsibility what so ever to the company that pays them an exemplary salary and compensation package. The employees are lazy, poorly trained, poorly supervised, and feel DuPont owes them something (this while they sit for 2 or 3 hours at a stretch doing crossword puzzles).  I rue the day I accepted employment at this location.  It was 8 years of frustration and disappointment.  Large corporations may have a certain reputation but always look at the local environment, this location upheld NONE of DuPont's supposed corporate ""core values."""
bad,"Accomplished and respected executive with success in leadership who leads with a team approach and develops innovative strategies to win in the marketplace. Leverage comprehensive knowledge in organizational management and current global marketplace to positively impact bottom line results. "
bad,nothing special like a salesperson in a shop assisting customers
bad,"Dupont is very Safety oriented , I have been here for 44years and 5 months. Things have changed and more to come with the merger with Dow. I am looking to find me something to do for 3 days  or so a week. I  do not want to stop working, I really enjoy it."
bad,"Beginning three years ago with the  ""fresh start initiative"" and now with the proposed spin off into three smaller companies there are a lot of good people gone. There is a lack of experienced personnel to fill critical roles."
bad,"Too much management/union tension.  Many, many poor decisions on behalf of management.  Great pay though......mediocre benefits."
bad,"Pioneer was bought out by Dupont while I worked there and the culture of the company changed, there was less value placed on family values and a sense of community, when Dupont bought Pioneer they let go hundreds of people during the merger and this still continues today. The whole culture changed. The people I was in the same group with were an amazing group of people and I learned a lot from them."
good,"A lot of smart people work for this company"
good,"You are put under very hot and harsh weather conditions. It's a full time job over the summer, and it is very difficult to keep your energy throughout the week."
good,"Pioneer used to be a good place to work up until about 3 years ago. Once they started adding layers and layers of management things started going on a downward spiral ever since. The old saying is true, too many chiefs and not enough indians."
good,"Legal management used to be transparent, strong advocate for diversity, and very engaged with its legal team. Great group of attorneys in staff ranks - honest, earnest, and caring."
good,The site is expected to double from new business and there are many posistions to apply for hourly and salaried.
good,"Days started fine, then the longer I was there, I was expected to come in earlier and stay later every day. When I got to the point where 12-14 hours a day wasn't enough and I was questioned when I took a lunch, it was time for me to go."
good,"The most rewarding aspect of working for DuPont is the salary...PERIOD. The work life balance is terrible and detrimental to your health. It's a rotating shift, working all three shifts each week. The management is terrible and with the recent merger, there's a lot of perks and benefits that has been taken away. If you happen to get hired, make as much money as you can, build it up (because you'll make a ton of $$ in overtime) and start your own business or go work another job that gives you the ability to enjoy life. Remember, it's a chemical plant and the chemicals cause much harm to your body. The average lifespan is five years or less after retirement."
good,"It’s ok, but you really can’t have a life and work there at the same time. If you’re a family person, you’ll have to find time to place yourself at home or wherever your family is."
good,Dog eat dog world.  Compensation okay.  Truly a 24/7 365 operation working all holidays.  Pay was fair.  Management was poor to fair depending on who you report to.
good,I worked here from age 13 till I was 17. Made 7.25 an hour just working in the field. My brother and I  made a lot of money during the summer break from school.
good,"Title: Receiving Clerk"
good,Not the same company. Merger and separation into 3 parts along with continued unit sales makes work very stressful. Management focus not on people at this time.
good,Currently work for Chemours which is a spin-off of DuPont.  The company has a cash-flow problem has at the Bell Site has laid off over 75 people in the last year.
good,"There was a level of complacency that thought the great discoveries of the past were going to magically happen again.  There was know direction and no will to see a program through.  This was clearly caused by a lack of communication between the business and R&D.  Also, there is a clear caste system between those with a PhD and those without.  New doctorates were immediately put into supervisory roles and promoted a an accelerated rate when very little credit and promotion is given to those that do the work under them.  Many Co-workers were more interested in making sure they got their check rather than trying to make a splash, create and innovate.  There was some great science available and the resources of the Experimental Station was amazing but at many times it went unused and people would literally sit around all day and wait for their day to be over.  Dynamic budgets would have staff literally stop doing their work halfway through the year and sit at their desks.  It was great to find such great resources and amazing experience over years but their lack of other industry experience shown right through."
good,The company is going through a massive reorganization and  will probably be sold for parts shortly.  Not a great atmosphere and certainly no future for employees.
good,I enjoyed working there at Dupont Canada for 26 years but the policies and procedures changed when the company was sold to an American conglomerate.
good,Management is out for themselves; do not care about the health and well being of their employees.  They tell you to stay home if your ill; but write you up if you do.
good,"Altough the management are very friendly, advancement in this company is difficult and their is alot of stress put on by direct colleagues. When the problem is brought to management, they will dismiss it based on the ancienaity of the colleague."
good,Dupont pays well. But the work/life balance is not that good. They continue to take benefits that were promised when hired. When is it enough? They used to be very family oriented. But not anymore.
good,Ok place to start off just didnt see much advancement though. Pay was not the greatest.  If you see yourself looking for a career this may be it or it may not.
good,"This site was tainted by such an intense Us vs. Them mentality.  A central cabal ran the plant, even to the detriment of any plant manager that came in.  Advancement was non-existent.  You were expected to be stagnant and thankful that you even had a job.  All the promises for career development only to get washed away in the next downsizing."
good,Even though I worked with DuPont for a number of years I always thought they didn't use more of their employees ideas. DuPont has been around for over 200 years but they never looked at what was needed to stay in the game. They let their competitors take a lot of their share of the profits clearing because they didn't know or refused to plan for the future.
good,"not really welcomed as new employee no real induction to other member"
good,The positions was very rewarding and gave many challenges. The rewards for doing an above board job were good. I appreciated the opportunity any liked working with the people. Overall most of the management group were capable and good folks.
good,"This Company treats and packages seed corn and soya beans.The company has 3 types of employment. Full time, full time temps and seasonal temps. I am classified as a temp but I work all year long. The hardest part of my job is to working with someone who is making double of what I am, doing the same job. There is a division between the full time and the temps. I have learned to run the box wash using the H.M.I. and problem solving. I have also learned to run the rework station H.M.I. I work well with others and we work as a team. We are organized and need little supervision. My lift truck skills have greatly improved. I load stacks of three nested boxes onto the line and once washed I will unload and put the stacks in rows in the warehouse."
good,"Advancement opportunities were minimal and threat of being CTP'd seems to loom over the employees"
good,"If you like long hours of work with very little feedback or mentoring, this is the place for you.  The turn-over is super high here, so don't get comfortable or make friends, they'll/you'll be gone in 2 years.  "
good,"Work/life balance is non existent.  Work 12-16 hour days, 4 days on 3 days off, one week you work day shift the following week overnights.  Rotating shifts, get a couple weekends of every couple months.  Forced to come in and work on your days off if you have low overtime hours. Management is not experienced or up to date enough to run the production process properly.  Lack of training and manpower. Union is hardly involved. Pay is excellent if it's worth sucking the life out of you."
good,"Overall, this company used to offer a good work culture and benefits. However, during the last two years, due to the merge with Dow Agrosciences, several changes have taken place. At this point, the Company does not offer any job security or career development opportunities. Additionally, the working environment and culture, as well as, the management have been gradually modified giving the impression that this is not longer the same company."
good,"This company is fine as a stepping stone to something better. Great for new graduates. Lots of new technology to gain experience. Management tends to not be people leaders, but rather scientists who'd much rather be at the bench."
good,"My time at DuPont was cut short, however, I did like the job. Safety is extremely important and the work was not very difficult as an operator. It was easy to learn and understand the job once I received proper training."
good,"Typical construction job"
good,"Company profile and standards are changing and down sizing is a critical factor among senior management. Direction of company is not assured. Chemical, and agriculture products is the only life line of the company."
good,"Decent pay, but must be willing to work 12hr rotating shift and 2 weekends a month. As far as the work goes, it can be boring. No challenge."
good,Safe company to work for and provides a good living. There are alot of dedicated people working for DuPont. It is a good company to work for I am just looking for other opportunities.
good,"I had many positive learning experiences during my time with DuPont.  I was able to learn from great and seasoned mentors that allowed me to develop my own engineering and management styles.  The work was fast-paced and allowed me the flexibility to manage my own projects and upgrades.  Overall, a very rewarding experience."
good,"Enjoyed the seasonal work at Dupont Pioneer over 35 years of service, Work life balance was ok, if you knew that you had to work extra hrs. in peak seasons. Company can be stressful during peak times and laid back at others..Quick learner on Logistics, and SAP, ,WMS programs to manage whse in a much more efficient way."
good,"Clearly a company that is in a period of change."
good,Great family atmosphere.  The people made the job a great place to work.  This also helped out way the negatives.  I hope that this group can work together again one day.
good,"I've been with this company for several years and the last 3 years has gradually gotten worse. does not support a good work life balance. constantly rotating shifts never know when your going to change shifts until the last minute. management is always confused and can't ever give you a straight answer. the hardest part of this job is starting a job that would normally take you 30 minutes and here it takes you an hour - hour and a half due to all kinds of paper work and  safety rules . safety is important, but they take it too far. also everything within in management is a big secret."
good,"Fast paced, high speed work day. I get better as a machine operator every day. Great line of comunication with management. The weather can play a factor in production at times. The people I work with are one of the best crews I have ever worked with."
good,"Good ol' boy culture. Advancement weighs heavily on popularity with management than actual result. Safety has evolved to risk aversion. Not a lot of room for growth and development. Horrible work/life balance. 40 Hours is unacceptable, 50 is expected, frequent calls at home and weekends."
good,"Management pawns off all their work on to others.  then claims the work for themselves.  Salary positions can work more than 60 hours a week.  The manager is their 8 no more.  The shoulder to shoulder employees are nice.  There is a lot of smack talking behind peoples back, even the managers discuss other employees to techs.  Very unprofessional.  My manager was loud, rude and had no clue how to run a lab."
good,"Enjoyed working at Pioneer until group was merged with another group, and management showed favoritism.  Lots of people sitting around not working, while a few did majority of work."
good,The overall job itself was enjoyable and amazing.  I loved working there and loved working with most of the employees there.
good,"Tough environment when told they want to change and like fresh eyes.  However, embedded culture such as this can be tough to overcome and navigate which can lead to above average frustration on the job."
good,"Trabajo bruto que realizaba mientras estudiaba , consintiendo en cosechar plantaciones de maíz para su análisis químico en laboratorios, el trabajo era cansador y clima laboral grato, pero breve."
good,It has its ups and downs like all jobs. Management really has no clue as to what is really happening with the chemical process. Process technician are the ones who really run the show
good,Company closed due to buy out. Bottle neck was all of the red-tape and extra effort to design and implement a project. I was a the facility for 30+ years and enjoyed for the most part. The people were great and could accomplish anything. Work stress was high.
good,"Es una empresa muy orientada al balance entre lo personal y lo laboral. Sin embargo, los últimos años han sido muy difíciles para los empleados en términos de estabilidad y oportunidades laborales (definiendo oportunidad no solo más trabajo, sino mejor puesto y mejor remuneración)."
good,"average"
good,Operation of machinery and production equipment. Rotating shifts was hard to get used to and you were devoted to the job above all other aspects in life. Pay was good and benefits were fair. Good people to work with and management was fair with it's policies.  No real room for advancement to higher or better positions.
good,Not impressed with leadership performance or management style. Plenty of focus on current buzzwords but no actual system wide implementation initiative. Tends to be flavor of the day.
good,Great exposure to engineering instruments. However during the Co-Op I was basically a glorified secretary. Tons of paper pushing and virtually no freedom of engineering practices.
good,"Great place to work with regard to safety - high safety standards!"
good,Company is being spun off into Chemours.  The science and research was top notch.  Scientist and people were very bright.
good,typical day  was 8 hours daily. I learned how to operate many different types of equipment that eventually help me in my new career. Co-workers were great people never had any disagreements that were disruptive to the job or work day.
good,Would like a different challenge and better opportunities.
good,"Typical work day included data entry, training contractors for updating/renewing companies safety policies/procedures. Provided safety orientations to new employees and or contractors. Updating policies and procedures. Inspecting/maintaining certain safety equipment. Working with other Supervisors/Managers on projects and or goals. Learned more about power point and excel. Learned about working with chemicals. Job focused around safety which was a great learning experience. Enjoyable part was working with my coworkers. Also, through orientations, made a lot of connections."
good,"gran empresa con una gran infraestructura en varios sectores"
good,"there are may things to be learned, i love the company not the people there is no proper guidance to process things .. it is something given you have to do.. if there are mistakes they will yell like anything"
good,overall a nice place to work. not a good place for advancement
good,"Hoje estou trabalhando sob pressao, as cobranças sao muitas e a contra partida e pouca."
good,"Disappointed in their core value statement, they are not putting their employees first during this difficult time."
good,I was very nervous about job loss due to major reorganization inside company.  The work I did was very rewarding and I enjoyed the team I worked with.
good,"its a job and pays well....,co-workers are great ..lots of overtime if you want it and if you don't they force you to work on your days off so be prepared"
good,Dupont is a good company to go to and make a really good living but it is nothing that is really going to challenge you. There is a lot of the same day in and day out work.
good,Learned a lot about working as a team and safety. Biggest problem I had was there are too many bosses. Each area had a minimum of 4 members of supervision on a typical day. And not enough operators for the amount of work. Overall a pretty good place to work.
good,Benefits are good and good people.  Like most places the Grand Rapids Plant has their pros and cons. Pros - there are a lot of really great people that work in the plant.  Cons - at times management lacks leadership skills.
good,"Busy days, outdoors, days/swing and night shift rotation during busy season.  Basic benefits available to employees.  Sick and vacation earned based on hours worked."
good,DuPont provided me with great opportunity to learn and grow over the time that I was working with them.  The company have lived to it's core values that were strongly demonstrated by the leadership. The culture and the work environment is now shifting and appears to be heading in a different direction.
good,Good company to work for but they expect too much of your time.  The location that I worked at expected too much time away from my family and did not compensate for the extra time.
good,"Dupont was a good company to work because they offered excellent pay and good benefits. It was a job that required some mental determination as it was physically demanding, and sometimes the temperature inside the plant was over 100 degrees fahrenheit. Unfortunately the plant closed due to a lack of demand for sodium, if it was still open I would absolutely still be employed there today."
good,"I worked for DuPont for 10 years.  Overall it was not a bad place to work so I will focus on the good things.  A lot of really good people trying to do the right thing...make the company money.  Great support from people on your level.  Pay was good, flexible schedules, and management was good about family issues."
good,"It was nice to be able to play with the kids, build relationships and take care of the families as they each checked into our department."
good,"Mi trabajo dependia de la etapa del año por ejemplo de enero a marzo la venta de semilla de sorgo, abril a junio seguimiento a los cultivos, eventos promocionales y evaluaciones en cosecha maices de ciclo otoño-invierno, de julio a diciembre la cosecha de sorgos y maices de ciclo primavera-verano, cobranza, venta y siembra de desarrollo de cultivos."
good,"Actual competitive wages, Supporting the American dream, Home, Cars, Family. True middle income,  Good work force,  Management, Micro managed, afraid to make decisions individually, decisions made by group so no one can be singled out, fear , The feel of swimming among the sharks. Safety violations or hurt during work can hold a penalty from probation up threat or immediate job loss. Example parking in a poorly lit area, slipping on ice. tripping. even paper cuts. All must be reported, So they can decide what your penalty will be, up to be fired. Job overviews, work atmosphere unhealthy, your there for the money,  under constant review. Work stress high."
good,La mejor interrelación con compañeros de trabajo. Oportunidad de aprender con equipos de ultima generación.
good,"Nice place to work with all world class facilities, feels like secured workplace which creates healthy atmosphere to work upon"
good,"good pay and benefits "
good,"Foi uma das empresas que mais gosto de trabalhar,me identifiquei muito,cresci como pessoa,aprendi muito,experiências que levarei pra vida,o convívio com várias pessoas diferentes,histórias,palestras dadas pela empresa,mi9nha função,tudo era muito bom mesmo."
good,"I worked at the Dupont Valdosta site.  The company is a Great Company to work for with wonderful benefits.  I didn't like the buddy buddy system there.  There wasn't no chain of command structure, nor HR on site.  Your coworker will shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.  Not a good place to work."
good,"I answer phone calls everyday, outside calls or within the company calls and do other tasks as instructed and assigned to me. Through this I've also learned such experience that even if your at your lowest of busy time you should know how to handle it with grace and work under pressure, staying good and maintaining good relationship with your co-workers."
good,Company taught you how to work independent or with a team. Shift were 12hrs rotating. Hardest part adjusting your family to the schedule changing. Meeting new people and having a bond over the years.
good,"Very engaged staff, seems to be a disconnection at senior level."
good,"Benefits are average at best, management is poor.  Plant is older and some equipment is in bad shape.  Management and union often butt heads over different issues."
good,It was a good job.  Swing shifts were difficult to balance with family life.
good,"Loved the variety, challenges.  Offered opportunities to use skills;"
good,"If you're looking for a company that provides a good balance of work and a home life, keep looking.  Very seasonal peaks, but it goes from one busy season right into the next with no slow time at all.  If you're looking to work a lot of hours nearly year round then look no further.  Almost no room for advancement as people rarely get fired from their position even if they're terrible is said position.  Which, in turn, makes a strong point for job security.  Overall if you want to work at place like this, go for it, but it's just not for me."
good,"This was a great location at one time, but economic trends have taken a toll on the future of the site."
good,"It was a great job opportunity, but I was only an Limited Service employee with the company. With being an LSE we are subject to layoffs after we reach 1600 hrs with the company. I'm still waiting to heat from the company about my return."
good,"Empresa con estrictas normas de segurirad industrial, en un ambiente de trabajo rutinario y de poca camaraderia"
good,"Repetiticous assignments daily, monitoring, sampling and troubleshooting. I learned pressures,temperatures, testing and mixtures, also the techniques of emergency responder, firebrigade and teamplayer. Management was proactive in process safety, procedures, teamwork, and training. My coworkers followed the procedures and safety requirements for the job. The job was not that demanding physically but very demanding mentially. The most enjoyable part was meeting and exceeding the daily production schedule with no safety and environmental incidents."
good,"DuPont was only hiring Limited Service Employees which meant you could only work for 9 months max. We knew this going in, but thought it was a way to get in the door. From day one, we were told by Trainers and Managers that if we came to work, did a good job, and worked safe, we would more than likely make permanent. Many of us rode this roller coaster for the full nine months and then were laid off. Towards the end, the company made it clear they were going to keep the department we worked in as a revolving door of limited service employees. It's really ashame because we took the job seriously and put more pride in our work than the permanent employees did. I don't recommend this position to anyone unless you need the money and you continue to look for work elsewhere."
good,"enjoyed my job and working with coworkers, there to help people with life situations but when one of their own have crisis to quick to throw them to the curb"
good,"Dupont has been restructuring their company for the past 10 to 12 years and at the same time laying off many/most of their experienced work force and rehiring younger employees into jobs that could have been filled by those asked to retire or those laid off.  However, they have been rehiring their older work force into temporary positions through contract firms and pay very good contract rates for accountants.  Unfortunately, in my personal experience, DuPont did little to help me develop my skills in the market and tended to put people into positions that they needed filled due to restructuring.  Today, DuPont is a VERY different company than in the past with many new employees and programs.  They seem to be trying to improve their environment for new hires, but unfortunately, my experience with the accounting group as a contractor is not good.  Mangers are very dismissive, unconnected to their teams of contractors --- contractors are hired for specific tasks and don't really feel part of a team.  Contractors are sometimes let go overnight without any reasons provided.  Contractors are not invited to most company events."
good,The company cares more about the shareholders than the employees. Morale was not great when the new CEO stepped in. My immediate management in the Crop Protection Business was fantastic.
good,"autonomia en la parte laboral, mucho trabajo administrativo poco estrategico."
good,"The pay and benefits were very good. Forced overtime so dont ever make plans. Can get forced over, in early and on your days off without notice. The culture there is cut throat, with the exception of a few honest employees. Will never advance unless you have seniority because it's a union run facility. If you want money go for it. If you have a family, stay away!!"
good,Good place to work. assignments arent too stressful. Management very biased. Fellow operators really biased but not as bad as management to get along with. Pay is good and benefits pretty good also.
good,I liked the drive to and from work. Work hours were flexible as long as you were able to get  your 40 hours in a week. Enjoyed my coworkers and product owners.
good,"DuPont, as a company, pays very well and has good benefits. But the Fort Madison location has very poor upper management. Upper management and corporate does not care about the people; it cares about making as much money as possible with as few employees as possible. I feel like I am ""just a number"". My direct supervisors; however, are wonderful and have the same struggles with upper management as the wage roll team does. The stress of training new employees is overwhelming, especially since you have no choice as to who management hires. Management has little to no awareness of how production truly operates, and they could not care less that morale is at an all time low. If you can deal with 12 hour swing shifts, poor work life balance and terrible upper management then you would be compensated well."
good,Lost my sense of taste while working there and found that painters syndrome is a real thing. Exposure to solvents and toluene can mess with you after a while. Lots of safety in place to mitigate but there is also a lot of smoke and mirrors. Management team has long since changed guard so I cannot comment on present day.
good,"Dupont is nice place to work with good work life balance and this is mainly due to robust and hardworking transport department."
good,"Client oriented business models with clean and safe work environments; however, the Ag division has started to focus more on numbers generation than innovation. Preferred hires outside the group instead of promoting those already within DuPont Pioneer."
good,"There are a lot of changes going on with the merger.  There is a huge culture of uncertainty that has permeated every aspect of employment.  There are tons of politics to deal with that don't improve the culture."
good,"The mission of the company is good  -- to provide improved food nutritional ingredients to hopefully enhance your health.  There are multiple locations, sub-businesses, and product lines -- lots to learn and some really good people to meet.  A"
good,was nice pay but not what i wanted to do forever. i cleaned all offices and bathrooms in a timely manner. same thing everyday. it got really boring really fast.
good,"Good Opportunities. In L&D, India we need more technological advancements.Work culture is excelelnt with everyone strictly following the 4 fantastic core values."
good,"Experience here really depends on department and manager, extremely variable. Changes mean lack of job security and constant personnel changes. Company very cheap, employee perks are minimal."
good,"The company as a whole is amazing and the pay is competitive. If you don't mind being micromanaged at every corner."
good,Did not encourage advancement. Customer support did not encourage working remotely.  Management lacked transparency and morale was low.  Benefits including PTO was fair.
good,"Balanced working environment, People are good, Management needs to be improved, The company policy is not equal for everyone. The salary structure for every one is not equal. The people."
good,"Management is difficult to work with at times. there needs to be a lot of things reconsidered for the type of job that we do. It seems that we are never prepared for any of our season responsibilities and when it comes time to get things done, it all falls on you. there is poor communication skills and not a lot of meshing between departments."
good,"Company was awesome when I first started, opportunity for growth, learning new cutting edge practices, great people.  During the past couple of years work life balance started declining, pressure from upcoming merger left things uncertain."
good,"Career advancement/change is hard to come by unless you transfer to a completely different department or leave the company altogether. Bureaucracy tends to bog things down in all areas. Life/work balance is touted while workloads increase and resources are reduced, restricted, or eliminated. Morale is low, fear of layoffs reigns, and the company seems to have lost sight of its greatest strength: its talented and dedicated work force. Positives: Pay is excellent, benefits are still quite good despite changes over the years, corporate campus is beautiful, and people are friendly and kind."
good,The job is great with various job duties and changes with the seasons. I have learned a lot of new skills and appreciate the opportunity but unfortunately it has been ruined my upper managements inability to follow procedures or treat all employees equal. They have favorites and have bent the rules for those individuals which has led to really low moral amongst everyone else. This has caused several of us to seek work elsewhere.
good,"DuPont takes pride in their company having a safety culture, but it is all talk and no execution.  The focus is strictly on hard hat safety and they have no concept of process safety.  Failures of equipment that should be lasting 10-15 years are acceptable at a 2-3 year rate, potential killing someone when a pipe spool piece blows out in the middle of the unit.  "
good,"DuPont is a reputable company.  While I enjoy working here I do think the some of the systems they use are outdated.  The culture here is very laid back yet close knitted. People are friendly and welcoming.  "
good,"-People are great and it is a fun work environment "
good,Great resources with great talents. Large company with great compensation. A small wood forest around the work location was nice.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo, solo que el trabajo es eventual y actualmente estoy en busca de un empleo estable"
good,"I have been at DuPont for almost 4 years and, although I've learned a lot and appreciated all the moral support I've received from co-workers, there is ultimately very little progression in terms of pursuing a higher career. I have outperformed ~80% of my peers; yet, I am one of the lowest paid employees in my department due to my efficiency and lack of need for overtime, and have not been promoted despite being the technician lead for two successful critical pipeline projects. It's a great first job, but it's time to move on."
good,"The benefits are probably the worst that I have had in my work experience. Very flexible and a fun place to work. there is nothing wrong with the company, except we need better health care beneifits. I have learned so much about the Bio Tech industry while working here."
good,"With a continued focus on shareholder profits, DuPont is a very unstable work environment with continued downsizing and selling of businesses."
good,"I hired into DuPont full-time in 2012 after a summer internship in 2011. I worked in a high hazard chemical process which manufactured TiO2. The subject matter that I was working on was very interesting to me (process development, process improvement, etc) but the turnaround time was very slow. The safety and MOC systems that are in place are very well put together, but can be poorly executed. I believe because the work streams are so slow to get results, and because so many people have to be involved in each decision, execution on projects is slowed down and recognition/promotion is also slowed down. It's company norm to wait 3+ years between promotions, even if you are a candidate who is exceeding expectations consistently. The people I worked with were great, a lot of talent, but that also made standing out harder. The plant I was working at got shut down due to business constraints, so in hind-sight the position was not very stable."
good,"Met a lot friendly people, they would just come up to you say who they were. I didn't like the manager, he was always in my department and made me nervous every time he showed up."
good,"People are nice; however, management seems to be largely incompetent. "
good,There are so many great people that work at DuPont but the company does little to maintain its core values and reputation that is synonymous with the name DuPont.  They have poor management systems and do very little to integrate the ever-changing fleets of businesses that make up DuPont.  There are lots of different types of jobs in the company but the culture and poor management will stop you from truly being the best when compared to peers at other companies.
good,"- Good work life balance"
good,"Dei esta avaliação, pois se trata de uma empresa de grande potencial, mas é preciso de uma Administração que foque em todos os parâmetros. Não adianta trabalhar apenas em cima de produção e não trabalhar as condições dos colaboradores..."
good,"If you are looking for a company with many locations and many products to expand your knowledge of chemicals, this may very well be the company for you. As a larger company, it has some benefits that you cannot find as readily with smaller companies. For example, it has a relocation program that will help prevent you from being stuck with a home that doesn't sell."
good,"Pros"
good,"Good place too work but lower management isnt very good. Over time is always available, the pay is okay once your able to advance. Some employees are unpleasant too work with"
good,"A good place to work..flex time, good people, etc. I gotta say though, there are some people been there since the company started and they act as they own DuPont"
good,"Once a great company! After our merge with Dow and the rumored removal of the N&H assets from Dupont, I'm not sure there'll be much left. New fictionalized movie ""Dark Waters"" will certainly not help."
good,"desarrollas la habilidad de vender, conversar con personas."
good,"A typical day at work is to walk in put all personal items in a locker."
good,"DuPont has been a good company to work for. In recent years, it has become a constant state of change, between changing IT systems, vendors, etc. to mergers and acquisition activities, this is a complex, fast paced environment to work in."
good,Good place to work only worked with Contractor for Dupont not Dupont. Did not get opportunity to become employee for Dupont at that time. Applying now for positions.
good,"Contractors treated much differently than ""Duponters"" - very hard to be brought on to the DuPont staff. Many people worked very hard to move up but the actual position within the company was near impossible to attain if you weren't hired on as a DuPont employee."
good,"A decent place to work, The most fun part of the job was they had drawings to use for troubleshooting, The people were good. There was a lot things to learn."
good,Good summer job. I don't think this is under the right company though. I worked for DowDupont/Pioneer and it recently spun off as Corteva agriscience. I don't know about Dupont itself.
good,Consistent workplace. Work was steady. Coworkers were great to work with. Opportunity for overtime was available. Work hours were appropriate for family.
good,"The site was a ""24/7"" facility.  Shift work (12 hours) was something I had not done before, but the pay was nice.  What I miss most is the people.  It was satisfying to be part of a team working towards a common goal.  Of the four plant managers I had experience with, only one was a good manager."
good,Many meetings throughout the day. Hard to keep focused on completing tasks or projects with additional work assigned almost hourly.  Operations management was very good.
good,"People were professional, managers sometime gave employee opportunity to development themselves. The company facility were good and was very close to home."
good,"I got to work with great people and would have continued to work there if it wasn't for the opportunity I got from the Air Force. The work schedule, at least to me, was ideal and they treated me well."
good,I don't feel that I was at this place of employment long enough to give an opinion to rate.  The only reason why I left was due to another job offer that had better wages and benefits.
good,Worked for a contractor company for a turnaround or shutdown therefore I cannot comment on the true or full conditions of the workplace and environment
good,Work Life Balance may be tough.  Worked 70+ hrs/week for 10mos as we worked to stabilize management team.  Good company but tough hours to meet goal commitment.
good,"No Longer a company "
good,"Environnement familial, collaborateurs sérieux."
good,"interesting culture. science and engineering backgrounds preferred.  otherwise, not considered as valued as those with above-mentioned backgrounds.  great benefits."
good,"I enjoyed the work I did and my team was very easy to get a long with. But the management at the time was not the best, and they did not work to cultivate employees. Swing shifts made it rough for family life."
good,"My current position is at a crop research center that includes breeding and research programs in corn, sorghum, and cotton.  The work is mostly outdoors and has busier times of the year during the spring, summer, and fall."
good,"Technically, I was contracted to work for DuPont from a third party. I enjoyed the environment at the experimental lab in Wilmington. The people I worked with were great. I appreciated their culture of safety."
good,"Many hours of non-paid overtime.    A typical day was 12 hours.  Worked with many different outside organizations, including the U.S. Government, large customers, and worked with very knowledgeable customer service reps who were dedicated.  Hardest part of the job was managing the huge amount of work with the least amount of overtime.  Prioritization and planning were crucial in order to succeed.  Most enjoyable part was developing relationships with customers and co-workers."
good,"I worked for DuPont right out of college 36 years ago. I moved 3 times in 5 years. I was in sales and traveled a lot. It was a good learning experience, but offered very little career growth opportunities. I was also unhappy living away from Atlanta in Chicago."
good,"There were several greenhouses in Hayward, CA. It's hard work. You're exposed to pesticides working in the greenhouses. Interesting though, and nice if you like working with plants."
good,No Promotion Opportunities. Very Friendly work environment. Not technically Challenging. Enjoyed going to work. Very Light work Schedule. Little supervision. Lot's of free time. Phone support. Mostly Farmers.
good,"I was directly under the Safety manager and she was a micro-manager despite not having one ounce of training or experience in my line of work. I encountered resistance at every turn and when I discussed my issues with HR, nothing was done to help remedy the situation."
good,Alto padrão em termos de dinâmica que desafia o colaborador a todo momento em querer melhorar cada vez mais
good,Worked with a bunch of great people that I am still in touch with 22 years later.  It was a demanding job and fun while it lasted.  Unfortunately they had to downsize and centralize our off in their main headquarters.
good,"Decent place to work, but has a lot of hurry up and wait. Management can be on your back about everything at times when there’s nothing you can do to help fix the issues."
good,"My experience will not be yours, as DuPont probably will be very different as a company once it is spun out of DowDuPont. More of a focus on the businesses, less on Wilmington."
good,Long work days. Site leader does not believe in lean principles or kiazens.  The site leader does not believe in open communication with production team or with leadership team.
good,"Productive, safe, clean environment with flexible breaks, and many overtime hours available.I work alone most of the time but my co-workers are very helpful when needed and they always offer positive feedback. I have learned to work very safely, efficiently and I have also learned to work very well as a team."
good,ive been with this company for 7 years and now I am getting laid off for the second time. great for morale when places threaten to close all the time.
good,"Worked as a summer intern.  It was a longtime ago, and lots have changed.  It was a good company to work at then,  understand they have had hard times."
good,"Preformed daily routine, procurement of materials, permits, meetings on the daily project assignments, and worked as liaison between construction and engineering. Dupont was a very good company to work for on this project. As always the safety culture was excellent with very few incidents or accidents for the project."
good,It was ok even though it was years ago. The operators were good to work with. The benefits were decent. The pay was comparible to nearby plants. Cost of living raise once per year
good,"It is fast paced especially since you are working in a field. Work starting at 6 am. Have daily meetings before shift starts. Managers can get lazy and if you have a complaint, they will not try to fix the problem. You work outside all day so you are exposed to extreme heat and very cold mornings. The research part takes about three months ."
good,Working at DuPont gave me alot of skills that i can use in other jobs and in all expects of my life. It is very hard work but worth it to gain the skills
good,The company was flexible providing for great quality of  life. People were passionate. The company took safety seriously. I would recommend DuPont to a friend.
good,"This was temporary work for me in a production setting. The job was very fast paced, but not at all difficult to perform. the setting was very clean and the people very friendly."
good,"DuPont use to be quite good at technology.  They feel onto bad business times and changed their portfolio.  Today, they are owned by Dow.  Hopefully the future is better."
good,"The Company is undergoing major changes with the recently completed merger and split into three separate entities."
good,The position is in a very fast paced environment. Many opportunities for training and updates with system requirements.  A pleasant place to work and very flexible.
good,"With all of the downsizings, people at DuPont no longer matter. The bottom line is paramount. Atmosphere has been toxic for last three to four years and won;r get better even after merger with DOW. More uncertainty looms."
good,Work was unsupervised and fast past. I learned time management . The work place was diverse. I enjoyed my job because there wasn't anything i couldn't complete.
good,This particular Surgery Center was sold to another entity. It no longer functions under the dated management known as Healthsouth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,Good place to learn lot of concepts. Good place to bring in lot of new tools for implementation. Can extend learning and can work on new platform. Very established company
good,The new division did not have very good scope and hired a bad manager of the division. They promised to much and never followed through on those promises.
good,Ran from a small town so if you weren't part of the good old boys you might get run over by a buss. There was no promotions from within my location all new job postings were hired from outside source which made for terrible management.
good,". Enjoyed being out on the front line directly involved with customer decisions. Tough to perform at times due to market trends. Overall good management, co-workers and culture"
good,"opportunities         projects             diverse             culture"

good,"Accueil et ambiance de travail agréable, pas de barrières cadre/ETAM."
good,"This was a great place to work for when i was younger. I don't think this would be a career job, although it will give you some work experience."
good,"I have learned a lot about seed production while working at Pioneer. There are many knowledgeable employees who are willing to answer questions regarding the industry.  Many co-workers are hard working and driven.  "
good,Started as a helper and worked my way to crew supervisor in 6 years and was only 22 years old. Responsible for 25 man crew that had to be shown what jobs they would work on each day. I had to order and get to jobsight all materials needed to keep everyone productive and able to meet production goals safely. Took care of payroll and read blueprints.
good,"Good variety of positions to work in.  Some loyal employees there.  Good salary, but bad on promotions.  Many layoffs lately."
good,"my opinion of them doesn't matter. Moral has been low for years and they rate it high, showing a disconnect. I love it its great. coworkers are the best part."
good,"It is a good company to work for.  It is generally easy to balance work and life, because your management usually gives you flexibility to work from home when necessary."
good,Overall the atmosphere is relaxed not too stressful.  The company is extremely large and diverse.  Many opportunities to travel both domestic and globally.  There is some turmoil due to expected changes in the company and new CEO.
good,Provided a wide-range of IT initiatives and environments to lead and collaborate upon with multiple business customers and multiple IT resourses.
good,"Report to work early, and get pre-paired for your shift.  Perform shift turn over at the start and end of shift. perform lock out-tag out when needed to. Assist mechanics in repairing problems, and help change valves and pumps when needed. Communicate with upper level management on day-to-day operation's of the area, and report any down time and problems that may arise."
good,"I was a research technician.  It wasn't horrible work by any means, but you repeat the same process over and over again, and you are given no freedom to think on your own."
good,"Was introduced to a lot of new systems. Learned various new techniques on bettering myself in the work area. Gained a lot of Strategic Planning techniques. Typical day was insuring the proper shipping materials were sent out daily, and communicating to various carriers on scheduling orders, and pick ups."
good,"Focused on Core Values."
good,"Segmento N&H possui bom clima organizacional, auxiliando nos processos cross funcionais da empresa."
good,Five days work and three shifts working schedule and management staffs are friendly and helpful to others. I do team leading at present and my colleagues are well experienced and good team players.
good,Het is een mooi bedrijf leuke collega allen de communicatie is heel slecht
good,"At Du Pont Pioneer the task vary seasonally. "
good,Dupont is a great organization to work for. There are a lot of opportunities across the globe.
good,I really enjoyed working for DuPont.  I figured I would retire until we were sold by DuPont and became Invista.
good,"(1) Typical day - When need to process the very complex payment from the customer consisting of more than 17,000 invoices in 1 payment."
good,an easy way for kids to make money during the summer. Early mornings but I was able to gain a lot of leadership qualities
good,"Good benefits, good company to work for, got laid off when they made cuts in the ag divison"
good,"people were friendly and work as a team. Pay was good."
good,"DuPont provided me with the knowledge to safely apply commercial and experimental pesticides to various crops using statistical design methodology. Management was very hands-off and I was able to have a lot of freedom to operate in my territory. Co-workers were pleasant and profession, and guided me in research and sales. The hardest part of the job, at times in the summer, were the long hours. However, I enjoyed working for the company and gained invaluable knowledge."
good,The techniques and procedures of how to manufacture fibers to create a synthetic component was a unique and education experience.
good,"A typical day would start off with a group meeting, discussing any issues from the previous day and any safety issues that need to be addressed. Each cell in the factory has a manger that had a team of seven people who worked under them that they managed. The co workers all worked together to get the daily task done. The hardest part about my job is not receiving my proper breaks throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing all of my assigned work in a timely matter."
good,During my employment with DuPont Canada I enjoyed everyday of being in the office and working with others as we became friends over the time and we were sharing our stories all the time and having lunch together with our team members. I learned so many things about farms and farmers by speaking with them over the phone everyday and also learned more about our manufactured pesticides. What I really liked about my job was the challenges that I had to go through to find answers for the farmers. My job was very enjoyable and I did not have any difficulty in doing it.
good,Positivo per esperienza iniziale in organizzazione strutturata
good,"A typical work day consists of entering data from testing results, ordering supplies, investigations and miscellaneous daily functions as needed."
good,"Typical accounting environment. Pretty strick rules. 30 minute lunch breaks, 2 15 minute breaks, and very strick dress code."
good,"As an employee I first value that very word! I put my job at the top of the list of things that matter and are important.I worked at Dupont for a total of 22 years and worked in several areas there.I learned very early to be a team player that provides a great work environment and produces to excellent material that was being processed in that specific area.I valued my co-workers and especially their time and dedication that we as a team put into such a giving company as Dupont.A typical day at work was delightful in the fact that we were working on the same given task that was to provide an excellent product with the Dupont name attached.The hardest part of my job at Dupont has to be working shiftwork.Eventhough,I did it for a number of years that has to be the most difficult part of the job.There were perks to each shift but sleep deprivation has to adjusted on shift work.My management at Dupont has to be one of the best things at Dupont.They are very ""hands-on helpful and always available to be contacted if needed.The most enjoyable part of the job at Dupont has to be the that I was part of family that is world wide known that carries through generations past and present and future!"
good,"DuPont has been a good place to work over the years.  However, the company is being split into smaller pieces and this impacts the employees through layoffs,  role changes and, in some cases, pay freezes."
good,Good company to work for and for the last 5 years it has been called  Axalta Coating Systems. Worked there for 11 years now and feel its about time for a change.
good,"Job advancement is not always done fairly not everyone is treated fairly."
good,"I actually enjoyed my time at Dupont, at the site I worked at it was like working for a small biotech and had a family feel.  However the parent company was not very supportive of the exceptional work done there.  Promotions usually took 10 years to get (and that was just in the same job title).  Job recognition was very low on the list, it felt like our contributions to the pipeline were always overlooked."
good,"A job should be fulfilling to work at.The job is laid out so you understand the goals you need do. Able to work not supervised, every one respects each other,drive time learning new tests."
good,"Poor management. Batch process so lots of startup and shutdown of unit. I learned a lot from my unit trainers,Made sure I understood completely of my responsibilities. The best part was the pay rate per hour! The overall rating is a good place to work if you take your time, work safely and do not rush!"
good,Very good company and environment.  Many opportunities to be had if you seek them out.  Good benefits and vacation time.  A lot of interesting research and very intelligence people here.
good,"Los días pueden ser a muy agitados o muy calmados, es variable. El trabajo fuera de la oficina sucede todos los dias , incluyendo fines de semana."
good,Very fast paced and competitive environment. Decent Management. working with heavy equipment like hyper compressors is difficult. Technical aspects are fun!
good,"Long days outside in the heat and sun, but good pay and fun colleagues. The hours depended on what fields were ready and when. They are a company that follows laws and standards closely."
good,"Good work place with Job security and benefits "
good,"A relaxed work place environment, with little to no micro management, which is a plus in today's society. Also, have the ability to work with many different facets of the organization"
good,"Jobs are being outsourced to offshore contractors.  Unfortunately, not a lot of job security here any longer."
good,Good place to work if you don't mind being outdoors. Walking through corn on the hot days of summer can get a little agitating when the leaves are cutting your skin and poking your eyes.
good,"My Manager was good to work for.  He could relate to any situation that may come up and have good advice if I needed it.  You always knew where you stood with him. There wasn't any backstabbing."
good,Offers many challenges and great experience for one's career. There is always something new to engage with and learn a lot.
good,"A once great company ruined by bad management, lack of investment  and shareholder greed. It is a shame that this historic proud company will soon no longer exist."
good,"Chances to advance career"
good,Not the company I started with almost 15 years ago.  Downsizing and layoffs.  The people you work with are great.  Lots of uncertainty with pending merger and spinoff's.
good,"1-h30 de route environ avec payage."
good,"awesome work experience, great benefits I just wish that they had more job positions open. supervisory team was awesome also the co workers were awesome."
good,Extremely busy group.  Attention to detail a must.  Patent applications filed in the US and outside the US.  Docketing of patent applications progress done in a web-based system.
good,DuPont is repositioning itself as a Life Science company from a traditional chemical company. Great place to work in terms of scientific and engineering culture. People at DuPont are great to work with.
good,"Company constantly restructuring teams while still expecting them to get a lot of work done."
good,I have no work life balance. 60 plus hours a week. calls at night. priorities change frequently with added duties good place to work if you don't care about work life balance looking for hourly work from salary
good,"bons administradores, boa comunicação com todos os colegas de trabalha, ambientes agradável, bons eguipamentos etc..."
good,"Great management and overall a welcoming atmosphere at the workplace. Employees genuinely care about each other, and I have the utmost respect for my seniors due to their humble approach and working together on day-to-day tasks. Management makes a giant effort to ensure a good employee morale."
good,"Como lo comente es bueno el ambiemnte de trabajo, se dan situaciones  normales pero que no afectan el clima laboral se trata con mucho respetos a las personas, esta es una gran escuela sobre todo en le aspecto de seguridad y de proceso se capacita con cierta frecuencia, es bastante extrecha la relacion con los directivos y la gerencia."
good,"Unloading hazardous chemicals from tanker trucks                                  Learned about haz-mat operation which included wearing PPE properly.                                                                                        Really didn't get to interact much with management per se,but the co-workers i received my instructions from each day really had it together,very informative.                                                                  The job was outdoors so the only hard part of the job was working out in the cold.                                                                                     The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the job itself."
good,Good job. Work is very demanding at times. There is a lack of communication which causes a lot of extra work. Some very good workers with a lot of knowledge. The hardest part is being in an acid suit for several hours without a break.
good,"lo que aprendi es igualar varios colores y  decodificarlos"
good,DuPont offered lots of opportunity for various job assignments.  The site encouraged movement to different positions to develop experience in employees.  The only negative was that some positions were offered based on personal connections and not job performance.
good,"Lots of opportunity to grow. Job assignments can be challenging, fun, and rewarding. Mangement lacks in mentorship program. Can be put in assignments without the right resources or guidance."
good,"por parte del trabajo es bueno, lo que aprendi en dupont fue todo a serca del mantenimiento y montacarguista y lo de seguridad en cuestion de la gerensia es buena pero en cuestion del ambiente de trabajo es muy desgastante la parte mas dificill del trabajo es que se manejan insectisidads y funguisidas es muy peligroso, loque mas me gusto es que aprendes adesarrollarte como persona."
good,"Took on job in Grand Rapids. Shipping office in the rear is nothing but drama, drama, drama. Everybody there basically grew up with eachother and are all from same general area. So if you are an outsider coming in prepare your self for the gossip. Mainly from the temporary employees. The first shift girl in shipping and receiving is the worst. She is a temp that is back for her 4th season. She will make your life miserable if you work with her. If you get hired in as fork lift, there second shift shift lead isn't much better. He's rude. Refuses to work as team, and doesn't follow the rules set by the company. Which as a temp person is conflicting coming in. The atmosphere up front is much better. No drama, easy people to work with, and proper training."
good,It was an entry-level position in a warehouse setting.  The schedule rotated with 12 hour shifts being the norm. It was a good starting point to transition into the polymer industry.
good,"outstanding attendance"
good,ok job.  Ex Military hired full time only. Good for improving and/or training for better positions. I really liked how involved they kept all employees. Not a bad gig id have to say!
good,This was a great place to work thanks to the people I worked with.  I only left due to a poor manager that did not allow me to manage my staff and would direct me to do one thing and direct my staff to do the exact opposite creating an unstable department.
good,A empresa oferece bons benefícios e grande aprendizado.
good,"•	Manage 20+ staff and led 25+ investigations of safety/environmental incidents in Nomex Polymer area. "
good,"Es una muy buena empresa para empezar a trabajar como ingeniero,sin embargo existen departamentos mal dirigidos e impiden el crecimiento profesionnal de sus trabajadores."
good,Lopende band werk. Elastische garens op klossen nakijken en in dozen verpakken en op de lopende band zetten. Ben hiermee gestopt omdat ik geen hele dagen meer kon staan.
good,"The Pioneer side of DuPont Pioneer is great. The coworkers are mostly all friendly, the lower level management means well even if their hands are tied in most cases, and the workflow is nothing too strenuous. The downside is DuPont's current business model of getting rid of non-essential employees and it's move towards contract employment for non-managerial staff. What I learned from Dupont Pioneer is that the current job market is more volatile than I thought. The hardest part of the job was working through maintenance weekends and making sure everything that broke during the maintenance windows got fixed. It was fast-paced but it  wasn't too much to handle. The part of my job at DuPont Pioneer I enjoyed the most was working with the hardware in the server room and working with the more command-line/IBM Mainframe software."
good,"Great chemical company that supports core values of safety, environmental stewardship, respect for people, and high ethics.  DuPont is also committed to flexible work schedules to help employees balance work and family life."
good,Favoritism at its finest from management. If you aren't related to someone or been their friend for years you will never move up. They are stuck in their ways and unwilling to evolve with technology.
good,"Good place to work and you can learn a lot."
good,This is good company to work for if you have a lot of time. Pays very well. The machinist there are very experienced and do not mind training. Very good moral.
good,Ιδανικό εργασιακό περιβάλλον έως το 2015. Αποτέλεσε μεγάλο σχολείο όμως υπό την νέα διεύθυνση κινείται πλέον σε αχαρτογράφητα νερα.
good,"good pay and benefits, casual and flexible workflow"
good,"Great place to work.  Good pay and benefits - GREAT 401K."
good,"Typical work day would be started by working on building automation, checking important areas, and areas that are normally inhabited by research personal and lab workers, and PHD's."
good,"Company well managed, best part of working there  - DuPont people, very good company culture. Company also cares very much about employee safety - i did not see that as much in other places i've worked. One negative - company is constantly cutting on expenses/costs, makes it difficult sometimes to do the job that needs to be done. Overall, great place to work."
good,"The hospital expanded, but has had difficulty filling beds. Generally, it is a hospital going through growing pains, but is steadily trying to work out the kinks and get its reputation back on track."
good,"Co-workers are great, but some level floor workers are lazy."
good,"Liberté d'organisation, peu de développement car peu présent en France, management opportuniste, pas de vision sur l'avenir, variété des tâches."
good,"Veel Klante Adquisitie gedaan"
good,"Veel klantencontact internationaal"
good,"The pay is pretty decent and the work is easy, very little hard labor, but management needs a lot of fine tuning."
good,"was the time of my life in many ways."
good,"Great compensation for the work you do."
good,Nice place to work and learn about team bonding and corporate culture. We would get rewarded for our hard work which was the best part about working as a procurement analyst in this company. Great place for people with no experience to start.
good,"Polyvalence des taches agréable"
good,"While working for DuPont Pioneer as a general labourer, I will admit it was tough at some points with the hot summer weather we experienced, although it was great on a cool summers day.  Everyone at this workplace was very helpful and encouraging.  I enjoyed working in partners and groups to complete tasks, putting our ideas together to ensure the most effective and efficient plan for the particular job.  The hardest part of this job was when working individually, I had to really think about what was the best route to go down in order for this job to be a success on my end.  Making mistakes and learning from them was the way to learn at this job, along with increasing your pace while still ensuring the job looked professionally completed.  A bonus was how caring my manager was, and the great snacks she would always provide us!"
good,I have learned many things at DuPont. The most important thing is how to properly use SAP. I have an extensive knowledge of SAP and would be more than willing to advance that should a job opportunity request such.
good,"Steady job with career movement potential.   However, lots of red tape to get projects done and pay was lower than comparable companies in the area."
good,I started at this location with high hopes. Where I had come from had higher technology but different set of purposes. I am impressed with the management in handling personnel issues. The corporation as an entity is very warm and comforting but I am used to more rigid rules and adherence to rules. There is much room to grow in the company. They have plans in many different directions and are understanding how they can achieve them. The hardest part of the day is repeating issues. Some just don't seem to get resolved completely so we end up facing the same issues again.
good,I worked as a corn pollinator in high school. It was a good part time job for a small agricultural town. The pay and hours were good for a high school student in the summer.
good,"travail intéressant, stressant, agréable et enrichissant"
good,Flexible place to work with a diversity of people.  Pioneer is very supportive of work and life balance.  They have a great benefits.  There is a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"•	Supported field sales in identifying product availability, product delivery and fulfilling product requests while providing superior, timely customer service."
good,"detassel/derouge cornfields, and supervise/teach new workers. Hard work but did not mind it. Best managment out of all my jobs. Also learned a lot about agriculture."
good,Everyone I have encountered at DuPont has been amazing and very helpful.  The new CEO is lowering morale in the company by laying people off and job security is no longer a perk of this position.
good,"A twelve hour a day job. Can be very fast pace."
good,"Interesting and important work"
good,"too much churn with the merger with DOW. people are flying under the radar.. lack of emplowerment, and too much politics to get the job done. good people, though"
good,"Great environment, great people, sometimes stressful however fun and great management."
good,Good place to work.  Good benefits and great flexibility.  The leaders really care about their employees.
good,High possibility for advancement. Structured work place.
good,Good place to work physically challenging.. Room for advancement and the people are great.
good,Awesome job I love it I am always looking to advance tho and not much room here to advance in the job here  for example  there are only so many trucks and drivers that everyone pretty much has the same job everyday
good,"DuPont continues to attract external applicants because of their household name. The company hires managers and leaders who do not connect with their employees. I worked in the Shared Service Center, where managers are clickish, insensitive and not in tune with employees."
good,A typical workday is not getting to do what my job duties are I am constantly being pulled from my duties because they are either short handed or non qualified staff.
good,"Would not recommend working in QC Lab. A lot of division among workers caused by irrational decisions made by current manager. Management does not believe in utilizing its workers and or making them feel valuable. If you're someone who loves to learn and loves being hands on going above and beyond, do not work here. Your role here will be very limited. This place is behind. However, I would recommend this as a good starting position for interns and or current high school students."
good,"DowDuPont, specifically Corteva Agriscience the Agricultural Division of DowDuPont is trying to market itself as a new company.  This is leaving employees behind and creating a culture of concern, unknown, and uncertainty.  Taking 22,000 employees into a new era of the combined company is something management is not doing well."
good,Coworkers enjoyed drama way to much. The work was fine though. There was no opportunity for advancement. There would be alot of down time which made the day go by extremely slow.
good,livrer les repas personne agèes 
good,"We would start the day with a start of shift meeting so that everyone knew what they were responsible for throughout the day.  A lot of time more work was added on throughout the day by management.  It was a work at your own pace environment.  "
good,Company undergoing major overhaul.  Major cutbacks in all areas.  Benefits package being severely reduced and raises have been stopped.  Was a great place to work 10 years ago...
good,worked there for about 4.5 years very good with sap. still no signs of being hired on. i have heard of people there 12 to 20 years be four being hired on full time.
good,"Everyone is friendly and helpful.  Great place, if you don't mind shift work.  Management very friendly. Job can get boring at times."
good,"One man office, assisted VP of Sales, and assisted 3 other managers off-site.This was a temporary position, filling in for the administrative assistant going out on medical leave for three months.  Three months turned into two years."
good,"Many changes in company and not the same as it was at one time.  No job security.  Difficult environment especially for 'support' departments. Very smart, hard working people however."
good,"Laborious."
good,Dupont was a good company overall for benefits but not concerned with employees' future. I did enjoy working with our customers and had some nice coworkers.
good,have the swing shift. 12 hours and it swing shift. I actually work as a contradotor . we don get the benefit of the people that actually work for DuPont!
good,"I worked 7 days a week for Pioneer. I enjoyed the pay and being on my own in the workplace. I learned a lot on responsibility and safety on the job. I worked with one other guy during the day and after hours, but the few managers I did see were friendly. The hardest part about the job was not the actual work, but the amount of hours with no break. I enjoyed the freedom and the trust the company put in me, but was not given an opportunity to advance and was let go after the season ended without forewarning."
good,I worked housekeeping under GCA services it was a great experience and I learn a lot  Great coworkers and job environment.  I left because there was not opportunity for growth.
good,"Pick up work from boss and proceed to either look through microscopes for signs and reasons for failure in material."
good,When I started I enjoyed my job but some members of management changed and so did the entire culture/environment.  Things have went downhill quickly and certain members of management seem to always have their blinders on while others like to micromanage.
good,"Rotating schedule, one weekend off per month.  Lots of overtime.  Can force you to stay over for 8 more hours, 16 hour work days.  Old equipment.  Management is clueless."
good,Really good first job the pay was decent for a 13 year old kid It was a summer job. It wasnt super hard but it wasnt always easy. It was very hot sometimes.
good,Great company and wonderful people. There are great projects and excellent mentors. Started out of college and have been promoted many times within various businesses.
good,"You're either outside all day in a field or inside doing inventory/packaging. "
good,"nada nuevo que aprender"
good,"On a typical day I was involved with employee training records. I maintained the training records and interacted with the employees in an effort to keep employees current with training requirements."
good,"Great people to work with in a very tough environment. Due to demand of product or lack thereof at times this was a very, up and down"" place to work. The workplace culture did invite advancement, creativity, and equality, this was a plus. Lets make no bones about this, this is a food production facility and the hours are tough and the environment dirty and hot."
good,"I made a very good living working for this company, but 7 day straight rotating shifts catch up to you.  They have a very strict A & T policy and no sick days (you must be hospital ill or take the points.)  Every man for himself."
good,"My role includes the processing of customer orders, internal stock transfers, and review availability of materials for both.  I am constantly communicating with, supply chain management, external customers, internal customers, and sales management regarding their needs and out ability to fulfill their expectations. I also review processes against continuous improvement goals and account manager expectations."
good,DuPont is a good company you work for. All depend on who is your manager and what project you work on.
good,Temp to hire; rotating shifts; co-workers were hard workers
good,"Very fast pace, always lots to do, Very good with sap, i've been a contractor for DuPont for almost 9 years and still know sign of ever being hired on.."
good,"Good place to work. Work at your own pace, there is no micromanagement. Able to work at home if the need arise."
good,"Compensation is pretty decent, but management is terrible and there is little to no career development. There is flexibility in works schedules and lots of volunteer opportunities available."
good,"A company with a lot of history with some hard to change attitudes and bureaucratic processes, nonetheless with high standards in science and R&D.   Like all S&P500 and DOW index companies, top management cares more about the stockholders and top leader bonuses than about their own employees, even if employees remuneration is decent (in accordance to standards)."
good,"This was a dream job if you can handle 12 hour swing shifts! The 401k was excellent and the money was awesome, that is until we were merging with DOW and DuPont decided to close our facility and keep the Union unproductive plant open. They did however give us ample notice and many tools to assist us on finding a new job which I am thankful for."
good,La empresa paga bien pero el trabajo es de paso no hay planta disponible ningún momento
good,DuPont was a great place to work.  The future of research is very unclear because of cost cutting and pending merger with Dow.
good,Les collaborateurs sont souvent des personnes très disponibles. Ouvertes à trouver des solutions.
good,"I work in the molecular characterization laboratory setting up PCR reactions using various robotic instruments. The laboratory is GLP certified; meaning work is completed under careful conditions to maintain a clean environment, limit contamination and error with significant documentation and procedural execution. I work under the use of SOP documents and methods that meet GLP standards. When necessary I will perform minor robotic repairs as need, and on a regular basis I preform daily maintenance and calibrations. I also know how to prepare and create master mix needed to run these experiments."
good,"Um ambiente de trabalho que se convive ate bem independente dos problemas do dia a dia do serviço, com uma gerencia ótima. E que apesar da dificuldades em execução de algum serviço sempre havia alguém pra instruir e ensinar. Por fim gerava um bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,"A typical day at work was repetitious: inspecting yarn, driving forklift, shipping and receiving loads."
good,DuPont is a good company if you can get in full-time but other than that they treat you like slaves and don't value you or your experience.
good,as soon as you walk in the door safety becomes first on your mined so i make sure i where all of my PPE. on the most part i injoy management an co-works i like talking to them i find that working shift work nites are the hards part of the job and having a job i fill bless.
good,"A typical day is working directly with farmers and prospects for new customers in agriculture.  The hardest part of the job is getting rejections from asking for a sale.  The most enjoyable part is working directly with the farmers, they are honest, genuine people."
good,"no comment for this company. I will not rate them in this manner. it is not my place to judge the company based on my opinions and personal feelings, Thank you"
good,"Ambiente stimolante, flessibile e di crescita professionale. "
good,DuPont was a nice place to work at with room to grow. I only got to work there for a month before i ended up moving. My trainer said i was catching on very fast and i reminded her a lot of the B shift manager when she first started training him.
good,"A great company with lots of opportunities"
good,Not a bad experience. Work associate were kind and willing to help. Mentoring could have been better. Location did suit my needs to be near work. Corporate consultants were available for just about every need.
good,Great place to work. Success is what you made it - definitely benefited from having managers with a vested interest towards my success.  Workplace culture was different at the 3 sites that I was fortunate enough to work at.
good,Needs more diversity manager is not a good listener about home problems coworkers seem not to know laws on harassment great pay. System is outdated and everything breaks down
good,Good work life Balance. Top management is highly capable. Global presence of the company. A very good pay master and the core values of the company is very nice.
good,"This was my second job and it was a good job as a contractor. I've to meet new people and we all worked as a team, no one was left out. It was a good job."
good,"Great people who get it when it comes to marketing and public relations.  they understand and invest in media relations, social media and give the team the ability to do what they need to do."
good,I was a part time worker for DuPont Pioneer. I only went through corn fields and detassled corn so tit could become genetically modified. It was super hot and hard but it didn't require a lot of work.
good,"Supervisors expected a lot but gave ample space to make decisions in my work, always supported and encouraged. Company gave adequate opportunity for training and development."
good,"Well planned and organized day. "
good,"DuPont tiene todas las ventajas e inconvenientes de una gran multinacional. Por un lado todo está perfectamente organizado, procesado y procedimentado. por otro el nivel de burocracia es enorme y las decisiones pueden ser muy lentas."
good,"Good place to work, very good benefits. Health insurance, retirement plan, time off, etc. Work/life balance was good. Steady pace at work, varied between season though."
good,"Best company to back up their commitment to safety first.  Company commited to their core values of Safety, Ethics, Respect and Environmental Stewardship"
good,Worked with doing other jobs. First was in the mail room documenting all the benefits and setting up the prices. The second job was working evening delivering in New Jersey.
good,"Excellent place to work, work environment and work culture is great.."
good,"Dupont yerkes is a good place to work overall. Paid vacation, 401k matching, health care, vision, dental. You're not pushed to work too hard. If you can show up to work on time, work safely and are willing to work 12 hour shifts and swing shift, then you can make over 65k/year. If you want to work some OT (and there is plenty) you can make upwards of 100k or more. No exaggeration. On average, every employee is probably making around 75-80k a year. Good place to work, management needs some work but as of 2018, managment seems to be heading in the right direction."
good,"Better compensation as compared to academia. Good work/Life balance. No job security for past couple of years. Management is average but this cannot be generalized for the whole company. Overall, I enjoyed working at DuPont."
good,"Travail répétitif, bonne ambiance, 3x8, culture de la sécurité importante"
good,"Good place to work, compensation is competitive with the market.  People are outstanding and enjoy what they do.  May not be for those who want to work in a less structured company."
good,a normal day was you get turnover from the person you are relieving for issues to be resolved before you make your rounds and take your readings. If all is well you can finish early and do some CBT's (computer based training) which is half the training you receive. Mostly these CBT's teach you about the way the company is managed and the admin. portion of it all. Which to me the hardest part of the job is the admin. part. And of coarse the most enjoyable part of any job is the end of shift when you can go home safely to your family.
good,"as an interne the job was a great learning experience, I definitely had a great group of guys who went out of there way to make sure that I learned everything a could about the job."
good,"10 jobs in 20 years, so lots of opportunity."
good,I enjoyed working for the company but once the merger was announced in 2015 the environment became stale.  People were being laid off.  Morale was low and the future became uncertain.
good,"Use to be great place to work. Not so much now. Looking for Career Change, DuPont  in process of merger with Dow Chemical. Safe place to work. Has been working conditions. People Oriented. Diverse."
good,"DuPont is in the process of merging with DOW Chemicals and is still trying to figure out where it will be after everything settles.  It was, for the most part, a good company to work for.  Flexible scheduling was definitely a plus when trying to balance work and family."
good,"It's been several years since I worked "
good,This was a fun place to work with interesting projects/tasks.  It's a shame that management has taken a once great company and virtually decimated its global influence and its workforce.  The friends I met there are some of the best I've ever met.
good,"Very good employer, good conditions, and overall respect for people."
good,"A typical day would be reviewing documents, looking for certain information regarding the request of the attorneys that are representing Dupont.  The workplace is quiet atmosphere.  I didn't fine anything really difficult."
good,"Great Pay good benefits"
good,"Not the best fit for me, but I expanded my skill set immensely, This served me well in my future positions. I have nothing else to say about it. Goodbye."
good,"Challenging and sometimes rewarding, fulfilling job, having known you have affected someone's life on the global scale by ensuring that you have provided a quality product that will sustain them in a long term."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Pioneer.  The main reason for looking for a new job was so that I could use my degree more, and I also wanted to make a larger income."
good,"DuPont has been a great company to work for, as it relates to pay, total compensation, and working within a challenging career field. I feel their management team is out of touch with what the crew needs and wants, and there is an impression that the plant is divided between the haves (front office personnel) and the have-nots (operations and maintenance personnel)."
good,"Flexible, work hard, play hard, "
good,The people make for a comfortable and good working atmosphere. The managers are great at working with building your skills and excelling you within the company.
good,DuPont has been a great place to work. They treat their employees well and everyone there is great. I don't know how the culture will be impacted in the future.
good,"Overall good experience in DuPont. Employ friendly atmosphere. "
good,DuPont Performance Coating was acquired by the Carlye Group and rename Axalta Coating System.  Lots of change and reorganization is in process.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"DuPont was a great place to work, until they gave too much authority and decision making to the department supervisors.  After that I witnessed a lot of people being mistreated with no one to take the actions to for correction.  The way people were put on supervision was by simply signing a paper saying they wanted to be a supervisior; there were no qualifications that had to be met to get that promotion."
good,"A typical day at work began by arriving 10-20 minutes before clock-in which allowed me to prepare my work station to begin promptly at 8 am.  Logging into phone system, as well as, all other programs needed were the first steps of my daily schedule.  I was in charge of handling all ""Contact Us"" submissions through the DuPont Protective Apparel website, DuPontSafeSPEC2.0.  I then answered any and all voice-mails in need of follow-up.  Multi-tasking these duties while answering all incoming calls that I received during the work day, as well. "
good,Routine but challenging with new twists that was a part of the continuous improvement process. Safety was a key requirement whether in the office or at a site.
good,"Today my typical day at work is on the computer supporting a Global Supply Chain application called SAP.  I am part of the run maintain team as well involved in large project to improve the current planning process to support the business.  "
good,"DuPont is a good company to work for.  Competitive pay, good 401K, and benefits.  Major change going on now, but company shifting primarily to focus on science."
good,A typical day at work as a Process Supervisor includes troubleshooting issues and making process improvements. The same goes for an Assistant to Operations.
good,Easygoing laid back place to work. Safety Oriented. Get the feel of a family more than a team. Could have way better communication between management and wage roll or even management with other management departments.
good,"Group meetings"
good,"Long history of being a good company to work for. However, as the company transitions more to DuPont and further away from Pioneer, respect for employees is decreasing."
good,"Based on my experience at DuPont, DuPont is supportive of its employee's needs and willing to be flexible if an employee needs it. The compensation is convervative and the workload can be heavy at times, but generally acceptable."
good,"Enjoyed working there"
good,"I learned something new almost every other week. My managers were awesome. They were very intelligent, helpful, understanding, and laid back. My co-workers were friendly, and also helpful. I really got a sense of teamwork even though we worked on different projects. I was given much independence from my managers to determine my schedule, which almost always varied from day to day. "
good,This company finally gave me my start to a field of chemistry.  Before working for DuPont I had no experience in my field at all.  Although I was only a lab technician while at DuPont it turned out being a position I could really use as a spring board to launch myself into a position working as a full time chemist.
good,"My typical day at work was going in and welding. I didn't have too many other responsibilities since I was just a co-op. When there was nothing to weld I would go and help the sheet metal guys with their projects and work."
good,"The teams I work with are efficient and accountable."
good,"has diverse business strategy"
good,"The work was fun and meaningful. Safety is the Highest Priority, Great Training, and Good Workplace. Opportunities for Advancement is scarce in this current job"
good,"great company with near unlimited  training,and excellent safety record"
good,Good place to work.  Had planned on working there until I retired.
good,"Experience in handling implementation and support areas of SAP HR R/3 system of version ECC 6.0"
good,"Dupont is a large company and being part of a large company, you tend to get lost in the shuffle. People didn't talk much and it reminded me of worker ants falling in line to do their job and there was always tension in the air. I love welding but that was not a job i enjoyed."
good,I have had alot of positive times at DuPont Pioneer. The SHE group is alot of fun and I have a great time with them. However the Production group has unreasonable expectations and does not care about the larger DuPont SHE group goals.
good,"el ambiente laboral es muy bueno, uno aprende a hacer diferentes actividades en relacion con la agricultura.. El trato de tus encargados de area, es muy buena...Lo mas dificil es q uno esta expuesto al sol pero simplemente eso... Me gusto diria q todo, ya que es una actividad de la q me gusta y estoy acostumbrado a hacerla..."
good,enjoyed the personal job progression while employed there. Being promoted to head office was most gratifying.
good,"The days at Coastal Training Technologies dba DuPont Sustainable Solutions were always interesting. Customers can provide challanges that were both easy and hard to solve. I learned how to handle them and, if at all possible, be able to assist the customer in their needs. I also learned more about Safety in the workplace than I ever thought I would need to know. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the tough customers but those were overshadowed by the customers you were able to assist in the best way possible."
good,"Difficult team, under a lot of stress, management unsure of how to keep researchers motivated, great location, wonderful human resources, good compensation."
good,Team is very good and work life balance is good. Global leader heading the team needs to be replaced. One may consider working here for a year tor two. Team is expanding.
good,"I had a chance to gain a lot of knowledge from their Engineers, Maintenance and E&I team.  The most enjoyable part of the job was coaching,developing the employees, and working on continuous improvement teams."
good,"It was a safety conscious site, I enjoyed the system hardware and layout."
good,"Company went through massive changes and I saw so many colleagues laid-off; the morale went down so drastically, and yet the work for the few of us left was nearly impossible to succeed; but our team was incredible and we did succeed very well."
good,The job was exciting and very challenging. Learned alot about teamwork becoming efficient in regards to my day to day job duties. The people I worked with became family.
good,"A typical day included assisting employees with HR questions especially benefits and payroll questions.  Processing invoices and answering vendor inquiries was considered typical for the position I held."
good,Buen ambiente laboral y facilidad de aprendizaje en cada area
good,"I really loved the people there, my position is a seasonal position that they hire yearly. Loved the company and the position. Just not a secure job. They offered for me to come back again the following year, however I declined since I found another job."
good,"DuPont takes safety very seriously, and is committed to safety in all aspects on the plant site. Found staff to be friendly and helpful. Though as an intern there were definitely some slow days. Overall a good experience for an internship."
good,"Great Work Environment Offfice was designed as workplace of the future, Ergonomically desks that could go up and down, shades that would automatically adjust, and lighting that would automatically adjust."
good,"The actual work is easy, though the shifts are difficult if you want a life outside of work. The responsibilities don't match the pay and are only getting more difficult. There is no ability for advancement from my current position. Management is so overworked that they can not give you the time needed to deal with personnel issues."
good,"Usually it woulld be a very hot day with a wet morning and we would sometimes show up to work before 6am to try to get the day over with faster,  so that we werent in the extreme heat for a long time. However part of the job (understandably) was working in many conditions so when it was extremley muddy or gross out we would still work, which didn't end up being worth it for me. However the managers were great and there were very flexible hours and easy procedures to follow."
good,"I worked with a PHD chemist. This was the ""old"" DuPont before all the management changes, layoff, restructuring, etc... It was slow paced and predictable, but opportunities for advancement were few."
good,A typical day at work would consist of walking through a plot of corn and making sure that there was no cross pollination between corn plants. We prevented cross pollination using tassle bags and shoot bags.
good,"If you put in the work, you will succeed here. It is an aged culture but getting younger every year, perhaps a bit slow to respond to present-day advances. However, what DuPont does, it does well. Work/life balance varies dramatically depending upon the role you are in. Benefits are excellent. Compensation directly out of college is competitive; however, intermittent and lower-end raises (even for one who consistently is rated for excellent performance) leads to ongoing salaries that lag behind many other companies."
good,"Good place to work, but the hours can be a bit long and rotating shifts with midnights, weekends and some holidays too.  The management is ok and there is a Union too that is helpful at times."
good,"--Typical work days are governed by a balance between long range work and fast paced day to day operations"
good,"A typical workday is fast paced, challenging, and ever evolving.  Most days present an opportunity to learn something new and useful.  Opportunities abound for Engineers and Operations."
good,"Contracted to DuPont as a Telecommunications Specialist. My responsible include but are not limited to maintain Four PBX’s (Privet Branch Exchanges) and all equipment within. I maintained the Analog, Digital and VOIP phone systems the Network, WAPS and Fiber connections."
good,The work was easy. There didn't seem to be any challenges for me to face. The job didn't interest me. Company takes forever to get the simplest tasks done
good,"Dupont was hit or miss. In the beginning, it was a great environment and I planned on being there long term. It was an established place and I considered myself lucky to be there, but when the merger hit, I felt that the CEO cared little about its employees and more about stock prices."
good,Great first step into manufacturing/industry. This is brand new plant. Start-up of production is stressful but provided lots of learning opportunities. Overall was a good experience that provided opportunities for growth.
good,"a great summer job for teens who want to make good money. It's tough work, out in the elements but if you show up every day and do what you're supposed to you'll get a nice bonus at the end of the season"
good,"Worked and study the grow of corn"
good,"Long hours on your feet, however, it wasn't seen as a task because the people I worked with were such great people. The hardest part of the Job was that we were subjected to all the elements, however, jon safety was priority."
good,Learning Sharpoint and Sap **** Awesome Job! Perfect Manager Perfect Office. New Equipment and Old Building. Two Cafs. Lots of Coffee and Knowledge. AN A
good,"Good Place for starters and has given me chance to prove myself. Became an individual contributor and increased my technical skills"
good,Most of the engineers and chemist were very easy to work with. All the operators are willing to work as a team which is very important when working with hazardous chemicals.
good,"It is a nice company to work.People in Pioneer are very friendly and nice, especially the team that I worked is a very nice. I never had a problem other than struggling for job security."
good,"Building Innovations is a great place to work at DuPont (if it stays as part of the merger with Dow).  There are lots of long term employees who care for each other, the business and technology."
good,rotating schedules not a fan 10 or 12 hr shifts not bad if u not the one waking up at 4am but nothing to complain about other then not knwn when what week will be your last if u aplly here make sure its with the company an not an agency I liked the job tho
good,"Concerned due to the recent merger with Dow chemical.  However, DuPont was good to me for 16 years.  Overall the culture is good and the people are nice."
good,"Pioneer utilized a temp service seasonally. Re-training of new workers was constant. Pioneer plans to expand plants, but closes them in middle of the expansion without notice."
good,It is a fast paced work environment. The people you work with are great. It is a family oriented and healthy initiative company.
good,"Manufacturing section has been moved overseas last 20 -30 years.  We need to keep our manufacturing jobs in the States."
good,"empresa com ambiente de trabalho tenso, onde quem pode mais, são os funcionários efetivos que tem mais AFINIDADE com a equipe diretiva."
good,"Daily production meetings, line walks and employee coaching.    The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to accomplish always changing goals."
good,"You come in set up your work station, grab an end user interview them, backup thier document and start the re image process"
good,"DuPont Pioneer is a company with great culture. I have been surrounded by hard-working people with a deep expertise in the pharma/agro industry. They were always available to answer my questions and to mentor me on delicate issues. "
good,"Electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation technician"
good,Great place to work as far as people and conditions. Really drive home Safety ( condition of employment ) Management easy going and fare.
good,Everyone was great that i worked with and for the jobs just doesn't last as long as the company says they are suppose to.
good,"Working there was a daily challenge with software and approaches to customer service constantly evolving. I learned a lot about Salesforce and SharePoint, along with the many products and services that DuPont has provided through the years."
good,Es war gut und interessant neu Kunden mit Kollegen von technischen Abteilungen zu gewinnen.
good,Its is totally unique job for me. Where I have learned that generating the demands always works for future and for future forecasting. And you have to convert yourself as atmosphere of mumbai on every step.
good,Seasonal job that is very fun and you get to learn a lot. The management is excellent and the co-workers are great.
good,"I worked at two different sites, with my time split equally. At one site I worked alone in the fuel aging lab performing maintenance of test specimens and reporting data from testing. At the other site I was part of a team and performed instrumental analysis on polymers and reported the data. The majority of my co-workers were friendly and pleasant to work with. Direct management were all a pleasure to work for. The hardest part of the job was being a contractor. I worked side by side with people earning more than twice my salary and I often did more work than they did. I did not have any paid vacation or sick days and was not eligible for any company recognition for my work because I was a contractor. I was promised a raise after one year but that did not occur. I enjoyed the flexibility in my schedule, the laid back atmosphere, and the diversity of my work. "
good,easy to get on with great trainers and crew every thing was perfect
good,"Rotating shift work which is hard to maintain lifestyle, but compensation and benefits help make it manageable.  Gaining skills, knowledge, and experience to help further a career in manufacturing."
good,I enjoy working for a company that has the end customer in mind and the management team is is one that is helpful at work or out of work. The culture of the workplace is very safety oriented and will stop at nothing to provide a safe workplace for every employee.
good,For anyone it is a good place to work they follow core values as a blood to the organisation. And the culture is very good in this organisation everyone can adopt easily.
good,"Great place to work.  Friendly people"
good,"perfecte balans werk en privé."
good,DuPont provides awesome benefits and pay structure.  Constant changes in company strategy and managements eliminates job security and not a lot of opportunity for advancement.  Heavy work load with not a lot of work-life balance due to less and less personnel and support.  Enjoyed my career while there and the awesome people I was privileged to work with and friends I made.
good,"Great place to work when it comes to salary.  However, if your looking for more and want to be developed you will lack that working at this particular site."
good,After the merger of Dow and Dupont new plant manager. Everything started changing. I've been there 13 years and when new plant manager came the plant went down hill fast
good,"●	Performed Smoke testing after the build deployment on a weekly basis after the defect fixes"
good,Its through my experience with DuPont that I was able to meet interesting people from all over the world and travel with.  This was truly a science company and a place I truly miss.
good,I thoroughly read the job descriptions understood the job rules and requirements answered every question truthfully added my resume and reviewed it to make sure the company can understand and I'm asking for a opportunity to work for this Rig and I have cleaned tanks for this Rig with another contractor
good,"Great work life balance, compensation and benefits are little bit lower than expected, but the company atmosphere makes up for it. Great culture and a good opportunity."
good,De las mejores empresas eticas y ejecutorias en las que he participado.
good,Definitely a good work life balance job with flexible work schedule and a lot of group activities to make work fun and enjoyable. Learn a lot of lab skill and gain experience in working with a lot of advanced lab equipment.
good,Our site location provided a good work environment where everyone worked together to achieve the site goals.  Management was open to hearing my suggestions/ recommendations and supported the safety efforts by training workers effectively and addressing safety concerns in a timely manner.
good,"O dia de serviço é normal, tem dia que é mais puxado, a empresa presa muito a segurança, e tem incentivos para novas ideias."
good,"Needed to become adept at using CCTV monitors, reading alarms, and using a page system. Paperwork and forms needed to be filled out for all visitors. Learned very quickly how to be an authoritative figure."
good,"A bit of an afterthought in the DuPont Corporation, was free to sell as I wished with little  direction. Too tied to pioneer seed and confusing programs to really excel"
good,Liked feeding the world. Steward ship policies on point.good employees. Challenges and learning daily. Always changing. Definitely seasonal. Very well organized corporation.
good,"DuPont is a friendly, work to prove yourself, thriving environment. If you are a hard worker DuPont will notice and reward you, if you're one too slack off, DuPont will notice."
good,I work independently and cooperate with my colleagues to develop new strategy for improvement and succeed.  I am friendly and have the good personality to get along with any colleagues.
good,Good work environment.  Opportunity to learn and improve my knowledge on US and foreign patent prosecution procedures. Interaction with inventors and corporate leaders from all over the world.
good,DuPont was a good place to work.  The people are good people and the work is challenging.  The products made at the Richmond location are unique which made the work fun.
good,"A lot of desk time servicing sales reps, monitoring computer screens non-stop.  Little tolerance for suggestions on process improvement from the field or in office."
good,"Worked with Distributors, Retailers, and Farmers to build the crop protection and seed business in Northeast Nebraska, Southeast South Dakota, and Southwest Minnesota.  Typical work day would be meet with 3-5 customers per day to discuss their operation and then propose solutions to meet their needs."
good,"started out really great, untill the retirement went away, then all the benifits started going away and we felt more like numbers than people. This is when the culture began to change."
good,"The company is good but there is very less chances for growth, only area marketing manager and regional sales manager are on pay role other staff is on third party , company strictly told to employees don't touch material and cash but its totally wrong we are all doing these thing by forced. Otherwise all good."
good,"DuPont was a great innovative company with deeply embedded core values and principles based on respect for people and ethics. Great place to work for, full of talented and polite people. I just hope the legacy will prevail after the mergers and spins."
good,I was a contract employee and did not have the chance for advancement in my area. I did not have the opportunity for my position to become part of the company allowing advancement.  DuPont employees did have advancement opportunities.
good,"This job has easy days and very fast paced days. Management is typical and the supervisors can be exceptional depending on who you have. You do have to watch out for the random head hunters that want to make personal advances in the company by stepping on others to get there. We call this at work pulling a ""Fought""."
good,"Muy buen equipo de trabajo"
good,Company has a long history of being innovation with very talented people. I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences I have earned over the years.
good,"Perform data entry, HR functions; manage programs; generate reports; interact with all levels of employees and managers. Great bunch of people to work with.  Enjoyed safety related social functions."
good,The company has been good to me and my career up to this point.  They are under going a lot of change right now and cutting back the workforce.  I'm unsure of their future and looking for an opportunity where my contributions will be  valued.
good,A typical day at work was like night and day. You may be extremely busy today and come in the next and push a broom all day. It is a fun place to work with good people. However as with any profession it also has its headaches. The biggest problem I had was favoritism and gossip. Management nor employees should ever engage in either. Overall i was satisfied with my employment here.
good,"They are a no nonsense company and expect employees to perform their responsibilities."
good,"For an intern, DuPont gave me a lot of freedom to tackle my projects however I wanted. Some of the work was dry and monotonous, but other projects required problem solving. They also payed very well for an internship."
good,"Things move slowly at this organization. The people are #1 here, but bureaucracy gets in the way of great, sharp minds reaching their potential as quickly as they might."
good,Technical organization is data driven with the focus on customer needs. Management is looking for results. Co-workers are respectful and freindly
good,Worked 14 years and learned many things about managing people & systems.
good,Dupont is a company with strong core values and focused on steady development and growth.
good,Hard work but I enjoyed it. The best part of the job was working with the staff and doctor. The family was very good to us.
good,It was a great place to work. The people were very laid back and everyone was treated like family. It's just to bad that most of the jobs are only contract positions.
good,I enjoyed working at DuPont.  I was continuously able to learn something new.  Was a very safety aware environment.  I would come in and look at the line up to see what particular job I would perform that day.  I was trained on 3 lines on both Quality and Windup duties.  I was also trained on two different wrappers.  Most every one I worked with were team players and we all worked to help get the job completed on time and first pass first grade product.
good,"This is a very analytical position requiring strong organizational and superior interpersonal skills.  I've worked for this company for 36+ years and was CTP'd in 2009 due to the ailing economy.  A four person team was reduced to two.  After a year, DuPont called me back as a contractor doing the same job from which I was let go from, which I've been now doing for three years. MYcurrent position opened up for a full-time person, and DuPont awarded the job to a person with no expertise in the job.  What I've learned is that you can work your life for a company, but there is no loyalty in the end.  I love my job and have had many awards awarded to me, but now seeking a new position."
good,"El día a día es muy cambiante, ninguno es igual. Es una empresa con muchas visitas, trabajos externos, además del productivo propio."
good,Respond onsite to customer service calls dispatched from a central response center
good,Typical Day at Work:

good,I had a great time learning in the environment there. Challenging at times as well as rewarding. Great opportunity to expand my circle of contacts throughout the community.
good,"Place was GREAT we all worked as a team, we worked hard but still had fun. Wish it would of stayed open. I don’t think I will ever find a job like it again."
good,"It was a pleasant working environment, management is more than willing to assist where they can. All departments work together in reaching the strategic goals of the organization."
good,"Fast paced work environment but with the merger between Dow and DuPont, there has been a lot of change at the Newark site. Lots of changes in management, conflicting priorities, etc. The engineering staff is an incredible group to work with, and the decisions to cut costs / lay off some of the longer tenured employees who weren't adding much value was a good idea. In a year or two, that site will be running very smoothly."
good,DuPont is a good comp;any to work with. It's core values and work culture makes employees feel valued. Employee welfare is pretty good and taken care well!
good,"DuPont's core values are safety, respect people and highest business ethnics. It is a good place to work. Coworkers take care each other. It is a good place to work and learn."

good,"I obtained solid broad Chemical Manufacturing and Business experience."

good,"I enjoyed my time there, learned a lot. I got to learn new skills. I enjoyed working with the people there, the camaraderie. The hours worked were good so I can spend time with family and friends."
good,This organization taught me basics of Procurement and with the guidance received by my management team I was able to concentrate on my career goal which is to get into a Mangement role and I was able to achieve success as I was promoted as an Asst Manager for Procurement Operations
good,"I enjoyed every role I had in my 25 years at DuPont.  I learned a lot of processes and had a high level of responsibility.  The people I worked with made going to work easy and fun.  I would have liked to have retired from DuPont but the merger with Dow caused a lot of downsizing and sadly, my entire group was let go."
good,"Très bonne entreprise mais faible perspective d'évolution "
good,Great place to work.  Pay is good and benefits are good.  Management makes great business decisions.  Only draw back was bringing in operation managers that knew nothing of the process or plant.
good,"leuke sfeer op het werk."
good,"I had many roles at Dupont.  I worked in Instrument / Electrical Design, Instrument / Electrical Maintenance and in various roles including supervisor and support.  Overall Dupont was very structured with limited opportunities to explore new and different horizons."
good,Intense days with contracts and workload
good,"Overall pleasant place to work. Veteran team onsite and productive , but not willling to share essential information if you're a contractor. "
good,"Love this company, and working with talented groups of individuals. This companies merger is conflicting with job security. This position was a great experience, job security is a must."
good,The job isn't too bad and the work is easy for the most part.  Hours can be rough sometimes.  Management can be blind to some obvious problems that are brought up.  Good work is recognized for the most part and the pay is fair.
good,"productive place to work, friendly coworkers, collaborating with others, did research on plant protection and did western blots for analysis, nice place to work"
good,"Company seems to be a little in disarray when it comes to managing its employees.  Overall, a good company to work for but be prepared for confusion regarding your role and reporting structure."
good,Great place to work where the business always innovate to create products and provide services for the better of human lives.
good,"The job was good ever changing, Hard to advance unless you knew someone really enjoyed helping others learn how to use products and to do R&D work"
good,"Dupont is a great company. It gave me the opportunity to grow up in different ways. It is a company that changes very often, creating room for learning and stimulating team working in a multicultural environment. DuPont emphasizes its core values along any project, initiative or activity. It´s a good place to develop not only functional aspects, but areas like Ethics, Respect for People, Safety etc."
good,"The best thing about working with Pioneer is your job changes with the season.  So, the scenery of where you're working is always changing and it truly makes the time pass right on by.  Our location also works extremely well together as a team to put out great production numbers.  The key is teamwork."
good,"It is a good place to work,good safety. Supervisor give a safety meeting in the morning and when finish start the working day; work tickets for repair pumps, pipe or any maintenace required."
good,Large agro-chemical supplier with great products and full of good people with deep industry experience. Undergoing merger with Dow creating uncertainty. Management also in flux
good,"Shift work is always tough, but they do compensate you well for the hours."
good,"The company has some interesting culture around safety and core values which required some adjusting belonging to a smaller company and then being acquired.  Things in a large company like DuPont are just different than being with smaller companies.  The thing that made it worthwhile for me was the site that I was located at.  It had great culture that was enthusiastic about fitness and getting to know each other as though we were family all while still focusing on science which we all loved.  It was a great group. Unfortunately, the company closed the location I was at."
good,"A typical day at work consist of replying to customer emails and voicemails, also fielding calls and creating leads for potential opportunities from customers and creating sample request for architects and designers. Internal meetings are held to discuss new techniques to satisfy our customers and bring new innovative ideas to the table.w"

good,Pioneer offers the opportunity to work with a diverse group of professionals in support of growing the Pioneer value proposition to its customers. In my role as Senior Investment Manager every day was different. Management supported our approach to portfolio management and valued our professional opinions. Working closely with our research scientist I gained knowledge of our Ag-biotech programs which represent the future value of Pioneer. This is an outstanding company to work for.
good,"Respectful corporate culture that values people, safety and the environment. Coworkers are great to work with and share knowledge.  Hardest part of the jobs is capturing data from multiple data sources."
good,"The role involves generating of various reports on Spend, On time payments, On time deliveries of the Purchase order, preparing KPIs and Dashboards for the easy communication of metrics with the senior management. Analyzing the gaps and standardizing the processes."
good,Great place to work and bond with colleagues. In the four years I was with the company I got many chances to grow professionally and personally.
good,i had good time till june 2015 after that some unreasobableness started due to my health issues and personal Problems due to which i lost my job.
good,"Shipping Coordinator position involved scheduling seed deliveries to sales reps and other plants to meet their demands.  Each day is different and involves keeping updated on inventory at several warehouses.  Co-workers were great to work with, and a very good resource for information."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Recommended by me.!!
good,"The people are extremely nice as our core value is respect for people and our boss will never yell at us or raised our voice on us. Growth of the business is a bit slow, so opportunity to advance also slow down too."
good,"DuPont is a very good organization to work with, I am proud that i have been a part of DuPont. DuPont is a very ethical company that cares deeply about the welfare of its people and its customers. Very strong safety culture, excellent 401k plan . You put in 6% DuPont contributes another 9%.One of DuPont 'Core Values' is 'Respect for People', and they hold this out as their flagship core value."
good,"Dupont's solution to most problems is to add more management. Even if you're not qualified for management, people move up to that level."
good,"* DuPont has an intense safety culture"
good,"Relaciones interpersonales"
good,Nice place to learn and practice statistics knowledge. Very friendly and knowledgeable senior staff. Great Work life balance!
good,"Mijn job in DuPont was om de lijn draaiende te houden door de aanvoer constant te houden. Met andere woorden, ik moest vaten met grondstoffen aanvoeren van de voorraadplaats tot aan de lijn. Maar bij DuPont kon ik niet echt mijn gang gaan en opgroeien in het bedrijf. Aangezien ik onder interimcontract zat en ik maar beperkt was tot bepaalde zones. Ik heb eigenlijk nooit een probleem gehad met collega's op het werk, het waren ook toffe mensen zoals ik ze heb gekend. Ik probeer om altijd vriendelijk te zijn tegen iedereen die ik tegenkom. Dat is meer mijn levenswijze. Ik moest niet echt moeilijke taken uitvoeren. Maar dat is natuurlijk alleen omdat je bepaalde opleiding moet hebben genoten om te kunnen werken met zeer gevaarlijke producten. Ik vond het jammer dat ze geen vaste contracten aanboden."
good,Great place to learn and grow into the type of work done here.
good,Productive workplace going through a transition period.  A great group of people to work with in a demanding environment.

good,"Knowledgeable of import/export regulations.  Attentive to details with thorough follow-up on order processing issues and logistics, complemented by a proactive approach to anticipating issues and preventing them before they occur.  Would strengthen a team of import/export Customer Service Representatives."
good,"Inicio meu dia as 7:30, por trabalhar na planta da fabrica, a dinâmica nos negócios é notada todos os dias.  Tive o oportunidade de trabalhar nos dois ambientes – Administrativo e no Administrativo de uma planta. Acredito que tal experiência tenha sido fundamental para o meu aprimoramento como profissional, pois estar em uma planta fabril permite estar próximo de onde a operação acontece e assim desenvolver conhecimentos e aprimorar a visão holística do processo como um todo."
good,"Usual routine, come in the morning and perform the same task. Some time the work load is huge. It is a very friendly environment. Co-workers are great. We almost eat lunch together everyday. I have learned about genome and about constructing library that I have never learned before so for me it is a great experience."
good,"Worked 4 12 hour days then 4 days off, shift work. The co-workers were for the most part, easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with Corian that wasn't setting properly and having to remove it from the line at a certain point. The line ran at a fast speed. The best part was loading the trucks with the fork lift."
good,"very enjoyable job. Co workers became and still are close personal friends still. Every day was different because of the nature of the work which made it exciting and new most of the time. I learned a great deal of different testing methods, some of which were boring and tedious but for the most part it was nice. There were a couple of managers that I didn't get along with but all of my immediate supervisors over the years were great and am still in touch with a couple of them."
good,"Heb er veel analytische experimenten geleerd, 5 ploegen was super, me collega waren oke.."
good,"Empresa de ciência e tecnologia, muito boa para se trabalhar."
good,Working from Home requires good discipline and pre arrangements for the meetings. My Manger should always be aware of new opportunities and summaries of meetings held.
good,"Great company to work for, safety standards are held at the highest levels, and innovators in their field. Their team of managers were dedicated to hiring the right person for each position and although most training seemed to be extensive in most areas of the plant, training was limited in the QA department."
good,"Rotating shift but great place to work, would definitely recommend. There isn't a clean or enjoyable job at the plant but I liked everyone I worked with, made the time go by."
good,"La empresa tiene una buena cultura y la viven, gente que sabe mucho y tiene mucha experiencia, siempre están buscando las mejores formas de hacer las cosas."
good,"One of the best Work Cultures in an MNC."
good,They allow worker of the age 14. It was good for a summer job at such a young age. Its only in the mornings making time for everything else for a kid to be a kid.
good,"A typical work day involved project meetings to review and schedule next steps for project work. I learned various analytical techniques for characterization of project enzyme including high throughput activity plate assays, HPLC, SEM imaging, robotics etc. Direct supervisors and project leaders there to help manage work flow and any concerns. Culture is work hard play hard and for the most part very friendly and open-no feelings of intimidation. Hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is problem solving and finding solutions when possible."
good,"It is fast paced work environment. Work culture is great. Every day is a new day to learn at Dupont.  Every work day is filled with  team learning, discussion, Laboratory work."
good,"Diverse learning opportunities and flexible schedules. However, during the merger and split of companies recently, many core values have gone by the wayside. Management is more concerned with gathering employees, than developing their teams."

good,I have learned to cooperate with different groups of people. I feel that it's easier to  the life-work balance here. Managers would allow working at home sometimes.
good,"Over all it was a good place to work, and grow as a production worker, I worked my way up to supervisor. For job security it one of the best company to work at."
good,Science and innovation driven company. Parent company vision is unclear however Industrial Biosciences is a good place to work. People are good however movement up has been stagnet due to parent company.
good,"To put into perspectives, you have to make adjustments for shift work, its an around the clock operation that does not stop/  Some have come here and dont have a clue of what to expect, until they get in the mix of things, I suggest that one should do thieir homewok first before venturing to an work environment such as this, simply because its not for the faint at heart."
good,"très bonnes possibilités d'évolutions "
good,Technology training provided by Pioneer keeps me relevant with new tech.Pong tables available. Can take off when I need to and work from home if necessary.

good,"If you want to be in a challenger environment, where things change very rapidly, DuPont is the place to be. Those constant business changes ensure learning and change opportunities. I personally like that. Drawback is on career pathway. With frequent changes, including on management basis, it´s tough to design a development plan."
good,People are great to work with.  Management listens to your ideas.  Learned many new PowerPoint diagrams and advance Excel spreadsheets.  Workplace can be stressful at times but very rewarding.
good,"Hard work pays off here. But it has to be something you enjoy thoroughly, as weather can be less than ideal. Travel opportunities are abundant. Advancement is probable if you are a hard worker."

DuPont also invests in people with training and education to include paid certifications and ensuring continuous improvement of the organization as a whole.

good,DuPont Pioneer company is a seed company is a india no. 1 company. Hybrid seed first time lanched in india. Pioneer group is a DuPont. DuPont company is a American company
good,Job is good schedule is all over the place due to season changes. would recommend to people that don't mind short notice on shift changes. 401K is above average
good,"Overall, pretty decent place to work.  Many worked long hours but the relaxed hours in the summer makes up for it.  Salary was above average for Des Moines.  Many faced job security issues with the Dow-Dupont merger and constant job reorgs."
good,"Oferece bons aprendizado uma visão de mercado, ambiente agradável de ser trabalhar,"
good,"Good culture. Friendly work environment."
good,"Replying to emails from buyers and suppliers."

good,"I have been working for DuPont for 13 years. This company gave me very good opportunities to grow and I was able to take them and make the difference!"
good,"Front line - answered calls and greeted walk-ins.  Checked my email for assignments and communications from various customers.  On occasion, I arranged out of town accommodations for staff, and/or travel arrangements.  I was responsible for purchasing items for the office as needed or requested.  I learned to do in-house payroll and paid particular attention to time sheets for accuracy.  I was a member of the Social Committee, which organized employee events and special occasions, ie Birthdays, Christmas party, etc. Being the Safety Technician allowed me to learn more about job and employee safety.  The senior management team was great to work with.  My opinions and ideas were always considered.  I got along well with all my fellow employees.  I was given the liberty to edit and design the company's monthly newsletter, which I enjoyed.  Inter-company newsletters were a great way to know what was going on in our other Canadian locations."
good,"Grande empresa, mas não existe plano de carreira, quem almeja crescimento profissional não tem espaço e acaba deixando a mesma."
good,Relaxed place to work but doesn't keep you busy all year long. Really good people to work with and very flexible with your schedule.
good,"Grande autonomie dans le travail."
good,"Jeg er meget stabil..."
good,They asked for a hard days work but in return you were treated very fairly and with respect. You always had the freedom to use new ideas to grow and were treated with respect as well from co workers and peers. Great working environment.
good,I worked from a home office. I had a specific area of small and big box accounts that I visited daily to teach and train all of ther employees on the Dupont Stainmaster products so they may sell the Dupont products effectively.I gained new accounts and cultivated existing accounts. Contract negotiations were attainable with the level of investment the business foresaw. I had to increase market share with this product and retail concepts.
good,There is too much flux due to the DuPont Dow merger.  My 20 year career will likely be snuffed out for short term market gains.
good,"DuPont is the place to be in Delaware regarding the flexible working time. You could start the day from 6am and be off-work at around 3pm."
good,In the past it has been a good work environment except that they are now shipping jobs to India that replace employees and contract staff.  They are consumed with cost cutting which does not create a positive work environment.
good,"Typical day at work is dictated by the expectations of the research position that you hold.  Some days can be very long research-oriented days, while others consist of attending on-site education seminars about a topic of interest, meetings and conferences.  You're trained at DuPont to become a versatile scientist; if you're a chemist, you'll soon learn about engineering/biology/physics in order to get the research to the level that's expected.  You work with a team of people of all backgrounds, disciplines and expertise in order to build your level of scientific knowledge.  The hardest part of the job is that your performance is assessed at the end of each year.  The most enjoyable is that there hardly is any research occurring that becomes monotonous and boring; you are always learning something."
good,The coworkers make you feel like family as long as you are nice to them. I enjoyed my time there because the only problem there was the lack of employees.
good,"we work for average 10 hours in daily operations."
good,Provided the foundation of inventory and plant accounting.  Was able to communicate with various levels of management.
good,"This company has lots of layers of management which makes it difficult to get things done.  "
good,"As an LSE i learned  to become FL certified, trained for safety by OSHA. worked as oxone employee at night and loved it because wasn't a crowded enviroment and easy to get walk around."
good,This is a great place to work if you don't mind waking up early or having to switch between nights and days for about half of the year.  The people are great to work with and all the jobs in the plant at the technician level are pretty easy to learn.
good,A fast paced environment that presented new challenges everyday requiring an innovative perspective. I worked daily with international businesses to deliver the materials needed to perform the operating functions
good,no issues except the culture. The employees can be fearful of change. The Richmond site is huge and perfectly arranged. The exposure to new ideas and methods of learning are incredible. You will regularly come into contact with higher management at this location.
good,para mi el trabajo es bueno solo que el sueldo ya no me ayuda y he solicitado un aumento dado que he demostrado mis habilidades laborales y ellos la han aceptado desde ya casi dos años pero no mas el sueldo sigue bajo todo lo demas me he podido adaptar dado que ha donde sea que vaya se tiene que relizar con respeto y responsabilidad lo mejor que se pueda y con buen rendimiento tratando que se vea una buena calidad ya que este es el que habla por si solo el como te desenvuelvas en tus actividades diarias laborales me gusta trabajar pero tambien me gusta que me valoren que haya una mejora continua en lo personal y que en lo laboral se refleje en mi sueldo ya que este si es digno ese sera el que te va a ayudar a una buena calidad de vida dentro de la familia ya que uno trabaja para que la familia este bien tengamos lo necesario por todo lo demas en planta esta bien. busco una mejora busco ganar mas de lo que gano

good,"I would arrive, and my P.I. would have a note for me for the polymerization reaction he would like me to run. I set up the glassware, make sure everything is clean, and make sure the reaction vessel is inert. All monomers are weighed accurately, and added to the reaction vessel, using minimal solvent to wash the remaining monomer in the vessel. The rest of the solvent is added, and the reaction is monitored. The reactions are completed, and the next day, films are made of the polymers. Tensile testing is conducted of the polymers."

good,werken in 2 ploegendienst- volgens dagelijks wisselend werkrooster- onder verantwoording ploeglijder
good,"It is a great place to work to get quite a bit of money. You work every day for 2-3 weeks, There is a lot of work that needs to be done and the faster you get it done the faster you get out of there."
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"Safe environment, even in harsh areas.  Strict protocols on safety for the personnel, visitors, community, and environment.  hey reward jobs well done, and help each through problems.  They are very team oriented, but take care of the individuals."

good,Had a division in queens ny that they closed and asked me to  transfer to  Wilmington DE which I did not want to do..From there I took a position with long island stove where I was an outside sales rep covering a portion of nyc  .Iworked there roughly 6 years and then decided to open my own business which I ran for 22+ years I started out calling on builders 'contractors;real estate people; of which I did shy of 1 million dollars in sales back then...As of today I am living in ponte vedra beach Jacksonville
good,"No central location to complete job requirements"
good,It is a 200+ year old company that has taken care of many people for decades.  It just wasn't the fit and culture that I am looking for at this stage in my life.  that being said.  They do take care of their people.
good,The job has really great compensation and it is a joy working with the coworkers. You become family and eventually talk to each other everyday and they are very helpful/
good,I really enjoyed the time I had at DuPont. I was only contract. My experience was well worth it. People were pretty nice to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job was interaction.
good,"Loved the job when worked at the Niles location.  Much less stress and hovering management.   Most of the people I worked with were great but some, not so much."
good,If you like a job where you're always doing something it was a good job for that purpose. After you were done doing what you needed to do you would always go help someone else until everyone was done.
good,I was laid off as a result of the Dow DuPont merger.  The process was fair and open though.  My time there was good.  The work was fulfilling and the rewards were good.
good,Open - collaborative entrepreneurial recruitment firm - team oriented with a lucrative compensation structure. International scope of services in Canada and USA
good,Overall good company work for.  The atmosphere was relaxed.  Management was friendly and helpful.  The age group was diverse and everyone got along.  Customer service focused
good,"A very safe place to work, safety is stressed. The facility has the worlds record for safe work hours. One of a kind facility with limited room for advancement due to having only about a hundred employees. their future looks promising with projected sales and possible new products in the pipeline."
good,it was a great place to work i was in maintance worked 4-10 and was a lead man when i left there i was a millwright and worked hand and hand with operations
good,"As a spinning machine operator, my job called for me to take action only when a thread broke out from the machine.  Other than that, it was a very relaxed job.  The job was hot and demanding, but the benefits made up for it."
good,"At the time I worked at DuPont it was still a thriving enterprise.  Strong company values which each employee was required to learn about and follow.  The company did mostly ""walk the talk"""
good,"I would work for DuPont again, but perhaps at a different location. Often tasks were not organized which was a direct result of poor upper management."
good,"Every morning you get up and go to specific locations to catch the busses that take you to the field. Its hot, wet, exhausting but also sometimes fun."
good,DuPont really needs to focus on taking care of employees from a pay perspective - salaries are not competitive and very few employees receive stock options.
good,"I loved working there, they paid a lot better than most places would. The safety was a big concern on their part, a lot of the rules made since, but you had to follow them."
good,DuPont has some very driven and caring people working there. The command and communication structure was very siloed. It was difficult to transfer between businesses without making enemies in management.
good,I enjoyed the position and learning genetic procedures. I liked the people that I was involved with...much more than in my next job! I would consider going back.
good,High class scientific research organization.  Stimulating work where ideas are valued and you have freedom to work on your goals.  World class scientist to share ideas with and stimulate thought.
good,Overall I enjoyed my employment with DuPont Pioneer. I was able to advance from an administrative assistant to a research associate. Flexible work hours were also given to employees. The only thing that made me uncomfortable with this job was my manager was not really good with her skills. She needed more managerial training. She was very knowledgeable in her job but her people skills were lacking.
good,"My tenure at this facility was far too short lived. I came in a temporary worker and didn't like receiving the news my time was over. I could honestly work at Dupont/Pioneer for decades, and retire feeling good about the work I've done. The job isn't stressful, and it's not boring. It's rather perfect. They have employees engaged in a few different activities every night so that it's not too boring, they offer different jobs every night. The people are knowledgeable and easy to work with. I would have liked to have stayed much longer."
good,Job was demanding at times. Long hours at times and because of the business function and the down market it was hard to motivate employees of the importance of keeping the production timeline.
good,A constantly fluctuating schedule makes the job unique and spontaneous.  A focused team striving to find improve the overall operations and success of Pioneer.
good,"great people to work with, everyone is committed to running the place safety. A very intense unit operation that requires strong dedication to safety."
good,"great opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with new hires and guys learning more about their trade. at the end of the day, it was a satisfying job."

good,"I enjoyed working for DuPont.  I left for a better paying job opportunity.  Nothing personal about the compa                               "
good,"This was my first real job out of college and my experience was great! I had the opportunity to work with and learn from world class talent in the field of biotechnology. I was encouraged and was given the resources to pursue and develop new ideas and products. Educational advancement was encouraged and mentorships were available to new staff. In more certain economic times, this was a great place to work, but restructuring and layoffs have made the work environment stressful. I would defiantly consider working here again."
good,I have worked in various areas of DuPont Pioneer and was very pleased with my time there.  The reason I left was due budget constraints  and would enjoy another assignment there.
good,"DuPont is a R&D company. here i worked as a BMS executive.i learned safety related stuff here, also i improved my technical and management skills of organisation."
good,Was a great place to work.  Thought I'd retire from DuPont eventually.  It's a shame they decided to close the brand new facility.  They are calling it the 700 million dollar mistake.
good,"In my 24 years of working for DuPont, I worked at several locations including an international assignment. There were many great people and personalities that made up the workforce of the company.  The culture was very supportive and had many resources to call upon. Excellence was always a goal as well as fostering a safe work environment. Work was generally challenging and exciting."
good,"Provide large space to learn and develop yourself's professional skills"
good,"Colleagues are highly educated, support one another, and work toward common goals.  Laboratories and other facilities are state of the art.  Benefits and salary are good."
good,"For those who want to do state of the art scientific research and related engineering, DuPont is a great place to work.  The facilities and colleagues are outstanding.  At times the work environment can be stressful due to deadlines or when facing unknown next steps upon a change of research direction.  However, there is nothing more satisfying than developing a new product or material that the world has never seen previously and fills important needs."
good,"Quiet atmosphere.  Duties included document review, with a chance to perform special projects.  Some opportunity for advancement depending on availability."
good,Dupont is a very interesting company to work. They have a great culture of job and saftey. Technology is always useful to have meetings with colleagues overseas. They have an enviroment with very flexible hours to work as long as the job is done.

good,Best company ever to work for.  I learned a great deal while working for Dupont.  I would have loved to retire from Dupont but circumstances prevented this.
good,"8 hours a day "
good,Changing culture of late. I left company two years ago during time of divesture of businesses. The company is now in the process of merger with Dow Chemical and know there has been a lot of upheavel.
good,"This has been my first job after graduating college and has been very enjoyable.  I got very lucky finding a job with a great culture (work hard, play hard).  Everybody is eager to share knowledge and supportive of branching out of the department to explore other avenues."
good,"Worked 3 1/2 years as an Extraction Operator and loved it. The huge downside for me was the 2 week swing shift. 2 weeks on 5am-5pm then 2 weeks on 5pm-5am. Good hours if you're single. You end up working 2 days on and then 2 off. Every other weekend you work Saturday, Sunday, Monday."
good,"22 years working with this company it's time to change"
good,Overall Dupont is an OK company to work for. It's health benefits can be better and it has a pretty bad career advancement but the team environment is great. The environment is relaxed and very friendly. Many team building activities. Work load can be tough at times and very easy other times. The hours can be pretty flexible
good,"Ho imparato molto in questa azienda."
good,"The company is great to work for. They have many benefits for their employees that you do not always find available such as tuition reimbursment and infertility help. The hardest part of the job is the random breakdowns during season. The job is very fast paced and with a lot of product movement, it can be a challenge to keep up with. As with all companies, the people are the best part. Everyone is very respectful and the company is full of smiles."
good,Has been a great company to work for in Delaware. Lots of change is currently underway. The future after the DOW DuPont merge will be interesting.
good,"After retiring I can say the one thing that I miss about the place is the good people who worked there.  If by chance I find another place"

good,"There in no typical day in the work because the load on the work is balanced by all the team members."
good,"The Santa Cruz do Sul DuPont Pioneer's site, are a good place to work. Nice coleagues and good chalenges to support the business. Awesome lunch too."
good,"DuPont Nutrition & Health is a really great place to work. Excellent pay & benefits. You may disagree with Management sometimes, but that comes with the territory at any job, I believe. Work schedule does take some getting used to, as it is a rotating schedule, and because of this, you only have one weekend off a month, but it is a 4 day weekend, so it's not too bad. If you don't mind working hard, and rotating shifts every week, I highly suggest it as a place to work."
good,. Respect for people and all the different abilities they bring to the company. Good training and standards. Safety is #1.
good,不予以评价。很快要变成一家新公司了。没什么可说的吧。12年的工作经验能给以后的就职带来什么影响，真的不清楚。
good,"This company gave me an opportunity to put my foot in the door for experience dealing with field research. All the co-worker seemed to have invested in their job. It can be labor extensive at times but it is also enjoyable. Most days was spent on discarding seed and plot maintenance. At times, I would help associates with their research projects"
good,In the past DuPont has been a great place to work.  They treat their employees well and everyone there is very nice.  DuPont is undergoing significant change so I don't know how the culture will be impacted in the future.
good,"Great environment, great coworkers, Great benefits and work/life balance. Many opportunities to work on many different projects. Not micro-managed. Held to be responsible for your own work. Lots of HR/Required tasks, but good training to have. One of the hardest parts of the job is understanding the organizational structure and knowing who is who and knowing who you need to contact for what. Sometimes feels like too big of a company with a confusing structure and fragmented."
good,"The plant is a smaller operation of about 90 people that is part of a much larger international corporation.  There is the benefit of a small, self governed operation and also the benefit of the resources of a large company."
good,bon management et une grande entreprise leader dans leur domaine
good,"After 26 years was laid off, they have posted other jobs but will not rehire loyal employees? management are largely uneducated, the upper management is largely engineers, and you know how well engineers are at running businesses."

J'analysais les indicateurs productive à travers niveau sigma pour définir les nouveaux projets et économiser les ressources. En plus, je déployais l'amélioration en tant que Master Black Belt Six Sigma."
good,Great company to work for. Learned a lot from a lot of different people who treated me with the up most respect. I was the only contractor on my shift and the company along with the employees treated the same as others and not differently. We work as a team and family and that's what made work easier and safer.
good,"I would wake up at 3 a.m. in order to catch the bus that would take me to the cornfields where we would work. We arrived there around 4 or 5 a.m. and start working until 3 or 4 p.m depending on the weather. We had 2 breaks, one of 15 minutes and one of 30 minutes. "
good,"The many years I have worked for other companies, I would say this company has been the most friendliest. I have been there only a  few weeks and it seems like I have met almost everyone in this building."
good,"travail très varié :chaudronnerie, serrurerie ,plomberie,soudure ,maintenance industrielle (activité entreprise basée sur la recherche)"
good,As a chemical engineering co-op I gained experience working with computational software used to improve the TiO2 production processes at DuPont. The pay is good and the environment is positive with flexible hours depending which site you work at.
good,"lo mas difícil fue: el ambiente de trabajo."
good,Company has a history in the region and treats employees fairly.
good,"Very developmental rolls, opportunities for advancement."
good,"Management skills vary significantly from plant to plant. The hardest part of the job is working with uncooperative operators, a behavior fostered by poor management-union relations.

The environment fostered professional development, mentorship, and continuous improvement."

good,"- Basic secretarial duties to senior management;"
good,learnt how important safety is.
good,"I am an upbeat worker, a self starter. I am safety oriented. I get along with anyone and try to find the positive in any situation."
good,"The work day was centered around efficiency and production. Promised delivery dates had to be kept, and in doing this, safety was first priority. I led a team of 5 - 6 employees on a Mylar production line and learned a lot about managing people, time and resources. My co-workers were very helpful in keeping things running smoothly while I focused on other aspects of the operation. The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour, rotating shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to complete my shift and have all of my people leaving without injury, as well as having produced a product that passed inspection and was ready for sale. I also enjoyed the challenge involved with coordinating with other areas and people in order to produce a good product."
good,- Planning starts with a coffee at 9AM and the day ends at 5:30PM with satisfaction and hope
good,"This company was good to work for the experience factor. They trained you to do your job before putting you to work, and also stressed the importance of safety at the workplace. The management was good although seemed to be tough on others, but as long as you did your job you had no problems. They hired everyone under the sun, meaning it was all different types of personalities that sometimes clashed however the management always handled the situation in an adult manner and ended any conflict before it escalated further than need be. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the assembly line, at times it sped up to a point you was always moving and was so exhausted at the end of the day, however it was nothing that we couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all the different people that you would find in your typical refinery setting. It was amazing to see how different we all were but how similar we were at the same time. I enjoyed working here very much and if I'm still in orange when it comes back around."
good,"DuPont is known for their core values which is why they are a leader in today's global economy. You can learn a lot in this large company and gain a wealth of experience as an engineer. They keep expertise in house and do not contract out much work. They are you typical large corporation when it comes to meetings, HR, benefits, etc."
good,Trabajar en Du Pont se siente seguridad por altos estandares que se manejan dentro de la empresa en conclusion todo es agradable

good,"Overall is good. "
good,I traveled 50% of the time.  The leadership team worked extremely hard and was willing to put in the extra time for the team members.  The only reason I left was that a former colleague needed help to turn around another company.
good,"Great pay, excellent benefits, lots of training and educational opportunities. Simply too many meetings."
good,"24 hour production plant that will typically have breakdowns"
good,"Safety first, work was pretty much straight forward, well defined scope of planned work and everything provided for work. Lack of mobility with company changes now."
good,This was a physically demanding internship but allowed me to become immersed in private sector crop research. The management was positive and professional.
good,Supervisors are trained in an area but not all areas. The older people there are more angry of upcoming people and they don’t have the patience to train new employees properly.
good,"I worked at DuPont for relatively short period of time and on a contractual basis. Nevertheless, I was given the same facility and status as its formal employees and therefore I enjoyed my work there."

good,A work culture based on respect for people. Good colleagues and great place to work with a very good work life balance. The company needs to be more aggressive to market its great products.
good,transform corn and subculture callus tissues.  Playing ping pong with friend during the break.  people are very friendly.
good,It was a short stay but e good one. Chemours on the other hand was different. Overall it was a good journey. The co-worker are awesome and really good people.

good,Great place to work.
good,"DuPont was a great place to work. Good benefits, good culture, reasonable pay. DuPont likes to promote from within so many opportunities to advance to different positions. I only left due to distance from home."
good,"Not a bad workplace. The pay is good. The hours aren't bad, they are what you make them which depends on the area you decide to work in. The chances for advancement are there for the taking, you just have to go for what you want. The only down side to the experience is that they can be a little racist."

Esto debido a que es una planta con dirigentes Globalizados."
good,"Managing a crop breaks your year into specific season with strict deadlines.  The structure of the growing seasons trickles into the roles as Field Operations Manager.  I will oversee a very wide variety of processes throughout one growing season.  Many of which provide their own unique challenges.  This dynamic work environment ensures there's never a dull moment.  The fast pace mentality and quick decision making required for crop production are also attractive attributes of my current role.  All of the responsibilities and uncontrollable factors can make for very complex process management which, at times, can become frustrating.  The people management is the most rewarding task of all.  It does come with its fair share of 'bumps in the road' when building a team to perform at an expected level."
good,"DuPont has been an outstanding place to work.  "
good,"I went through several changes at the same job/office.  Dupont purchased the company in 1999 and I was in charge of the Accounts Payable Dept. for the two sister companies in the U.S.  Dupont kept me on after the entire accounting department was moved to their corporate headquarters in Wilmington, DE.  They kept those of us who stayed through the transition.  Dupont subsequently sold the Performance Coatings division to Axalta in 2013."
good,"empresa agradável de trabalhar,ótima convivência com os colegas de trabalho,oportunidade de crescer profissionalmente"
good,Leadership is a very good skill to learn and apply in order to grow in the company.
good,"The DuPont company gave me the opportunity to advance based on how hard I worked.  "
good,"Ik ben Eerlijk, sociaal, flexibel, leergierig, klantvriendelijk, doorzetter, verantwoordelijk"
good,Computer operations to control levels for daily operations. Learning something everyday is a plus. You see different things all the time and you problem solve them. Our management was excellent. They would pitch in and help when they could.
good,"Started in medical diagnostics field sales calling on hospitals and clinical laboratories. After several moves I relocated to the main Delaware office and developed and performed Sales Product Training.  Also did customer training. My resume has more detail."
good,Outstanding experience working with some of the best professionals in their field.   Safety was always at the forefront of every project and the company had  a good balance between work and life.
good,Good pay and there is room for advancement if you are a good worker and have good people skills. Pay starts at 13 an hour and within a year you get a dollar raise. Schedule is swing shift so if you don't like that then you will hate the job.
good,"Great place to work. Managers were easygoing and made the work fun and easy. DuPont was recently merged with Dow and is now Corteva Agroscience. Overall, great place to work."
good,I worked at DuPont Pioneer's Miami Research Station during the summer while I was in high school. It is a great first job to teach people new to the working scene how to function in a work environment effectively.
good,"Throughout my many years at Dupont Pioneer, the people I worked with were not only my coworkers, but close friends of mine. During my last year there, I, along with other workers, traveled over the state to do work for the company on different projects they were working on. Each returning year I was given a pay raise and given more responsibilities making my experience there more fun."
good,"I enjoyed working for DuPont. I always had outstanding colleagues with a deep technology knowledge, as well as very good supervisors. There was a very strong safety culture that helped us feel comfortable working with equipment and chemicals. "
good,"A very good job to get you started, DuPont pioneer offers fair pay. Most of the managers/supervisors are reasonable. Time consuming and exhausting especially in the heat."
good,"Uma empresa que visa bastante atitudes éticas, se preocupa com o funcionário, tem ótimos benefícios e visa também a integração social."
good,"The workforce generally very old (50-60s) and many are retiring soon. This leaves a huge opportunity for younger and motivated employees to fill the void and hold great positions. Due to the older workforce, the pace of work is generally pretty slow and most people are content to put in their 8-5 and then coast so it isn't the most stressful or cutthroat environment. If you're early in the career and ready to go crazy with hours and jump-start your career, probably steer clear. However, if you're looking for a stable, low stress, well-paying job, comfortable job then this is a place for you."
good,A typical day was spending eight or so hours out in the fields helping to pollinate corn. DuPont Pioneer had a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere. They also found ways to keep their employees happy even though they had to spend long hours in the fields.
good,The future direction of the company looks very promising. I enjoyed the time opportunities I was afforded during my time there. The employees are also nice folks.
good,"Pioneer is part of a large company but it still has a small company feel. Many employees have been around for years because it's a great place to work. Compensation could be better, but the cost of living in Des Moines is low. I've met the CEO and not only is he a nice man, he's very good at what he does."
good,Great place to work. Great coworkers who always have your back. Competitive benefits. Love the schedule and the overtime. Management could be better.
good,The best part about the job was driving all over the province meeting farmers and helping them with their canola crop and being outdoors.
good,"On daily basis I'm responsible for the following:"
good,"There are various tasks to do every day. Before I started working within Dupont Pioneer, I knew nothing of how research in science worked or what there is going on. I have learned much during my time here. All of my co-workers have been friendly. Management for each position here have been helpful with my scheduling needs during school and around big holidays. I love the fact that each position, within every day is different and that I'm always learning. I think the hardest part of my current position is loading and unloading large machinery due to my physical height. Being a temp employee, I do not get to enjoy benefits like health and vision."
good,"clocking into work, going out into the field, and going to your row of corn and fertilizing the corn, you could get a drink anytime and were outside all day in the sun, if it was raining you were still out but if it was thundering you weren't allowed to go out you had a 30 minute lunch break and you meet new people that you got along with all the time"
good,"I went to work for DuPont at their Richmond, Virginia Spruance site in the spring of 2009. Specifically, I worked in the Tyvek® division as a laboratory technician, or product developer. The product, Tyvek® HomeWrap®, is a nonwoven polyethylene protective barrier used to prevent water from damaging the interior frames of houses while allowing air to pass through. My job was to investigate improvements of these properties and to test the results using American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) methods in the laboratory. Unfortunately, this involved extensive use of my chemistry background rather than the chemical engineering I had been studying. I also spent a significant part of the work term in an off-site laboratory-warehouse, which was secluded from the process engineering that I had hoped to be a part of. "
good,It's a different experience after one gets indulged in the projects. There is alot to learn. A very friendly and supporting work culture which eases off other work stress.
good,"el ambiente laboral es muy bueno, las instalaciones muy confortables y las prestaciones excelentes."
good,"Currently going through a merge transition. Flexible hours; safety- & employee-oriented. Collaborative, diverse & friendly culture. Grounds and buildings very well-kept. Onboarding can use some improvement; however, it will likely improve after transition. Some management is transparent that provides a more comfortable and confident environment for employees."
good,"Until the layoff where they shut down in March 2016. It was the best three working years I have had since I joined the worforce after graduation. I learned many new molecular techniques, took part in planning/designing experiments, and had a very understanding boss. It was great until rumors of layoffs circulated and then finally came true with a whole site shutdown announcement in December 2015."
good,"My work would have fed the world. the job in plant tissue culture was very gratifying. my job there was the most enjoyable I ever had. I was promoted to Associate biologist even though I had no college degree,"
good,Je travail entant qu'opérateur en chimie pour les cultures à dupont Cernay France
good,"Do not recommend, work is definitely rough and hard, but a good workplace with great people around you. During this job I learned how to endure work in hot weather and heat training."
good,"DuPont as a company is a great place to work. Compensation...vacation...benefits are all great. The problem is, in the Beloit location...you will never advance if you are not rubbing elbows with the right people. If you are a master of being fake and playing the game, you will do great. If you are a real, honest worker, that just wants to do your job and go home...they will make your life miserable. You will never advance, you will never have opportunity for growth. They also make everybody work odd shifts that have to rotate so work/life balance is not great."
good,"When I cam in, I was made sure that i was given enough knowledge to learn about the business which the company was doing and from there on i was asked to pick and get the thongs together. "
good,"If you are looking for a great company to grow within, this is it!"
good,I've had many Friends and Family members that worked and still work there.  The company still tries to keep everyone safe.  There is the need to stay competitive.  It would be great if companies would value their experiences worker longer and continue to keep them employable.  The investment in ALL employee should be appreciated.
good,"Equal opportunity for everybody , fun place and good to learn, pay on time ,no need to wait,user friendly,Nice environment,easy to access,learn more,lots of companies,easily get call."
good,"This is an outstanding company to work for.  There is a focus on safety, people and the business.  There are clear objectives communicated and a great Team environment to maximize productivity."
good,Lots of turnover in upper management over the years.  Job security is there due to sold out business.  The pension was taken away in 2007 so new hires have to use 401k to plan retirement.

good,"I really liked working for Dupont, I meet a lot of great people. It was really a good job but not the best pay compared to other plants in the area. If the pay would have been better u couldn't have had a better job"

good,"Excellent work environment, great teamwork, safety awareness, performeed safety duties: weekly, daily, and quarterly, cross training in many position at job."
good,Great company!  Recent merger with Dow Chemical has set the company up to dominate many industries.  Science is a passion of mine  and I loved working in R&D.
good,"I would go back to work with Dupont in a heartbeat, I tried to get rehired at two location, Charleston, SC and Fayetteville, NC with no luck. It was a great place to work with a competitive salary. It provided excellent benefits however, they were better when I was 1st hired. Over the years they were still good just not as good.  I received my degree while at Dupont and they paid for every dime. As I said before I would gladly accept an opportunity to work with Dupont again."
good,L'utilizzo della lingua inglese cosi come il contatto con tutte le società internazionali e i lavori di statistica sono stati un punto positivo per la mia crescita professionale

good,Enjoy working there a lot. I've learned a lot of the job field. Very friendly people. Everyone at work is willing to help you learn and become the best you can be
good,I learned through working here that staying positive and motivated will increase the quality of the work you are doing. In return this will open more opportunities on the job for more hours and benefits.The hardest part was definitely walking the corn fields all day in the heat. Enjoyable part was the accomplishment at the end of each day.
good,I would still be working for this company today if they were trading. The parent company Dupont Corporation divested the coatings division and sold it to a hedge fund on the USA stock exchange. They reappeared in a significantly reduced capacity under a new name. Most Australian employees resigned. My division was closed.
good,The EMEA manager is very supportive and encourages me to follow my gut concerning a particular project. I manage my region and understand the market to implement an effective sales and marketing strategy. My team support me to ensure sales targets are met. Business 2 Business sales is something I focus on to increase market share.
good,"Over all this is a great place to work, very friendly people working there, willing to help you out when needed. I only worked there a couple of weeks, and I loved it. Its not a job that I would like to be dedicated to my whole life that is why I havent gone back but the management and employees are great. I learned a couple things bout the corn that they grow there and it was just an over all nice experience."
good,"I really enjoyed this autonomous role working across web, social media, pr, content creation.  A great team that is focused on 'getting the job done'.  I am sorry to be leaving due to cost cutting ahead of the DuPont / Dow Chemicals merger."

good,"Visita as principais revendas da região, depois a ir ao campo fazer avaliações nos campos de soja, conversa com produtores e final de tarde palestra ou eventos similares sobre os produtos da marca DuPont. Quando comecei na DuPont eu tinha acabo de me formar e aprendi muito principalmente além de orientar os produtores e a saber ouvi-los suas reclamações e conhecimentos. Quanto aos colegas  de trabalho sempre tive ótimo relacionamento. A parte mais difícil é o primeiro acesso ao produtor que alguns são muitos desconfiados. "

I also learned to utilize the computer for record keeping of different raw materials, also getting DOT trained, and certified. Management in my department was pretty poor, and most my co-workers were very helpful in all aspects of the job. The hardest part of the job was getting equal work ethics from one member of my department. Lastly the most enjoyable part of my job was working outside, and being trusted to get all my daily duties done in a timely manner."
good,"I've had a fantastic experience at DuPont.  I have had the opportunity to develop valuable skills, tangibly contribute to the business, and work with excellent people."

good,"Du Pont is one of the leaders in the Chemical Industry. The motto that stuck with ALL workers is "" SAFETY FIRST ""- i.e. no job is that important or that vital that we have to compromise safety. Du Pont is well advanced , ahead of other Companies in Science , because of the emphases on Research and Development. All workers are encouraged to put in their best without undue pressure coming from anywhere, something similar to a honor program. Training is a very important aspect. If or when one is in doubt, all one needs to do is ask a colleague, Supervisor etc. Re-training will be provided if anyone needs it to make every worker feel confident and comfortable.."

This includes the shop floor to the top floor, ensuring systems are interacting correctly to process and deliver critical information to end users.

good,Productive and sometimes fun place to work. It was a mixed bag. Never did the same thing from day to day.  Management often would change their minds about the rates we should run the units.
good,"Paid more the more experience you have, DuPont Pioneer was an excellent company to work for. It is hard, but rewarding work. You get up very early in the morning and work until mid afternoon, but are paid a healthy amount."

O mais difícil do trabalho era o horário, pois eu fazia segundo turno, então, trabalhava até as 23:45 de segunda a sábado, mas trabalhava com bastante satisfação."
good,"Foi uma experiência ótima para o crescimento profissional, me identifiquei com as atividades e gostaria de continuar no cargo, porém devido ao processo de fusão isso ainda não se concretizou."

good,"Een werk dag begint met werk verdelen en voorbereiden .kalibraties , standaarden lopen enz."
good,"Typical work day varied. I learned how to be flexible and adaptable with great leadership in co-workers who mentored me. The hardest part of the job was being in a large company promotions with a job title change, bonuses, and rewards were hard to come-by or earn.

good,Dupont used to be a great place to work at but over time things have changed. HR department no longer on site all questions that need to be answered are now through the phone.

good,"Making sure I get all my supplies ready to start my day, and I've learn how to run floor machines, I really liked working for this company before it the building was knocked down I enjoy coming to work everyday the workers were very pleasant we all worked as a team."
good,The big downfall of the St. Joseph plant is that it can’t act on major decisions until they hear from the guys above them. Because of this employees are left guessing what will happen next week.

good,A DuPont é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar. Valoriza os funcionário e tem bons benefícios. O ambiente é mais informal que a maioria das empresa e ela dá bastante flexibilidade para os funcionários. O ponto ruim é que não dá muita oportunidade para você conhecer outras áreas e se movimentar entre as vagas internas.
good,"Pretty great pay for the field that Dupont Pioneer is located in, pun intended. My only issue with working there is it doesn't feel like the individual is valued there. Definitely feel like a big corporation and the hiring process is tedious with a phone interview being the first of 2-3 steps. Hiring freezes and layoffs don't seem untypical for this company but it's been awhile since Ive been there so I may not have the current story correct."
good,I really enjoyed working here I just would like to be hired on permanent. Pay is really nice and don't really have anyone on you bugging they let you do your job. they take the time to train you correctly.

good,"I only worked at pioneer as a summer job so I don't know much about the benefits provided. Very good Co-workers fun and great to get along with. Working on summer crew at pioneer has taught me how to be a boss to younger employees. My management was very understanding and very good at helping you understand your job better. The hardest part of the job was being in the heat because you're out in a field all day everyday, and there isn't breeze in the corn."
good,"Es muy buena , empresa sobre sale los valores humanos y el buen trato , tanto de la gerencia como el de los compañeros de trabajo !"

good,I loved that I had the ability to move around and the challenge behind the job was fun and motivating. Had I not relocated I would more than likely still be working for this company.
good,"DuPont is an excellent company.  The managers are fair, technically very sharp, and wonderful to work for.  The work is never boring.  As long as you meet your deadlines you can work on whatever you want."
good,Good place to work with good benefits. Liked working with people.
good,"We were a high performance team, accomplishing a lot in a short window. "

The management and the human resource team is an add-on for an employee for all  the pros and cons while they been hired till they exit. And the transport facility is excellent especially for an women employee."
good,"We had a unique work environment, It was named High Performance Work system. It essentially was a Team based work system with each operator managing themselves and others. It also required working in several different roles for the business needs. We were extensively involved in the day to day operations whether it was the chemical, mechanical or the operational role we were always prepared to fill in where needed."
good,Great company to work for. Was able to move up at a far rate had a good mentor. Flexible work schedule with compatible pay. Great benefits. Definitely recommend.

good,"Core values are good and are followed as well,"
good,"I worked there for under 90 days due to a mix up with a choice I had made. I planned on making a career out of the Remington DuPont as an operator but things just didn't work out. I made a mistake with medical paper work unrelated to the job and wanted to work, so it came back and bit me in my butt. But anyways, the Centrolex supervisor is an awesome guy. He is a great leader and I would have taken a bullet for him. Unfortunately when my incdent occured, he wasn't there, so it was too late to be fixed. The Centrolex ""lead"" operators are also really good people. One in particular is very cool and very knowledgable. He always helped me and was willing to guide me through my learning process. They also do a very great job of orientation. They make sure you have all the resources you will need once you hit the floor and start working. The Training Coordinator has something good going out there. If I could go back in time and fix the mistake, I would! If you have an opportunity here, take it!"
good,"DuPont is a good  place to work, I learned a lot by working in every Department of the Plant. Most enjoyable was the experience I gained working with so  many different people.

good,This is a good company to work for and if you are looking to make a good amount of money then this is the place. Your co-workers are hit and miss. The hardest part of the job is the rotating schedule and the work atmosphere you have to work in. You work with molten alkaline metal and it is extremely hot.
good,"DuPont was a great place to work. The pay was amazing and the hours were definitely easy to work through. Although management structure wasn't amazing, overall I would rate my time there as a positive experience."
good,It's a very good company which takes care of employees. It's objective towards safety and core values. Best company to work for ...

Great pay (weekly),Friendly staff and friendlier coworkers. I just loved the environment of the job. Just stay hydrated because the heat is no joke."

Aprendí  sobre herramientas en excel, a trabajar con equipos de trabajo diferentes cada día, sobre comunicación efectiva, sobre herramientas tecnológicas, entre muchas otras cosas. El equipo de personas que trabajan todo el año es muy bueno, te enseñan y explican, te integran al equipo y trabajan codo a codo con uno. Lo más difícil a ratos puede ser el manejo de grupos humanos y las relaciones humanas en general, uno nunca deja de aprender sobre este aspecto. Y lo que más me gustó del trabajo fue la combinación de trabajar en sala, oficina y terreno; uno termina trabajando y aprendiendo sobre distintas etapas y perspectivas del proceso."

Having all the quotations, the next step is analyze which vendor needs to award the order/project then have it approved by the sourcing head. Once approved, purchase order will be generated and send it to the vendor. Tract deliveries and follow finance for the payment. I learned all this in my current position.

good,"With a company as large as DuPont it's hard to make broad generalizations. I'd say that the company will be a state of flux for the next 5-10 yrs easily. You can get great experience as long as you network properly and keep ahead of the curve."
good,"Productive ,challenging work place with excellent work ethics. Variety of jobs to qualify on for progressive wages. Safety is encouraged and part of employment responsibility. Training program is well planed and executed. Upcoming merger with Dow Chemical is anticipated as positive towards long term employment and also sets employees to be cautious toward the future. Health Insurance could be improved. Co workers are relative in age ,and each individual assist in physical and knowledge to assist new and progressing employees. Hardest part of the job is heat in summer months around steam lines ,although all lines are protected and insulated. Typical workday could consist of monitoring of equipment and gathering readings  for deficiencies. Or one could be tagging or detagging equipment after maintenance or before maintenance."

Three years later I went back to shift work as a Team Leader, which is entry level management. I learned when my boss was fishing, and to choose my words carefully. The best advice I received was to ""make friends"" with the thirty three employees I was responsible for. I take a genuine interest in my employees and familiar with their home lives. I learned to follow the rules. This has kept me out of trouble many times, and I learned to ask for input from my superiors.

DuPont was my training ground as a young engineer.  Their field engineering program gave me exposure to many different product technologies, and their Safety culture was unparalleled.  Management strongly enforced and supported a safe working environment.  I felt safe and learned so much...and this led to my contributing significant business value.

They provided me with extensive sales training, they pushed me daily to grow as a sales person, and they provided me with the freedom to use my own creativity to establish customer relationships. The co-workers were excellent and a strong team atmosphere was established at the very beginning of my time with DuPont. The hardest part of this job would have to have been my lack of agricultural knowledge at the start. I actually had zero agriculture background, nor did I take any agriculture based classes in school. Throughout training and on the job experience I was able to grow my knowledge of the industry and now consider myself reasonably educated within the agriculture industry. I enjoyed many parts of the job, but the most enjoyable would have to be the relationships that I built and the ability to provide a product that benefited the customer as well as DuPont as a company. This position introduced me to the Sales industry and showed me that I have a real passion for building relationships and ultimately for sales."

good,"My progression through the Company was pretty normal for the 80s. I came up through the ranks, as they say. After being promoted in 1990, my typical day's work was never the same from day to day. As the Facility Admin I was responsible for all personnel and equipment within each facility. In this function, I did everything from overseeing the Janitorial staff, to writing and preparing Lockouts, overseeing all Maintenance tasks,coordinating all personnel moves in my assigned areas, ordering supplies and preparing weekly reports. I was the person everyone called when something went wrong, no matter what. Obviously some days were better than others. The hardest part for me was when I couldn't satisfy someone's needs. My most enjoyable job was my final one in Site Housing,I was able to transfer in 2008. I had always been on the Dept. side and was now at the Site Level. I had various areas that I was responsible for which included making sure that each employee's move was scheduled in a timely manner, coordinating their telephone service and any furniture moves that individual may need. I was also responsible for all of my areas' facility floorplans. I was trained in both Aperture and CAFM (Computer Aided Facility Management). I also had to resolve facility floorplan and other personnel issues. In addition, I worked on many Special Projects. I have always enjoyed helping people and for 20 years, that's exactly what I did and that's where my greatest satisfaction came from, no matter how small or large the task. I was very fortunate that I always had good Management. I went to work"

good,"The company offered good benefits, and facilities. It focused on training individuals so they could perform a responsibility as well as possible."
good,"I loved working fro this company. This is a company that believes that their employers have lives outside of work, and they respect that. Therefore, family men and women who work for DuPont can feel comfortable knowing that they can still be family-oriented and be a great worker at DuPont. DuPont has strong moral values. I have never felt more comfortable and secure in my job than when I was with DuPont. They also strongly oppose micro-management because they believe, as most employees would agree, that it degrades employee morale and demotivates even the best of employees. Therefore, you never have to worry about a manager breathing over your shoulder all the time. Instead, they assume that you know your responsibilities ahead of time, and as long as you complete them in a reasonable amount of time, you will always have job security."
