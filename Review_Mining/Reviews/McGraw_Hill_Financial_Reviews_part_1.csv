bad,"Empresa que no se preocupa de su principal recurso que son las personas. Mal trato, bajos recursos, no se las recomiendo a los profesionales que quieran proyectarse."
bad,"S&P is the hub of multi tasking , No body has time time think of smart work. Wall street culture of rude and mean.  There is no place for good people. Better think and join."
bad,"I will not be rating companies for you. If you would like them rated, please do that yourself. Enough of this nonsense. Get your act together, this is terrible."
bad,"I worked at McGraw Hill a long time ago.  Cannot comment on present leadership or management.  At the time it was a good place to work.  Slow paced, corporate environment."
bad,enjoyed my time there...and looking forward to next phase of my career. had a great time...enjoyed the people and atmosphere.
bad,I do not know about the current management so I really am not able to comment on this company at this juncture. I left while there were many changes.
bad,"Ok place to work at."
bad,I worked for the vice president & 4 directors a nice place to work
bad,jobs out sourced. too frequent hire and fire Tell us about:
bad,"Work/life balance: It is only on paper for people to look at. Once you try to use these benefits, they will become performance issues."
bad,"I worked for McGraw-Hill Education as a summer intern and the experience did exactly what it was supposed to do. It taught me a lot about life. I came in during a ""reconstruction period,"" which means management was calling employees into conferences rooms by the tens and firing them. Some people received severance packages, but it was extremely sad. When I started, I wasn't really taught anything or how to do my job, I had to jump in. I wasn't given the materials that other interns were given. I understand that I had to take initiative, but I didn't even have the basics such as style and grammar books. Everything I did and learn was solicited. The aura was dog-eat-dog. Them editors were very smug and bitter. The management acted like doing their job was a favor to you. My peers were like chickens with their heads cut off, which meant I had to pick up a lot of the slack. One the interns even killed himself, there after. Before I started I thought that working there was my dream job, but knowing what I know now, I am glad they were on a hiring freeze when I graduated."
bad,"Our dept was very micro managed with managers who watched your ever move. They watched if you were 2 minutes late and kept a time sheet on you. They are supposed to the be the one of the top 100 companies to work for in the USA for women. No way. I forgot to say, we were all salary. Our department would not let you work at home and would not let you change your hours due to child care issues or having children. I did meet alot of nice people. Several people in our department had nothing to do, so we were put on special projects on downtime. I think it is a good place to work but all the managers have different styles. Our boss had to know everything you were doing from you shoes, clothing to what time you arrived. He had someone who would report everything to him from within our department and she would do it over email. So you would find out about it later. Even if you were talking about something that was not her business."
bad,"The compensation and increments are less compared to other MNC's. "
bad,"S&P Global, which is a sought after company for those dealing in financial information, IT-enabled services and business journalism, doesn’t have a good recruitment process at its Gurgaon office. Employees are hired without paying much attention to their skills and experience to see if they are best suited for the job. At the top of it, they are not given any orientation or training to perform their job role in the desired manner. And, constant scrutiny makes things worse for those who are grappling with lack of tactical support to gain confidence."
bad,"I thought the Mcgraw Hill companies would be a wonderful place to work and retire from someday. Boy, was I wrong. It is way too top heavy with too many directors, managers, supervisors and so on. They do not appreciate you as an employee or as an individual and the favortism never seems to end. How they can eliminate american jobs and give them to india is beyond my comprehension. But then again, when the big people make so much, there is no regard for the little people. This was a great company back in the day and now it is being run into the ground. After 16 years of being employed, doing a wonderful job I was also discarded without a blink of the eye."
bad,"Awful cut-throat culture -- the salary is the only reason to stay.  They're outsourcing 60% of their jobs, so you will not last long.  I was there 10+ years, I know what I'm talking about."
bad,In the process of splitting into two distinct companies. One focusing on their education business and the other on their Financial services.
bad,I am still traumatized by working there.
bad,"repetitive packaging of material, tedious work, redundant, Same thing over and over. Management did not worry about the employees and did not check on them"
bad,"Company frequently reorganizes, leadership changes frequently. Many legacy processes and platforms that were not adequately supported."
bad,"Very poor executive management, completely devoid of ethics or integrity. High degree of favoritism and cronyism to the extent not seen in most other companies."
bad,S&P has a strong brand name but Ratings division Mgmt is weak and not strategic. Very short sighted and lack long term vision. People are quite nice and collaborative. Good place to retire but not grow your professional career.
bad,the company is going through a transformation. The recruitment function has been outsourced. The entire department has been re-organized.
bad,The company is outsourcing a lot of jobs overseas. The was a good company until they decided to outsource jobs.
bad,"No raises, old-boy network, everything is based on time in, not performance. Many employees do not posses any degree's or certifications. After graduating from school with my degree and working in the field for 5-6 years. I was placed in a warehouse role an advised to pursue a forklift position. I was also told I could re-apply for the job I was hired for when there is another opening. Why, I was the last to be hired in. This was also done to many other good employees who also decided leave Arrow."
bad,"Company outsourcing everything they can, employees with over 30 years have been let go.  Many changes in senior management with new ideas."
bad,"very unorganized management, waited a whole day for pages to load, they were not knowledgeable about how many employees they needed for their work load, poor work plan and organization"
bad,"Consultant company that always puts the client first."
bad,"Promotional and News Graphic designer"
bad,"Public Speaking, Management, Power Point, Excel, Word"
bad,"In my estimation this company lacks the management and technical tools to effectively create the necessary work environment for motivated and progressive professionals. They also have great expectations whe it comes to great delivery, but fail in pay. I hear the benefits are ok, I haven't yet used them to know."
bad,"S&P is basically  a boring place. Outdated systems and everybody is busy with managing themselves instead of getting their work right. Good if you look for an easy job without challenges, if you want to develop yourself and your career - leave quickly"
bad,A safe job with little progression opportunities and mundane work. Pay is stingy and managers are incompetent and back stabbers. Only work here to get the name on your CV.
bad,"Great brands, colleagues and clients, but no innovation, lackluster management, lots of uncertainty and no marketing.  Hard to get things done.  Limited support.  Lots of silos."
bad,"This company was a great company to work ,now it just a job. I have lost all of my passion for it,now I am working for a paycheck."
bad,Worked at S&P for A year and recommend not to apply for it ever.  The pay is very low as well as the work they do is also not very good. Not at all satisfied with any thing over there.
bad,"Company reorgs constantly at the whim of whatever new business initiative someone woke up with that month. Tough to keep up with the flip-flop of concentrations and attempts to catch up to softwares already in use elsewhere."
bad,Don't believe what recruiters tell you about unlimited sick days and flex work hours as promised by recruiters no work/life balance be ready to work on weekends. Long work hours and unrealistic deadlines. Your benefits wont start till after a month if your lucky it took me almost 2 months to get everything setup and I was working in HR.
bad,"I do not recommend this organization to anyone who is looking for stable employment, professional advancement over time, or a career that endures for more than a few years."
bad,"Planned and managed daily operations for a distribution center operated by one of the world’s largest companies that designs and publishes a variety of educational media (print, electronic/digital, software, CD/DVD) for delivery to school districts throughout Texas and California.  Coordinated supply chain management with Supervisors in 6 other corporate facilities nationwide.  The DeSoto facility measures 220,000 sq. ft., ranks second largest among 7 U.S. corporate centers, and ranks No. 1 for productivity by shipping 12+ million units annually."
bad,"Except for the large south-facing window, office space is dull, spartan, and lacks the amenities you'd expect from an established and successful company. Management is functional, but at times petty, chauvanistic, sour, unwilling to teach, unwilling to be taught, and generally lacks knowledge of financial markets & investments."
bad,"The employee benefits and generous lifestyle accommodating working conditions sees a large portions of employees working from home, long weekends off, taking time off for outside duties, flexible start finish times."
bad,"Hard to get hired on if you did't have relative working for McGraw hill."
bad,"typical seasonal position"
bad,Terrible management seen in all groups - old managers that are dinosaurs and unwilling to change or open a book made in the last 20 years on management skills
bad,No career pathing but a steady 9-5 job. Management has been overhauled a few times and institutional data has been lost. Luck plays a big growth in growth opportunities.
bad,"Desk bound for 7 and 1/2 hrs per day, the need to maintain productivity and quality were upheld at the cost of soft-skills."
bad,"- Multiple projects at anytime"
bad,Lack of strategy and direction hampered the company's ability to compete in a declining market. Great products and great people but weak executive leadership.
bad,"I would not recommend this place for a permanent place to work, this is a good place to get a year or two in experience if you're coming out of college or looking to get into the field but this company is not interested in furthering your carreer, I've been here almost 10 years and have come to realize that when it comes to work ethics it's all a show. This company does what they want no matter how many people they get to say different, I guess it's part of a private company way of doing things. The benefits are great but to permanently work here I would never advice it. Save yourselfs and find something more suitable adn family oriented than the corporate sector of this way ward country. It's to politically corrupted to see good people for what they are rather than just a product to get another product out."
bad,"S&P used to be focused on grooming employees (managers and direct reports) to manage larger responsibilities. It used to be a place that cared about the business and its needs."
bad,"An important position grading nationwide standardized testing. A management team who obviously cared about the future of America's children and a progressive work culture, yet, seasonal and temporary employment with no guarantees of work."
bad,Environment is decent enough.  No cafeteria but plenty of possibilities around.  Management seems to lurch from one ill-conceived idea to the next with no foloow-through.
bad,"It was a job. Nothing special about it except that I made good friends. Pay was awful, but what else should I have expected? Hours were consistent and breaks were fair."
good,It was a pretty easy job. It served its purpose as far as compensation. It was too short of an assignment and should provide more job security.
good,"The company has lost its way; it once was a fabulous place to work, but has become a slave to ""shareholder value,"" rather than quality. There is no security, and no respect for hard work."
good,They hire through a temp agency and it takes an average of two years to get hired permantely to work for McGraw-Hill.
good,"quarterly vat returns"
good,"Too many re-orgs, too much middle-management, not enough empowerment"
good,Ever changing and challenging. Frequent leadership changes..... In the midst of transforming to an operating company. Numerous operational challenges.
good,"McGraw Hill Financial (NYSE: MHFI) is a leading financial intelligence company providing the global capital and commodity markets with independent benchmarks, credit ratings, portfolio and enterprise risk solutions, and analytics."
good,I've worked here on and off for about 6-8 years. It's not bad for seasonal work. They pay reasonably. There is no chance for advancement or benefits. Management isn't bad.
good,"It started out your typical corporate environment lot's of people were upset about the end of the pension program a few years back, as a millennial I never even considered the possibility.  Your future (past 3-5 years) here will be largely determined by your ethnic background;"
good,"Most people that work there do not know or speak to each other, Management is indifferent. Bottom line driven and very little company culture or memory,"
good,"I had a great manager which made my job a lot nicer. i was a per diem, which means i was the first on the totem pole to get no work when the  budget was really low."
good,"As S&P Global continues to acquire companies and grow, they continue to pack as many people in to one office as possible.  Management refuses to acquire new space and has continuously remodeled the same floor to pack more employees in to one floor.  The work spaces are cramped and the noise level in the office makes it impossible to focus on work tasks."
good,Ambiente laboral normal con horario compatible con la vida privada.
good,Overall the company's ethic's and how they treated the employers was hard to overcome for very little pay.
good,"Depending upon the group you work in, management can be extremely dysfunctional. Hours and pay tend to be reasonable. Definitely not a place to go if you are looking to build a career. The company is HIGHLY regulated both by external and internal forces. Expect to spend a significant amount of time doing paperwork for all roles including Associate, Associate Director, Director, and Senior Director levels. In short, don't expect to stay too long. It's fine for a temporary holdover while you're waiting for something better to come along."
good,"Very heavy micro-managing which caused delays in project completion."
good,"Limited potential for growth depending on group, great opportunities to develop analytical skills, continuous process improvements. I would recommend this company."
good,Some of the Senior management did not show maturity of their role. Some teams were not very well collaborative.Really good technology stacks and utilized distributed architecture. Therefore good technical exposure.
good,Not a fun place to work although they pay well. Everyone looking for other jobs. Management constantly changing strategies.
good,"Sat in a large conference room with 250 to 300 computers.  Everyone working together.  Team leaders were assigned and those were the people we could ask questions or get help.  Each test had a read-behind and we were asked periodically to review these."
good,"The day generally flew by, working at the call center many members would call in daily for assistance. Being short staffed meant having to wear many hats at times."
good,Working environment was great.  Co-workers for the best.  Building was nice.  Product was outstanding.
good,This was once a great place to work for until 4 -5 years ago when it became clear they were determined to outsource us.
good,"I have a large workload of contracts that get processed into the system on a day to day basis. Ive learned the different legal terminologies, how to look for errors in a contract, the sales process amongst other things. My co-workers are nice people who are team workers. The hardest part of the job sometimes can be having the same contract issue with the same sales rep(s). The part I  most enjoy about my job is learning what the other business units do in order to have the contracts ready to send them over to me for processing. Also, getting to train a new employee."
good,"Its one of the good place to work"
good,"S&P has afforded me the opportunity to learn a great deal about finance and accounting, but opportunities for advancement have been rare, and based as much on personal connection as professional merit. Reinvestment of profits, which continue to soar, continue to shift from employee to executives and shareholders."
good,"The company is a financial firm with a Wall Street mentality. However, it is old-school and somewhat set in its ways. Career advancement is difficult and raises are small."
good,"We can learn new things with Learning Exchange."
good,"stress full no appreciation of good work lack of management support duplication of work "
good,"when revenue and ""street"" opinion are positive, material, impactful and necessary changes become more difficult. Cultural environment on constant flux and politized"
good,"Great company to work for, I learned so much from my time there."
good,Few opportunities for advancement.  Lacked strategic direction. Too many changes in senior leaderhship.llaskdjflksajfaslkfjaslkjflaskjflsajflksajkldfasjlfjas
good,"McGraw-Hill was an environment defined by individual accountability. A large organization where responsibilities are clearly defined and contributors understand their roles and how these roles support and effect the larger goal of producing best-of-breed content for specific market segments. "
good,"I've worked at McGraw Hill as a contractor. There are no benefits and no real guarantee of advancement. However, I am able to work from home which gives a great work/home balance."
good,"overall its good company, great way to start the career but it is not the place to stick to because career advancement is very slow,"
good,I have been there long enough to manage my own department and have an incredible amount of flexibility.  They do not pay competitively.
good,"I have been at Standard & Poor's for thirteen years and have been promoted over the years several times.  The management structure is very tall and heavy.  The people that I work with are genuine, good people that do not treat the job as a revolving door but as a career."
good,Great work/life balance.  Advance quickly; however glass ceiling was reached very quickly.
good,My position at McGraw-Hill as a Learning Solutions Specialist was eliminated as of 12/31/13. I enjoyed what I did and my co-workers were great.
good,Enjoyed the brief time I had with them but felt opportunities were limited. Unable to search for options/jobs easily. 
good,Cool easy place to gain experience n call center but please pay attention to your checks & commission because they have a lot of errors and delays n checks and things that’s not acceptable for no one who wants to get paid one time
good,The work place is good but culture is not well. The internal management is not good due to they dominate the lower level employess and not giving them a minimum values.
good,I m working here since 9 months. Company work culture is good. But when u talk about growth prospects it is pathetic. Management is bad. No encouragement from senior level to do something new to enhance your knowledge. Promotion criteria is bad. For technical background student this is not good.
good,Their compensation is good and the people that they hire tend to be really talented. They grow by acquisition which is both interesting and challenging. It seems as if they have been fortunate in the people who they gain by acquisition as most stay and do well
good,"lack of talent management. hard to move frwd"
good,There have been a lot of changes at S&P. Some good such as building leaders and helping employees gain different skills however leadership doesn't value necessary value those skill sets.
good,"I worked at S&P for two years as a Financial language editor. You get to work in a multicultural environment, with benefits such as performance bonuses, but there is no actual room for professional growth. The hardest part of the job was the monotonous work. The best part: the people I worked with - it was a really nice team."
good,"Working for S&P can be highly rewarding, in terms of the markets you interact with and the deals that come through the door. However, the organization is in the midst of wrestling with life as a newly-regulated entity, and it's not handling it well. It put a lot of nonsensical bureaucracy into place very quickly to comply with Dodd-Frank, and improving the basic  processes of getting things done is going to take a long time."
good,"I would still be employed with this company if our department hadn't been sold to a competitor and the office closed.  The office culture was amazing, work/life balance.  I'll never have a job this good again!"
good,"Good pay for the easy job that need to be done. Can get 35 hours or more, fast pace job Company tends to show favoritism to employees which causes problems"
good,Time wasting\distracting co-workers.  Sat next to people who were very social and had nothing to do with my project.  No job security.
good,Organisation going through significant transformation in all Lines of Business.
good,"On every project I have been on the supervisors and team leaders work their tails off to get it done on time and done with the customers standards in mind. The higher ups don't seem to care about the customer. They just want the project early for their bonus and the large things the customer wanted done well. Other than that, the details that are needed for the projects, are thrown out the window. Also if something goes wrong it's automatically the supervisors fault, even if the supervisors kept telling management that their plan was not going to work."
good,"Advancement within the organization is not appreciated. "
good,Training was given on an on the fly basis and usually after you had not done something correctly
good,My time at S&P is very rewarding.  However I am looking for a job closer to home as the commute into NYC is becoming more difficult.  I enjoy working as a team and I do get that with S&P.
good,"Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC is a U.S. financial services company. It is a division of S&P Global that publishes financial research and analysis on stocks, bonds, and commodities."
good,The CEO did not want me to improve his financial statements. He was totally wrong. The financials did not properly reflect the financial condition of the company.
good,"structured work environment but low growth overall"
good,It has been a few years so not sure what to say I do not know why indeed will not let me skip this company for accuracy but they will not. Got to love bad bots
good,Lots of work with few people.  Needs new processes and internal systems so resources are a bit overworked.  But this means there are lots of opportunities.
good,"Not much room for advancement.  Learned lots of skills but the organization has changed many times over since being there, which doesn't foster a lot of confidence in job security."
good,"The work serves a real purpose in the capital markets.  The analysts are diligent and honest (but not perfect).  That said, I loved my time there."
good,My management team was the best part of this job. The work was a bit boring but I appreciated the opportunity to work independently. My insurance was great.
good,"McGraw-Hill Education was a great place to work. I had the best supervisor I had ever worked for the first 5 years I was there. Then I had the worst supervisor I had ever worked for the last 5 years. With the changing pace of ""books"" in today's society I don't know if the job would be better now or not. I do know they closed the office in DeSoto, TX and moved it to Ohio. There are a few agents working from home."
good,"Loved the work. Was part of a good team. Build many relationships. Too many management changes. Had 3 bosses in 12 months. No stability within senior management."
good,the job was great but  i had to handle a lot of the work load and wasn't getting paid well i would have to put in 10hr shifts 5days out the week with out lunch break at times
good,It is pretty laid back working here and with decent work life balance. Located in downtown so not much good meal/coffee options. Employee benefit is okay.
good,Standard & Poor's (S&P) is the world's leading index provider and the foremost source of independent credit ratings. Standard & Poor's has been providing financial market intelligence to decision makers for more than 150 years.
good,"The culture of the company has been changing as it is going through organizational transformation. Management could be more effective and efficient in breaking down silos, and be more aligned across different teams/business units. Improve work-life balance, and offer more career advancement opportunities for employees."
good,base pay offered is not what I was expecting considering they are a global corporation. good benefits I guess compared to some employers out there....
good,the most enjoyable part of the job  was the interaction I had with the people I worked with  on a day to day basis. the hardest part of the job was not being unable to promote and pay the associates who worked in my group fairly. The workplace culture was excellent most preformed and completed their daily tasks in a timely manner.
good,The position I had with this company is no longer available. The company lost the contract to Pearson after the assignment that I had with them. So therefore I would recommend going to Pearson or another company for a similar position.
good,Once CTB was purchased by DRC everything changed.   I loved working for CTB.   I learned a lot from a lot of wonderful people.   I will always cherish my clients and the friends I made at CTB
good,As  product manager working with the Business Process team was pretty decent. There wasn't much room to grown within the group but the job security was always there.
good,"Very poor work environment, But some people are good. Nepotism, favouritism, bullying and secrecy.. Very poor team work .. But depends on managers. IT is terrible."
good,"good company with great benefits. Lot of changes are underway, technology and business divisions has major impacts. Consolidation happening across all divisions."
good,The smartest people I've ever met.  Very nice work environment.  But problems with upper management (like most places).   Work day is busy and pleasant.  I had a great team-got a lot of things done and really enjoyed doing it.
good,It was an easy going work environment.  The planroom was located inside of BPI.  I was responsible for processing and checking in all new project and make sure all the information was up-to-date.  My favorite part of the job was when contractors would stop in and check out the blueprints for jobs that they were interested in bidding on.    Some days were very slow when no new blueprints were being shipped.
good,"Learn how to provide good customer service with basic configuration on Laptop and users home network."
good,"I was hired as a contract worker. I really enjoyed learning about how to write manuscripts and to edit them. I loved the fact that I was still involved in education, only I was helping write the textbooks that the students would use."
good,Left the company over 10 years ago.  The business and leadership has changed significantly since I left the company.  I am not able to provide any insight.
good,good work life balance. good reputable company and strong brand recognition in the market. Company is value and growth driven and make all necessary changes to do that.
good,"Good place to start.  Learn a lot of ins and outs of the business.  Great name recognition.  There are a lot of changes happening, which can be good or bad, however you look at it."
good,"Opportunity to lean about many areas of the business. But as with any large company it can be difficult to move quickly or get decisions made."
good,"I nurtured new and existing client relationships, allowing me to align their needs with my company insuring positive growth for all parties, short and long-term.  I conceptualized and executed strategies that generated quantifiable results for both my client and company."
good,"It was cool, they didn't pay me well at all.  I worked in a group with crazy dynamics so, at the end of the day most people tried to leave before they outsourced our team completely."
good,Lack of knowledge transfer by leaving employees led to unnecessary work and confusion. However talk of the use of new technology was a major factor employees stayed at their positions.
good,"not bad, numerous products. 45k base 20-30k commisions, persistence and dedication required. good start to a career. close to home fairly easy going, outdated building. not too bad 7/10"
good,"When I get into the office, I hit the ground running.  I start by reaching to my staff in India to see how their day went and what needs to be done by the evening shift.  I then reach out to my  Canadian staff and US staff.  I want to see how everyone is doing and if there are any issues that need to be talked about before they become bigger issues.  I've learned to deal with remote managing and how to do team building within different time zones.  My position at McGraw Hill has given me the opportunity to grow as a manager and be part of several Green Belt projects to learn how to be ""Lean""."
good,Its an great experience learn many new things.it was like an tutorial.
good,"A pleasant work environment. Must multi-task with numerous situations that need my attention."
good,"None, its a decent place to work at. Would not want to add anything more."
good,"One of the best- kept secret in new jersey, "
good,"Many great experiences. The facility closed and moved to Gahanna, Ohio."
good,There was no typical day at work while working for AFIG as no day was the same. There was always so much going on and an Facilities Manager of such a large company you are never at your desk.
good,"Heavy workload with definitive deadlines.  Highly educated people.  However, getting results and the process of meeting deadlines was challenging and demanded constant diligence."
good,I developed a great collaborative work effort with my co-workers.
good,"I have worked at MGH for 8 years and I find it a lovely place to work that fosters good relationships with co-workers, but there is little room for advancement within the company, and the nature of the publishing business is rapidly changing."
good,McGraw-Hill is a leader in print and electronic construction information. The company has several well-known brands.
good,S&P is a great start to anyone's culture..it helps you to manage stress and get strong in ups and downs.
good,"In was an excellent place to work. Too bad, I came on board short before whole IT infrastructure was decided to be outsourced. From that point on, it went down the drain."
good,It was a difficult culture to work in.  Many people spend their time managing up.  There was a great deal of  turnover and management change.  They offer great benefits.
good,I enjoyed working with the company all through my tenure.We can learn new things and good place to shape our career.One who starts career it is the best place to acquire knowledge.
good,"Good work/life balance, fast paced work environment, highly skilled co-workers, inspiring management and leadership, competitive salary and benefits, collaborative work culture"
good,It was a great opportunity to work for S&P Global. It is always fun loving to work in this organisation. The management is very good. They consider each and every things for career review.
good,"it wasn't a bad place to work but there was no advancement for my position."
good,Currently I believe that the leadership is lacking the ability to manage team appropriately.  There is for to much work for people to have a good work life balance.
good,"Secure place to work with good pay (for a Midwesterner) and challenging work. Ability to work from home often or even full-time. However, very much an ""old boys' network"" with little to no opportunity for upward advancement, as the company has adopted a lean management approach and will not promote unless someone above you leaves. Raises are less than inflation unless you get promoted, but bonuses are good."
good,"Exciting to meet people of diverse culture, become their friends and understand their language.  Typical work day was repetitive, but it was still fun."
good,"Good company to work for"
good,Working experience at MHFI depends on your current manager.
good,"At this Senior Executive position my primary daily job responsibilities were to train the new employees (evaluators) in the proper procedure for grading the various assessment testing tools (FCAT, ISTEP, ISTEP+, and other state academic assessment tests). Promoted from an Evaluator to the Operations Team Lead Project Manager. Maintained a 95% Correct Percentile Ratio for all evaluators for 6 consecutive years in Mathematics. Provided Mathematical data analysis and curriculum development for each Assessment Project. Supervised, monitored and evaluated a team of 20 staff members to ensure compliance with company policy, state and federal regulations. Served as Cross-functional Team Leader to ensure company maintained appropriate productivity for growth in our division."
good,"- Friendly work environment"
good,Option to telecommute part time or full time is a great benefit.
good,-always busy and always learning new things
good,"After many mergers and acquisitions, the company was not always a fun place to work.  It seemed like I had more than one boss in different states and countries, not just my manager.  Helping with client requests was the most rewarding part."
good,"I was very happy there for a year and when the company started growing exponentially, it lost the ""family owned"" feel it used to have. there was too much hostility about promotions within and the office became a constant competition. Owners were always wonderful, generous guys but their choice of middle management staff caused much turnover."
good,Descent work / life balance however lots of politics and barely any opportunity for growth. Compensation is quite moderate. Colleagues are nice and friendly.

good,Descent work / life balance however lots of politics and barely any opportunity for growth. Compensation is quite moderate. Colleagues are nice and friendly.
good,"Everything that would be expected from a large, well-known company. Competitive pay. Normal working hours."
good,S&P seems to click for some people.  These people are always sought after and move through the ranks quickly.  Other's can easily get lost in the organization and job advancement can be difficult.
good,"I came to S&P in September 1998 and worked there until May 2000, when I quit the firm. I was hired as a tech analyst and within 3 days was transferred to retail analyst. I did not mind this; I had just worked as a bankruptcy analyst in Boca Raton, FL and was very familiar with retailers because frankly they file for Ch 11 protection often, so I felt I knew a bit about the industry."
good,"Stable, predictable, fun, not particularly challenging work."
good,Benefits were great thought it would be a place to make a career until layoffs came.
good,"The work is interesting and allows you to learn a lot. People is also helpful and skilled."
good,Very hard workin job pays ok but i think they need to work on there staff
good,"I was an out bound costumer service agent. I called people that had gotten rid of their Rogers products in the past 5 years and tried to get them to come back to the company. I was selling home phone, internet and cable and at discount price so it would be more enticing. "
good,A company that promotes work-life balance by providing work schedule flexibility. Remote work is permitted only if authorized by an immediate supervisor.
good,"La cultura laboral es excelente, muchos extranjeros y compañeros muy amables. Los ascensos son super lentos y los salarios mas que insuficientes. Tiene horarios flexibles, 20 dias de estudio y la organizacion no esta mal. Esta bueno como para trabajar cuando estudias pero ya cuando te recibis tenes que conseguir otro trabajo con mejor paga. Hay descuento en gimnasio pero tenes que pagar bastante igual que no se siente un real descuento."
good,A very good place to work at. The work culture is good and the management allows good work life balance. Merger with SNL has brought reduced salary standards.
good,"This is a great credit union for people looking for a start as a teller. You will quickly learn about all of the various credit union products. The hours and locations are also great for students and working parents. The credit union has three locations in Manhattan which are easily accessible by multiple subway trains."
good,S&P as an organization has been going through constant restructuring for the past 3 years but nice people and place to work especially Ratings business.
good,"A typical day at McGraw-Hill Education would involve meeting with my peers, other Trainers to discuss leadership and upcoming events and travel plans (domestically / internationally). "
good,"I had the opportunity of participating in the start up of the offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was the platform and project manager of the units of credit risk management for Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay."
good,"Work environment is excellent."
good,They made me feel like I was part of the family and they really welcomed me to the company. I would love to work for this company again.
good,"I have learned about the education fields and about to sell in NYC."
good,This company is up for sale and the strategy lately is so dog eat dog that no one is working together o make progress this year in sales. We still have a job to do and it is difficult when people are fighting with each other to save thier jobs. We are very vulnerable at this point in time.
good,"This was a temporary position we were not entitled to the normal employee benefits, no paid time off even when I lost my Mother. I would have like to experience normal benefits"
good,Working at McGraw I meet a great bunch of people. I enjoyed establishing relationships with the instructors I supported. I gained the opportunity to become a work from home agent.
good,"~Inbound calls"
good,"Frequent Senior Management Changes, lack of direction in some groups."
good,"A typical day at S&P is always very busy. Many contracts that needed to be summarized and reviewed. Lots of client and sales rep interaction. I learn to deal with many different types of personality  and lots of deadlines. The workplace culture is good. However, there is always room for improvement. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the pressure that others are dealing with because of their deadlines. The most enjoyable part was working with all my wonderful coworkers and my awesome managers. I learn alot everyday."
good,Pretty good life-work balance in most groups but promotion/growth is very unlikely or at a very slow path. Compensation is not adequate.
good,Lack of leadership skills and foresight greatly limit the groups possibilities.  Feels like a large company run like a mom and pop shop
good,"Answer Phones"
good,various opportunities to grow and learn on a daily basis
good,"Frequent management changes, opportunity to learn, little growth, overall well respected organization, conservative in adopting new technology, reasonable benfits"
good,"I worked at S&P for seven years. It was a very good place to start as a financial analyst and the overall management was good. In addition, the compensation was fair."
good,"The educational system is a good place to work - but as a buyer of physical books, not so good. More schools are going electronic and the industry is having a hard time in keeping up with demands of poorer schools that need physical books and too many employees"
good,"It is perfect place to start your career, but you should not stay longer than 3 years if you wan to grow and have a successful career."
good,"S&P Global is a good environment for to learn the financial industry and to expand your financial career.  Co-workers are supportive, helpful and work together to achieve common goals."
good,Good work life balance but low compensation and a lot of turnover in management positions. No clear career path for Business Analysts due to the frequent turnovers of senior management in our group.
good,"Productive workplace, helpful peers, strike business hours, worked as a business analyst, managers were helpful and gave opportunity to work proactively"
good,"-good benefits"
good,the environment culture was good. the management level was helpful and cooperative also they adopted democratic leadership style. It increased my confidence level.
good,"Great people while I was there, bad crop came in at the end."
good,"great place; good structure in place. Plenty of change to keep you engaged - changes in business units, acquisitions of companies, dispositions of companies."
good,"buen ambiente, buenas condisiones, buenos compañeros"
good,"I would arrive at work go over whatever was priority on the list for the day.  I don't consider any job that I have had really hard. I would run reports and check for error, make any corrections and rerun the report.  Prepare equipment to be mailed the sites."
good,Empowerment to have impact from any level in rating committees. A great place to hone writing skills and learn about ratings and meet mid level to senior managements. travel and exposure are also good benefits.
good,"Its nice place to and great work culture"
good,"Working in the financial industry is both challenging and rewarding. "
good,"Good benefits, professional atmosphere, long work hours expected. Supportive management.  Location in New York City: terrific!"
good,"Did not offer full time position. "
good,"A typical day at work includes learning everything about an issuer. Additionally, when I travel I got to see new places. I was able to write for the company publication, which was somewhat enjoyable but had to be limited in scope."
good,"McGraw Hill Financial strives to continuously change its equipment, premises, hardware and software, systems and staff structure. If you are adaptable and looking to learn constantly then this is the right employer for you. The exposure you can potentially get is great."
good,It was nice to work with the company.The working environment was too good.The people surrounded their were so co-operative and friendly.
good,"A place to understand who you are and where you want to be. Either entry level or management, people are there to provide knowledge and create a sound work environment."
good,It's a first shift job. Have two 10 minutes breaks. 15 minutes in summer time. I have learned how to use tools. Also learned how to wire motors. Management teams are always there for you. Co-workers are friendly and funny. The hardest part would be the working environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work independently.
good,I worked in the warehouse as a pick/packer basically i had to pick books and pack them
good,The Work Environment is good. And The Co-Workers are friendly.
good,Great place to work with opportunities to learn about project management. Co-workers are very helpful and willing to guide you through a training process.
good,"Contacted customers regarding delinquent accounts in a call center."
good,"-Learned how accounting/reporting is done at the corporate level"
good,"The company has excellent products, some of which are enormouslty profitable, and you get to work with smart and (mostly) honest people"
good,enjoyed my tenure there. campus recruitment function was fun. I learned a lot.
good,1.Review today's plan and Task
good,Sane as any other company . Get in for a few years leave because its all the same
good,Structured code reviews contribute to successful migration of error-free code.
good,MHEducation has been a wonderful place to kick off my career. The benefits are great and I've made some great friends in my coworkers. The company is highly involved in the local community and there is lots of opportunity to participate in these activities.
good,"A typical day at work is to meet with and lead cross-functional teams in order to meet the strategic objectives of the firm for regulatory compliance purposes. After meeting with different teams, develop end-to-end processes and when necessary develop training sessions globally regarding the new regulations or changes."
good,The team atmosphere here is top-notch and lends itself well to completing projects on time.
good,"S&P is a great company to work for. The company is very socially conscious, aspires for great work-life balance. The company also pays well, including bonus. Its a very consensus driven culture which can sometimes be challenging for some folks."
good,"**This review is relevant to S&P Global Ratings IT and Data groups**"
good,"Frequent leadership changes, good work environment, reasonable pay, company is in a transition environment, opportunity to learn if you are pro active,"
good,"Company good and work also i am doing good."
good,Très belle entreprise pour travailler sur des missions de notation passionnantes
good,Fast paced cutting edge atmosphere.  Good scene of accomplishment at the end of the day. All offices use the most current and ergonomic office furniture.
good,I worked at S&P for ~10years and maintained a wonderful work/life balance.  The work environment was relaxed which made my workday very easy.  Mid-level managers were underdeveloped but co-workers were team oriented.  It was a wonderful experience working at S&P.
good,McGraw-Hill was once a wonderful company to work for.  Unfortunately most of the divisions and groups have been sold and the only division left is Standard & Poors.  S&P is a great place to work for but McGraw-Hill no longer exists.
good,"Its been a couple years since I worked at McGraw but it was a very professional, if not exciting, workplace going through a transitioning period."
good,Going through cultural changes. Change a lot in the eight years I worked there.  I personally liked it the old way but I am sure once it settles in it will not be too bad.
good,"Visiting and meeting with suppliers. Quarterly score card review meetings with vendors to review there performance. Reviewing daily summaries of individual supplier performance and sum reports comparing supplier doing the same or similar work to one another. Scheduling meetings with problem suppliers, who are consistently late or falling short of performance quotas and have quality problems."
good,Friendly but professional atmosphere of hard working individuals that get work done timely and efficiently. Very busy day to day operations coordinating with our global teams and working together to bounce off ideas problems issues as well as resolutions to better support the business deliver to the market. One of the hardest parts of the job besides IT constraints is the language barrier/understanding at times with our over seas counterparties. We work closely with the business to understand their needs and rely to Information technology department to be the liason to get enhancements implemented.
good,Employment is via Kelly Services and Temp.....Not a strong oppoutunity to be hired full time.
good,"Great company, however outsourced IT to an outsourcing firm."
good,"I've been employed with Standard & Poor's (A division of the McGraw Hill Companies) for 25 years and have recently lost my job as a result of a departmental outsourcing. My experience with the company has been mostly positive over the years. While I might not necessarily agree with some of the decisions made at the top levels, I understand and accept those decisions. I've had the benefit of working with some tremendously talented people in my career with the company. While with the company, I managed approximately 10 people. At times, it was a high pressure environment with strict goals that needed to be met (consistently). This was one of my favorite parts of the job as I work very well under pressure! I need to be moving fast and I do my best work under these conditions. Managing an in-house team that was responsible for ALL company receivables was not an easy task. I consider specialized collections an art form. The ability to negotiate (successfully) with high level clients at very prestigious firms (and for VERY large sums of money) can be very off-putting to some. For me and my team, it was a very rewarding experience!"
good,"great company and great benefits, regular hours, work from home.  Nice people "
good,"Quality work and very professional, experienced, and intelligent co-workers. Offers flexible work schedules, however work/life balance could be greatly improved."
good,"McGraw-Hill has some of the nicest staff. My co-workers are a delight to work with. The hardest part of my job is staying on the phone all day, and not necessarily having a project(s) to work on. The most enjoyable part is having the opportunity to speak to a wide range of people from various organizations. The management style of not micro-managing works wonderfully for me. I do have an occasional coaching session to discuss my progress and areas that need developing. I learned how to use Oracle proficiently."
good,"This used to be a dream company for many but these days it lost it’s charm. Lay-off of good talent and bringing up the most vocal people, who knows nothing about the business owning it. It if are already in your sweet spot, well watch your steps. People should change but that does not mean you should change the structure every three months!"
good,"Management and superiors received more pressure with the take over and publishing going more digital.  Managers slowly placed pressure on all senior sales members and caused many stress leaves.  Over time, they hired out of school students who would take almost a half the salary of the senior territory reps."
good,Good organisation for people working in core development of product. Adaptive to new technology and open up to give chance to new faces to take initiatives for bringing the change
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was showing the correlation of McGraw-Hill products with the state assessment thus proving to teachers that the provided resources would address the state standards.
good,"At S&p global the work life balance is awsome. need to improve the managementt style of working."
good,"I worked as a Business Analyst and it was a contract job. While the pay was great, but the job security wasn't there. My project ended before the contract was up and I had to leave."
good,A typical day involved interaction with multiple departments and levels of management.  I was able to enhance my ability to liaise and develop rep-ore with a wide range of coworkers.  The difficult part of the job was the amount of bureaucracy within the department.  There were many channels of interchanging management and policy.  Too many meetings that seemed to be very inefficient and unproductive.  The culture of the company was great.  The people and office were very pleasant and educated.  Management and coworkers enforced respect and acknowledgement of team/hard work to each other.
good,"This used to be a place for motivated and independent financial analysts and programmers.  The new management is striving to change it into a mindless assembly line that suppresses individual creativity, and keeps costs low by churning the employee population. Their fondest dream is to replace all those pesky humans with an AI that will stick to the rules and work for peanuts."
good,"The company is going through big changes at the moment with the acquisition of SNL and there are significant changes to internal and commercial policies which are having a negative effect."
good,"Positive culture - "
good,As someone who was a recent graduate in finance. The S&P culture is great. There has been a huge focus to expand the centennial office. The teams here are small and everyone is very friendly.
good,"I was involved in a fairly new education testing program. It was voluntary testing across the United States. Once the tests were scored each school received a report that compared their test scores to schools around the world. It was very interesting to see the difference of test scores related to the different regions in the United States and then see how each school compared to the world.  Very exciting."
good,Productive and good scope for learning and starting up Career. But after a point we will not get enough growth. work culture Quite silent and serious.
good,"In the end when the business was declining I covered 14 states by car and called on all Bookstores, Book Wholesalers and Medical Bookstores. While I traveled over 2 million miles by car in 47 years I did call on every account I was asked to call on until they either started buying from wholesalers or they went out of business. I prefer this culture because I am not accountable to anybody but my sales manager and myself. I would say the hardest part of my job was keeping my bosses up to par on computer changes and helping them get up to speed. I never had a boss who was more proficient than I was on a computer. I was often asked to attend meetings that were attended mainly by Vice Presidents. But I loved the main part of my job that was calling on accounts and meeting with people. The people in the book business are the salt of the earth. And while the business itself was losing it's clientele and life for the average bookstore was a struggle these people who were mostly owners kept the faith and it was wonderful servicing them. I would have to say that what I learned is that while you can outlive some businesses you can never stop loving the people that keep it together. God bless the book industry."
good,Moved through the company management to director of print sits for producing Dodge Reports on construction.  Field operatives would gather sit information and we would disseminate it into the specific categories required by our individual end users.  All reports would be collated and packaged for mailing nightly and sent to the airport or post office for distribution.
good,I worked at S&P Global and found it to be a company with an excellent culture and workplace environment. The management was collaborative and supportive.
good,"Loved working at McGraw Hill.  I worked myself up.  Lots of advancement.  education reimbursement.  Met alot of interesting people.  Interacted with artist, financial people, writers,"
good,The company has many different divisions that is very diverse in a lot of ways but hard to get into without the proper education or certifications. The department that I worked in was phased out and others that had a longer tenure was moved to another department.
good,"Si vous aimez vous investir, vous avez la possibilité de vous épanouir   au sein de Standard & Poor's."
good,"This review is form the perspective of Atos Contractor at Mcgraw Hill Financial."
good,Make outbound callls to different Architectual firms in all 50 states. The purpose was to generate Sales leads for various companies
good,The company focused to high performance while competing in a very competitive Globalized industry. This role strengthened my technically skills.
good,The team i am working in isnt organized well and needs a lot of improvement as far as processes are concerned. Co workers are mostly consultants so it doesnt matter that much. Toughest part was to get to talk to the management.
good,Continuous work flow throughout the entire work day.  Able to improve my skill level by attending various classes.  The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting financial matters....but it was very satisfying when resolutions were found for those same issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with my clients.
good,"Working at McGraw Hill, I got a chance to work more on my people skills. I learned a lot about organization lean structure. I became a stronger leader, worked a lot on patience. Management was a little shaky at times as far as higher chain of command. The over all environment was pretty cool. Everybody got along, and flexed to help others when needed. I would say the hardest part about the job would be, the fact we had to break our neck and beg for raises that were really appropriate. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that it was actually hands on. We stayed busy learning each position that was available."
good,The McGraw-Hill Education Groups is one of the best companys around today.
good,Great industry to work in--digital is driving force not just print books anymore--loved my manager and co-workers--not really suitable if you have small children--best part was meeting and working with professors
good,The McGraw-Hill Companies has a strong work ethic and family culture. The employees are impressive professionals that strive for personal and professional development each day. Employees are encouraged to network and move around to various departments throughout their career. Ratings companies sometimes get a bad reputation depending on the outcome of the economy. We still tend to have a positive attitude throughout.
good,"Pros – Growing subsidiaries, international, work-life balance opportunities, personable culture..."
good,"I was hired to full a position that had been vacant for more than six months. It was a highly stressful position with much to do and little turn around time on projects. Unfortunately, there seemed to be some conflict between my managers expectations and those of management, the latter of which informed my contract and my decision to take on the job in the first place. Given that this was a commuting job, I was told by management that I would have at least two work-from-home days per week and that I could meet directly with authors -- whatever it took to ready key final draft manuscripts. Within a few weeks, it was clear that my immediate manager was not in agreement with this arrangement, and I was forced to commute daily, After spending upwards of 40 hours commuting weekly for an already stressful job, I determined this was not the job for me."
good,"I am working as a Lead database administrator in hyderabad, everything good from current company but I am looking for change. S & P global is an financial domain company"
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. It was exactly what I expected going in to the position. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Overall, I have nothing bad to say."
good,Worked in a number of different departments and was afforded opportunities for advancement and made long lasting relationships both inside and outside of the office.
good,I was hired as a Credit Analyst. It's a good place to start out of college because there is a month of training and a structured mentorship program. The company culture can be beige but that is perhaps expected with a financial services firm.
good,S&P is staffed with talented and smart individuals. The workplace culture is great. There is a good work/life balance. Individuals are given opportunites to succeed.
good,"I doubt my personal experience would be similar to others working for the company.  My job was vastly different from the one I thought I would be working, largely in part to my being shifted from the hiring manager to 2 others in the first 3 months.  As such, my job there was toxic and I had to leave.  I would go back there in a different role with a different manager as I truly thought it was a great culture and a great place to work otherwise--I just wish my job had shaped up to what I'd been promised when I was hired."
good,I overall loved this job but they only could hire a two people and lay off the rest for the summer season when students were not in school.Enviorment is kind of dull .
good,"Nice place to learn,large scope for learning new things.easy to maintain work life balance. safe  place for  women."
good,Work culture is almost too collaborative.  Too many unstructured meetings but otherwise resources needed to do your job are provided and the work is interesting and rewarding.
good,"I worked for SNL Financial prior to the merger. At the time people were beginning to note a shift away from 'small company where everyone knows everyone' to a medium sized corporate outfit. "
good,This company is very easy to work for. They defined the job and it was appropriate for their definition. I enjoyed working with both management and non-management.
good,"S&P is a great place to work, they are very family oriented. The only problem I had is they do not look for their employees next contract. Even though they say they are looking. "
good,Good place to work. Nice management & good work life balance. Employees are motivated to take part in decision making & all the issues are heard & resolved.
good,the work-life balance in this company is amazing but every coin has two sides. There is very little growth option and have a lot of hierarchy which makes it all the more difficult.
good,"As described in the title. The process is killing us; too much procedural work that significantly slows down the rating process. "
good,Good pay and rewarding job. The hours were great but there was not enough work for all of the employees. If there are ever full time employment opportunities I would encourage qualified people to apply.
good,A strong company that cares for it's employees and strives and succeeds at being the best in the business. Best people to work with keeping up motivation and drive.
good,Standard and Poors was a good place to work.  It was a positive work environment and the work was both interesting and challenging.
good,I started working with the company as temporary staff and am still awaiting a timeline for permanent status.  I became trained immediately to handle a large variety of different transactions.
good,"Great team in the PMO working to serve the internal business clients with excellence.  Fast paced changes as regulatory hurdles create a moving target and the team must respond to new global laws and regulations."
good,I have telecommuted for over 10 years.  This is an option that is sometimes offered to seasoned team members with proven track records.  Regular work hours are required.
good,"The worldwide company has since divided into two companies. One still contains the traditional book division, while the other has most of the information services."
good,"Start day with Pending tasks and pick up taks on first come first serve basis."
good,Research Assistant for Standard & Poor's nascent consulting group.
good,"Overall, S&P was a good place to begin a career. You could go in, mingle with your co-workers and get down to work in a positive environment."
good,"Many dedicated, hard-working people. Many meetings but probably no more than a typical large organization. Benefits are very good, and compensation is very good."
good,I learned how to use MS excel. Learned how to file catalogs of writers' publications. Helpful co-workers and caring boss.
good,"As a Freelance Production Artist, I review all material (Art, Color, Mechanical Specs) liaison between Management and Art Directors. Enjoyed the interaction between Art Directors and Management was able to get me 2 cents in, which was valued."
good,"This is a very good place for professionals to join who are good at the latest tech skills, Robotics, Automation, Data science, etc. The culture of the company is very good and equal opportunity given to everyone to raise the voice, share the ideas. The Best thing about S&P Global is work/life balance provided to each of the employee."
good,I have learned many things and work life balance from this company and the colleagues here are also wonderful and will help in any tough situation. I am happy for being part of this company.
good,"I worked in Islamabad office. Its very good place in term of fun; work life balance, management but not good in term of salary and learning and growth process is quite slow."
good,"Best Job I ever had!!! I enjoyed everything about this company. "
good,"Monotonous work requires high caffeine intake."
good,"S&P Global Market Intelligence is one of the most people centric organization I've experienced. It provides you different arenas and opportunities to showcase your skills and and provide better career deveopment opportunities along the way."
good,This position provided some hands-on experience in the website building area.  Also provided a unique opportunity to work with the manager of Emerging Markets.  Providing support on that level is something that has stuck with me throughout my career as an Administrative Assistant.
good,"At S&P, work is appreciated. This company motivates its employees by publicizing their good work time to time. the work environment is youthful and professional."
good,"Being a hard worker who enjoys a challenge I am willing to put in extra hours to"
good,"Beside salary and work politics, everything is just fine for the work that my team does. There are teams that i believe are paid equally whereas, the work they do are a lot easier task. Even, there should be different norms for mba professionals and undergraduates, all are paud equally, and also they are recruited for same profile too."
good,"Given the circumstances of our division being sold, the company did a good job of keep us informed of the process.  The pay and benefits were fair and consistent."
good,"Great place to work with good work life balance."
good,Working at McGraw Hill Ryerson has been a blessing.  The location is above par.  Located currently on the Whitby waterfront it is an ideal location to zip out during lunch for a quick walk to clear the mind.  The people that work here are amazing.  The different roles I've had over the years have been challenging and rewarding.  Its a place I feel lucky to be part of.
good,"Good, stable company"
good,Good work environment with colleagues and management; competitive environment; product oriented strategies; low stress level with best salary package.
good,MHE is investment in classroom learning and rewards hard work and innovation. The company also promotes growth from within and networking opportunities throughout their organization. Overall a great place to work.
good,"Good environment"
good,"S&P is a good company to get experience working in the investment industry, however further progression can be challenging and this can have a detrimental effect on workplace morale."
good,"While S&P has made efforts to decentralize from its New York office, recently opening offices in Denver and Dallas, most of the better opportunities, positions, and intracompany mobility takes place in the NY office. The other offices are much smaller, and this can lead to career stagnation and, occasionally, lay offs. In the end, NY calls the shots."
good,working on the phone placing calls to give service our company provided and working with a team. pleasant environment to work at.  Also with management if you work hard they move you up within the company.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at McGraw-Hill Financial was the different people I was exposed to during my time there. I worked for the construction magazine division and a typical work day is meeting daily deadlines. Management was very open and supportive in hearing my ideas or grievances. My co-workers were always more than willing to help me with things I wasn't familiar with and I learned so much from them and the clients I communicated with. My job taught me patience and taught me to strive for more in life.
good,"respectful work enviornment"
good,"A good organisation to work"
good,I learned how IT Department of a popular Financial Company works.
good,"While this company is known for their stability, the role I am in now, while I don't foresee it disappearing, I also do not see it growing.  Projects now feel like day-to-day work that must be done every year at the same time and for the same length of time, based on deadlines.  However, the deadlines never bothered me.  On the plus side, everyone is supportive of one another.  This job has also exposed me to several career paths: risk management, project management, business analysis."
good,Overall good company to work for. Sometimes there is a lot of red-tapism that gets in way of accomplishing things.
good,"Busy from start to finish"
good,"In a consulting role, I touched many different areas of finance. My coworkers and clients were intelligent, pleasant people."
good,"working at the field, north, northwest and central Area. my co "

good,"Large, diverse organization with many opportunities. I especially liked its global presence, which allowed me to travel to different offices."
good,"The job was as great as expected, management in UK is very professional. Work life balance is good and company is supportive. Professional team, even interdepartmental work can be difficult."
good,Great benefits. Team building culture. Opportunities for advancement. Learning and development opportunities. Work/life balance. Global travel opportunities.
good,"Job security work life balance is good, perq and compensation is at level of job market, management and sinors are very helpful, clearing interviews is difficult."
good,It was a good place for learning especially for those having technical skills and expertise. They mainly focus on automation and data science. It's a fun place polish your hard as well soft skills.
good,Challenging career opportunity.  Lots of travel covering clients all across the USA.  Interactions with C suite is required.  Sales conferences and client meetings a must.
good,Working with S&P global was good and where we have work life balance with good benefits. Company providing internal training for the employees for self development.
good,"""It is great to work for a company that is open to new ideas and suggestions. I have an ability to manage our desks, create our daily schedules. The Executive Team has an open door policy, so you have support whenever you need it. Senior Managers are constantly learning about people, technologies, companies and different industries. It is very satisfying helping people find jobs and helping companies find employees that they need."
good,S&P Global has a nice corporate environment and offers good benefits to employees. It pays well and the management is cooperative. Workplace culture is great and employees make the place a breeze to work at.
good,"Acquired following skills while working there: Financial Analysis – Product Development – Planning and Execution – Workflows - Process Improvement – Matrix Management – Business Writing"
good,Work there for 30+ years was a great place to work. I enjoyed a three day work week with 5 weeks of vacation plus holidays. The only downside is that I don't still work there.
good,McGraw-Hill is truly an industry leader with a great culture and work life balance. If you are beginning your career here kudos! You will not be disappointed.
good,Good work environment and benefits. Good career progression and training. Flexible working hours.  Access to a variety of social activities groups in the company.
