bad,This is a modern day sweatshop in the city of Sunnyvale in California. By far my worst work experience. I’m surprise they’re able to get away with how they treat their workers. Go type sweet shop in  google for additional photos.
bad,"Incredibly stressful workplace. Management wasn't very organized with having a back up plan with being behind schedule on outbound shipments. I didn't learn much as a shipper, but it was both physically and mentally exhausting. Non-stop work loads trying to rush stuff out the door. Glad I left when I could cause I didn't see myself ever advancing at that work site with that type of management and atmosphere. Also very high turn over rate here."
bad,"The surgical robots are cool, but the engineers look down on everyone not in their club. Advancement is non-existent even though you have the skills. Engineers make mistakes in their designs all the time."
bad,"Manager is not a good person to work for. This is not a good company to work for. If you have the opportunity to work somewhere else take that job."
bad,If you go there and dint like management or anyone move out of the cell before its too late. They won't listen but bug them until your comfortable and get your compensation right.
bad,"Lot of political environment tough to handle"
bad,New supervisor was hired had no technical apptitude and a willing to standup and protect technician interests in ongoing work.  The climate is hostile and non communicative.  Everyone is self center and lack of leadership and teamwork.
bad,"I received some really great training here on lean mfg. 5S, commwip and they have a good quality management system  but my cell as they call the work groups had it own click and I didn't really fit in. Surprised that they did not find another job or cell for me to work in. I was never late and always did what they asked me to do. They wasted a weeks worth of training and I ended up at another company making more money. So glad I saved myself a years worth of time. I would go just for the training though. I think they really just hired me to get them through their quarter end but they were not honest about that from the get go."
bad,"I have no reviews for this company. A typical day is eight hours. The manage sucks, they are all there on seniority, they are not managers and they don't go to bat for you."
bad,"1*	Provide customer service, training, and support of the Concur online booking and expense management reimbursement tool"
bad,"Management is suck, only listen to the lead. If the lead didn't like you. Your contract will ended sooner than you though. I will never  come back there."
bad,If you cant be on time every single day and dont punch in early then this could be the place for you. but i punch in at 603 and that was my last day. kind of a reliefe. takes alot to fit in here. each cell has its own clicks and dont .like to let outsiders in. Same with Managment. they could use alittle bit more training.they sometimes put people in the wrong spots it seems.
bad,"Manager was telling people to quit and he would hire them back,"
bad,You may get what you want in pay but you will get twice the work. They ask people to work 10 hour days but really want you to work 12 hour days. Upper management is stiff and disconcerted form real people. The stock is no longer preforming as it did in its heyday but they still think they are at the top of the food chain. If you like to get chewed out in meetings this is the place for you.
bad,The culture here is very stressful and the people are very heads down all day. If you are a worka holic then this would be a great place for you. I would rather not comment.
bad,Fast paced high tech med device robotics company.  They have become more focused on the #'s and not the employees or the employees development.   Especially tenured employees that have built territories from little utilization to significant market share.  When there is little room left for growth in a territory they will aim to replace highly paid Sr. reps with recent college graduates to babysit cases and cut their overhead by 2/3 rds to make #'s for Wall Street.
bad,Very hard to advance in engineering unless you have a Stanford engineering degree. The best jobs go to Stanford grads and non-Stanford are second class citizens.
bad,"Great pay and healthcare. However, very  click-ish. Employees and management ALL talk behind other people’s backs. They are all very childish!  Also, Management diff not want an Executive Assistant so most tasks were personal."
bad,"In a typical day, you will likely feel pressure to participate more towards goal achievement, unless you already work the expected 60-70 hours per week"
good,"The company started as a very family oriented work place. But as it grew as a corporation  the moral and sense of pride of the employees diminished . Due to the lack of leadership skills of the new salaried member of management . The point system attendance grading became a tool to terminate good  employees  who do not agree with the low self esteem supervisor. There's a lot of this going on.. not very organized and  alot of drama .not a bad place to start "
good,"Great place to work, manufacturing would not be ideal for anyone trying to achieve work life balance or advancement.,"
good,"Very political and low pay, also they discourage overtime even after being told by recruiter that 10 percent of my pay would be overtime and was given a higher pay scenario."
good,"Good product, strong CEO, and great communication of the intended company culture. Weak HR Management, resulting in leaders at VP and Director levels not consistently adhering to the company cultural norms."
good,I have nothing good or bad to say about Intuitive can not comment due to legal issues and the agreement have signed
good,"great benefits they get rid of experienced managers for engineers, job security is based on attendance rather than performance.  no room for growth. medical care is great once you become permeant"
good,"Fast-paced environment. Multiple daily meetings-sometimes too many precluding efficiency at work. Work culture is focused about work and very little for developing any type of social interaction."
good,"friendly crew, helpful leaders cross training availability is good"
good,"Amazing technology with interaction with multiple specialties.  Treated as expert in the room with customers. learned anatomy in multiple specialties, C-level selling. Lots of firing and hiring which had negative impact on culture and consistency with management."
good,"I worked a typical ""swing shift"" 4:45 pm- 2:30 am.  Worked there over 3 yrs as a temp.  I learned vision systems and a multitude of other instruments.  The management was the best I have ever had by far. Co-workers stayed to themselves. The hrs were the hardest part. Worked every Sat for over 3 yrs also.  I enjoyed out team building times and our once a week meetings."
good,There is little work and life balance. More and more VPs in the company but not much addition to people who are doing real work.
good,The company has really good products and had been leading the robotic surgical market in past 20 years. C-level offers nice vision and leadership in future development but many organizations are not aligning with that.
good,Leadership is not there. You are expected to take on many task without direction. I learned so much about FDA standards and documentation. Management moves around so much. Co-workers are very tired and stressed. FDA requirements are constantly changing. The pay was very good.
good,Intuitive has the most advanced technology with wonderful developers.  Management style is varied amongst areas/regions. A very heavily male-driven culture which is slowly changing.  401K match is not industry standard despite the success of the company.  Travel varies but on average is 20% of the time. Work-Life balance is discussed a lot but a challenge to implement due to nature of work. Would benefit from more associates to support hospital cases.  Development is specific for those identified as leadership track ready.  CEO is a wonderful human being and may not hear the street level growing pains extensively.  The technology is impressive and will continue to drive success within the industry.
good,"The company is fast-paced and action oriented, with most levels set on tactical execution in support of the sales team.  Management is smart and frugal.  Co-workers speak about it being a grinding environment without the sense of being appreciated. Most enjoyable aspect is hearing the positive impact da Vinci surgery has on the lives of so many patients."
good,My boss was great but above him it was a complete mess. No creative work. All production work.
good,"The da Vinci Surgical System improves patient experiences and outcomes by fundamentally changing surgery da Vinci Surgery simplifies many existing minimally invasive procedures, da Vinci makes new minimally invasive surgical procedures possible."
good,Work here is stressful at times. Management is unorganized. They will not listen to their employees but instead will bring employees down. Situations are handled poorly.
good,I learned a plethora of knowledge about inventory management and how to deal with inventory discrepancies. Great benefits and stock options.
good,indecent management could use replacement. long work hours but on the brighter side every 6 months you get evaluated for a raise.
good,great people. culture is driven by engineering and product developement
good,"Just Inspect Material"
good,It's a new company that moved from Sunnyvale  very interesting place  they shipped out surgical instruments  parts to surgeons  all over United states  so they can preform  surgery on their clients  my first day  had me make boxes  for week  then they had me order picking  sometimes the days will be long  because of the hours we work  plus the job is hard you can only make couple of mistakes a week  after that take you to the office  and talk about my performs.
good,"Challenging workload and productivity"
good,"Hay gente muy sucia en cuanto al terminar los descansos."
good,"The company focuses efforts on the patient experience and sticks to it across the board. "
good,"Great people"
good,State of the art lean manufacturing. Very bright employees. Fast paced. Work life balance.  Balanced daily meeting to work hours. Great compensation and benefits.
good,"It is a good brand. People with a very high level of accountability at all levels. Good open communication with organization's leaders, causing all people feel part of the decision that are made."
good,"nice place to work. you will learn lot of new things. very good management. No need to work hard. good team members."
good,Hours are really long the management is good but they don't give opportunity for advancement. It can be stressful at times with lack of information to provide customers. Again expected hours during quarter end were 6 to 6
good,"Hyper growth, great products, dynamic workforce.  Changing the surgical landscape.                             "
good,Intuitive is a great compant to work for and I have 12 years of yenure
good,A positive work enviroment with friendly people. Heavy workload with a lot of pressure of building a quality product. Opportunity for promotions very limited
good,"good place to work but management suck  people from California think they are better than the ones from NC some of the people there make it bad. the hours are great but its a lot of back stabbing and little groups that huddle up talking about other employees,"
good,Smaller company. Limited growth potential. Great business model and very successful in engineering and marketing new medical devices. No solid competition.
good,busy busy busy all day long building with small parts. supervisors were down to earth but managers were almost too strict. best part of the job was the longer than usual lunch and all the free food on the weekends. the hardest part of the day was not being able to take bathroom breaks. we had to keep building until the next scheduled break.
good,"A great company to work at with amazing people and great hours. A lot of overtime, so you never have to worry about that."
good,I  held a high profile position working in hospitals with robotic surgery while I was with Intuitive Surgical. Selling distributive technology that changed how hospitals and surgeons operated and treated their patients. Selling on Value metrics and how it affects hospitals while challenging conventional laparoscopic surgery and changing surgeons mindsets on value of robotic surgery. I worked closely with hospital CEOs and C-level to help grow their robotics program as well as increase over all surgery volume.
good,Intuitive Surgical has a great product and they are working to make it even better.  The employees were enjoyable to work with.  I would definitely recommend working at ISI.
good,Highly demanding for product output. If one colleague does not build to a certain time limit you are to take from them and they cannot count the product as a build on their tally charts.
good,"ISI pays well and offers attractive benefits, while producing a great product. The folks here are very accountable for their jobs and it's a fast-paced and fluid environment that always keeps the work interesting."
good,"I have been working here for more than 3 years as contractor,its been good experience"
good,"There really is not a typical day in the life of a da Vinci sales professional.  However, a day in the life of a sales manager could involve, a two to three day field ride with a rep, followed by conference calls and one:one performance calls with my team.  In the field ride day, starting off with a robotics committee meeting with the OR leadership and C-suite executives, discussing high level performance metrics and the strategy to guide improved economic and clinical outcomes.  Following, 3 cases with surgeons and staff at different points in the learning curve, using high direction, backed by clinical and technical expertise to, create successful outcomes not achievable with robotic technology."
good,"Best 10 years of my professional life.  Challenging and rewarding atmosphere with outstanding and transparent leadership along with dedicated co-workers working on amazing, life changing products."
good,"Overall a great company however the dollar superseded the patient on their “pyramid” which was counter intuitive to the culture they initially bred.  Limiting hours able to maintain surgical robotics to 8-5 is counter productive to helping the hospitals maintain maximum uptime and patient driven results.  "
good,There is so much to learn from the other employees at Intuitive Surgical and so many projects happening at once. It is easy to approach someone from another group to ask for advice on your own project. There are many intelligent and talented people who work here.
good,"Great company to work for if you are on day shift, by the time you are out it is still bright enough to enjoy the rest of your day. "
good,"It was great working at intuitive with daily, weekly and monthly goals and timelines in place. I learned writing MDR reports, managed multiple tasks, and it was a great workplace. The hardest part of the job was submitting MDRs to FDA on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was there was team work and team activities outside of work ."
good,"Fun place  to work, learn lot of new skills. Have to better yourself everyday. The working culture is always thrive to get ahead. They will teach and train you on new skill set every month"
good,"Typical day is fast paced and can be long day. We worked hard."
good,There are a lot of opportunities for who have ambition and willing to grow with company.  A company provide a lot of good benefit and compensation.  A good company to work with.
good,"A typical day at work included doing credit evaluations for new customers and following up with collections activities."
good,Fast-paced demanding work environment.   Work-life balance can be an issue in some positions. Many highly motivated employees across the company. Great product. Pay and benefits are very good.
good,The company does really good. The mangement was cut throat. Workplace culture is good an dmy learning curve was also good. They have strict goals and deadlines
good,"It is a good plce to work for, has a very good work life balance and provides job security. This compnay gives a very good compensation. Nice place to work for"
good,"-Friendly environment"
good,Great product and great management! A rewarding career. The most enjoyable place to work.
good,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is the global technology leader in minimally invasive robotic-assisted surgery. For more than 15 years, Intuitive Surgical has focused on advancing surgical technology while consistently maintaining a “patients first” philosophy. The da Vinci Surgical System has brought minimally invasive surgery to more than four million patients worldwide."
good,Innovative company with great work life balance. Significant responsibilities given to junior employees makes Intuitive a great place to grow your career. Very laid back work environment.
good,"pro: "
good,"It was a fantastic place to work, people cared about each other and everyone really believed in the mission. I can't recommend living in the bay, but that's a personal preference."
good,"Very good company to learn about regulated environments."
good,"fast paced and demanding culture for most teams."
good,"At Intuitive Surgical, the patient always comes first and every team works diligently to achieve such a goal.  With a heavy order volume (>800 per day) and lengthy, detail-oriented projects simultaneously consuming your day, the company continues to maintain a strong hold as the leader of the Medical Device industry, strenuously creating a robotic presence that is readily adopted.  "
good,It is a comfortable environment to come to work and as part of a team who gets the job done. It is excited to come and work with good attitude co-workers and work together to see our motivation and persistence pays off at the of each day.
good,"ISI has brilliant minds who develop amazing technology. They provide fantastic resources to support your job. They pay really well, 401K was a joke, but employee stock purchase plan and stock grants were amazing! Their main problem is management, especially in the sales area. I still own their stock. Would work there again in a heartbeat."
good,I enjoyed working at Intuitive Surgical.  I had a very good boss and liked the other members of my team.  Getting training was hard because everyone was so busy.  It was a contract position and I really needed to work more than 8 hours to keep up.  I came in over a holiday weekend to keep up but did not charge for my time.  The medical robots that they make are amazing!
good,"Intuitive Surgical is a great company.  They have a great company DNA and is a wonderful place to work.  ISI is in the business of providing technology to help surgeons perform sometimes complex cancer surgeries... the message is very clear that the patient comes first, ALWAYS!"
good,"i really enjoyed working with this company they group of people i worked with were very enjoyable and fun easy to get along with, management was very friendly and open to any employee concerns"
good,"This job was extremely stressful due to all the FDA regulations because its a medical device company. The culture was awesome, very very hardworking, dedicated , intelligent people there. Unlimited room for advancement and bonuses and pay raises. All around the best structured position i have ever held. I learned a ton and felt recognized for my achievements. Also the pay and benefits are un comparable!!"
good,"The company, its people and its leadership are best in class. Great company and overall environment to be a part of. There is a constant emphasis on growth and process improvement."
good,"Excellent, highly recommended. Great life work balance. Difficult to get in, though. Company culture puts the customer (patients) first, ahead of profits."
good,Everyday is never the same.  We are presented with challenges on meeting company and customer expectations.  This is to be expected in a fast paced environment.  Great place to work and grow.  Highly recommend.
good,"Intuitive is a federal regulated trade zone and it has it own rules and regulations governing their premises. It is a modernized, fun pace workplace. Quality is strictly awarded to those who check and re-check the products."
good,I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity work for this amazing company that is doing amazing for the medical world. The opportunity is there if you want to advance in your career.
good,Great place to work. Very smart people in upper management and C level geniuses.  You work hard and be prepared to work hard.  Cutting edge technology driven company.
good,Intuitive's culture is unique and makes you want to learn and make a difference. Feels like you are working towards helping patients and that feeling you get is great.
good,The workplace culture was excellent. Everyone seems to enjoy their jobs and everyone helps out when they can. It is a very fair place to work and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves.
good,Amazing company to work at. I loved the job culture and how much they took care of their employees. Clean environment and very organized. its a shame i moved but definitely would recommend this company to my friends and family
good,"Overall this is a good place to work."
good,"Field service role. Salaried position. You covered a geographical territory with some co-workers where you installed, and then serviced medical devices at different medical facilities. Your job was to install, upgrade, troubleshoot, repair, and maintain the medical equipment. You worked alongside clinical reps who train the customer on how to use the equipment. Work is dispatched to you in trouble calls that you arrange logistics for such as travel and parts. It was a great company to work for. Workloads increased as years went on and customer base grew. Out of state travel became more frequent from monthly to bi-weekly or almost weekly. I was burnt out on travel and trying to coordinate logistics that would often deviate from plan. Workload was highly predictable and cyclic with preventative maintenance and upgrades, but could be often highly unpredictable with service calls coming in."
good,"I've admired Intuitive for years. It always seemed like a challenging, smart, collaborative and respectful organization. Not to mention the technology is out of this world! Since I've started, I'm happy to report that it's living up to all my expectations, plus more."
good,"a typical day at work in which we have to reach our goal is competitive and challenging, I really learned a lot for the 3 months I was working with them. The hardest part of working here is getting off really late and when there is a rework in a process it makes our work slow because you have to do it over again. But the most enjoyable part of the job is when the team reached the goal and everyone is cooperating and working hard to reach the goal. Team work is the key and it is really good working with cooperative people."
good,"Our day to day work consist of lots of phones and order processing.  "
good,"Trabajo muy interesante, necesita de mucha dedicacion y enfoque,"
good,The company was great place to work and the people work there help and friendly and the company was big and clean but the work was  too stress but after all good
good,"As a contractor, I was given access to training and many company activities, with the exception of corporate all-hands meetings that provided permanent employees with details of product planning and goals."
good,Best job ever! It really was a game changer for me.  This job completely enhanced my earning potential & completely transformed my life. I love what I do. And I look forward to climbing & advancing to a new level
good,Intuitive es una empresa que ofrece muy buen ambiente laboral y cultural.
good,es una empresa muy buena y con buenas prestaciones
good,Excellent opportunity to learn the recruiting basics in a high volume fast paced environment. Supported Area Managers on the East Coast. Setup interview days for Managers.
good,"This was a great experience, my mentor and senior producer was a wealth of knowledge and I learned a lot.  It was a fun team to work with and they are all very talented."
good,General:  Mature management.
good,Fast pace company with a superior innovative product.Lead by brilliant cross functional teams. Industry leader in minimally invasive medical procedures
good,"This company is great to work for and I wish I didn't have to leave.  My commute is now too far from work.  I learned so much from  this company.  It is an amazing piece of machinery that we build at this company.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing how successful all my trainees become after I have trained them.  I enjoy helping people and performing multiple tasks.  A typical day at work begins with a meeting, responding to emails then training new and veteran techs.  Sometimes we do have projects with deadlines that need to be met.  The hardest part of the job is trying to meet production schedule while training continues on the line and working day and swing shift changes.  This company taught me a lot about lean manufacturing and how important quality is because we are dealing with patients lives.  I will miss this company."
good,exelente empresa muy buen ambiente muy buen salario exelentes prestaciones muy buen ambiente laboral
good,Muy buen equipo de trabajo muy buen ambiente muy atentos todos exelente paga y muy buenos bonos
good,"Great place to work. I love the work culture, and the way all teams support each other. Its amazing to see how upper management takes effort to make everyone feel so comfortable to work."
good,"In the Field Service Engineer position some days can be extremely stressful.  One day in Anchorage, Alaska our daVinci Robotic Surgery System had a hard failure.  With a Hard Failure the System is completely down until a visit from a Field Service Engineer can take place.  At the time I was living in California and I was the only Field Service Engineer available.  I flew to Anchorage, Alaska in a massive winter storm picked up the service parts at FedEx and repaired the down system under extreme pressure.  There were Doctors, nurses and most importantly the patient waiting for surgery.  I had one hour to perform a repair that usually takes three hours minimum.  I completed the repair with just minutes to go.  I stayed in the operating room to make sure that the patient had a positive outcome and the daVinci Robotic Surgery System was operating within the parameters of our Standard Operating Procedure.  The patient had a positive outcome with a major surgery and was very grateful to hear that a Field Service Engineer traveled from San Francisco to repair the complex surgical system and also make sure that they were satisfied with a surgical procedure that saved their life. "
good,Many staff are genuinely very kind and good people. I would recommend it if you want to work of an awesome firm that is hard working and super supportive
good,"I love working for Intuitive Surgical!... and I don't want to leave, but on the same token, I miss being home & I miss being with my fur babies."
good,"i work for this company about 2 years."
good,"This was 1 of the best jobs i have ever worked for.i had a early shift when i worked there ,which was great.at this company it did not matter what,the job was,the job was done at ease with a steady work flow.also at break or lunch they have coach truck on wheels come to provide meals."
