bad,"Terrible work environment, management lacks communication as well as accountability. Management embraces safety only when it’s convienient. Would not recommend commuting to a company that doesn’t commit to their employees."
bad,"EQT really does not care about safety, they are more concerned with liability and placing the blame on the employee if something were to happen.  Most of management is there because their Mom or highschool buddy was able to get them into their position.  They are constantly changing your work area and who you report to.  Its almost like they do things just to make their employees miserable.  Communication is almost non existent.  They are constantly making people scared for their job and try to motivate people through intimidation.  I would say this is the reason you don't see more negative reviews."
bad,"It was a very cut throat culture. I always felt that I had to “CYA” and was always “looking over my shoulder”. If you were not a part of the “good ole boy club”, then you got cut at lay off time. My experience was not utilized, no chance to provide input or insight, I actually got “dumber” by working here. Upper management had no idea how to efficiently run the department. Had too many people in all the wrong places. A handful of us worked long hours while the rest did absolutely nothing. People put in positions with literally no background or experience in the role they were given. "
bad,Management turnover was high. Management couldn’t make decisions and provided very little training. No one had answers to questions. Some employee’s work load was too much and others did nothing. Management has no idea what the employee are doing. It’s a very confusing work environment. Lots of mistakes are made and no one cares.
bad,Not a good place they don't care about the people in the field when I started back in 2012 it was a good place but all the good guys left so now you have a bunch of  stupid people running it they think there ???? smells good someone will get killed just a matter of time
bad,Company in big trouble. To many bosses. EQT is the most stressful company I have ever worked for. The company waste so much money it is pitiful. Every time you go back after days off you have a new sop to worry about.
bad,The upper management consist of a bunch of over educated idiots that no nothing of an hourly employees day. Very unfair and inconsiderate.
bad,Lack of trustworthiness and inconsistencies in carrying out company policies.  Large turnover in difficult HR department and not advocate for employees.
bad,"Learned to manage myself."
bad,Most people working for EQT stay solely because of the monetary compensation and they are unhappy with the workplace otherwise. It is a very stressful and unrewarding place to work.
bad,"My lease favorite job experience in all of my career.  Too much turnover due to the cut throat mentality and the way they treat people as expendable pieces that can be discarded at anytime if they don't fit exactly what they want.  Not inclusive, not a place where individual thought and diverse thought is not welcomed."
bad,"The Land Administration department at EQT is not a good environment in which to be employed.  Employees are not expected to perform typical lease analyst duties but instead required to act as customer service representatives, which is not a typical skill set of lease/legal analysts.  Additionally, not every employee is held to the same standards and this department is borderline hostile.  The management team lacks focus and does not possess the skills necessary in order to lead.  Generally, employees in this department are unhappy and abused, which affects productivity greatly.  I would not recommend working at EQT in this department."
bad,Value driver goals that do nothing to improve processes and procedures.  I'm really surprised they havent found themselves in really deep legal trouble.  Turn a blind eye on basic problems for long enough they turn into big problems.
bad,"Despite touting work/life balance, often worked 11-12 hour days, worked on days off, and often on weekends. Salary was decent, but not for the amount of additional time spent beyond typical 40hr work week."
bad,"HR executives cultivated a culture of fear which affected the entire organization.  Great pay and benefits, I also hear that it is a better place to work now that the Rice brothers took over."
bad,"The leadership was in flux constantly and the day to day operations were incredibly political.  Meetings were constant and unproductive.  I enjoyed most of my time, but as the company grew and split, that enjoyment was lost."
bad,"The pay and benefits are actually very good, but it does NOT make up for the environment and mistreatment of employees. "
bad,"Limited promotion opportunities unless you are part of many niche groups"
good,"•Provide assistance to water technicians on a daily basis, aiding with daily cost tracking and other various functions when needed."
good,"Manages and schedules gathering pipeline and interstate pipeline transportation activity, including nominations, capacity release, imbalance monitoring, accounting and customer communications. Responsible for the operations in the ever changing natural gas market and regulatory arena ensuring that EQT complies with both the FERC and NAESB regulations by adhering to strategic plans, policies, and procedures.  Also, I communicate operational issue with external customers and internal departments to ensure pipeline systems are both physically and contractually balanced. Routinely communicates with various levels of personnel in Internal gas measurement, Accounting, Systems Analysis, Gas Control, and Field operations."
good,I was a temp and cannot speak much of the benefits. It was an easy day to day task assignment and I really enjoyed that. I have learned the importance of being thorough.
good,"Things go down at breakneck speeds.  "
good,"EQT used to be a fantastic place to work - great pay, excellent benefits, CEO with great vision and knowledge of the Marcellus and its potential, employee recognition, promoting from within, encouragement of employee betterment, etc. Unfortunately, most of these great items have fallen by the wayside. I do have a relatively good opinion of the new management team in place, but think they have a long way to go to make EQT a great place to work again."
good,"The culture when I left was that you hoped you could go to work at your station and not get any attention, there was no reward system for work well done, but severe consequences for any violation of the multitude of rules that are constantly coming out to increase the ""safety culture"""
good,Management was difficult to deal with and made the work environment uncomfortable.
good,"Great compensation and benefits. Tough culture. Lacking in leadership at the Mid-Senior level. Lack of transparency. If you get the right manager, it can be a great experience. If not, life can be difficult."
good,"Although the compensation was inline for the industry the job expectations were off the charts. Management only wanted to be involved for the end result, never for the day to day sacrifices that needed to be done to achieve the goal. There is no work family balance for most jobs within the company. My manager and VP didn't even have the courtesy to thank me for my eight years of faithful service upon my retirement. The management philosophy is: that is what we pay you for."
good,Great benefits and flexible schedule.  Overly ambitious management choices have caused the unexpected lay off of 10% of the work force when they were already greatly understaffed.
good,Never been part of a company that had so much drama.   they are horrible at forecasting and prefer to do things their way.  The Rice Brothers should take over and lead.
good,This job was at an intern level.  Not comfortable drawing conclusion off the company as a whole during such a short time frame.  Just be prepared for a weird culture and keep your mouth shut.
good,"Good pay and benefits"
good,I worked as a contractor and did was treated as an outsider to the organization. They lacked the ability to work in a team atmosphere and collaboration was non-existent.
good,"Everyone is nice, friendly, very helpful and want to teach you your responsibilities and make sure you are doing a good job. Include everyone and emphasize being apart of a team"
good,TEam members were unfriendly and not willing to share vital information.
good,"My perspective is by nature limited... others likely have different views:"
good,"Great job if you have an engineering background/engineering degree and/or a ton of field operations experience in oil and gas.  If you possess these things not only will EQT pay you quite well, you will advance quickly, if you are competitive and results driven.  They pay very very well and the benefits are fantastic.  A great place for an engineer looking to advance their career.  EQT looks great on a resume.  The culture is a nightmare.  Very cliquey and people will betray you in a heartbeat to get ahead.  Watch your back. People hardly talk to one another unless you are part of the clique.  If it weren't for the culture, this would be a pretty good place to work."
good,Good place to work as far as benefits go. I personally didn't have enough to challenge me and unless you were part of a clique you were not taken serious and given equal opportunity.
good,"Great compensation, needs better management, there was to much emotion put forth into people keeping/losing jobs and too many chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,Good environment but there were so many insecurities all the time of not know if you would have a job. Always changing up management and putting people in management and supervisor positions that don't know what they are doing.
good,"-answer phone, troubleshoot issue's the user has ether resolve or raise ticket status."
good,"EQT is a great company to work for, I left due to a life change that required me to re-locate.  "
good,"Company has a tremendous amount of positives.  However, once you are in the company, there are limited opportunities for advancement.  That is the only downside to the firm.  If you are looking for a place with a great work life balance, very competitive compensation, and enjoy working with talented individuals with strong professional credentials and aren't that concerned with moving up the ladder, than it would be hard to find a better place to work."
good,"Utvecklande, stimulerande, fölränderlig, utmanade...jätteroligt. Förändringar & utmaningar hör till vardagen"
good,"As my exp. w/ EQT, they have been going through a very lot of Drilling Supervisor's, and if you do not agree w/ them or fit in to their click, or 1 of the Drilling Supt. does not take a liken to you, you will not last very long."
good,Culture was fast moving.  Coworkers were wonderful.  Management moved to slowly to resolve issues accurately.  Communications were their biggest issue.
good,"New culture trying to be instilled across the company, data driven and pushing for the sharing information to order to make better decisions by breaking down silos that have long existed within the company."
good,"Good place to work, career ladder is vague, culture is cliquish, and uncertainty is abundant within the industry.  Pay is great, benefits are great, management is good, but there are too many chiefs and not nearly enough workers."
good,"Great company, wonderful benefits. But its very high stress and your work goes home with you at the end of the day, whether you are salary or hourly. Great job for college grads, but once you are more established or would like to start a family, the balance will be very hard. Do-able, but hard."
good,"Always something to do and learn. Very quiet workplace. You are responsible for completing your own tasks and ensuring that they are completed in a timely manner. If help is needed, it is up to you to find the correct answers."
good,"Working with measurement, pipeline and compression departments to produce systems utilized in the natural gas industry."
good,"Good place to work,offers many challenges and opportunities for those who pursue them, salary, benefits are excellent, change is a constant"
good,"This is a great company in a booming industry, but entry level employees do not receive the attention/training that a future-minded company should give."
good,Work requires much traveling daily.
good,Previous executive management were clueless how to run an oil and gas company. New management is creating a more streamlined company with high expectations of their employees.
good,"Great Job, Great Staff and Great Company which I have worked so hard for after 37 years fell through due to OPEC cutting Oil Prices more than 50%+."
good,"An integrated energy company with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that acquired Rice Energy, making it the largest natural gas producer in the United States."
good,Great pay and benefits. Great mapping team. Only problem natural gas work is cyclical. I wish gas prices would stabilize
good,"I am thankful for my time with EQT.  I was given numerous promotions ultimately ending up as a Director.  Though I ultimately was unsatisfied with my final supervisor, all leaders prior to him were excellent."
good,"This company was great for job security, but lacked in company culture, as it was not very diverse."
good,Early years were great then there was to much stress. Working on your supervisors value drivers before your own created a stressful environment. Value Drivers began to be outrageous and not apart of your normal job.
good,"Work life balance is not great.  Pay and benefits are very good.  Career advancement from within could be improved.  Moving to Southpointe should be a bonus, reducing travel and parking costs."
good,"The compensation structure at EQT is great.  If you're looking for a challenging opportunity that requires employees to be at the highest level of efficiency, this place is for you."
good,"Very demanding atmosphere, but very rewarding in terms of salary and bonus potential. Management not prone to recognize you in other ways for hard work. Difficult to advance or receive promotions. Overall tendency to not have faith in their employees."
good,Great company with great benefits. Will be interesting to see how new management does running the largest natural gas producer in the nation. Great work life balance.
good,Currently transitioning from Upstream/Midstream Oil & Gas company to strictly Upstream Production company. Excellent compensation and benefits with 9/80 work week and vacation based on years of service in the industry.
good,I work in land admin. The company treats employees well. The company employs the 9/80 work week.
good,"Very busy place to work, entering Lease information in database. Worked with Landmen on lease acquisitions, managed check request for bonus payments.  People here were like family."
good,I enjoy working at EQT. It has a good work environment with allowing you as an employee to learn & grow to better yourself. Very team & goal oriented.
good,"Innovation driven culture, always looking for a new improvement. Prides itself as a low cost (lowest cost) producer, but still willing to spend a little extra to test something new."

good,I enjoyed working here for most of the time I was an employee.  I got along well with all of my managers and fellow coworkers but I was unfortunately laid off due to economics.
good,I enjoyed my time at EQT.  I was constantly busy and learning each day.  I moved up through the ranks quickly.  The people were the best part of the job.  EQT offers a great benefit package.
good,"I genuinely love my roll at EQT, I am just looking to relocate eventually and see what all the industry has to offer.  I do not have anything bad to say about my current position."
good,"In production, a typical day consists of reviewing and processing accounts receivable from multiple vendors. Updating and maintaining the Bill of Lading spreadsheet for the all the water being hauled to the different well pads. Entering and updating all the costs in well view for the water haulers. Also, communicating with the engineering managers, vendors, and field technicians resolving old wells, closed GL codes, and JIRA tickets takes up some more time of the day. The day goes by so fast because there is always work to be done in production.  "
good,"I have only been there a short time, but everyone seems to be proactive and productive. I especially like that the bus drops off and picks up right in front of the building - no more parkway hassles."
good,Land Internship. I really enjoyed my summer at the company and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to work for EQT.
good,EQT was a fun and exciting place to work that provided excellent compensation and daily challenges. Executive management is a little too secretive about the direction of the company and absolutely refuses to give any notice what so ever of layoffs.
good,"Hit the door running first thing in the morning.  Review of wells and accounts take care of most critical issues ASAP.  Work on any and all calls/messages from field guys and customers.  Pay bills, order and work with vendors for supplies as needed."

good,"I love my job and the people I work for.  The company is good to its employees.  I hate to be looking elsewhere, but sometimes location is the key."
good,I very much enjoy my job at EQT.  I stay busy and have learned a lot.  My supervisor allows me the freedom to do my job and knows I will get guidance and advice as needed.  The hardest part of my job is a lack of communication with other employees and a delay in them getting needed information to me.  I find my job enjoyable because I like what I do and the people I work with.
good,Company was looking to revamp approach many of it's functions in a very competitive market.  Excellent visibility within the organization and access to top level managers.  Very exciting dynamic place to work
good,EQT is an excellent place to work with phenomenal benefits and compensation.  The company has a clear vision of where they are headed headed. They reward employees based on merit and encourages innovative contributions. EQT compensates appropriately for the work-life balance. They also promote career development and encourage their employees to increase their education.

good,Great people to work with. Friendly environment. EQT has great engineers that are easy to work with and very helpful. Working with EQT has been a good experience
good,"Everyone seemed to be very collaborative and focused on career growth, which was incredibly helpful. A typical day in the office could get fairly quiet, though were a few happy hours/lunches with the team."
