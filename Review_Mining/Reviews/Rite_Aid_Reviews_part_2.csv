My typical day a work is either opening the  store doing the daily task and everyday is different,or do the closing shift. and some days I work a double shift. Everyday is a learning day either from your coworkers or our customers.  In a Management position you learn to reword your questions and show and ask instead of order a person what to do.  In the work place you need to get along as a team player. The hardest part of a job is really nothing.  just keeping learning to get ahead of the game and make the customer number one.  The most enjoyable part of the job is just keep smiling at all your customers."

good,Working at Rite Aid taught me a lot about customer service. Working in the pharmacy department has taught me what people are looking for in a retail setting. One of the hardest part of working at Rite Aid is customer satisfaction and constantly putting the customer first. The most rewarding part was having the customer happy at the end of the day!
good,"My opinion is colored by the fact I was an intern with the company while I was in pharmacy school, so it was not my everyday experience for the majority of the time that I worked for them."
good,very productive and friendly place to work
good,I loved my coworkers. They were all really nice and we had a lot of fun together. The manager was really good about working around my schedule. She would always let me off when I needed off.

Once done helping drop off window go to the computer and start typing prescriptions into computer system, as well as answering phones and directing calls.

My experience as a Technician has increased, I am more faster at typing prescriptions and my professional skills has improved as well. I worked with about 10 employees in the pharmacy which included 6 technicians 2 pharmacist and 2 cashiers.  My former co-workers were very friendly and helpful.
