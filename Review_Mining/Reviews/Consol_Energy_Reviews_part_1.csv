bad,"Bring you in... In two months took pension away, continually took benefits and perks away.  Constantly changes supervisors, managers and job duties.  They have no idea how to run a gas company.  After 2+ years they decided to cut 1800 jobs.  Cuts not based on performance, just last 1800 hired were first 1800 fired.  They kept dead beats and unskilled folks, while laying off some highly qualified and motivated workers."
bad,"They create a culture of fear by making everyone think their job is always at risk.  Management makes you feel that your best is never good enough.  Morale is low due to job security.  After laying off several crucial employees, people are left with too much work.  They have cut all benefits."
bad,"Started out as a great employer. Then things turned cut throat when asked to relocate from Va to Pa Operations. Found out they only like their kind, not minority friendly."
bad,He worked countless hours in unsafe conditions through the years . He worked on thaw shed heaters and pier before they were removed by asbestosis abatement. The Electrical maintenance manager was Incompetent man who wouldn't order correct supplies because he wouldn't leave his comfortable chair. My husband contacted Asbestosis and died 2 and one half short years after diagnosis. Boss never called him. Company let him go because he couldn't work due to lung fibroids. This company has treated me the widow terribly.
bad,"Stay clear.  There a lot of ideas but no tangible plans to make them a reality.  Very PC to a fault.  There is a lack of experience in exploration to take advantage of the market.  Take a long look in the mirror before you leave you're current location to work here.  There's a reason they call the headquarters the ""Death Star""."
bad,The double talk from the management combined with the good ol boy network made the place less than ideal for someone who was not connected with the establishment.
bad,Work 60-72 hours a week no family time and get treated poorly!
bad,"I've been working at enlow fork for 8 years as soon as the current CEO took over and started taking all the coal profits and dumping into his precious gas company, the mine has taken a nose dive.  They will not put any money into equipment.  Everything underground is falling apart.  Our average run time is about 3hrs a shift the rest of the time the equipment is broke down."
bad,"The company as a whole has undergone a massive restructuring, which is a difficult environment to thrive in. Lots of moving parts, and shifting jobs, in a few years it'll be great!"
bad,"Good pay, good employees, terrible upper management. The micromanaging is running this company in the ground. They are operating it for today, and not planning for the future. It’s a shame, it used to be an excellent place to work! Everyone in upper management has their own agenda, the days of working together as a team are long gone. As sad as it sounds, it’s the truth!"
bad,company would promote management to try to intimidate hourly workers. did not enjoy working for them. they would constantly berate employees.
bad,"7 day a week operation which requires rotating shifts weekly"
bad,"company once was a family oriented company,within the last few years,company went down hill fast,you are just a number at this company"
bad,"Known for lay offs throughout their history. Poor management decisions such as: hired way too many people prior to planning to ramp up drilling in 2015. Then had to fire all the people because of poor prices. Company may be going under or bought out soon. "
bad,ok place to work if all you like to do is work. don't know what else to say and this won't let me continue until i say more
bad,The company pays well but they are in a constant flux between hiring and lay-offs.  Upper Management is a mess.  They have people in roles that they are not qualified for.  Proceed at your own risk.
bad,"The only positive thing would be the money,and the frienship bonds you make. Your truly putting your health at risk with this job. The upper management does not listen to the employees and makes changes as the hours go by. They make your job very difficult changing policies so often. I will give them a tip of the hat trying to promote safety, however in the end getting coal out will always be # 1. You truly look forward to spending what little time you have with your family and you can just about bet on them drafting you on one of your days off leaving you with only one day off. that's not positive for home or work !"
bad,Management was poor. I was expected to work about 70-80 hours  per week with no overtime and I would go a few weeks before I had a day off.
good,"Has been a great company,  I have learned many skills that I will take with me in life. This company has changed greatly in the last few years that I don't agree with."
good,"work different shifts every week"
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was working with the hourly employees. Upper management lacked the ability to relate to anyone  below their pay grade. Lots of policies, no praise for any job done well, but critizing was imediate if things did not go as plannned."
good,My department co-workers were great. My supervisor always took the time to explain something new to me. They were very accommodating to anything that came up in my personal life.  I learned a lot. Our group worked well as a team and I enjoyed my job.
good,a great place to earn a living great co-workers.some of the supervisors are great and will take your input as serious. the hardest part of this job is them wanting you to work fifteen hours in one day. best part is having a job at a great establishment
good,"- 12 hours on/12 hours off, 1 week on/1 week off, & they could call you in at anytime"
good,"Transformed and trying to rebuild. Bad management, Micro-management it is ok if you like to be micro managed. The company may succeed but will be hard and employees will face cuts before it gets better."
good,Most day to day activities were support help desk and solve problems. Learning was outside of work or learn as you go. People were great and the personnel they had was great. The job was always changing and projects were always being added. Most projects were not completed before you moved on to the next project. VP and executives were very poor at best and did not understand the workload or scope of projects.
good,Good place to work. Poor life/work balance. Good compensation and generally good people. Not very stable environment at in the current economy/culture.
good,There has been a major downturn in the commodities industry and as a result CONSOL has been forced to lay off a large percentage of their work force.
good,"Start work at 6am, went underground an went to sections an started mining coal then when a piece of equipment went down id examine the equipment an diagnose it an go get the equipment needed to resolve the issue."
good,"*Work day was long hours with many challenges."
good,"Lower management has improved in the past few years."
good,Overall a good job. I would have never left but they sold our job to another company that had financial troubles. They take care of their people. I hate that it worked out like it did.
good,"work way to much with not enough people to be successful. ran the day to day maintenance operations. worked every fourth of July, because of shutdowns."
good,Consol Energy has been undergoing a transitional period throughout my tenure with the company.  Consol is a legacy coal producer converting the company's vision to adopt natural gas as it's main focus.  I am very grateful for the opportunities provided by management for my development.  I enjoy the amount of trust and responsibility provided by management to challenge me.
good,"Entry level program, little responsibility, lots of learning and entry level tasks.  Good program for new graduates, could be improved for those with work experience."
good,"good workforce, people easy to work with.learned all phases of mining.constantly being trained on new things.hard to maintain production quatas, they changed all rhe time."
good,"Hard work, didnt like using equipment for some jobs they would rather use manual labor. A clear seperation of boss and employee not allowing for a joint work force"
good,"CONSOL has been a great source of professional experience. I've had the opportunity to work in the generalist function for staff employees and with our coal miners. After three years, I moved into the compensation function. My role in compensation blends the customer service aspect that I enjoyed as a generalist with analytic challenges that make every day interesting."
good,"Typical day was very productive with many opportunities to impact the controllable."
good,I liked working for this company. I would probably still be working for them to this day if a set of unfortunate incidents hadn't accord.
good,"At my time spent at Consol Energy things were constantly changing. New policies, paperwork, rules and regulations.  It was hard to keep up with especially when there was no proper communication. Efforts were very high from everyone in management but due to the constant change i feel things got overlooked down to the lower level guys. Ridiculous blanket policies were always being placed and everyone's need to CYA made a stressful environment. Hours were long and it made it very hard to have a family life."
good,"A typical work day would consist of reviewing projects currently in progress and decipher the project plan that would need attention for that day while handling any other requests and/or issues that may have been present."
good,"You go in on time, you mine coal, you learn skills you never thought you could do. You are underground, once you figure out that that little light on your hat is your only light, you learn to walk and work like any other place. Most of your coworkers are there to earn a living, have a little fun and mine coal. The hardest part of the job is going under ground and praying to go back outside at the end of the day. The best part of the day is knowing you are a part of a crew that has pride in what they do."
good,"You can be forgotten in this company due to the amount of employees it has."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is developing successful teams or departments that provide results.  I enjoy the success of my people and my supervisors.  I believe in improving everyday.
good,My experience at Consol is different as a contractor. We do not get a lot of the benefits and perks that permanent employees do although we work in the same environment. Being a contractor that has been with the company for 2 years I have met a lot of people there that are enjoyable to be around and make the work day fly by. It is challenging to advance in this company and you really need to put in a lot of time and effort to meet the right people in doing so.
good,Security check as we came in/out punched in the make our way to our stand with our staff the make nacho and get drinks ready for the event which to place for the day
good,Consol is a good place to work.  I've been here my whole working career.  I'm just looking for a fresh start in a new and upcoming industry.  The company is in the process of transforming from a coal company to an gas E&P company.
good,"This job does not consist of back breaking labor, but the hours and rotating shift can be hard at times. The Management team could use some professionalism improvements. Most all of the co-workers are great people. The pay is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Good paying job, not much home time with rotation shifts. Management is okay for the most part. it is very interesting and exciting process watching the coal be extracted. all and all good place to work"
good,it was the best job I've ever had until recently when they started stripping benefits and never had enough people to cover shifts which resulted in a 70+ Hour week
good,"18 years of some of the finest men and women I have ever had the pleasure of working with in my career.   Upper Management to the hourly worker, from the top ranks to the bottom, you will not find a more dedicated group of tireless,  motivated, goal oriented people in the industry.  A company can only be as good as the PEOPLE who are employed within."
good,"Long hours worked"
good,"The pay is good but the work is tough. You will be putting in a lot of hours in unfavorable conditions. If you dont mind that, then you will be fine working here."
good,"I only completed an internship there about 8 years ago so I don't have much to say about the company except for, while I was working there.. they compensated very well and their employees seemed to really like working for the company."
good,I loved being underground running equipment and doing a job not many people get to experience.Had a very good group of men that i worked with witch made life underground much more enjoyable.
good,Great company to work for.  This company gave me the opportunity to learn several different parts of the mining process and the different ways to extract coal.  Worked well with me while I was attending college
good,Seemed to be a very well put together company from when I was there for my 3 month internship.  I learned alot and it was easy to get along with everyone.
good,"In my current position at Consol Energy, I’ve hands-on extensive experience with Microsoft excel and its tools. I’m performed process optimization, built forecasting model using multi polynomial regression method, and benchmarked the company’s performance with its competitors in U.S."
good,"Consolidation Coal Company was a very employee oriented company.  As years went on and things changed the company evolved."
good,"Good place to work, safe, getting a younger management team"
good,maintained large earth moving equipment. long 12 hour days. shift work changed every week.
good,Working in a Production Section where the Coal is produce off the Miner which you and 8 other guy's work together in a safe and efficient manner for a period of time.
good,Was an ok place to work. Management changed to corporate driven not employee and company driven. Runs lean and to corporate. Ok location but South point is over crowded and ingress and egress issues
good,"Continuously changing direction due to uncertain coal industry. A lot of excellent people work here, some ""good-ole boy"" characteristics in certain departments. Although I am very grateful for the opportunities this company has provided for me, I have a hard time wanting to recommend to a friend or family member due to possible job security issues in the near future due to further regulations coming down the pipe in the coal industry,"
good,Show up early find out what your doing develope a game plan and execute call out production report pay employees examine work areas
good,There has been a major downturn in the commodities market and as a result CONSOL has been forced to lay off a large percentage of it's work force over the last year.
good,"The job was demanding at times.  High pressure situations when critical equipment was inoperable. Solid management team present through my career.  Promoted advancement, flexible when showing interest in continued education.  Routine annual inspections of the site required planning and a team effort."
good,Consol was a good company to work for with good benefits. Unfortunately there was little room for advancement and several layoffs during the time that I worked there. I loved learning new software products and teaching people how to use them.
good,"Good company is good to work for, the pay is great, benefits are good. management cares about the employees. unfortunately it is impacted by the market conditions, and is constantly evolving in order to improve itself."
good,"Able to identify obstacles and eliminate or work around to achieve common goals."
good,Typical day is loading Vessel and unloading coal trains to the yard or to those vessels. lots of moving parts and large machinery. Very strict safety standards. hard part of job going back and forth between day and night shifts.
good,If you don't mind changing shifts every week and working a lot of hours there is a lot of money to be made at CNX. You can pretty much write your own paycheck by signing up for extra shifts.
good,Good place to work to make good money but the rotation of shifts can be overwhelming at times your first year to 5 years you get two weeks off and after that every five years you will get an extra week which is nice
good,The company Knew how to make money and provided a decent working environment. Good place to work great pay. Work/Life balance could be better
good,"A typical day on the job was different depending on where we were in the life cycle of drilling a well.  My day consisted of managing the job site and putting together a plan to keep operations moving forward for the next 12, 24, 48 hrs.  I was responsible for the safety, compliance and budget of the job.  "
good,Company morale could use improvement. Overall day not bad. Everyone works hard and seems to enjoy working there but management has there favorites.
good,Manage daily operations consisting of organizing Well Tenders and Roustabouts each day.Hardest part of job was all the different things that came up each day.Enjoyed my co-workers
good,"Great working environment couldn't imagine better, company works with your needs and doesn't discriminate in any form or fashion"
good,"If you're not accustom to many changes, don't get on the bus. The market environment will have you worried about if you will even have a job the next day. Anything can happen."
good,"consol has been very good to my family. i loved working for such a great company. just happen that the decline in natural gas prices, had eliminated my position."
good,"1)Typical day starts at 5:30 a.m. review fire boss books and make a list of violation to be complete for the next shift. After that I get my call out from the midnight foreman and then update my list of work and supplies. Then day shift is lined up for the work to be accomplished on their shift. Next I get the finals from Midnight and then order supplies according to the needs of the mine. Next I go under ground and check on all the jobs going on throughout the mine. I then come out and review the fire boss books again and up date my list of violations. Next I get an update from the day shift foreman and start planning the afternoon shifts work list. Line up the afternoon shift with their work list. Get the finals from day shift and review the fire boss books from dayshift updating violations on the list and getting the supply report from the yard. wright up the plans for the mid night shift and finalize any orders need for the supplies in the mine. Leave mine at 7:00p.m."
good,In the Oil and Gas Industry there is no thing as a typical day. Ever changing but really enjoy the fact that no two days are alike.
good,"Company is focused, professional and good to its employees.  It provides excellent salaries and benefits and is sensitive to family/personal time needs.  Company is benevolent to community and charitable organizations.  Good place to work."
good,"Loved my crew! Work hard don't slack off and keep production up and everything works out.  I hated to leave, but it was a necessary evil for me.  Miss the good times."
good,I'll come into work start my day by stacking all dirty dishes together preparing them to be thrown inside the dishwasher. Catch the dishes on the other side and properly organize them. After that sweep and mop the floors along with cleaning the kitchen machinery's.
good,"The job itself was great. I enjoyed the labor, and certainly enjoyed the pay, but the life/work balance was a bit much for my taste. The pay was outstanding, but I didn't feel that I had enough time for friends and family."
good,"Great company with above average benefits when I began working for CONSOL Energy, Inc.  With the decline of first the coal industry and then the gas industry layoffs where necessary and that affected the moral of the employees.  I gained knowledge  of many of the aspects of the business.  I worked in many different departments with many different management styles and was always able to adapt.  My final years with CONSOL I worked in the construction department assisting the director and 4 project managers.  We worked as a cohesive team and supported each other.  I am the type of person that enjoys being busy with a whatever it takes attitude.  I enjoyed getting up every morning and going to work."
good,"I worked with the other employees at Consol Energy for 4 years. I spent more time with them than my real family. I enjoyed my job, even though it was stressful. I managed the suspense accounts, royalty owners whose funds were suspended due to address hold, ssn hold, etc. I assisted with disbursement orders and supplemental orders from the Division of Oil and Gas Board. "
good,"it was a nice place to work, good money, nice people, safe place to work."
good,"I would get to work, dress in work clothes and ride elevator down approx 1500 feet underground. Bosses would tell you where to go and what needed done. Guys work well together. I learned how to operate some new equipment."
good,Safe and stable work environment. Consol in one of the highest aying company's for electrians. It is a growing company and has alot of careers to offer
good,"Lived on drilling location 26 weeks/year working 12 hr shifts. "
good,"Booming industry, great company benefits and compensation"
good,My review upon Consol Energy is that its a decent workplace. Its not made for everyone. Only those who have good work ethics can manage this job.
good,"A work place that placed education, safety and compliance as core values.   This was demonstrated through safety and compliance training to all employees."
good,"good company to work for, reliable and good to workers, employees are good to work for, always asking have employee is doing good family oriented, very productive"
good,"A typical day out on the river as a deckhand was to be gone for two weeks at a time, with one week home. I absolutely enjoyed working for Consol Energy all four years and was challenged everyday. My management and co workers were great to be around and made it the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest job unfortunately was to be away for two weeks and one week home, especially when I started a family not long ago. Altogether, Consol Energy was an outstanding company to work for, however the traveling consistently was not working out."
good,"Good company to work for, the hours are OK the rotating shifts take a bit to get used to and balance your life around.  Time normally flies at work and before you know it your shift is done."
good,Move over 1 millionsyards of rock with rock loader
good,"very good work environment, often times shift work scheduled in advance. great pay and benefits and great working environment among coworkers and always kept in the loop by higher management."
good,"CONSOL is a hard-working, focused company.  They employ many positive management techniques, encouraging innovation and expression.  Cultural changes are underway to allow a better work/life balance."
good,"Productive work environment where I was able to learn about the entire process of oil & gas leasing, including, but not limited to leases, W-9 forms, easements, source deeds, mineral reservations, etc."
good,its safe place to work great pay. Good benefits and great people to work with. Ive learned a lot there learned how to run all the equipment in a miner section and how move a long wall
good,"very good company to work for, safety first, friendly people, good pay, good benefits.  overall it was a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work included all types of labor. I had my assistant mine foreman papers so I did a lot of fire bossing. I also did a lot of roof bolting and other labor jobs. I learned to work in a team environment and how to reach your goals and meet time sesitive jobs on time. Management was intelligent and also hard working. My co-workers were all hard workers and i got along with all of them. The hardest part of the job was working 7 days a week plus overtime. The most enjoyable part of the job was of course the good pay but also learning a great deal about hard work, team work, and what it is like working for a great company."
good,Great people in a challenging environment.  Fast paced job.
good,"I enjoy working for Consol , and I enjoy learning new things."
good,"Mining is a tough job. Pays very well.  Does not leave much time for a home life.  Have to decide which is more important, making lots of money or spending time with your family."
good,"Great job, but open to layoffs with commodities pricing. People were great and had a sense of pride in the community we worked in. Field operations were paid extremely well."
good,"I work as a contractor and do not get paid what I am worth, and I would love to get on permanent.  Consol is looking to sell the company coal's side of the business."
good,"The downturn in the coal industry and the temporary downturn in natural gas certainly put this company into survival mode, however my experience there was still positive.  I agreed with many of upper managements decisions as a whole.  The focus on workplace safety being a number one priority and empowering the employee to act regarding safety says a lot about a company.  The overall culture of the company was one of teamwork.  Ideas may be presented and do work their way through.  I will always look back at my time will Consol Energy with pride and accomplishment."
good,I love Consol they are a great company to work for. They treat everyone very well. They have a clear vision of what they want the company to become by learning from the past.
good,"Time studied continuous miner, and long wall panels. I have assisted with various projects, life line, Federal MSHA Inspectors, DEP State Inspectors, mine tours, hazard training, don and transfer classes. I have also assisted with the mine engineer at Robinson Run to prepare the mine maps with ventilation updates and mine gas well permits for the yearly mine inspections. I have traveled to Bailey, Enlow Fork, Shoemaker, Blacksville, Robinson Run and Loveridge"
good,"really friendly people. good place to work. ................................."
good,Consol energy is one of the best companies to work for.  Every day safety was the upmost priority by management and the works as well. Long  hrs and great pay.
good,"A typical day involved 10 hours minimum starting with arriving at work and getting ready to go underground. Once ready you started with daily shift books and call outs, receiving a call from the on shift foreman of your section or work group. This call would included everything that happened on the previous shift and what you needed to prepare for or follow up on on your shift. Once shift itself started, you spent your 8+ hours in dark, dangerous condition of being several hundred to 1000+ feet underground. For this reason you come to be a family with the men around you. You learned loyalty and respect for one another since these were your co-workers, brothers and sisters, your emergency help if things went bad and your family when someone had a bad day or had to rely on them for help. Management was every bit involved with the crews as the crew members. Most were treated just like any other member of the crew. Management more hours there than anyone else. I myself enjoyed every aspect of the job. No two days were the same even though the job itself was. Conditions could change in one cut and therein lie the challenge of being prepared, having a plan, and training. The hardest part was adjusting to the darkness, especially in the winter when you may see the light of day on day shift for only a few minutes each day. Overall, Consol Energy was one of the best companies i have ever worked for and I regrettably had to leave, but will continue to cherish the memories of the people i worked with and the lives who touched me while i was there."
good,"Great company to work. I only wish they had not sold their coal mining companies to Murray Energy. CNX , at times went above and beyond to ensure their employees and their families were well taken care of."
good,You showed up for work and when you got to your assignment you did your job.  Always had the tools for the job also was good work conditions didn't do stuff that wasn't safe.
good,Supportive management and ability to learn all you want. Great health insurance and vacation time. Education refund and in house training and classes.
good,"I started working at Consol when I was 18 at $14/hour in a coal preparation plant. I worked for the company for an additional 3 years and learned many many skills. Engineering interns receive a $4/hour raise every returning year. In my time at Consol I worked at a prep plant, surface mine, and 5 underground mines. It was a great job with great pay, and I learned a lot."
good,"The superintendent knows all of the employees by their first name.  He is very approachable, fair, and willing to listen.  He expects everyone to do their job but he does not micromanage."
good,Great People to work for. Great benefits Great Pay. Enjoyed working here
good,"As a foreman trainee (intern) I get to assist in various jobs on a daily basis. This industry is primarily teamwork oriented with safety being the number one concern. My fellow co-workers are experienced miners who teach me something new each day while watching out for my safety. This is a unique industry with its own language, specialized skills and training. Each day is like a new adventure."
good,I enjoyed working for Consol Energy for 13 years.  Unfortunately my time was shortened due to them selling the mine I last worked at for them to Murray Energy.  They were conciensous on safety which is a big plus when it comes to working in the mines.  I recieved all of my certifications from the classes that Consol offered.  I wish I was still working for them.
good,"Previously one of the best places to work in our geographic area. Compensation adequate for responsibility, good benefits. Good environment. Unfortunately the upper management in the corporate locate in Pennsylvania decided to close the local office."
good,I really really really really like what I do it is very fulfilling to me to make sure the miners are all safe underground. And to go home everyday with that filling.
good,"Consol Energy is a great place to work. You are treated as a team player. The management staff is impeccable. The work environment is friendly and ever ready to be of help. Truly, the hardest part of the job is the commute. Working there taught me to have no qualms about relying on others for assistance. The CONSOL environment is all about teamwork."
good,"I worked for consol energy for 12 years ,,They had great benefits , insurance,401k,life ins. And great pay. And they are great with safety,I really miss working for them"
good,"GREAT! Worked well with others, listened to the older workers, learned from them, they learned from me, Made the job SAFE, Trained employees on equipment"
good,"CONSOL is a very good place to work, however, at times can be extremely stressful.  At one time I had an extremely difficult boss, but that was the only negative."
good,"Reviewed gas leases and input royalty amount into royalty accounting system."
good,was very satisfied with job . went to dominion coal more money and advancement
good,Repaired Coal mine networks and computers. I would handled Belt monitors and systems i also repaired the mine tracking systems
good,Every day at work is something to look forward to at Consol Energy. The ever growing natural resource company is very diversified and is efficiently run. I love all of the people that I have met and the human resources department is wonderful to work with. Best company that I have ever worked for.
good,"Consol Energy was my dream job. I appreciated the aspects of what I was taught, my learning experiences gained, education on being safe & At Zero policies and procedures. I appreciated every day that I was at the company & it will be a part of my heart and soul for life."
good,Consol Energy provides a good income along with great insurance for my family.  They have always given quarterly safety bonuses and much more.
good,"Get to work, and put on my mining gear."
good,my review of consol is that it was the best job i ever had management was allways good to me safety was back seat to no one i hope that down through time i wiil get called back thanks
good,"My typical day at work consists of different events of entertainment such as; family functions, concerts, live music, Food, good environment for guests as well as co-workers."
good,"Good stable company to work for, one of largest energy companies in the world. Very stable"
good,Consol Energy is a Great place for employment opportunities.
