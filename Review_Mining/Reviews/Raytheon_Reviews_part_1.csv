rating,review
bad,I was interviewed as a site lead. Unfortunately there was no site lead therefore no direction. One of my co-workers found it her daily mission to harass me everyday for one reason or another. When the team lead was finally brought on from Raytheon he did nothing to alleviate the hostile work environment only adding to it.
bad,Security field is without oversight or ethics.  Company lays off employees 100 at a time with no severance and no reeducation.   Company claims to value veterans but contracts out 100 positions to a subcontractor that causes incomes to be reduced by 50٪.  Those 100 were about 80 percent.   Several died because of loss of health insurance and lack of health resources after loosing income.
bad,"As a Senior Quality Engineer, one of the worst company that I have ever worked in my life. Poor management, with no experience and background. I was not getting paid enough. I had to worked in Raytheon to have my experience in my resume. Over all, I do not recommend to anyone"
bad,"Straddling responsibilities between two organizations is never easy."
bad,Poor Employees morale and bad management from the top down could use an over hall. I would not recommend to Sailors Airmen or Marines because the pay sucks
bad,"Don't work at Raytheon in Fullerton Ca"
bad,"The compensation package was more competitive than most of the other Defense Contractors.  Working on site, I had minimal contact with Raytheon Management, however they completely supported the contractors in the field when needed."
bad,GM manager brought in and ran the department as a auto manufacturing plant.  Got rid of planners and made manufacturing engineer planners.  The was not a good move
bad,"Management is not efficient.  Lots of nepotism majority related to management. If one person doesn't like you then all of management doesn't like you.  They will not let you advance, give you horrible reviews & except you to train contractors/new hires. No leadership, do not give you access to programs to do your job! Set you up for failure. Arrive to work everyone in cafeteria during work hours.  Rules apply to certain individuals Do not train you- it's do or die. Lots of favoritism.  Department managers are like used car salesman. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to work at Raytheon."
bad,"Mostly redacted. Joined onto a failing project/contract, Most employees were just trying to save their rear. Some top cover but director seemed to enjoy passing the blame."
bad,"HR is absolutely terrible, situations not explained at all and false information was provided by HR. Not even allowed to actually start new position. HR very unprofessional"
bad,As sated above. Raytheon had a ridiculously horrible deadlines only because they wanted to outbid the competitor and never thought about the amount of staff or resources needed to refurbh=ish the equipment for the client. Which always ended up having everyone else run around like insane people trying  to figure it out. 100 plus hours a week is insane and often times didn't feel like I had a life at all.
bad,Raytheon had purchased a small company name Telemus. The employees were bitter the company was sold to Raytheon and I was the first Raytheon employee to  come to that facility. There was no security program. The employees did not take kindly to change. I didn't make it  a year.
bad,Not a Great Place in my opinion;  Culture is a major factor.  Many of Mgmt have been there a while and they all know each other.  Many are set in their antiquated ways and don't readily welcome creativity or innovation.
bad,"They don't care what good you have done, you are just one foot out the door when they have their money and you don't."
bad,Raytheon Albuquerque treat female engineer really bad and unethical.  3- Friends fights all the time and they are the managers.  They talk bad about their colegue to their customer.  This is illegal to do.  They do not understand the simple CDRLs delivery requirements.
bad,if you did not have a dead piec of paper you could not advance in the company. managers will stab you in the back. all the time and effort you put into a career them they tell you when something goes wrong your out and it was just a job.
bad,great for a fresh college grad or an old person. The main focus of this company is for defense . Think standing at the DMV when applying. Average is mandatory.
bad,"No goods manger liz is trash"
bad,"My expectation from this 4-month long Ethics investigation was to restore my reputation and integrity and hopefully my position.  I have over 7 years of working for Raytheon, and completed all of the mandatory Ethics Courses.  In my opinion, this case was the most Unethical, Non Impartial and one sided Judgmental investigation ever."
bad,Horrible company. They dont treat the employees fair. I work all day yet get no respect. I would never work here again and my coworkers think the same.
bad,Very disorganized and complete disregard for their employees.  You never know what is going on and communication is terrible.  They basically count on you not being willing to find another job and stick it too you. There are MUCH better places to work in Louisville that here.
bad,The job was stressful when working with someone who always complaint about the work load or the time that was taken to do the job on a daily basic. Not recommended.
bad,"Maintained the departments library.  Repaired RPG, cables, tracking equipment.  Used the computer to input the parts used for the day. The people I worked with were family to me. We worked together. I looked forward to going to work. Many times we worked 10 hours a day. We also worked every holiday."
bad,Raytheon says they are employee centered and support the employees. But they do not follow what they say they do! If you take time off to spend with family. Management gets on you for taking the time even if it was scheduled previously! The upper management does not support it's employees or managers/supervisors. There was a change re-organization in the company. Things change at that time and not for the better of the employees.
bad,"Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems is the worst place I have worked.  Diversity is a joke.  A strong good-ol-boy network, nepotism and gender discrimination create a distorted and closed environment.  Management uses fear, intimidation and bullying to control and manipulate employees.  When business is down, employees are wrongfully terminated or harassed into quitting instead of laid off.  The official culture is supposed to value respect, but this could not be farther from the truth.  Respect is used as a tool against employees.  HR and management will fabricate and distort facts claiming an employee behaved disrespectfully which will then be used as grounds for termination.  Appeals to the top level of HR are useless.  Salaries are frozen among the different functions by management decisions made behind the scenes.  Hiring managers lie to get people to accept offers.  New hires are sabotaged by their peers.  Do not work here."
bad,"contract work is ending need to find a new job asap. there is no advancement and need to provide for my family "
bad,"Mckinney Texas,"
bad,"Company is one of the best in the world, although management in El Paso site could be the worst in the nation, improving management would give company a great boost in El Paso site, also employees need to be awarded the salary they really deserve, not just what management thinks would be the best to achieve their goals and bonuses."
bad,Company didn't really have good benefits and PTO. Company doesn 't provide notice for layoff. Company have little opportunities to move up.
bad,"Raytheon (Waco, Texas Division)"
bad,"If you report quality issues to your management and they don't act on these issues and if you report these quality issues higher, you are deemed and labeled a trouble-maker, and you WILL be retaliated against through your performance evaluation. Performance evaluations determine whether you receive a pay raise and if you are given a bad performance, forget about any type of raise; not even a 1%. If you contact Human Resources for anything pertaining to quality issues that your management ignored, human resources is your worst enemy! If you are an off-site employee, you are on your own; Management will not support you!"
bad,"Employee needs are an afterthought, i.e. base access, toilet facilities, parking, morale, potable water. Health insurance rates are 5% of base pay or more. Mis-appropriation of assets, using target assets for manager work area beautification."
bad,"Ongoing layoffs and declining in size for quite a few years. A lot of deadwood here, as well as incompetent management. Morale and motivation levels are very low."
bad,A typickal day was reviewing documents or performing audits.
bad,This company likes to categorize workers into neet job codes. It is very difficult to cross train and the company does not openly support furthering education.
bad,"operate a combination of CRT/keyboard/VCS to simulate the actions and communication of pilots and remote ATC facilities during medium- and high-fidelity training exercises. Remote Pilot Operators receive voice commands from student ATCS's, input proper entries into the automated system to simulate pilot actions, translate displayed information into appropriate ATC terminology, and respond to the student via the VCS utilizing proper phraseology."
bad,"Worst ""expletive""environment/management/scope of work/mutual aid partner ever! This experience even made my employment at Rural/Metro.......or better yet, McDonald's during high school seem enjoyable. If you like to be dragged along under the pretense that a department and management wants to become a progressive fire anad emergency services provider, but never actually do anything to improve......this is the place for you!!!!!!"
bad,"Raytheon UK has the worst engineering culture  it’s a boy’s club with the worst gender pay gap. Management structure lacks any flexibility, It’s the worst of the 70s management style. Most of engineers are over stressed and many suffer of mental health issues due to the working culture."
bad,"Many many EEO complaints have been filed and this company fosters discrimination on so many levels.  Mostly Caucasian Male leadership, very few females and minorities in top positions."
bad,Pay grade is a determining factor of the way other employees address you on a professional or personal level. If you ask any staff member they will tell you that you are just a number to management.
bad,"If you have any sort of work ethic, leadership will take advantage and overwork you while the lazy employees get paid the same or even more than you. Lazy employees are promoted above hard-working employees. Hard-working employees go through mandatory unpaid OT, while lazy employees get paid for OT they didn't work. These lazy employees will take credit for another's work."
bad,"This company runs itself like a sweat shop. They say they like six sigma, yet the legacy people feed off of this place, not intending to retire or leave and discourage new ideas that in turn run off new talent. I don't see younger people staying at Raytheon, unless there are no alternatives for them elsewhere. Management does not want to see or hear about problems and the cut throat environment is highly encouraged."
bad,Poor organisation yoy get a start date and nothing is set up for you supervisors and lead hands running about with no clue management look down there nose at you if walk past them understaffed in thw wrong areas to many people sitting at desks thinking they know whats going on and they dont a company thats only instrested in profits with no intrest in workers and dire comunication skills company wide
bad,"Company primary concern is with the bottom line. It was very difficult getting the benefits set up correctly required many, many phone calls. While the schedule was for ""off every other Friday,"" work load does not allow for benefit."
bad,"RPS talks a good talk but management does not back up what they claim they will do. It is all about the money, not the employee. Would not recommend to anyone to work for Raytheon in Troy with the current management team in place. The people were great but poorly managed."
bad,"Good salary, too much micromanagement, work not well coordinated."
bad,My manager was inempt at best. At one minute he was giving direction to complete a task within 4 days by the end of the day he was carrying on why the task had not been completed. Since he was the only one to apply for the job he got it.
bad,"Raytheon is not transparent with contractors. They will promise 40 hours a week, but they do not tell you that the hours a week available is based on the amount of projects in the pipeline. They tend to hire alot more contractors than they have work for. contracting is very unstable in this company and they RARELY promote contractors to perm instructional design positions. They prefer to hire directly and not move contractors into perm positions."
bad,Not very much diversity...culture is not very flexible..big on technology but management still does a lot of manual processing. the manual processing gets in the way of doing the job efficiently and effectively
bad,"Very disappointed in the management, they play favorites.  No way of knowing your status of a promotion and management will say you are in for promotion next go around, but doesn't go through.  I was not challenged and hated what I was doing.  Not all of Raytheon is like this, it all depends on your manager and I got stuff with a bad one."
bad,"When I received my job offer from Raytheon, I was very excited.  I thought I'd be joining a dynamic organization that treats everyone fair and equally as well as joining a team that really wanted to make a difference.  Sadly, that turned out not to be my experience there."
bad,"I was constantly given recruitment assignments that were cancelled when I had already invested 30-50 hours in successfully getting a cue of highly qualified candidates. To make matters worse, I was blamed for ""not making any hires."" It was a total nightmare."
bad,Just a number. Company is too big.  Too many processes that make no sense. They just do it to do it.  Offered new suggestions and they say no this is how we do it here.
bad,Very political and poorly run company. They needed to put more training into there management. And focus more on treating people equally regardless of job title or education. Your employees are one of your most important assets. And everybody should feel they are a asset. Hardest part of job was staying positive in hostile work environment.The best part of the job was the time off and benefits. Many of those benefits are being removed over time.
bad,"People are encouraged to tattle on each other.  I've never had to CYA more in my 30+ year career than here.  I worked in Missile Systems.  Management treats people terribly because nearly everyone is tied to the retirement program or they are temporary employees, and, therefore, disrespected. Also, its the biggest game in town in Tucson - nowhere else to work in that area.  VERY political."
bad,"I have always had a successful career but when joining Raytheon at Glenrothes I found quickly that the management were just bullies, the processes were non existent and the role was not as advertised.  If you want to join as a project manager and be blamed for things completely outside you control, sit and produce 150 page powerpoints on a daily basis and have very demeaning managers who don't trust anyone to do anything then this might be the job for you.  The resource turnaround is unreal.  Within the 6 months I worked there I saw at least 10 people come and leave after a few weeks in the role and also others bullied to force to resign.  You have been warned."
bad,"Raytheon is a wonderful company. Benefits are amazing, management is top of their class. Working in a production setting produces peaks and valleys therefore resulting in ever adjusting production pool with increases and decreases."
bad,Management needs a real shakeup. People in place who are not capable and do not have enough functional knowledge.
bad,I really enjoyed the job and the folks I worked with and the qa work was different scopes of qa
bad,"Raytheon is one company that I will never work for again and have advised many not to do so as well.  They don't care about you as a person and will fire you once they loose a contract.  "
bad,"Terrible Management, toxic material exposure, lots of stress, poor benefits, terrible morale."
bad,Lack of treating employees with respect by management and constant turnover. Management not qualified to be in management positions.
bad,"Very stressful place to work When it's micromanaged."
bad,"If you like staring at your computer all day, and management doing whatever they want without consequences, then go for it. Enjoy your time checking boxes and filling out spreadsheets."
bad,"Who you report to can make or break your career.  In my case, the management drove me away.  Basically, they were clueless and did not have a good handle on their roles.  We were expected to do the job of 3 people while the expectations were not at all clearly stated - very chaotic and stressful.  In my case, comments appeared on my performance review that I was not even aware of and I didn't have a chance for redress before they became a permanent part of my record - not good!  The comments were false and easily disputable.  There were other things as well, but this was the final straw for me which is why I chose to leave.  RMS has a huge employee retention problem and this is just one example of why."
bad,"A lot of egos at Raytheon and severe lack of professionalism, too many people more content with making them selves look good rather than looking at the bigger picture."
bad,"Enjoyed my job, didn't like the harassment that I received from other Raytheon employees. Poor management and I would not recommend working at Raytheon."
bad,"Raytheon is a company that treats their employees like cattle, often ignoring them and not considering how they can help grow the company, business and clients. "
bad,I should have looked at my time differently while I was there but it was the worst job I've ever had.  There is no drive for results or change only to cover perceptions.
bad,Raytheon in Louisville KY is the worst place I ever worked.  MRP does not work at all. turnover in procurement was over 75 % upper management knew there were problems and did nothing to fix them. had 3 managers in 13 months
bad,"Strange wonderland of multiple meetings, unclear responsibilities, and behind the back politics."
bad,"Possibly the worst place I have ever worked! In stark contrast to the values communicated internally, the culture is one of blame, demeaning and disrespect. "
bad,I learned that everything they teach about being ethical is not how they treat their employees. They make it almost impossible to come to work without feeling threatened or feeling uncomfortable.
bad,"If you have low expectations of management support, don't care about cutting corners and enjoy being mistreated, threatened, demeaned, then this is the job for you.  Management cares only about themselves and keeping there jobs, and will throw subordinates to the wolves to do so. Its a good ole boys club and as long as your a member, you can do no wrong and face no penalties for your actions. Direction is always verbal and denial the word of the day."
bad,"The co-workers where great, however, the company is more about what is best for the bottom line.  The company doesn't care about their people only how much profit can be made."
bad,"You are expected to work ""casual overtime"" and the raises are low or non-existent, while the company makes record profits and upper management get huge pay increases and bonuses. The culture is filled with people who love war as it is good for business. You are constantly exposed to right wing propaganda and pressured to support it. The management constantly try to pit engineers against the union in the plants in MA, while they move more and more to non-union states. The managers are only concerned with their own careers and will put that ahead of what is good for their employees or the good of the product or customer."
bad,Dulles VA interview process -grilled by senior recruiters who appeared to find fault at all cost. Potential racial bias.Left hanging regarding outcome.Terrible experience
bad,Weekly NO-NOTICE tests on material that has nothing to do with your job. Sole purpose is to fire you!
bad,"Constant stress every day"
bad,Working at Raytheon you will be well compensated well but will also be expected to work 60-70 hours per week for that compensation.  At the end of the day you have to decide if the little bit of extra compensation is worth the 60+ weekly hours.  The management team is very old school and has failed to adapt/take on new technologies causing frustration among the younger workers.  There is constant turnover among young employees because refuses to adapt.
bad,Raytheon promised the world when they bought my former company.  They lied.  We received nothing good from the take-over.  I saw the writing on the wall and had to make a decision that was best for my family.
bad,"The only thing good about Raytheon is the Christmas break. Task leads lie about your performance. Every project is behind schedule, too many meetings for waste of time."
bad,"They have a tendency of overworking their employees; provide compensation, but have to endure mismanagement by the higher-ups.  Blatant disregard for professionalism; angry management style."
bad,"Work was ok. Big VMWare shop. Lot's of change management. Wouldn't be so bad except it's ""Tribal Knowledge"".  Do NOT get on the wrong side of security. Really horrible people!!!"
bad,The work culture at Raytheon is very toxic. Several of my friends left due to the negative work environment at Raytheon Missile Systems. I would encourage applying to other defense contractors if that is the line of work you are looking for.  Getting promoted or switching positions within the company is all about seniority. This company is very conservative and cheap. Go work for Northrop Grumman instead! Way better company.
bad,"Unethical culture. They lie on proposals to the government and lie to employees. Promotions are extremely hard to get. They hire from outside rather than promote from within. They pay well but you're selling your soul for that paycheck. If the government requires certain skills or certifications for people working a project, Raytheon will tell you to get it on your own. No training for the job just tons of mandated training because they were caught doing things they shouldn't do (Ethics training, Export compliance training, etc.). Lot's of smart engineers that design good products despite the poor leadership."
bad,Bad work enviroment.  Very political.  Too many politics and drama.  Promotions are based on who you know and not how well you do your job.  Leadership is poor and everyone is just out for themselves.
bad,"Terrible management created an atmosphere of ""do your job or lose it"" was the norm everyday. Even though they advertised work/life as important they took it as a joke."
bad,Moved from California to Kentucky following them after they asked me to. After working for them for 16 yrars my warehouse manager takes me up to the logistics managers office were HR is on the phone and they are telling me I no longer have a job because I am on an overhead budget. Escorted me out the door to my vehicle telling me sorry WOW.
bad,"This company has no desire to take care of their employees"
bad,"Raytheon is by far the worst company I've ever worked for.  In two years I have not gained any useful new skills or knowledge.  Management does not communicate with employees, the engineering processes are overly complex.  It typically takes at least a month to get even the simplest requirement wording change approved."
bad,Worst Management team I have ever worked with or for at any place I have ever been.  There is no vision for the future. The work is boring and you are discouraged from being proactive or creative.
bad,"I wished that RMS offered a pension for employees, but it was eliminated many years ago.  This was a huge incentive in the past that is no longer available.  Health benefits are great.  There is room for improvement in most other areas."
bad,"Used to be the best place to work with great benefits.. With new management, it became unbearable place to work"
bad,"Watch yourself at this company! In the event that you are an inspector and your find quality deficiences and report them, you are subject to being ""blacklisted"" by the Human Resources department in the event you leave this company and would like to return later."
bad,"This part of Raytheon used to be Hughes. Raytheon bought them and now it has the usual corporate atmosphere (do whatever it takes to get a dollar; you can always do some ethics training to repent later). The amount of bias that is shown publicly is amazing. From promotions to job growth, the old adage about who you know is alive and well."
bad,"For the UAV job, Raytheon hires you and then turns over all control of your body to the Army. You are given weekly tests and weekly threats to your job. Don't like it? LEAVE!"
bad,"This place was vibrant around 2003, but through bad management decisions (all over the company), many of the talented people left for greener pastures. They have replaced many of the technical people with those that can make killer presentations, but not much of scientific value."
bad,"After working at Raytheon for a year, I've found the company to be a total disappointment. The job you're hired for isn't the job you actually do,  and what your day-to-day responsibilities are, aren't what matches your education and experience. For example, they place people who have no interest, experience, or educational background into finance activities. You have almost no say in what you do, and new activities are sprung upon the unsuspecting employee. To some, this might be a challenge they accept and welcome, but to most, it's an unwelcome reality. There is a bully environment with inexperienced, uneducated managers and senior staff who have been with the company their whole working lives."
bad,work revolves around unrealistic goals and unrealistic government rules. i do not recommend working here if you have never worked government work previously
bad,The HR and Management are very self centered and have high egos looking out for each other and letting the real working people carrers die and lay off.
bad,"Time in SCIF is high, meaning time learning about new technologies and trends in the industry is low.  Management is very hands-on, often looks over your shoulder.  Raytheon policies removed the fun, hip environment that was a huge advantage as it is rare in government work.  "
bad,"Old Boy Net work,  HR are scared of directors."
bad,I really don't remember a whole lot but I did receive most of my training there.
bad,"This company has black listed me due to finding numerous quality issues with their radars and reporting these issues to higher management. All the management is concerned with is making sure that a contract deadline is met regardless of the quality of the product. I've been black listed for life and was told so directly by one of the managers. I was told that as long as he works there, I'll never be employed by Raytheon again. I have tried numerous times within the last 9 years to be re-employed and nicely told that I don't meet their qualifications even though I worked a total of 8 years for the company."
bad,A typical day at work was paranoid never know witch department would get cut next.
bad,poor training and the supervisors are never on your side. i worked in property management and the women there gossiped and were chatter boxes. they have nothing better to do than tattle tell on you to your supervisor instead of mining their own business.
bad,"Wonderful place to work at the beginning. However it quickly turned to a badly mismanaged, poorly run company. Total lack of vision allowed competitors to completely take over market share. Shame"
bad,"Bad environment, have to walk on egg shells, fake people all over the place. Everybody is ready to stab you in the back for their personal advancement."
bad,I was there to work and not make friends.  If your not buddies with the supervisor it makes things really hard for you. When you take a vacation make sure you get proof ot something that shows your vacation was approved by your supervisor.
bad,"Hired for technical experience but was treated as needed to conform to theri way of doing theings.  They had very poor training on their operation , on theri sytem of doing things.  Had to learn thier owl system of on line documetation plus their new system at same time.  New system was explained by people who just learned it themselves.  It took 10 times longer to use their system to do the work. Technical wqork was documented as if a production environemnt.  When slow everyone was looking for charge numbers.  Important criteria was coming back from break or lunch EXACTLY on time - not technical work.  Ran as a boot camp and not as a professional environment.  Had to learn most of how to do things from other emplyees.  Most of their acronyma and lexicon was different from the real world.  Very stringent environment.  Job description and interview did not portray the very rigid rules.  The worst was learning multiple new production systems (IMRO)  which needed 30 or more clicks and entries to do the simplest things and having to learn this at the same time as their older VM system.  very fe people knew thee new system.  I have had jobs for 20 years and 15 years and this only lasted 60 days.  It took me only 8 days to get two other offers.  technical skills was way less important than taking 11 minutes on a 10 minute break.  I consider timed breaks as very unprofessional for a senior level person as asinine."
bad,"This company lied when they let me go, made up a BS reason on why I was not a good fit. I do not recommend anyone working there.....just awful . Benefits are good, pay is excellent, but it's a cut throat environment."
bad,"HR and management is incompetent.  I appled and was hired for one position, waited 4 months for my clearance, then was placed in a totally unrelated position.  HR screwed up the offer process and the start date."
bad,"The benefits are ok, but not worth the culture of stupidity and the ""good ol' boy"" to make it worth the effort to fill out an application,"
bad,"For all of the reviewers here who make comments like, ""if you get in stay in"", you seriously have a non-performance mindset. Raytheon is a huge company, but 97% of its income comes from the government, thus poor performance is standard and allowable. Simply stated, as an employee there for 6 years, I can say that the culture and environment is ""clock-in and clock-out"". I will challenge anyone to refute this allegation! I just left Raytheon for these speific reasons. And bye the way, I am a recipient of Raytheon Corporate's highest acheivement award given for outstanding performance - IT WAS EASY!!!!!!"
bad,Not enough staff and many employees had a negative attitude.  Management never came around only for meeting s that's it. The leads are clueless no bs as a requirement for job false job requirements.
bad,Culture is CYA (cover your...you know the rest) for management and Human Resources.  HR should be horrible resources.  Nepotism still rampant despite advertised culture of fairness and caring.
bad,"Supervisor assigns work to perform. I collect the necessary materials and tools needed to perform the tasks that are assigned to me. A typical day could consist of cleaning, installation, rework, polying, and reading procedure requirements."
bad,"Good company, good team work, personality of the people and benefits. Even thou we work hard where enjoing our service of the people."
bad,"Team building, supporting our troops daily. Maintaining and operating our system.  Looking forward to maintaining a working relationship with the government."
bad,Why did I leave? Lack of funding approval for the program I was working on. Poor management over site. Most people I knew at that time have left the company.
bad,"It was really a who you know kind of place and a lot of people were two faced,  Technical help was fair, but I noticed anyone that was really good didn't stay at this company for long. It has a union which helped the pay, but even the union was who you know. Managers had their favorites and treated others poorly."
bad,"Cleaning offices and bathrooms"
bad,"IIS in Richardson is in its own little world. I was only there from December to April and in that time, "
bad,"Too many meetings."
bad,"Competitiveness, back biting, dragging you off into a room for a bashing, pulling you from projects, patronizing language, ostracizing, know-it-all boffins, jumping through hoops endlessly, insulting comments, high pressure, lack of trust."
bad,I was offered and accepted very good positions at Raytheon Aircraft Services.  General Manager at one of their facilities and National Sales Director.  Company merged with Cessna and is out of business now.
bad,"Long hours, a lot of travel, and was promised a lot of bonuses that didn't come through to get me to keep pushing. Did not like my experience with the company."
bad,Not organized at all. There is no type of work-life balance. Very selfish and rude people that judge those not from same culture backgound
bad,I just star reviewing the phone calls answering some of the voice mails
bad,"Despite seemingly copious amounts of work, the company is currently downsizing rapidly.  Employees are laid off without explanation even in key skill areas.  Management will not acknowledge to employees that layoffs are happening and it creates a very uncomfortable, unhappy workplace."
bad,"About 20 of us planners were seated in the hanger alongside of a business jet. Pigeons did a number on our computers. A person was spray painting the aircraft next to us and we were breathing the fumes, and the union really did not want us contractors there."
bad,"Great government contract, but not enough deployments to stay gainfully working."
bad,"The pay was good the company was horrible. They say it starts at the top and works it way down, I guess there is a lot of truth to that, at least at the Ft Huachuca site. I would never consider working for this company again!"
bad,"The subject line says it all."
bad,"poor benefits, not a good salary structure at all. Managers had no day to day input on the work being done."
bad,"It is very hard to move up in Raytheon once hired for a given position.  The raises are metric based, however management is not held to the same metric."
bad,"The qualified candidate will manage all aspects of COTS and FOSS hardware and software through the full program development, build, and delivery lifecycle. Should have knowledge of asset management best practices and strong skills tracking COTS/FOSS items using Microsoft Excel. An existing US Government TS/SCI Security Clearance and US Citizenship is required for this position."
bad,"Always Reactive, never proactive. Change was to often and difficult to deal with. Training was inadequate to non existent.  no transparency. Advancement was provided by not what you know but who you know. The harder you work the more was expected. no rewards for excellence. job actually drove me over the edge and a breakdown resulted. Suicide considered. difficult to return to work after therapy. long term disability benefits cut."
bad,Horrible management team and unfair / low payscale which made for a poor environment. Raytheon's Corporate processes fell far below that of NGC and other defense competitors. Company is just coming up to speed with automated networks in critical areas such as export / import and business development tracking tools.
bad,"See summary above.  That sums it up."
bad,Working on the production floor was very stressful and I was never rewarded for my hard work. I learned that when you are an engineer you don't advance your career as quickly compared to operations. The company doesn't take care of the workers who put in the most ours and bend over backwards.
bad,"However, once inside and employed there, things are very different. The current employees are very petty and lack the knowledge of proper protocol."
bad,No comment pay was good during the time I worked there I have no other comment to say about this company location was good for commute
bad,Raytheon is a company that employees are never sure if they have a job tomorrow or not. Raytheon lays off people thru one door and hires at the same time thru another door.
bad,"Full of plenty of very nice, capable people, however, the culture strives for mediocrity due to an overarching emphasis on not spending any money. Many areas are run by a small number of enthusiastic individuals with the remainder providing the barriers to change. The main aspect of the culture is an acceptance of fire-fighting in all areas of the business."
bad,Improvement needed on changing its culture to correspond with the changing industry.
bad,toxic culture.  glad not to b working there anymore.  could not recommend to friends.
bad,"Recent federal budget cuts, along with business unit consolidation has forced the company to lay off hundreds of loyal employees the last few years.  Even the CEO is getting out - it's not astable environment towork in."
bad,The manner in which the contract for training new air traffic controllers was a complete disaster. The FAA added more students and Raytheon ran out of money within the first 6 months of the contract. Mismanagement on both sides has cost hundreds of jobs.
bad,"Work life balance was talked about a lot, but was rarely respected."
bad,I spent seven years at RMS in Tucson and the conditions went from great to really bad.
bad,The job was in the west Utah desert and it was long way to work everyday. .
bad,I cant wait to leave. Micromanaged to death with no room to grow. Union work is not for everyone. I would do your research before applying here. Some great people but most aren't. Some engineers are brilliant but their managers don't listen either.
bad,Manager commonly issued contradictive direction and made public personal attacks that humiliated the individual. Suspect the manager has a passive-aggressive behavior problem.
bad,"Lot of ethical /HR issue within corporate. No one is willing to help, Person will be in a trouble IF concerns are addressed and will be micromanaged by Management. Toxic, unhealthy environment."
bad,The only thing I liked at Raytheon was my job soldering. The management there are in clicks. If you go to the same church or golf together there will be a job promotion in the click. The pay is well below other manufacturing facilities.
bad,"Raytheon is a good solid company with good values (trust, integrity, respect) that it strives to promote and push.  There can sometimes be an over-focus on process and a general risk aversion that trickles into functional work, but that is part of the engineering culture that is an important part of making products that folks depend on for life or death applications.  I have the utmost respect for RTN senior leadership and the culture they are promoting."
bad,"Employee is stuck on their own.  If they have a place to make money with you there you go, if not good luck finding work on your own,  Parking availability is also poor as is the on-site cafe."
bad,"While I am sure other departments at Raytheon are fun and exciting places to work, Some offices are not. Be mindful of which department your looking to work at. - IIS=  >:("
bad,"Hired based of my security clearance alone.  Stated they would train me and never really did.  Had to learn the job on the fly for the 2 years I was there.  Was told I would be promoted and the date of promotion kept getting pushed back and pushed back until finally their answer was, ""not sure anymore"".  Management was terrible with the contract I was on.  I have determined that I will never work for this company again."
bad,"This is for NWS Raytheon North Bay."
bad,"Good pay, but no certainty of continued contract employment meant that all workers, including managers, spent significant time looking for the next contract employment to hop to. The good ones, and there were many, were not rewarded in any way for productivity. The lazy ones, and there were a few, could hide out with ease. The single most disappointing and frustrating position I've ever held. Mission accomplishment was an afterthought."
bad,"The on-boarding was difficult and basically non existant."
bad,"The environment was very fast paced with deadlines, very over whelming.The culture was good, but to many employees are frustrated and upset wit the terms and conditions."
bad,"Produced instructor guide to include slides showing typical structural"
bad,if your part of the good ol boys club you may stand a chance. pay structure is hored. management is or owner is less than desirable.
bad,"Large defense contractor that is top heavy in management. Some very interesting work. Some nice people. Bureaucracy continues to grow, often to simply justify keeping so many managers. Questionable ethics. Employees are a resource and not a valuable one."
bad,"The strangest thing about this position was the charge numbers.  Typically, the customer would release maybe 10 or 40 hours at a time for us to use for software development.  Sometimes, I'd have to change charge numbers 3 times a day.  I learned Visual Studio.  Travel to other locations took up about 10% of my time.  The best part was that I had the opportunity to design a distributed software system."
bad,I enjoyed working there except for the last two years. With the cut back on defense the company started shedding employees. The more you made and the longer you were there the bigger the risk for a layoff. 
bad,I started the purchasing departmnet. This company was a new MRP facility.
bad,"Very frustrating to work in this company when previously employed in commercial sector. Ability to change is poor, new initiatives appear often but are left to die a slow lingering death (to the extent that everybody knows to show initial enthusiasm and after that they can then happily let it die). Management are capable but fail to create a drive & commitment from (very capable) employees that is seen in the best employers."
bad,"people disappointed not happy in office, colleagues shouting to each others. Very bad energy."
bad,"It's drab like the last scene in the warehouse in Raiders of the Lost Ark. There is no camaraderie to speak of, but rather, vast unoccupied cubical farms."
bad,I wouldn't recommend it.  Not progressive. Elitist culture.  No room for advancement.  Town is not very welcoming to strangers not a lot to do in the community unless you're retired or like to drink.
bad,"Gossip and poor management made the experience here miserable."
bad,Coporate culture when I was there included management making subordinates look unsuccessful. May have changed since then. Many layoffs and relocations to Arizona.
bad,"Excellent immediate team collaboration, and worked great together.  Immediate manager was excellent, but the director of Security was not a great person to work for."
bad,Senior leadership's agenda is self promotion rather than overall co success or end user needs .... other than achieving follow on contracts.  Yes achieving follow on work is paramount to corp success/longevity but not at the risk of serving the real end user's needs.
bad,Not the greatest place to work. Bad work behavior is tolerated and it hurts productivity. People get discouraged after a few years and leave. Would only go back if there were no other options.
bad,"Raytheon loves to hire and coddle young grads, but they only stay 2-5 years and move on.  They tend to make false promises about opportunities when everything really depends on winning contracts.  Lose a bid and they lay people off.  Win a bid and they'll hire almost anyone (just to lay them off later).  After one year on a program the youngest software engineer was in his 40's.  I saw 5 college hires move on to greener pastures.  Rumored to have 65-70% turnover rate is this age group, yikes!  May be a good place to start, but not a good place to stay."
bad,"Growth opportunities are not offered indiscriminately.  The environment can be very hostile and unprofessional at times.  When these occasions of unprofessional behavior arise, no action is taken by human resources. Overall compensation to years in service are not competitive. Little opportunity to expand expertise and for regular training."
bad,"Definetely not your average business. People pleasing leaders, #1 goal is money. The most enjoyable part of the job is there is very little supervision"
bad,the factory isn't a place for those with thin skin. the career employees are simply putting in their time until retirement. very little motivation to step up and make any improvements.
bad,"They have put the systems in place that take whatever little fun exists in engineering right out."
bad,"Look for work to be completed and assist as necessary. "
bad,"Hired for all the wrong reasons."
bad,"The company is not loyal to their employees. They talk about work/life balance, but do not pay attention to it and work you constantly. They are far, far too process driven and can't think beyond the process. They say that they want ""creative tension"" between the IPTs, engineering and the programs, but all it leads to is back-stabbing, confusion and chaos. Their promotions in the upper ranks are a beauty contest instead of being based on what you know and how hard you work"
bad,Raytheon Missile Systems is running a fascinating experiment: can the division create processes so robust that failure becomes impossible despite declining technical aptitude among employees?
bad,"My typical work day included various major negotiations with the Navy and Coast Guard and with Subcontractors like Lockheed Martin to establish contract price/delivery/terms and conditions for weapon systems. Sometime these negotiations required travel to Washington, D.C. and oher locations so negotiations could be accomplished face to face."
bad,My current lead doesn't appreciate anything I do and talks behind other workers backs to everyone. Doesn't know how to talk to anyone with respect and thinks she never makes any mistakes.  No wonder why she cant keep anyone working for her. Most people only last maybe a year in her section before they start having health issues due to stress and not being trusted.
bad,Stressful company to work for. Very very unorganized and the worst part is management. You don’t get recognized for a job well done. I would not want to work there again.
bad,"The union/management relationship is very toxic. The union leadership only serves to protect the lazy workers with 30+ years of seniority while new hires are constantly reminded of ""the good old days"" where the union had some amount power. When I first came in I was ""treated"" to a presentation by the union that can be boiled down to ""It's us vs. them. We're the good ones!"" They also used ""brothers and sisters"" so often I felt more like I was joining a cult then a union. Then they don't take new hires seriously when they bring up issues unless they're willing to make it known that they complained practically marking you by management as one of the bad ones, when you have a legit safety concern and just want to do your job safely so you can go home. "
bad,Raytheon offers great benefits packages to their employees. Once you're employed at Raytheon you have significant job security. Job advancement and promotion is slow within the company.
bad,"No chance for advancement or career growth.  Management would rather layoff seasoned employees and hire college graduates simply to cut costs."
bad,"Having worked at RMS over 10 years, it was time to move on. Our directorate (Engineering Product Support Directorate) used to be led by a great Director who was fair, talented, personable and seemed to genuinely care about the people. Then he retired in 2015 and then the place went quickly downhill after that. The new director was a pompous, uncaring, unfit leader that nearly every decision he made created such a negative work environment. And the Department Heads and Section Managers he put in place seemed to be just like him. It was not worth my health to continue to work in such a negative and hostile work environment so I left RMS and left Tucson as well. My husband and I both worked for Raytheon and we are extremely happy not to work there any longer!"
bad,"In support of a multi billion dollar NATO proposal effort, responsible for the development of subcontract activities associated with 40+ team members located in 19 European NATO Nations.  Working with existing and potential foreign subcontractors, in conjunction with the Contracts and Program Office organizations, in the development and negotiation of offset agreements and corresponding subcontracts to be implemented to satisfy Raytheon’s offset obligations. Duties included a full range of complex major international subcontract activities (Teaming Agreements, Technology Assistance Agreements, Offset Compliancy Program, Source Evaluation and Selection and Subcontract Terms and Conditions) supporting a NATO and U.S. Department of State regulated proposal effort."
bad,"Not empowered to actually do the job, constant meetings."
bad,"Working for Raytheon at Ft. Irwin has been an interesting experience, as well as a learning experience.  I've been involved in many areas of Logistics and training.  I've been in procurement and supply chain for the past 18 years, including working directly with the Army and suppliers.  I have had to track purchases, equipment, receiving, and inventory over several divisions and platforms.  The accuracy has improved greatly.  "
bad,"If you are not an engineer you have little chance to move up with in the Company.  From the top to the bottom, Raytheon approaches every interaction as a math problem, it is not a business based culture."
bad,"Raytheon BBN Technologies is an old school company struggling to keep up with a changing buisness and employment landscape. Despite being a technology company, BBN has difficulty attracting young talent with up-to-date skillsets."
bad,"A culture of older, bureaucratic white male and female defense hawks beholden to Wall Street analysts and quarterly profits. 1980s-styled work spaces include gray cubicles, zero natural sunlight and Aramark food service."
bad,"Has an awesome opinion of itself, but fails to deliver on many fronts.  They pay well, but it becomes a mindless droning of process and risk hedging that leads to oblivion."
bad,"Raytheon is an exciting place to work with a great mission. You will learn, develop and have some great experiences; however, there's a price to pay. You will put in long hours, including nights and weekends. I had a few great bosses who were exceptional; however, that's unusual and rare in this environment. There's a strong tendency to manage people rather than leading them."
bad,Didn't like the way raytheon and management laid off  a employees with ten years or more  and  offer servance package to them when people with less than thirty days on the job keep there jobs.
bad,"Really bad management in Corporate Communications. Management was out of touch of what the real needs of the department were.  Why do I have to tell you more, these are the facts!!"
bad,"Management is supportive, helpful and friendly. Tools used to create training was proprietary, so it becomes difficult to transfer knowledge to other employment. If very much an assembly line of instructional design.."
bad,"I worked 18 months on a contract for this company. I had an excellent Supervisor who tried every way she could to make me permanent to no avail. Only after asking the Manager when my contract would expire, he told me Friday, which was two days away. Nice send off...... Will not accept contract work from this company."
bad,"The quality of the engineers there was very weak with a few notable exceptions.  The old-fashioned pananoia of a military-industrial complex organization was pretty stifling.  "
bad,"Pulling data for analysis, creating charts; attending many meetings.  Reviewing data with appropriate personnel--documenting path forward. Little direction from management; culture is very stressful. Hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what management actually wanted.  Most enjoyable part of the job were many of the people."
bad,"Job experience varied greatly between different management particularly with different programs."
bad,"a typical work day involved aircraft design activities. I learned the companies business processes. The management was middle of the road. The workplace culture was highly stressful. The hardest part of the job was handling upper managements disrespectful treatment of employees. The most enjoyable part was working on tat that time, the most advance super midsize business jet in the world, sadly, no longer in production due to poor management at the top,"
bad,"I was on a 6 mos contract with this company. However, in that time frame 9 individuals from upper management left due to differences with organizational changes. The processes are antiquated and it is more than likely you will hear a fax machine in the distance. An ISD will not have the ability to meet a SME before beginning a project. Most individuals in management have never completed an ISD course themselves, so the deadlines are unrealistic. The two positive segments of this contract were the work/life balance and enjoyable SME's."
bad,"OK company but uses the word ""team"" where no teams exist. It is one for all."
bad,"In the office where I worked, we worked as a team, and I with a great bunch of engineers.  However, we never felt supported by upper management."
bad,I liked my co-workers and the job wasn't bad at all. Got to meet all kinds of new people and networked. It was the management side of things I couldn't get past.
bad,"lots of travel time and interaction with the soldiers"
bad,The department I am in has a schedule for tasks that are impossible to meet unless you work overtime. I've worked for Lockheed and IBM and I have never seen such short deadlines to meet.
bad,"Upper management often covers for each other at the expense of lower employees, including disregard of proper regulatory processes in the interest of completing projects. Many processes take too long to complete due to federal regulations and lack of knowledgeable workforce. Fails to ""fight"" for employees and ensure they are furthering their careers."
bad,Raytheon at Indianapolis needs to diversify to bring in more work. Being a DOD contractor it tends to pigeon hole you to growth. If they offered apprenticeship programs it would bring in young talent for the machine shop. Their focus is more on high end computer programing in lieu of building and repairing stuff.
bad,"Local site is managed by managers from or in Tucson or elsewhere.  They haven’t kept infrastructure up, so network is slow. Unfortunately, productivity depends on network. Takes 2 months to receive a tool after submitting purchase requisition."
bad,The mission and job offerings have change based on the business strategy. It hasn't always been that way because we used to help the customer solve small problems with the hopes of getting bigger jobs. When we were a government facility it was a joy to work there with many different opportunities and the customer loved us. I worked there 39 years and I could have worked longer but it wasn't about the income more the coworkers and management style. It has changed so much and seemed toxic. Good luck.
bad,"It was a good paying job.  I cannot comment on the over all company as I was only at one job the time I was there."
bad,Typically we had little insight into what we were doing on a day to day basis. Most of the work that I was asked to perform did not align  with the job description.
bad,"They talk the talk but do not walk the walk.  "
bad,Probably the best job you'll ever hate.  Process has become the product and checking boxes is more important than delivering solutions. An extremely frustrating environment for those that want to work hard and believe in the work they are doing.
bad,"I was at the company for more than 15 years. The first 10 years were good to great. The last 5 years were terrible as the company lost market share in the commercial aviation radar sector. As a result of constant layoffs and unreasonable workloads, the work environment became stressful and difficult."
bad,"This was agreed to be a 6 month contract-to-hire deal. They knew I put my household items into storage and drove out to California from Maryland. During my time at Raytheon, I was commended often and was told I was ""the best they have seen"". I had won numerous awards when I contracted here 10 years ago. I was recognized in the hallways by no less than 14 people with a hearty handshake and a ""Welcome Back"". I was paying $3,000 / month to stay in hotels during this time. $325.mo for storing my items in MD."
bad,"My project is most trouble govt/Air Force project."
bad,"They simply don't pay enough for the positions I was employed in. "
bad,Pressed for time because of poor management and the quality of work is being pushed whether good or bad. They just want to push item through and not caring how good the product looks.  I know they have a dead line but they get the products and then come back to redo again.
bad,"Great for work life balance. However, this company is bad for salary raises and culture. Team bonding is virtually nonexistent, and the atmosphere of the tewksbury location is difficult to ""live"" at daily."
bad,"Raytheon/ Hawker Beechcraft is a good place to start for people that are new to the private aviation/ Fixed Base Operations industry. Although the pay is mostly entry level, and benefits average, it's good for young Techs"
bad,"This location of Raytheon has the potential to be a great company for non-engineers. The problem is that you have ""lifer"" employees who are put in management due to their longevity with the company and not due to any leadership qualities. This seriously squashes any incentive by team members to float new ideas and innovation from the business support roles as the only idea that is embraced is the status quo. A lot of negative feedback and not much in the way of encouragement or empowerment, which is very much command and control style of management. All of the participatory monetary incentives for lower levels (below manager level) achieving goals have been removed."
bad,"already reviewed Raytheon; something is awry with this system because it does not recognize that I've already done this work, but I have to write something"
bad,"Insufficient training for new employees. Overwhelming amount of inhouse demands and knee jerk management. I questioned, at times, if anyone really knew what my job really entailed."
bad,"Work is rewarding."
bad,"Good pay, benefits."
bad,"Management has the lack of a good communication with it employees, and don't provide the necessary step to help with your growth within the company. You also have the downside of working shift work, which has the effect of not spending time with family during families activities."
bad,I would compare Raytheon with similar size companies in hi-tech or silicon valley companies in the following way - Post Office vs. FedEx.
bad,"For all those people out there that say Raytheon provides a good work life balance, they are right! People can come and go as they please, call in anytime, work on personal issues on the clock etc etc. But for every instance of this someone is picking up the slack and getting crapped on for it, it would seem. Raytheon is trained to manage the unethical, immoral scum of the earth. Raytheon does not know how to treat hard working people. They just do not train that way. So unethical actions quickly get swepped under the rug and any person who reports these actions is reviewed as ""not a team player"". Management is terribly gutless, especialy when it comes to a dispute between a proffesional engineer and an incompetent union worker. General atmosphere is highly unproffesional. Large focus on minorities and women with such a large company as you would expect. But when a hispanic says ""all you white boys look the same"" and upper managment as well as human resources does nothing.... come on! But what can you do? With all the AA laws and equal opportunity BS, then factor in the union, what would you ask them to do? I just want to warn if you are hard working, morral, and ethical you will get walked on by this company until you are shaped into the same POS as the rest of the workers at Raytheon. Then, once you are made into something expendable, out the door the first chance they have."
bad,It is hard to believe that people can stay in the same job for 25 years. No change or challenge. Death of technical skills by repetition and inane conformance to policies. Hire young people in and do not mentor them results in solutions that do not work.
bad,"Basically this company has all the right ingredients with the exception of management. The majority of the workers have a decent, balanced attitude. When you throw management in the mix, it becomes an unworkable situation. The management that I worked for had zero education in leadership abilities. It was like the kid who got picked on saying,""get out of my yard"". I can't remember how many times I had to lead from the middle. If you have ever been in middle management you can understand a little of what I mean."
bad,"Not for all people, but if stress and plenty of work then this is the employer for you."
bad,The benefits are great and the company shuts down around late December for time off. Good for a career start or to get some experience but don't plan on making a career here. The raises are low and barely cover the cost of living. Generally the pay is below industry standards. The technology is outdated and they are very slow to adopt new technologies. There are a lot of silo'd teams and the work space is extremely political with infighting between managers and teams. Management sometimes denigrates and blacklists employees. There are a few good managers but not many. There are constant re-orgs and occasional layoffs. Expect a new manager every year who doesn't know you or your work. Very slow career growth. There used to be ample training to learn new tech but that has went away and you can go years without any new training (other than annual mandatory ethics courses). Not very good for long term career growth.
bad,"Raytheon management has no long term goals for the Albuquerque work force, and the long term future is unknown. The Human Resource department is a 1 800 number."
bad,"Please realize that I am talking about the company in Tucson and my review opinion is based on my personal, one-year experience."
bad,"My time at Raytheon was very tumultous. Business unit underwent a complete overhaul organizationally, ending in a significant RIF. My position was cut."
bad,"Raytheon purchased our company and within 2 years there was nothing left resembling our old company.  Prior to the purchase we were the premier company supporting SOCOM and SOF specific missions.  Our reputation within the community was exemplary, our FSR's second to none and our dedication to the mission shown in the effort we all put forth everyday to support our fellow warriors. Raytheon had no experience operating as a service provider within this community and single handedly dismantled through bureaucratic miss management,  one of the top performing companies supporting SOCOM.  Raytheon is an excellent company within their wheel house, which is providing high tech systems and weapons to the military, but fails miserably when it comes to supporting the smaller  arm of the DoD, SOF."
bad,"Good company supporting legacy products. Huge tension between new employees and current employees at Raytheon.  Many employees at retirement age are afraid to be replaced by new hires. New hires were tasks with mundane assignments to prevent from succeeding in their role. Senior engineer belittle and humiliate new employees to show that they are superior.  Some Immediate managers micromanage and criticize others in public. Goleta used to be a good location but recently turned into ""Ghost Town"" due to the wildfires, mudslide and the closure of 101 freeway (esp. during several mandatory evaluation)."
bad,"Disclaimer: This assessment may not be fair to Raytheon as a whole.  At Missile Systems in Tucson, AZ the management were much more competent.  At least they some what recognized the well achievers.  But at SAS the management had no clue especially line management.  If you were a-kisser, you would do well at SAS environment but beware of back stabbers.  Program managements were better than line managements in general."
bad,Raytheon Missile Systems pays well but Tucson is a poor and run down city with lots of crime and four months out of the year well above 100 degrees. Work is slow paced and low quality...
bad,"This is a fielded job away from the main employer site, thus there's very little recognition, except when there are issues.  Management is stuck on schedule and knows or cares about little else.  No advancement opportunities and when the contract is up, this job will be terminated."
bad,"The projects at Raytheon are too short. Most of the people I worked with moved to the Portsmouth, RI location from various other facilities. The contractors I started with ended up working for very short terms that lasted a month to 4 months. The project they are working on is quite large and they don't have time for training. They need people who have been working on the project, hence bringing in people from other facilities."
bad,"Worked there for 12 years and job advancement was based on who you knew and not merit.  Management turnover was an issue, and was more to advance to the next step than being a good manager for your people."
bad,"Large defense company with cutting edge technology and commitment to the warfighter"
bad,"It's either their way or the highway.  Management is chosen not by abilities, but by nepotism, cronyism and willingness to work over 40 hours."
bad,"Manage the Mission Systems Integration (MSI) group that creates integrated solutions to meet the customer needs in the uses of transponders for both new and upgraded platforms.  Within these programs I manage the preparation and chairing of Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs), System Integration Labs (SILs), and customer interface."
bad,"RMS possesses a big array of interesting products and system platforms that was transferred from other defense companies over the years (GD, TI, Hughes etc). RMS Tucson itself is not good at developing new systems but better at production and build-to-print programs. RMS has a very political and somewhat amateurish management structure. Management typically lacks technical skills or the ability to discern such in others. There is a bias against older workers hiring in from the outside. But RMS has a vast organization and can be a good place to work if you can find the right group."
bad,"If you are a prior service Marine you will do fine for a bit. Pay is great but the ex army people yo work with will make sure you don't stay. Even when the customer is active duty Army and asks for you to return, RTSC will send an ex army person instad of you. Not uncommon for a Program Manager to tell you to have your wife visit you, just to find out months later no one will sponser her."
bad,"Raytheon will probably always have interesting technology to work on.   Raytheon is a large company responsible to its shareholders.  Expect a ""just get along"" diversity approach and an ethics program that knows the song ""Don't Rock the Boat.""   Enjoy the irony of mandatory ethics training over your lunch hour in exchange for a box lunch."
bad,"Raytheon sees employees as numbers.  We were part of a buyout and our culture was removed within the first two years.  Our group had no visibility into the larger corporate structure, therefore weren't able to take advantage of the larger Raytheon machine and the opportunities that came with that machine."
bad,"Revloving door of militant and political types run the C level jobs. Slow-moving giant that will expect a lot from you but not have the job description fleshed out or give you access to necessary materials to complete the job, then will turn around and chastise and ask why job isn't completed. If you are a creative type who understands there are multiple ways to get from point A to point B you will butt heads with those who just want to plod along and not assess their processes, even if that's what you were hired to do.  I do not recommend working at this company if you enjoy going home on time and want logic to rule."
bad,"Company forgot that it's the people that make you a great company, not the CEO. I previously worked for a company that was bought by Raytheon.  The culture of that company was destroyed in a matter of months."
bad,"Raytheon is a good place, the salary is very good.  I do not know much about the benefits.  I was temporary waiting to go full time.  I had premature twins and decided to stay at home with them"
bad,"Raytheon was the most unstable company I ever worked for.  In 8 months, had 4 managers.  Test automation consistently took a back seat to manual testing.  This is just insane practices."
bad,"The job was great, the hours were great, the compensation was great. However, the management was poor. No employee engagement, no employee advocacy and centered around getting contracts, not ensuring that the work on the contracts was good"
bad,"Small divisions within Raytheon function outside of the Raytheon culture.  Within the smaller group you see lots of back stabbing and cliquish culture.  If you don't have a TS, you are expendable.  Secret clearance doesn't count for anything."
bad,"If you want a medium, safe, high paying government job, this is the place for you.  If you have goals or ambitions outside of what you're told to do, than this definitely isn't the place for you."
bad,I left Raytheon in 1989 so I do not know if the culture has changed but when I was there it was a very difficult place to work. Turnover was very high and employees were for the most part treated like a number.
bad,"I enjoyed raytheon but the new Supply Chain Management is terrible. "
bad,New management is running a corporate environment like a typical call center. Not a bad place to work short term but for a career look elsewhere. Starting pay is low compared to the skill set required.
bad,"Raytheon is a good company, if you want to work in the defense industry.  It is well managed, but the scale of the company makes you feel like just a number"
bad,The job did not require work overtime. I did not enjoy the workplace culture (very strict rules due to government contracts). There was no good system tools to help on daily task.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is to follow all of the processes that are in place.  If you have a great idea, it is next to impossible to have it implemented, or try to have anyone even listen to it."
bad,This was a job that gives u piece of mind but no benefits and poor pay
bad,"Big company, and it's all about what program(s) you get on. If you're surrounded by good people on successful programs, you will most certainly advance. Since the whole defense budget is going down, that sort of stuff is harder to come by. Not the best place for a young engineer."
bad,I was basically left on my own to build cables to drawing specifications
bad,Must network to obtain decent assignments.
bad,while under a doctors care and the suicide of my oldest child. I was fired for my attendance. There was no findings of misconduct on my part. My union didn't even want to fight for me because in their words. It would cost to much. This after paying over 10 yrs of union dues. They had my money but chose not to act. Im in the process of getting a lawyer. The company knows their wrong. This makes Raytheon a non family unfriendly place to work. The irony is that Raytheon had been trying to push me out on disability. They also due to my health. Told my union that I was unsalvageable. Now you tell me if you would want to work for a company that's in bed with local 933 union??!!
bad,incompetent management. no decent investment in R&D. no decent training. Legacy intellectual knowledge getting lost in petty financial considerations. Unable to recruit decent talent.
bad,"A lot of meetings, most of them just wasting time. Managers do not count the meetings or other delays in point of to complete a task on time. People work at Raytheon even on weekends or after work hours to get their tasks done as volunteer hours. The message is ""The task needs to be done, no matter when!"" "
bad,"Will half heartedly try to keep you feeling as not another number in a huge company.  Good pay if you negotiate well but benefits lacking.  Good working environment at least while you are there.  If no longer billable due to losing a contract or the customer making cuts, you will get some time to transition (about 4 to 8 weeks) and then you are gone.  Company invested minimal time and effort to people cut.  Management guaranteed 7 years and went on a fire sale after 7 months.  Not all of it was on the company at least."
bad,"Throughout the many years I worked here, there was always the fear throughout the facility of lay-offs. With any contractor, employment is contingent on the times. Always a concern."
bad,Management micro managed its employees and would make the workplace hostile. Job security was great because the turn over rate was so high they could not let anyone go. Pay was very low for what the positions were.
bad,It was my first position out of college. I was able to learn a great deal about the finance world in regards to DOD contracts. The major issue I notice was that none of the departments were ever on the same page. retrieving feedback on any procedure was far more cumbersome then it should of been. It felt like each department was more focus on completing their own goals rather then focusing on finishing a project together.
bad,"Many different skills are need to perform this position: for example"
bad,The work was feast or famine. I gained more knowledge about new product development. The management did not interfere. The Dorector believed in hiring new people to broaden the knowledge base. The new people were very good and talented. There was a lot of resentment from the legacy employees. Change and innovation was discouraged.
bad,Overall rating good. Trained new and current ATC specialist in their job requirements and training. Prepared DYSIM problems to be administrered in a Simulated problem.
bad,Get to work start my assignment. learning wire harnessing. Management will not help if you are new. Work place is depressing. Co workers are not allowed to talk to you or help you. Trying to learn a job with no support from trainers.
bad,"I worked behind walls a lot, so I basically spend 8 hours/day without a cellphone or music or anything wireless really. The work could be exciting at times, but we are always working with very outdated tools and software so progress is often very slow and painful."
bad,"This is like any other company. All Pictures and words, but management is clueless on how achieve an inclusive workplace and takes no meaningful actions to do so."
bad,Lot's of managers however lacking in true leadership.  Best part of working at Raytheon is the pay.  The Human Resource department needs down sizing. The company should consider out sourcing HR to avoid the amount of nepotism that is taking place.
bad,They hire a lot of people but not enough interesting work. Very process oriented. They hire very smart people but then ruin them by not giving them good work.
bad,Great company in terms of benefits but horrible community culture unless you get in with the right group. This type of environment leads to bad retention as a whole.
bad,"They advocated transparency and ease of transitioning if you wished to switch departments or seek opportunities that are more suited to your taste, but they'll cunningly argue against your promotion because you're not doing relevant work while switching. Management is incredibly out of touch with it's employees and unfortunately they put weight in rumors and stifle open discussion without repercussions.They put more money toward recruiting professional hires than training their young engineers. While this company has put a bad taste in my mouth, they do have employee resource groups that aim toward inclusion. I didn't see a wide range of diversity even though that's something that was advertised when I joined the company a few years ago. Plenty of women I've spoken to don't feel respected and heard. There are the few shining stars in management that empathise and do what they can to help, but it's unfortunately no match for the overall culture."
bad,Have not been there is so long I can't recall what is good or bad with the exception that the workforce is only as good as the leadership that is in place.
bad,"Good personnel, work atmosphere needs some help. "
bad,"Several years after the company was taken over by Raytheon it began to decline, at least at the El Segundo facility.  Employees are, for the most part, not happy with the management and overall structure of the company."
bad,"Good pay for easy work. A lot of politics and red tape, as to be expected as government contractors. Raytheon looks good on your resume."
bad,"A typical day would be to enter journal entries, reconcile accounts. I have learned many aspects of accounting since we wear many hats. Management is hands off and my co-workers are team players. The hardest part of the job is prioritizing and the most enjoyable is learning new things."
bad,"Work can be extremely busy and intense due to deadlines.  You can learn a lot when there are individuals who are willing to take the time to train.  That being said, since it is always busy learning some thing new can be a challenge which in turn makes advancement difficult."
bad,A lot depends on luck to work on interesting projects. The important work done is undercut by sustaining cronyism.
bad,This organization is very successful and has a very good rating in the marketplace.  The makeup of the organization is retired military.
bad,"Management was bad."
bad,"Raytheon touts itself as an innovation company, however, my experience was that they are very conservative in their approach to innovation. "
bad,"Don't go in assuming they are good at software. Go in assuming you will work on tons of legacy code. Don't go in assuming you will work with modern technologies. Go in only if you have a passion for the very specific type of work they do and match their laid back, old-timey culture."
good,This place would work you to death and pay you nothing. a few times I worked 70hour weeks and for a lot of the summer and they would only pay me part-time pay.
good,"Mandatory 6 day work weeks, no pay increases, year after year."
good,"Gone for months on end. Was on travel out of the country, back to back.  One year I was gone seven months out of the country, came back and was expected to do it again 6 months later."
good,"Leadership was psychotic."
good,"Worked here a long time. The culture has changed significantly and not necessarily for the better. Certain jobs can be rewarding. But, front line managers get seriously micromanaged. Be anything but a supervisor here! Union shop where management and the represented workforce often are at odds."
good,Right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  I was a contractor and was assigned to a manager who didn't know I was coming!  He was incompetent.
good,"Since this was a temporary position the management really did not take me seriously, I would have liked to stay there with my coworkers but was offered a new position"
good,"If you start your career as electrical engineer right out of college, then avoid defense oriented aerospace companies."
good,U have to know people to advance and make sure you get along with coworkers and bosses.other than that decide what's best for u and the long run.watch ur back
good,4 bullets to describe my short term employment at Raytheon now ForcePoint 
good,This was a company that provided scientific support for the main earth science grant at Goddard Space Flight Center.  Okay place to work in the 1990's.
good,"My position with Raytheon was expected to travel 25%. I traveled more than 90%. This does not support work/ life balance. "
good,"Typical day of work was 6:30 am to 3:30 pm with plenty of good work."
good,"New foreign management has left a once thriving Canadian grown European founded company a far cry from its heritage and former  business practices."
good,Raytheon Technical Services at the time had a management team that was out of sync with the rest of the company.  Poor business tools at the time (Lotus Notes) and lack of established and proved business processes.
good,"There seemed to be constant layoffs when I worked there.  The salary was low for my position as an executive assistant.  We were always wondering if we were going to be the next to be laid off.  There wasn't a great work-life balance.  You had to put your job first.  In my opinion, they didn't offer enough paid days off."
good,Good place to work but poor management caused the site to lose contracts which in turn resulted in people being laid off. Time off is nice. three  weeks the first year there and good benefits
good,"Almost all revenue is from government / defense contracts. The work environment can vary greatly depending on what contract you find yourself working on. Make no mistakes about this company and most other defense companies. Their management structures are antiquated at best. Managers and employees are not rewarded or reprimanded based on performance. Benefits are only as good as they need to be, and they'll pay you just enough to get your foot through the door. Most people will not want to make a career at this company."
good,The work itself is great but the company couldn't care less about their staff and you are in constant fear of a lay off. Raises and promotions are basically out of the question.
good,"Stressful, unsupportive, unqualified managers, No cafeteria Security imposed by DoD was very burdensome ""Diversity"" was taken to a perverted extreme. It sucked."
good,Solipsys is a generally nice place to work. Management lacks leadership skills advancement is difficult unless you are a favorite among leadership
good,Good luck getting answers from HR. Poor job prospects and questionable management. Typical day is met with confusion on the part of managers. In a state of limbo between part time and full time.
good,"Raytheon Professional Services, provides a fast pace environment."
good,"Too late now. Not fortunate to get with a good team and PM. Jealous coworker who wants my Job. PM is bias, just not what a expected. I pray to find a better team somday."
good,Should speak volumes when folks are leaving in droves.  The recent merger is affecting morale and there is a large amount of uncertainty within the ranks.
good,Was not told of the utilities I had to learn to do the test position I was interviewed for. I was immediately put into a work group that was based in Fort Wayne Indiana - difficult to contact them when I needed help. I was given work where I would have to understand Matlab - though the latest version was not on-line. Had to buy my own license for Matlab and had to learn it on my work computer. Next I was told to learn Python on my work computer - although the work version was 5 or more years old. Again not allowed to learn it at home. Eventually when my work supervisor was on vacation I was laid of by HR and forced to leave the work area immediately.
good,"Raytheon Global is a great place to work. However, when you work at one of the small office locations, it can leave something to be desired. Many of the managers gave no real business management skills other than they either sat at a desk the longest of anyone else OR they are friends with the hiring manager. Working hard, showing results, and having initiative are not indicators of positive job performance here. Annual raises and promotions are given based on whether they personally like you. Ineptitude abounds."
good,"It seems like no one is in charge and everyone is heading in all different directions."
good,Worked their for a short period of time due to length of the contract. Long hours every day when at a job site and still had to finish up paper work when returning back to the hotel when on the road and home.
good,"Poorly run, lots of chaos and skirting the system. Management was only out for themselves and didn't care about their employees. Tenured employees were toxic. Was so glad I left"
good,I enjoyed the work at Raytheon.  The working atmosphere was not indicative of a positive culture. Expectation to work long hours was very prevalent.  Management did not effectively utilize resources.
good,"Was a good job, but they laid off a co-worker and myself after 3 months and was a 3-year contract due  to ""lack of funds.""  Good training from our team lead and support through asset management. Was fast paced but fun and enjoyed all the I.T. workers."
good,"Raytheon's leadership has stopped caring about people as time has gone on. There have been many rounds of layoffs in recent years. It is a stressful environment that doesn't want to invest in itself. Instead, people are expected to work themselves to a point of burnout in order to make up for the companies many inefficiencies."
good,"Contract work makes the job not worth pursuing. Lots of old timers there that control the way the shifts are made up. No day shift for contract workers unless in training. They favor people hired through family and will place then in a better area with better shift coverage."
good,The work was easy to learn and good to be a part of helping the military. My coworkers were great and very kind. Although the coworkers are great the management however are very disorganized and tend to make the work more stressful than it needed to be.
good,"It may only be in the program I work in, so take this with a grain of salt.  But I noticed all of the organizations outside of Engineering are valued much higher than Engineers.  It has made working here unenjoyable as I have slowly learned their caste system."
good,"VERY schedule oriented company.  Not much room for advancement.  Employees at this facility are mostly women.  There are quarterly awards for leadership, Environmental Health and Safety, Security and Leadership which is a plus.  Management is ""so so"", depends on who your supervisor is.  There are some EXCELLENT supervisors on staff and there are some that aren't so great.  I did love working for this company and enjoyed my coworkers very much.  They all rock!  I do believe there needs to be a change in some management positions."
good,For the job we do at work we do not get paid enough. The management is terrible and myself and my co-workers manage better without our manager.
good,I'm sure Raytheon is a good company to work for but I didn't get to experience all that while working at the client site.  Their benefits weren't all that though.
good,"It was clear to me when Safenet was purchased by Raytheon that things were going to change. We all were told that there would be no changes. I week after the purchase everything changed. "
good,Short term installer for multiple avionics systems on C-130 airframes.
good,The culture is mixed when it comes to being creative and innovative for this employer.  If you happen to land on a program where grow and success are encouraged you will find job satisfaction and the ability to be creative and innovative.  Should you find yourself on a legacy program acceptance of change or investment in future technology are very difficult to achieve.
good,"Learned a lot from the experience, had the opportuniy to take online training to up my skills in the work place. More advancement should be allowed in the work environment"
good,The job as it stands does not let the experience flow as it should. We are restricted as to what we can train and not to our experience and ability.
good,Good company to work for. Actual work day begins at 6:30 am with a morning meeting with manager. Then on to another meeting at 7:30 with Factory Manager and Functional heads. At 8:15 is my meeting with Quality Inspection team where priorities and issues are discussed and resolved.
good,Satisfying work assisting our military members all over the world but not much for career growth. Pay raises are low & benefits are mediocre. I've met both great & terrible supervisors. Laid-back job atmosphere with deployment opportunities.
good,"I would say they are behind the times.  The only reason I was hired was because I held a TS.  We worked behind barbed wire.  There needs to be a little give and take... in other words.. if I as an employee are having health or family life issues, it would benefit them to work with me.  I had to leave them.  Not recommended."
good,"Like most places, job satisfaction depends upon your immediate and up-line management. There is a divide in that high caliber engineers are hired, but the business side is staffed with a very wide range of talent, commitment, ethics, etc. More recently, the company upholds inclusive practices and will try to find another assignment if the one you're in is a poor fit."
good,I would prefer not to comment other than the company is now recognized in the international community in not being able to keep their programs on schedule due to several internal factors.
good,"I started there making $20 an an hour. I worked 70 hours a week or more including weekends. I was considered salaried and was paid for 55 hours a week, Had to travel 140 miles every Monday and Friday to get to work or to get home with no reimbursement."
good,"Worked at Raytheon for 2 years, 1 of which they allowed me to work remotely full time.  It is a nice place to get a foot in the door for government contract work.  Most of the good management team where I was at left for greener pastures.  I was informed of being layed off right before Thanksgiving, so thoughtful of them.  The hiring team.HR down here where I am is slow and unresponsive, have put multiple applications in for the same jobs they keep posting monthly, of which I am qualified for, and either get no response or rejected.  Mostly no response."
good,"Shift pass down, morning meeting, review logs, monitor network, work trouble tickets, over the phone assistance, plan, schedule, execute updates, continuous communication with team members and higher echelon."
good,"I'll make this short - was with the company for 10 years, and over that time it devolved to a cut throat corporate culture.  The problem was mainly with the management - but everyone around was very unhappy and stuck with it because they needed the work."
good,Haven't worked for Raytheon very long and didn't have opportunities to work in many areas so giving an evaluation is a little tough. Raytheon appears to be a great company if you get connected to the right people.
good,"I did appreciate Raytheon.  One could potentially find oneself in incredible, technical environment.   However, the nature of assignment was highly dependent upon project leadership.  Since this varied, the result was a ""wild"" swing in assignment quality."
good,"Very unimaginative work experience.  Typical cube farm.  Typical daily grind.  Inflexible work hours.  Frequent travel.  Entirely too focused on boilerplate forms, reviews, and processes.  Extremely rigid and unwilling to accept new ideas from even the most senior engineers on how to improve.  Unwilling to stand behind employees.  Annually, each group must have at least one employee rated outstanding and one rated unsatisfactory - the latter will get no raises, bonuses, or the rare profit-sharing.  Pay is slightly below industry norms; benefits are about average.  Despite frequent travel, travel requirements are very rigid."
good,The company could have provided more opportunities for officers to increase their knowledge within the organization. The company could have made a financial investment to the advancement of officer's education.
good,"No goals are set with this company ,Mangers do not have a college degree.."
good,"Too far away from home."
good,The company culture changed in the 12 years I was there. The  environment became very hostile  and stressful towards the end of my  time there. I'm looking to to be a
good,Large company  that treats you as a number.  Recognition for good service is minimal.  Anger someone and you are out the door.  Minimal raises.  Management is better at the lowest level but distant and lacking at higher levels.
good,IIS develops very complex systems.  There is a tremendous amount of domain knowledge within the company.  The main fault with the company is that these large unwieldy programs are being strangulated with an ill fitting agile/scrum management implementation (not to be confused with an actual engineering methodology).
good,"I was lauded in all performance reviews, I was promised promotion multiple times, and I was secretly discouraged at the lack of skill in my supervisors. Then I was let go because I am a physicist not an engineer."
good,The majority of the people there were set in their ways and did not like it when some one new would come in and not much help was given to them. It was a sink or swim type of environment and not very conducive for long term growth.
good,"My experience was about a 2/5. I was way overqualified for the position, and began looking for another one shortly after my tenure started there."
good,"Middle management & above works a 9/80 schedule. Normal salaried employees work more like 10/120, It definitely helps to 'know' somebody in order to get ahead. And if another person comes along with better connections - you lose. "
good,"-Arrive half an hour early because the actual job was exciting and fun, it did not feel like work.  "
good,"Manage security contracts and business interests at multiple locations, responsible for oversight and the implementing government policies, plans and procedures associated with classified programs within the three intelligence agencies."
good,"The work at this employer is challenging and interesting. Product quality is usually very excellent. The hours are often long but flexible.  Pay and benefits are very good. "
good,"Productive high tech environment with great tools, IT, training opportunities."
good,10 hours plus days always expected
good,Job can be quiet boring. Not much challenge and really no chance for advancement. Flexible schedule . Make sure you get the position you want when you walk through the doors.Mostly pretty laid back environment.
good,"ok to work at Raytheon, most of the work related to government contract, if no contract award then end of the contract very difficult to find work and read for lay off notice. Management are very selfish, they not care for employees."
good,"•	implement strategic plans to optimize procurement, movement, warehousing, inventory control, and consumption of materials."
good,"While the pay is good, if you're not with the ""IN"" crowd you will be worked to death. Micromanagement is the norm at Raytheon. Be ready to sit in LOTS of pointless meetings that could have been an email."
good,"In my 12 years at Elcan, i have seen people get away with bullying, harassment and just having a bad attitude everyday.  Even if an employee were to escalate their complaint to management or HR, it was always just swept under the rug.  I worked hard for that company, and when i left after 12 years, my salary was entry level.  the benefits are great!  Management not so much.  As well as the HR department, not one of them is approachable by any means.  Because our dept filed a complaint against a member of management, one of the HR team members called us a bunch of complainers and our complaint never got resolved, or even looked into.  "
good,There are too few innovators at Raytheon and too many silly rules to follow.  Good luck on working through the labyrinth of processes and procedures to find a way to get your project work done.
good,Typical defense contractor. It all depends on your direct supervisor/manager. All other benefits of the company are comparable. Salary does include a yearly bonus.
good,Fast pace work environment.  Constant and steady work to keep you busy.  No down time most weeks.  Management needs training in their inter-personal skills.
good,I worked at Raytheon for a little over a year and never felt as though I was given enough training to do my job.  As such I personally felt that job security was low.
good,The work culture was very unexpected. Some of the things that went on were things you would think a small company would still be doing. Lots of turnover. People with little knowledge were in charge of you.
good,The company should really focus on millennials and not previous generations. There is a lot of process and not enough foresight into where the market is actually going in the technology sector.
good,"My  job became stagnant.  Was there 8 years and simply became professionally bored.  I had 6 direct reports, several which i personally hired.  I slowly realized that my job was not necessarily needed.  This was a slow realization.  I decided to leave and try something totally new.  I love to mentor and pass on what I have learned in terms of dealing with issues/problems, etc."
good,The work is sometimes interesting but the management isn't good. The company culture is not really great. Some people have worked there for a long time and don't want to let new people replace them or learn the job because they are afraid they will be laid off.
good,"There were some interesting challenges.  I was usually pretty isolated from my management.  Often we worked in different buildings or even on a different campus.  It was not unusual to go 6 months without seeing or talking to my manager.  Also, most of the managers I had were from completely different disciplines than me."
good,Solid company but long hours and the management was not up to par. Raytheon started out to be a great company until they changed management in our area and then it all went down hill. Several people left due to the lack of advancement and fair treatment.
good,"Workplace only average, typical management bureaucracy leading to inefficiency and poor overall front line management of employees.  very incompetent and ego driven supervisors more interested in self preservation and promotion than effective management."
good,"I was a contractor there, I received no bene's but even though I had a 'foot in the door' I still couldn't get interviews for internal job openings because of the 'buddy' system that goes on in big corporations.  So needless to say it was a waste of my time contracting there and doing the horrible commute because I had to find a job elsewhere."
good,"Mixed bag company: salary and benefits are OK, but management needs further work (at least in my group). Job security is also non-existent (also for my group)."
good,"Too much favoritism good old boy network.  The work was not bad at all.  Learned many things and the hours where great.  Hardly no overtime and the benefits were excellent.  The management was not fair and they distant themselves from the employees, only the favorites were taken care of."
good,"Raytheon seems to be about profits, they undercut their departments and seem to keep profit at their most focus. Felt they squeezed all out of me then through me away when they felt they could get no more. They're all about perception and small on action."
good,This job was difficult.  Difficult enough that I had to put in a lot of unpaid overtime.  It was thankless in that regard.  I definitely had no work/life balance either because of the overtime I was putting in.  It's sad because I really enjoyed my job.  I just didn't like how hard I had to work to do it.
good,"Routine type of job "
good,"Very Good overall, fellow employees were great and became friends. Middle management however was not well liked and created an uncomfortable work environment."
good,"As a Raytheon employee I found working groups too clickish. No actual real diversity is allowed. If you don't think like everyone else you are frowned at and even shunned. Contract job I had was easier going then being Raytheon employee. Diversity was allowed at the contract position. Management was good, with open door policy."
good,"Great people to work with, and really fun technology. Program success was often more dependent on bringing in work (budget), than on producing quality products. As a result, Project Management was generally focused on cost, leaving Engineers to often work 20+ hours of OT to finish their work.Line Management almost never had any clue as to what was going on and were generally only good for assigning ""rock fetches"" and other low-value tasks."
good,"Company still needs to make improvements on their day to day operations, training is very limited and management needs improvements. The company does offer great benefits and experiences can vary drastically between various departments."
good,Good place to work to learn new skills. I do not think this is a place one work for until retirement. I think it is a good place to work only for entry level skills
good,"A typical day includes changes to yesterday' direction."
good,"Inspecting incoming products for compliance before it goes to be installed or delivered to the customer, using calipers, micrometers and blueprints. Using Prism/SAP/Eagle system to input compliant or noncompliant issues, planning and execution phases of individual ship availabilities as outlined in NAVSEA Standard Item 009-67, enter and pull test data, and report inspections. Consulting with senior management for programs that provide for the inspection and acceptance of products and services provided by contractors"
good,"Loved working for Raytheon. Really enjoyed the smart people I worked with and supporting the Warfighter.  However, the environment was toxic and negative.  Management created a very hostile, negative, and defensive working environment.  There is little opportunity for advancement and the compensation is mediocre.  However, the paid time off, 401K plan and health benefits are second to none"
good,"Leadership in the Quality Organization lacks clear vision of where they're going and what they want to accomplish; getting more hung up on making up metrics than innovating Quality processes and better Quality Management and engineering overall.  "
good,Management is horrible therefore the job is horrible. Benefits are the only good thing about working here. Very difficult to advance if you stay in the same group. You must apply in order to advance.
good,"Somewhat unorganized and a constant battle with management in order to resolve issues. Any tasks related HR such as pay, timecards, and vacation take quite a while to be completed."
good,"It was obvious early on that Raytheon wants to be one of its larger competitors. I worked at the other company and they aren't succeeding at being as good or better. For starters, the technology some people need to do their job is so outdated. Even basics like Outlook aren't rolled out. Prepare to step back on time unless you are willing to find and pay for training on your own. Lots of conflicting messages about flexibility and balance."
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work, but their culture is in a state of disaster since consolidating.  Morale is low and program leadership is being allowed to run wild."
good,"work 15 hours per day, little management, short deadlines, little notice when items are changing, away from family, slow computer system"
good,"I have enjoyed my time here at Raytheon, I am just sorry that they will be closing by the end of the year.  That is why I am currently looking for a new employer"
good,It's okay if you focus on your tasks. Every place has its issues. Do what you went to do then go home. pay attention to what you have to do and only you
good,"The best productive empoyees and good place to work.Management on the other hand is not good,killing the company,slowelybut surely."
good,Spent a year as an intern training to become an embedded systems engineer. Established a very strong understanding of limited memory requirements and enjoy working with hardware. I knew what I wanted to do before I started working for them but they only re-enforced my curiosity and drive to learn.
good,"Yearly ""bumps"" are very minimal compared to some other companies out there.  Like some other large companies, HR moves at a glacial pace."
good,My Review overall of the company is it's a great place to get your foot in the door and it gives your the opportunity to learn new things.
good,"Learned many things, didn't agree with management in many things but it was a somewhat good work experience until new management came on board."
good,"It is a very large defense company. Employees are a number in the system. It has the typical benefits of a large organization as well as the typical negatives. As an offsite employee on a military contract, there was little interaction with corporate office. It was more who you know than how well you can do your job. Management did not manage and were hired not due to their qualifications."
good,"There has been a significant shift in the corporate management of the Aurora CO campus in the last two years.  Benefits have been significantly reduced.  Employees are now seen as replaceable tools instead of essential members of an engineering team.  The new corporate management culture encourages managers to make poor short term decisions to make schedule/budget at the expense of long term project success.  This leads to down-stream budget/schedule constraints that are levied onto the workforce, leading to high burn-out rates and low employee retention rates.  50-60 hour work weeks (sometimes uncompensated) are increasingly the norm.  There is no sign this is going to change any time soon.  This WAS a good company to work for."
good,"Pikewerks was a great company, Raytheon destroyed it. (Raytheon needs to work on the acquisition process). The work is challenging (although it's frequently the same thing for different customers), lots of smart people, very little turn over (before the acquisition), no support for products / capabilities reuse."
good,Great place to work yet job security is a worry as well as very hard and near impossible to move up the ladder. Lack the benifit for any training to staff.
good,Limited engagement from management.  Too much red tape.  Organization is so large that rarely can one person make a difference.  Little advance or incentives offered. Pay is not competitive
good,"I was typically harassed because the Engineering team liked all of the skills that I could provide to them to help with the [Config.3+] assignment. Others in the work area were upset that I was always picked for prestigious projects."
good,"There is little or no actual new work coming in and many contracts are ending."
good,Coworkers were OK and typical day was not busy. I learned that people in management sometime forget about taking care of employees as long as they are taken care of that is all that matters.
good,"I am working in a very light, and easy going work space. The hardest part of working here is trying not to take my work home with me. Everyone is treated equally and with respect. I have a great manager, and have great co workers as well. I have learned so many things from dealing with difficult customers, to learning how to maintain and help organize an office with 90 employees."
good,Could be a real good company to work for but has weak leadership in key roles that prevent the company from reaching the top 5% best companies to work for success.
good,Great company to start your career and to end your career. There is a varied experience depending on your immediate supervisor. Advancement in the company depends highly on politics as popularity is highly regarded. There can be a work life balance depending on management and job role. Work is unfairly distributed as talented employees are sometimes given more work. Also pay for the same tasks and job roles can vary as I get compensated much less than a fellow coworker just because of the number of years they have been at the company even though my performance at the task/job surpasses theirs.
good,"A Senior Industrial Security Manager with over 15 years experience in the classified environment, implementing procedures and providing objective management of tasks associated with industrial security programs."
good,Management was a little too old school - Machiavellian.
good,Easy place to work and plenty of training if you need it. Managers have open door policy. Pay is below average and the people are old. Great job security.
good,"productive some days do my own work plus did some training,meetings.soldering, bonding, mechanical, circuit broad solder,followed planning instructions, used leak test machine on some parts,used a hot plate to solder some parts together, build harrness, and felx cables.some management were ok,co-workers easy to get along with.the hardest part was getting the management to listen to you.most enjoyable was when you can have a good laugh"
good,Great company with a nice cafeteria.  Management move people around like you’re just a number without any notice or consent.  Union seems to sided with the company itself to cut down law required breaks to 10 minutes and work everyone like a work horse.  Lack of communication and if you don’t have a family member in the management side or higher up good luck on getting any advancement due to favoritism.
good,"The ethics, moral, integrity, trust, respect that's touted is overcome by their recent under cutting of the REAL costs in order to win contracts.  They have wiped the very foundation they believe in because everyone is too STRESSED to show true respect for their fellow co-workers."
good,The main way to move forward in this company is to have friends in high places. They struggle retaining a young workforce. The 27-45 age range is nearly nonexistent.
good,"Overall the people you work with are good, educated individuals."
good,"The writing team for the team I was on, was disorganized and didn't follow any current technical writing best practices. No one seemed to care. If I worked there again, it would be for a different department."
good,"Great workplace, I have thoroughly enjoyed by time here.  Mostly enjoyed the location, close to my home.  No freeway driving required!!  They could do a better job promoting from within."
good,"Easily lost in the fray.  Not employee focused. I originally worked overseas in Abu Dabi but the contract was lost and most employees were give just days notice that their positions were phased out.  Fortunately, I found employment within Raytheon so that I only lost out on a few weeks of pay."
good,"My experience with Raytheon was not a pleasant one.  Raytheon does not hold its management accountable for their errors.  While Raytheon insists it support values, I found that to be less than true.  But then, I was working at a remote site -- not in a large corporate office, so perhaps things are different there."
good,"Many meetings throughout the day. Raytheon has become less agile and more process focused, which reduces the company's ability to lower their cost to perform on small and short contracts."
good,"Raytheon is a large company with a wide variety of management styles. When I worked in supply chain, I found it to be a meaningful experience with a supportive manager."
good,"I was there for 18 months as a contractor, and could not get any support in becoming a Raytheon employee. This is despite having a spouse and several contacts in the organization."
good,"Generally felt I had to claw my way to any advancement, and took on positions that were unique and therefore not clearly understood compared to typical software positions.  Felt invisible despite going above and beyond many many times."
good,"Worked for the company for 38 years it was very good to me and I gave 110 present to the Company. Last 10 years were difficult due to the Company hiring from outside the Company, for financial reasons. What I seen happening was totally unacceptable for a Defense Company. The new personnel handled the Planning/ Scheduling and Logistics as if Raytheon was just an ""Off the Shelf"" Company, which in fact is totally the opposite! That is when I decided that the 38 years was great to me and to just trust the company and hope for the best, which was to retire happily, which I did!"
good,Good company to work for.  Hard to get promoted and they move you around like chess pieces no matter what current position you work in.  It's a pleasant work environment.
good,"Thought this would be the place I retired at.  Low increases, diminishing training and not keeping the experienced talent has forced me to look elsewhere."
good,Raytheon offered decent benefits.  The pay was good.  There were opportunities for advancement.  It could be a little stressful at times with the fast pace of some projects.
good,"What you would expect from large company. Lots of meetings, many levels of approval necessary for everything, very little autonomy or decision making ability at the ground level of revenue generation."
good,Its the luck of the draw on your management team if they care to move forward with you or just care about their numbers.  Honestly this seems to be the norm at other places so as long as you you never complain about working 65 hour weeks for the whole year should be fine.
good,"Management, projects, and team are great, however, feels like I'm being held back salary and promotion wise."
good,The atmosphere was unprofessional. The employees always complained about management and one another. The pay for the area was far below what it should have been.
good,Did not enjoy my time here.  Worked in Dallas Texas and the commute was atrocious.  My management was typical government.  Slow and did not seem interested in me.
good,None stressful workplace. Everyone easy to get along with. Very fast pace. Helps the day go by fast. Management team knowledgeable about all the rules and procedures.
good,Although the pay was low when I was there it was a good fun job that ha great employees.  Management was not good and there was a high turn over rate.  I do miss the people.
good,Raytheon was a place where the work life and home life worked together. They allowed me to be a mother first. They were good about the leniency for taking care of personal situations as long as you covered your shift and pulled your load.
good,The Management style at Raytheon is not conducive to critical discussions.   The work is fun and the products make a difference in the world.  They strive to utilize state of the art techniques
good,"Okay place to start out your career. Career advancement really depends on what role and department you manage to start with. If you start at the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong role, no matter how hard you work, if you don't have ""visibility"" advancing will be nothing short of a miracle.The red tape you have to go through is ridiculous. It's one thing to adhere to government regulations, it's another to add unnecessary BS on top of that just to pat yourself on the back and say ""look what we're doing"". Most of the people I've worked with have been good. The managers tend to be horrible."
good,"Raytheon offers some nice perks like a 9/80 work schedule and the best education packages I've ever heard of. They actually bring in instructors to host masters programs for their employees."
good,This job was remote. I worked in a completely separate branch of the company. As such I don't feel qualified to accurately describe working for them. The job itself was great.
good,"A day at work, lots of work and pull in more then one direction at a time, fast pace,good coworkers but upper management gives no respect to employees,under appreciated ed and compensated."
good,I accepted a job offer at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. in 1990. It was a campus feeling and a flexible environment.  It is now Raytheon.  It is not the environment it once was.
good,"Work days are bogged down with electronic forms and bureaucracy, that aren't always easy to deal with. It interferes with work in progress more than anything else."
good,"People are motivated, professional, and friendly. "
good,"OK company to work for, very cliquey though so if you aren't in the right crowd or right location your ability for advancement diminishes greatly, Nice buildings though"
good,"Raytheon is a challenging place to work. Opportunities are afforded, but at a slow rate. Each year, more cuts are obvious and no personnel replacements to lower the workload/stress"
good,Great place to work at when things are running smoothly.  I worked there during the major defense contractor mergers and acquisitions.  They had a hard time keeping up with taking care of the folks.
good,"Raytheon is a great company."
good,"Raytheon is going through a major transition regarding personnel.  The experienced and the new hired personnel.  The Corporate level believes personnel are plug and play, contrary to that belief experience is a premium for ALL Companies.  If not properly passed down to the younger population profitable success will be difficult."
good,"check in station, discus any previous problems, if any , walk around the plant to check equipment- which took about 30min, set a your station- read a book for 2hrs- take another walk to check equipment and repeat till your shift is over"
good,Company offers good health benefits. Turn over is high due to volatile market and inability to retain talent. Under Democratic President usually major costs due to lack of funding.
good,"Good company, but very dependent on government contracts. Lots of quarters where they talk about layoffs but don't actually lay people off. Coworkers are great! Benefits are decent."
good,"""Its not what you do, its who you know.""  That's a quote from senior management."
good,"Company has a diverse workforce, important programs, environmental friendly, safety standard compliant working conditions, and industry average compensation."
good,"need more test work in the Huntsville area.  travel not an issue, working hard has never been an issue. Testing saves money and lives."
good,Got to the point where I didn't know what the management wanted.  It was a decent place to work.  We generally didn't have to work a lot of overtime.
good,My job was to ensure that any issues that came up with the functions of the logistic department were managed correctly.  I worked beside other professional engineers in system and software backgrounds to ensure that the contract guidelines were adhered to and that all requirements were meet on time and under budget.
good,"The was a down grade position that I was used to working for, but I enjoyed working with the Staff and getting to meet different people. The hardest part was not watching the TV that's located in the lobby area."
good,"Stand most of the day, 12.5 hour shifts.  Great benefits, however, no chance of advancement at all."
good,Good company with opportunity to take on additional responsibility.  Rewarding to assist employees with their benefit/payroll related questions.
good,average work load.learned military technology.management is overkill/top heavy.co-workers lack technical skills/army recruits.hardest part is being away from home.most enjoyable is learning a new culture.
good,"Driving far to a fun job.work with military,hard are the shift changes"
good,over all great company. has soon great people to work with. need to improve leadership base.
good,The Supervisor for the Security Team Is very lousy at his job and nothing is ever his fault.
good,"For me, working for Raytheon was both a great experience but also a challenge. I was never spoken to by management before I was terminated, and it actually came as a complete shock when I was let go."
good,Great place to work if your an engineer. All supportive functions are viewed as expendible. GReat place to work if you are a peropleperson and is willing to build a solid network.
good,Raytheon's benefits are top notched to match their pay. The upper level management seems to really be in touch with where they want the company to move. The advancement possibilities are very limited according to what I have seen. They prefer older retired military versus a up and comer for leadership positions. That is where the shift occurs as far as the company culture. The hardest part of the job is seeing people who don't care get the leadership posisitions or them hiring someone from the outside instead of from within.
good,When you work for a government contractor there is a constant stress that funding will be cancelled. This leads to apprehension in whether you will have a permanent position. The opportunity to learn is constant but there is little chance for advancement for an individuel contributor. They do have flexible work schedules available to some positions. Great opportunity as a starting point in your career.
good,Defense cuts are taking their impact. Culture has degraded. Employee respect has degraded significantly.
good,"office work in a big company, so-so management, good co-workers, hardest part of the job was the commute"
good,Good co-workers - comradry
good,Work environment is comprable to other AS companies. No better or worse.
good,job was nice when you could get work assigned to you. Cant really wait around for assignments to be handed down. I have responsibilities to meet. I understand the company doesn't care about that. but it is a fact nonetheless
good,"Overall it was great only thing that really "
good,Raytheon Solipsys is a great opportunity of for individuals that are self-starters who can work on and complete task with little instruction. Culture is open to accommodate individual's lifestyles.
good,"Depending on the area you are employed, opinions vary.  They are a diverse company and working to inclusive of everyone.  Raytheon's work/life balance could use an updating."
good,Not hard work but the pay is below the cost of living for the area. No option to work from home. Contract has extended well past the initial time frame with no offer.
good,"Not a software company but needs software people.  Good work/life balance, but compensation is reflective (focus is more on benefits).  Poor software engineering career development and difficult management."
good,"Finding ways to kill time is a necessary skill when working at Raytheon. For example, it took me two weeks to get a copy of Microsoft Visual Studio, and the person in charge had the gall to ask me why I needed it."
good,Raytheon is a good place to work. Someone are a little to work with but the overall culture is not bad. No room to grow as the site is small and they seem to promote within.
good,"Workplace culture allows low-level managers and other non-Raytheon employees to escalate and report issues (e.g. disagreements) directly to their department heads rather than attempt at resolving them at the lowest possible level.  Thus, a cut-throat environment is created."
good,"Raytheon is a decent company to work for. I have a number of reasons for leaving the company, and maybe they just apply to me. I'm not sure about the ethics of defense contract work, but I don't know everything that's going on in the world and sometimes deadly force is required to keep people safe. The technology I worked with was old - clearcase - and updated - Jenkins."
good,"It was good very clean fun some times mostly friendly people."
good,"The culture is horrible, unless you are part of the in crowd which means you have a relative in upper management. High pods receive preferential treatment. HR is the worthless. I LOVED my job, but did not like the culture,everything you did, felt like walking on eggshells,doing your job here is '' not good enough.""  "
good,Enjoyed my time at Raytheon.  For the most part management greatly contributed to successful project completion; other times they were a great hinderance.
good,"Immediate manager was the worst manager I ever had in my over 30+ career.  "
good,"Work for Software Developers requires a Secret Security Clearance. Most work and meetings are held in closed labs and rooms. Communications between managers and developers is minimal. Independence of action is limited. "
good,the pay is great and it is a good place to log time in. Don't get any ideas of advancement or that the company / union actually cares about you they don't. your opinion doesn't matter. Upper management does not have a clue what happens below them. they say one thing and low level management do what they please. management will break rules over and over again because they know nothing will happen to them. squeaky wheel doesn't get the grease it gets in trouble for something else
good,Sat at my station and carried out my duties. I learned different troubleshooting techniques. Management was nonexistent. The workplace was routined. The hardest part was making deadlines. The most enjoyable part was the people.
good,Managers are very young (30ish) with very little practical experience.  The training was erratic due to the fact the production operations were out of control.  I.e. always putting out fires.
good,I am on a contract for Raytheon. They have to many processes and training. A lot of red tape to get anything done. I have been waiting for a promised promotion for about 6 months. I'm over this company and my management.
good,"Great work/life balance but IT staff our grossly underpaid and expendable.  They rarely promote from within, must leave company to get higher compensation."
good,"I worked for this company for over a decade."
good,"Raytheon is a typical Aerospace/Government contractor company. Lots of red tape which makes it hard to get things done quickly and efficiently. The people are great, management can be difficult. They are definitely more about you working than having a life at times. However, you do get a decent amount of vacation time and they are closed between Christmas and New Year's!"
good,"This company is an example of - it depends on where you are working for if you will love it or hate it. This company was developed by purchasing many small companies but these companies were not integrated into mother Raytheon very well and it as caused issues in areas of the company. They are trying to solve these and my experience dates back many years so this may no longer be an issue."
good,"For some of us, the hardest part of the job is the commute.  Hwy 105 and 405 are always packed rush hours at work days. Some jobs here require security clearances.  Jobs are starting to move to Texas."
good,"If you get the right job you will find that its not a bad place to work but you do have to find the right position for you, I did find so good facts about the company."
good,I was hired under a job descripion unlike what the real job entailed and was told that the hiring manager did not like me because I was their 2nd choice.
good,IF you like 55+ hours per week this is a good place.   The culture is generally collaborative but depends on the team.  Management can be good but work/life balance is missing
good,"People were willing to work with others, they had a lot of cliffs between depts. that someone had to bridge or product would sit. I learned a great deal off the managers, they were good mentors."
good,"Raytheon is an excellent company to work for as your final job.  If you are young and want to learn, do not work there.  I worked there 4 years and found myself confined to the system and did not learn much.  Raytheon moves verrrrryyy slowwwww."
good,I enjoyed the people and work I did.  I was held in very high esteem and was considered one of the better writers as I also was and instructor of the equipment that I was writing about
good,"if you like doing the same thing day in and day out then this palce is for you. however, if u have a college degree in a stem field then this palce is for you."
good,"High pressure to meet impossible deadlines, lack of recognition for excellent work, lack of advancement, lack of salary adjustment, lack of job security."
good,I was employed as a Human Resources Employment Recruiter interviewing and hiring professional employees. I also served as a college graduate recruiter and compensation analyst before voluntarily leaving Raytheon.
good,The Nature of the Defense Contracting business is unfortunately very political and somewhat stressful. It varies from project to project but it's something that comes with the job.
good,Worked with the soldiers on various equipment thru out the post.  Preventive maintenance on all kinds of military vehicles.  Check fluids and report any damaged parts on record.
good,"Teaching yourself the process isn't necessary a bad thing, I have learned a lot because of it and I am grateful for the experience.  Problem is noone is willing to teach a person when they may be confused.  The process has a large learning curve and is a very painful transition into new things.  Unless you are willing to work through that pain, a person will not thrive at this establishment."
good,"If you are an Electrical or Mechanical Engineer, then Raytheon is a great place to work. Other professions, however, will find their way to promotion blocked by political hacks from the military who know little about the jobs they oversee. They talk about treating their employees well, but they promote those that scream, yell, and berate their underlings to achieve goals that are often underbid and have short schedules in order to win projects. There is clearly gender bias wherein women engineers are given preferential treatment."
good,"A good place to gain experience and build resume but company is not necessarily loyal to long time employees which weakens job security.  Like all big companies, cultural & work environment depends work group management -- some are very positive & some are not.  Good benefits:  salary, bonus, 401K, employee stock plan, retirement plan, flex work week, generous vacations, and strong training programs.  Overall, it can be a good company to work for, but long term job security can be an issue."
good,"If you work in a hourly position, you cannot advance with this company. That advancement works only on seniority. Advancement only comes with salary paid positions. Raytheon has great benefits but the health care took a HUGE hit when Obamacare kicked in."
good,A typical work day is traveling to different Army installations and performing whatever maintenance is needed to keep the radar system up and running.
good,"Inclusive workplace culture with professional and ethical colleagues. Great Benefits and 401K."
good,You are expected to work many unpaid hours. It has a Northeastern US culture. Multiple opportunities for the younger employees.................................................
good,It was a really good company to work for until the layoff which got really ugly for everyone there hourly and salary all together. Other than that my fellow co-workers were very easy to get along but don't get me wrong there is never a perfect work place and we are human after all.
good,"The company is very diverse and tries to promote diversity. The people I work with are very nice (although not extremely talented). There is, however, no career advancements for the younger employees. I work very hard there and only see a 4% raise very year with a bit of stock options. It seems like (at least in my program) that things are going downhill... Less benefits every year. For example, there are really no free lunches and they stopped paying for training. I guess this is not really their fault because of how government contracts work. The work is frankly just not that challenging, mainly because there is a huge dependency on Systems Engineers. It seems like Software Engineers there are ""replaceable""."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for if you're a solid employee. Many good and hard working people who produce quality products for our war fighters."
good,"Management is definitely in need of internal evaluation/oversight in terms of fairness, honesty and ethics. This is an area that has seriously declined in the last few years."
good,"Raytheon has a lot of great people, but there seems to be a talent gap.  They have a lot of people that have been there forever, and a lot of people who just graduated from undergrad.  The people that are coming out of undergrad do alright because they are promoted quickly to about Sr. Eng. I, but then their careers seem to stagnate or they move on: hence the gap."
good,"A pretty easy work environment. People can be a little isolated and not willing to help. Hours are reasonable and compensation is good for Tucson, AZ."
good,About 80% of the work force had to deploy to Antarctica for the summer season.  It became challenging once the program started evolving.
good,"wish it hadn't been contract work. I enjoyed learning all the new stuff that was being made, and learning how to build and test the stuff."
good,Enjoyed working for Raytheon overseas. They are very supportive of their employees working overseas. They are prompt in addressing issues as they arise. There leave policy isn't the best but not the worst
good,"The benefits package is very good, and the 401K program could have matching fund but overall it is good. My overall experience with the company was limited"
good,"If good work/life balance and job stability is your main concern, this is a fantastic place to work.  If you want a challenging and innovative work environment, this is not the place."
good,"Worked extensively with customers on product issues including Supply Chain Management (Source Inspection), supplier audits and hardware quality reviews.  Chaired Failure Review Boards for both Space and Radar Programs.  Designated as a subject matter expert in Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Systems (FRACAS).  Experienced in leading Integrated Products Teams from design and development to field supportability of ground and space based systems.  Key Strengths include:"
good,"Interesting technical work, decent pay, but performance and pay are only loosely correlated.  Management and the technical experts tend to be risk averse, largely due to the primary customer being the U.S government.  This risk aversion sometimes prevent innovation."
good,"Raytheon is a good place to get your feet wet to start off a career. With Raytheon on your resume, it's easy to find your next gig once you've put in a few years. Just be careful about the specific Raytheon location. The Albuquerque, NM location has some department managers who shouldn't be in management -- they are too young and inexperienced. But the reason they are in management is that they were already with Ktech when it was acquired by Raytheon in 2011. Thus, they have their positions via inheritance, rather than through merit. Also, the HR support at the Albuquerque site is sorely lacking -- it is one deep and expected to deal with a couple hundred personnel. All things considered, Raytheon is a fine company to work for, except for the Albuquerque, NM site. If a recruiter contacts you about a position there, be very careful. If you are an experienced engineer or technician, and the panel interviewing you comprises mostly people who look too young for the positions they hold, red flags should go up in your mind."
good,"Corporate atmosphere is extensively leadership focused with a focus on processes to the detriment to productivity."
good,Provides challenging environment but career may be short lived with company due management looking at employees as readily replaceable units.
good,"I have a job-share situation.  Six months I worked strategy, while the other six months I worked competitive intelligence.  I worked with all levels of management.  I did some traveling; Boston, D.C. Enjoyed working the yearly Strategic Dialogue. The best project I had was  Soldier Appreciation event.  I was able to go to Ft. Hood several times, interfaced with many military ranks. I arranged for all the lodging, meals, transportation and entertainment of the troops.  Quite and honor. I did all the logistics and designed the ""coin"" which was presented by the VP of Raytheon to each military attendee."
good,"When I first started there I was told it would be easy for me to move up with in the company. But, once I start taking my career in my on hands and applying for jobs with in the company. My supervisor at the time would not let me go. Sayjing we are short handed and he could not afford to lose a hard work."
good,"- I normally start of by saying good morning to my co-workers.  Followed by drinking my morning coffee while I'm at my desk logging in to the email system."
good,"Negotiating new business price proposals with the Government on a daily basis. Primary interface with the Government for contractual issues.  Work closely with Subcontracts on performance and compliance issues.  Answering Government's concerns on compliance and performance issue as the prime contractor.  Assisting the leadership team with making revenue and bookings goals. Demanding management team, but most members fair dealing. As with any work environment you have to work with various types of individuals, most hard working and passionate about the task at hand.  Hardest part of the job is negotiating items at the task order level with the government that had already for the most part been agreed and settled on at the IDIQ Master Contract level.  However, not in favor of the contractor.  The most enjoyable part of the job is actually negotiating up in favor of the Company, and persuading the Government to award a higher contract value."
good,"They talk about diversity but, employees branch out to be more diverse in their careers they are not protected due to years of service. They favor those in the current directorates verses those with more experience and years of knowledge."
good,"Great company with a great mission! Depending on the position in the company, everyday was unique and challenging. Management lacked basic people skills which made getting the most out of their subordinates very difficult. Recognition and promotion were rarely based on a set of tangible results and more based on popularity. Hardest part of the job was being mismanaged but the work itself was fulfilling and rewarding."
good,I was the logistic specialist for raytheon. Worked with Afghanistan Army to issue out gear. Good pay but management was horrible.
good,"Run diagnostics of every associated device for the ship's WAN."
good,"I enjoy the work I do and have had the pleasure of working with some very good people through the years. My favorite task was the first task. I had the good fortune of working under a great mentor who taught the fellow group of 4 new hires the ins and outs of FPGA design."
good,"Typical work day isn't bad, flex hours are great. Some of the management is too involved with employees on a personal level,  other parts of management treat you as a replaceable number. Co-workers are great and is what keeps your sanity, at this company."
good,"While I was only an administrative support specialist, it was still a nice experience. Upward mobility and human resources (appropriate job placement for personnel, specifically) were lacking, but the company seemed like it was a pleasant place to work."
good,"People you work with are great.  But, the management is metric driven and very old boy network."
good,Not ideal for my personality.  Overall non competitive work environment.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for this company is the challenge of working in such a fast and changing environment and hitting the goals - never a dull moment.  The hardest part of the job is maneuvering around very process-oriented folks. You learn quickly to ""manage"" them and get done what needs to be done on time and on budget."
good,KDC is a good place to get started in IT. You gain general knowledge of various systems when you set up classes.
good,"Innovative culture with exciting work"
good,Raytheon provided a work environment that allowed maintenance of current skills. It did not provide good opportunities for advancement or learning new skills.
good,Works a rotating schedule supporting various Army units for live training rotations. Very hectic schedule. Management was not the greatest. Co-workers were great.
good,Overall good corporation. Individual workers are a far second to production. A family type of management
good,"Compensation: hard to beat"
good,Same thing happens everday. Not enough work hours. Rules change a moments notice. Easy to learn how to run scenarios.
good,Management was unaware of individual performance. Large corporate structure makes it hard to get your hands on any real research and development. Mainly sustaining activities since the economic downturn.
good,working in general shift as team lead.its a service provider company
good,"Strict guidelines, plenty of overtime, good pay, frequent layoffs. Because they delt mostly in gov. contracts, training was constant."
good,"From my experience, the people at Raytheon are great to work with on a daily basis.Management has great vision and works hard to make sure the customer's needs are met. The hardest part of the job is meeting those needs and making the often tight deadlines (recently the usual is 2 day turn around for changes that should take 2 weeks). The most enjoyable part of the job is creating the designs for the new components to the system and finding the solutions to the customer's desires"
good,"I use to work at Raytheon in Tax department and a new Director came into the department and destroyed the whole department. If you want a stress free environment where they appreciate your work do not work in the Tax Department because you will get belittled, harrassed, and taken advantage of. Overall Raytheon as a whole is a great company to work for as long as it's not the Tax department."
good,"Inflexible and demanding management wants more, more and more out of their employees and doesn't seem to understand how they're burning people out. The overwhelming amount of bureaucracy prevents creativity and limits any sense of empowerment. Management says they want to run things more efficiently but no one is willing to modify the hundreds of policies to allow for such a change."
good,This is an extremely large company with many different intities.. The compensation is great.. The value so so but this is due to the management teams.. Most managers are stretched so thin that they are actually out of touch with the day to day.. This happens in large companies creating the numbers game with employees and taking the value of each person out of the equation.
good,The company had significant layoffs due to government cutting back in defense and loosing oversees contracts. Not a stable company to work for.
good,A typical day involves planning and organizing.
good,"typical day at work alway busy and always learned somethings from my co-worker and management is ok. my co-workers is always nice to me, the hardest part of the job is when people call in sick, the most enjoyable part of the job is we're own boss"
good,I have a multi funcational roll supporting production operations for Defense porgrams.
good,"Ingesting work location in Antarctica.Variety of duties including electrician.Challenging at times to live and work in a very small community,15 people for the winter."
good,"A lot of sitting around, and not much opportunity to work on new projects. Funding for training is lacking."
good,"Most people start work at 7:00 and work 10 to 14 hour days. There is a 9/80 schedule but, Friday work is still expected. Raytheon has a lot of finance systems and I learned a lot of them. Weekly Financial Planning, Long Range Planning, Cash Flow, Invoicing and Pricing are some. Management was challenging, there was not a lot of input accepted and direction was more of the style. Co-worker and program management were great and all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy a strict finance management interpretation of the policies and working the the programs to help the succeed with their programs. The co-worker and program management people were great and a pleasure to work with."
good,Management and HR does not care for the employees. Management will always find excuses. HR will not take any action on concerns. There would be 4+ complaints about a manager and HR will do nothing. Absolutely nothing.
good,"Large company, safe jobs, good benefits, able to relocate withing company, great people, leader in technical government contracting areas, sub contractor with other large companies"
good,Seeking help to understand company’s goals and objectives to work with dedication and commitment was so difficult when the only purpose was to meet deadlines no matter the cost.
good,Raytheon create Forcepoint. After the last adquisition and management changes  the company is working  hard to create the internal  culture and reinforce the technology with clear vision. Good place to work with hard challenges  in the market.
good,"New work environment, went out of my comfort zone. Management was very patient during my time with the company. Was a good/new experience a lot of skills taken."
good,Great company to work for but with the upcoming Merger with UTI I feel like a lot of people are on edge because they don’t know what the future brings
good,Raytheon is an excellent employer my experience working there showed that they are driven to achieve mission success and enable employees to develop their individual careers.
good,"Need improvement with quality of products and processes. Managers must be competent to understand how to resolve quality issues. Quality should be priority, not delivery."
good,"I currently work at Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson as a Program Security Manager.  I have worked at Raytheon Missile Systems since 2017, holding three different positions."
good,"If you fall into the right team with the right manager, Raytheon is a good place to work. Very rarely are you asked to work overtime and the positions I've had have been flexible with hours and location."
good,"Great Benefits, Good environment and training programs, well defined roles and expectations. "
good,"a good manager is a thing of beauty. A bad manager can make every day an exericse in futility. Raytheon has a a network of glad handing,non-productive mangers that can only see the and hear what they want."
good,"Culture is mostly laid back."
good,"Unfortunate to be gobbled up by the Raytheon acquisition machine.  Was patted on the head and told we were all going to be ok.  A year passed, things deteriorated.  Not a fan."
good,Raytheon is  one company with four businesses. Even though everyone works for Raytheon your benefits varies according to the business you are assigned too.
good,"Middle age women are invisible to management and there is little desire to understand my skills and background to place in appropriate positions.  Advancement, promotions, increased pay is few and far between."
good,"I have a disruptive personality, so my experience was pretty miserable. While I'm young, I've definitely had experiences in companies that valued everyone's opinion, and there were acceptable times to speak up if you disagreed or saw a better alternative. If you'd like to be somewhere that publicly discredits and shuns opinions based on seniority, this is the place for you."
good,Not a terrible place to work but union fees are taken for a union that sits around and does very little. Some departments were great to work for while some (magnetic's specifically) are awful and stuck in past ways with no desire to improve or modernize with the rest of the plant
good,"Great pay, lots of bureaucracy. Multiple layers of approvals to make progress. Workplace culture seems to be more of who you know or are related to. Standard expectation to work long hours to get the job done, no OT. Expectation to be available onsite during weekend afternoons."
good,Was not employee there very long. Supervisors were competent professional individuals. Bickering among the leads and shifts was extensive. Especially on 1st shift.
good,Very high paced and challenging.  The overall mission was the primary duty to be accomplished with continual scrutiny by management.  Very task orientated.
good,"I've worked for this company twice now in the past few years."
good,"A typical day of work, was very pleasant. Co-workers all worked together and managment was open to each employee. There was an open door policy to all employees."
good,"The culture is excellent and the jobs are interesting.  There is no time for boredom because there is so much work.  There is a great deal of talent at Raytheon and the employees provide exemplary service and development.  They are at the threshold of technology.  Unfortunately, the pay is low for the job requirements and applied skills, and turnover is rampant."
good,"Lots of opportunity to do paperwork, but no real design work."
good,Good company can be hard to advance or easy to get stuck in one place if you don't find the right doors to open or unless you get lucky in opportunities.
good,typical work day consist of receiving packages from shippers and/or prepping outbound packages for shipment. sweeping floors when work was low or slow. coworkers were sociable. good comradery.
good,"Raytheon is a great company to work, assuming you are in a good position. With the amount of work coming in, it is busy. However, this makes it harder to move around the company because people do not have enough time to train younger engineers. However, they do provide tuition reimbursement. The opportunity is there, however it is hard since you need to build connections and demonstrate you have a good understanding of your field. "
good,Was a great place to work. The staff was more than helpful and there was a great workplace culture. Due to the DOD reduction in spending I was laid off.
good,"people were o.k. to work with."
good,Very much an old boys network.  They value their friends over true performers. Tough to come in from outside company middle career unless you are previous service member.  Very little personal responsibility on behalf of management.  More than willing to throw subs under the bus.
good,Only issue I saw was not much support from Management if something went wrong. Always the line workers fault. Employees must be flexible due to the ever changing work environment.
good,"I was not at E-Systems very long.  It was an okay place to work but the wages in the entire San Antonio area were low, so I moved back to California for a high paying job."
good,"About what you would expect across the board. Just about every major player in the defense industry operates in the same way (including benefits, etc.,)."
good,Was a good place to work.  I had great coworkers and good management.  I was able to complete my daily tasks without much interference or micro management.
good,Corporate is a tough place to be.  Culture can be difficult for females especially.  I understand the other sites are more welcoming. I have visited them and they are more laid back with a more friendly environment.
good,"Coordinated benefits, payroll, interviewing, hiring, training, and related human resources issues with the corporate office, Facilitated the transition of Raytheon after there purchase of Hughes Technical Services Company. Planned employee travel and processed expense reports. Manage all telephonic, written and electronic correspondence for the site."
good,It is absolutely annoying that this is a necessary and unavoidable step that I am require to take. One should absolutely be able to skip this if that is what they elect.
good,Used to be a good place work. But a lot has changed past few years. Working for a defense company provides you a pride in what you do is important to military in the world.
good,A Typical day was to go in and sit a computer for 12 hours and help analyst with their everyday job. The schedule was great having to work Sunday through Wednesday one week and Sunday to Tuesday the next.
good,"as the years have gone by we have lost a new incentive every year and are continually told that it will be better in the end.  while the work is generally fulfilling and the days are not long, the company is not doing what it should be doing to offset the cost increase occurring due to inflation and an imbalanced economy"
good,do no ask people to write reviews or force them to do so.  I just want to upload my resume and put it out there in the hopes of bettering my career.  I really don't have time for this
good,"Tucson employees were not well liked by the company. As Hughes Aircraft, there was loyalty from management to workers and vice versa. Raytheon is strictly top  10 percent inclusion.  The products was great just the synergy was not kind. I retired."
good,"I originally went to work for Raytheon because I had met and worked with a number of people on a project that was shared between Raytheon and Northrop Grumman.  However, after I started working at Raytheon, I felt the projects were less math intensive, and the problems were mainly maintenance issues, or rewriting poorly designed and poorly written code.  "
good,"My daily work, I was kept busy at all times. I've learned more about strategies, brainstorming, researching. Management is good. When issues arise the problem was resolved in a timely manner. Good culture. The part is fitting into a work-space that is unfamiliar grounds. Working with those willing to support you and see you do well."
good,Working at Raytheon was exciting and challenging. The benefit of working there was you were able to work with some experienced intelligent people. The cons were due mostly to the stressful environment and lack of management.
good,"Punch in, punch out, get work done. Code reviews are helpful and not much gets in the way. The work itself is mildly important. The co-workers are nice people."
good,Raytheon has giving me an opportunity to learn about their products and the process giving me the knowledge that I have now to perform great task and confidence to explore this type of work and wanting to advance and best utilize my skills.
good,"Good experience there, manager was great, culture was not what expected, great benefits , every other Friday off with a 9/80 schedule, learned program management skills,"
good,"Great place to work with good benefits."
good,exciting industry but not a great hr culture. work is not that challenging and it's very political. hr does not govern itself the way it asks the business to.
good,"here we go, another mandatory entry so that indded.com can gather information.  I am tempted just to send my resume directly in for the job, rather than spend all day doing this."
good,"Raytheon as a whole is a good place -- they have a bunch of interesting projects and a lot of talented people.  The culture is rather progressive, and there's a lot of push to catch up with modern practices.  I learned a fair bit about REALLY BIG projects."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. Being off a week during Christmas. Working hours are in the morning. Health insurance. Paid vacations.
good,Departments and programs are rigidly structured; little flexibility in job duties. Management using EVMS emphasizes profit before product. Personnel assignments based on availability rather than appropriate skill match.
good,"8-10 hours day"
good,"You start your career at Raytheon, and slowly most of your peers leave over the years for higher paying positions at other companies. It's sad to see so much regrettable attrition. I spend more time training new people than doing the work we are paid to perform. Starting pay was great, however monetary raises thereafter are bad (2-8%/year) because they really aren't tied to workload or capability- it's more that you are working a important task with vocal leads/management."
good,"Co-workers were very positive and always willing to step up when called on. Management was not supportive at all and was very negative and had to many meeting, but my overall experience was wonderful."
good,I would prefer not to review at this time.  Am currently employed by this company.  And do not want to rate negatively or positively at this time.  Thanks for your concideration in this matter.
good,The management needs to be changed sometimes to get new ideas and better leadership. The place and personal was great for the company but they had some personal that were goodfriends and they move up in the company.
good,"After 18 years I was laid off, due to a merger with Hughes Aircraft."
good,"Typical defense contractor. large projects long schedules. nothing special.  good experience for the new developer, but i wouldn't make this my final stop."
good,"Management if more focused on social business rather than defense business.  Lots of lip service about training and growing employees, but it is not followed up with actual action."
good,"Rigid organizational structure with many layers of various types of managers.  Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual activities/tasks take place on schedule with little variation"
good,Very fun. Very boring Can be cut throat. Some people can be nice. Some people can be mean. 9/80 was a nice perk. This has been fun writing this review.
good,I new when I was there that it was a contract job but was trying to get hired on full time I enjoyed my time there and it was a good learning tool for me to see how companies work with goverment.
good,"This was an extremely fast-paced job.  Many things could and often did go wrong with equipment and/or operators.  Management was very involved. So much so that they were considered to be ""micro-managing"".  Stress level was high."
good,"Great company to work for in terms of learning an entire systems from prototype to an actual ground/flight test. Supported many different missile programs, both in avionics and naval. Enjoyed learning and working on challenging task in a Real-time Embedded HWIL system."
good,"a typical day at work: 8 hours"
good,"nice environment, productive place to work , good group of people, management was good, excellent learning experience, only a person with good work ethics can make it here"
good,Raytheon is a matrix of functional organizations that lack accountability to each other. Advancement is slower than most companies and their is a layer of political gamesmanship to be played on a daily basis. There are certain area's to work in that are better then other due to management styles. Days can be filled with meetings little time for producing work till after business hours. There is always more work to do that people to do it. You will find a mix of people that are awesome and helpful along with people you will want to keep your distance from.
good,"Overall it matters on what department you work for. It some departments, the stress was rather high for the amount of paid. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,"Vertically Integrated optic assembly facility, with a full machine shop, coating chambers, glass polishing and assembly departments located in the cottage capital of Simcoe county."
good,Industry is so competitive that family balance is almost always a casualty. Employee exhaustion is typical within my group and management creates a very stressful environment with untruthful deadlines.
good,"I enjoyed working at Raytheon however promises were made and then I was lied to about those promises, multiple times.  Management was good to me except for the misguidance in leadership."
good,"Call in and get service calls for the day."
good,"Union environment, but for the most part good people.  Found that most people wanted to coast through at the higher defense wages without rocking the boat."
good,"I worked with many teams to fulfill my job and deadlines. My last manager was horrible, he did not know how to run a troubleshooting team if his life depended on it."
good,"I was treated fairly and the management team was good."
good,Raytheon is a challenging work environment. They value diversity and work life balance. There is no typical day at my job. Every day there are new challenges .
good,"Pay was below national average for the position held."
good,"Working for Raytheon in general has been a great experience.  They are a large company with room for advancement.  In my current position, we have to travel frequently for a couple months at a time.  That is the part of the job that I don't like."
good,"Liked the cultural aspect of the company."
good,Pay was good but communications and working relationships between Corporate and Work sites was terrible. To much power struggles between different levels of management.
good,I was hired as a Senior level Supply chain manager but was utilized as a inexperience Acquisition professional and made going to work very uncomfortable.
good,"The people I work with are motivated, funny, and show great work ethic. Management tends to overwork these players and have in turn caused a lot of turn over."
good,A great place to begin a career but after you start making a pretty good wage they let you go. They do  not believe in career building. At least you get big company benefits.
good,"Not a company for people that expect change or workplace dynamics.  Many different programs moving in different directions, creating fragmented strategies."
good,"Manpower Staffing, is a good standard job shop. "
good,This company was a decent place to work because the day in and day out was consistent and organized. It was a bit boring however and lacked engaging tasks for me to feel a part of the work I was doing
good,Stable- job security- good benefits- ok pay- good location- nice people- interesting work- fun at times- daily duties get boring- not much room for growth- management is out of touch with employees
good,"Worked for a subsidiary."
good,"The company is very demanding and the culture is unfortunatly still stuck in the old way of ""it's who you know, not what you know"". This place is still on the buddy, buddy system."
good,"Enjoyed working as a staff specialist engineer, reporting directly to Manager. Focal point for composite material application and FEM / NASTRAN analysis to modify installation of Kevlar Radome on KC-135 aircraft with funds from OCALC."
good,Had only short a period of years at this company but so much to learn and learned additional some experience with each individual character and work place experience
good,"Had a 15 wonderful years good memories. job experience, work employee friends as my second home and family."
good,Learned more about Configuration Management and all that is required to keep a contractor in compliance with a Government contract. I enjoyed working with such a diverse group of people.
good,"encode security cards for several hundred employees. data entry,Microsoft word documents,track and report expenses for security department for vehicles etc."
good,I enjoy the company and my team that I work with. However I do not enjoy the job. There is no upward mobility and I do not enjoy sitting at a computer all day.
good,"NIL to report, wasn't a bad place to work- Got on well with both USG and AUSG. Staff friendly, atmosphere pretty good. Perks OK"
good,Good place to work.  Hard to get ahead without an advanced degree.  Enjoyed working there very much.  Great group of people.
good,"real management and leadership"
good,"This an engineering company that only values their employees with degrees. There are some great people that work at this company, however, is only for professional people. Regularly hourly workers aren't treated with respect as the salary workers."
good,"Depending on your functonal area, there's reasonable work/life balance. They do have challenges in regards to career progression. The company comes across like an old boys club where knowing someone is sometimes more important that the quality of work you do."
good,"the overall work relationship is good as a communications eng.  I work with soldiers on VHF, UHF, and GPS systems in Taiwan."
good,It was a nice place to work at the time I was there. I liked it. I had freedom to do my tasks how I saw fit. Even my supervisor was cool.
good,"The Co-Op experience was fantastic for learning the different sides of the business at Raytheon. I only had 2 years of experience at this company, but the overall culture/job was interesting and challenging."
good,Supplied inventory control in the printed wiring board department and expedited requirement planning from purchasing to production on a weekly basis.
good,"Performed the following:"
good,"Management can be extremely difficult and vindictive. Coworkers are awesome but those with higher titles or degrees will speak down to you, especially if  you are a woman."
good,"If you are given the nod, you may be involved with some fantastic projects. That is, if you are in the network from Hughes Aircraft."
good,Raytheon emphasizes a culture of inclusiveness and quality.  They're constantly working on cutting edge technology emphasizing mission assurance for the warfighter.
good,"Skilled, motivated. I am a multi-tasker and am easy to get along with."
good,"Contract job for 1 year, had worked in program 7 years prior with 2 contractors as full time employee."
good,"Have worked at Raytheon since the site privatized back in 1997. Raytheon is not a bad place to work overall - in the past 3+ years, since internal security realignment & business unit merger the change in the work climate is of the nature that has me seeking other opportunities."
good,"You take the good with the bad.  My part of Raytheon was a labor organization that thought they were a manufacturing organization so process got in the way.  If you are senior leadership, the benefits and pay are competitive but the hours are awful.  If you are a junior engineer, the technology, mission and process are very useful learning experience but the pay isn't good."
good,"Management, mine, was hard to get along with.  Didn't have a flexible bone in their body.  I had children and one day one of them got severely ill and she wouldn't allow me the time off, had to ask upper management to handle the situation."
good,"Great industry to be in.  Raytheon does it all. On land. On the sea, and up in space.   Opportunities here are endless. You will find much to do here and plenty of people to help along the way."
good,It was a good company to work for until they were taken over by Hughes Aircraft. Then we were sold off to a Saudi Contractor in and all of our benefits were slowly phased out.
good,My job entailed loading very sensitive equipment on trailers in accordance with government and Raytheon guidelines. I also posted equipment to our government bonded warehouse and worked with other departments to ensure equipment was properly prepared for transport.
good,"My job is composite technician. Everyday i lay up dry material fiberglass on the molds, and stacking up and bonding the polarizer sheet, honeycomyb into the parts i just lay up. After that i do vacuum bagging and check the leaking of the bag, when it was done , i move the the mold into the autoclave to cook."
good,"COmpany founded on great ideals, but the contract i worked under was a small scale contract that could have used more of the overal company's support to create a more efficient work environment"
good,I chose to pursue my graduate degree in business management. Philips was great and fun however Management made questionable decisions regarding the structure of my department. They've since returned to the structure in place prior to my resignation.
good,"Good Job/Life Balance but horrible job security, great benefits, good compensation, great work environment, average management and good company policies"
good,Company is pro employee and provided good experience and learning opportunities.  As an intern they gave me a good amount of responsibilities and trusted me with real work which is something not every organization does.
good,"I met several nice people while working at Raytheon. They had 4 Packaging Engineers in the Industrial Engineering department. The manager gave us duties which played to our strengths and everyone excelled in their jobs. I wanted to stay in the area, because I liked the small town of Bristol, TN. but like all aerospace companies it all depends on government contracts. Since I was the last hired, I was the first to be let go. Fortunately, that gave me the opportunity to be hired by Eastman Chemical Co., which was in Kingsport, TN."
good,This company was good!  They have lot of opportunity for you to grow and expand in!  Great for fresh out of college grads!!!
good,Nice company to work with as lots of training conducted & got a chance to go new caledonia & thailand. Learned differnet methods of traning delivery.
good,"Very busy workplace, I love working with my supervisor and other co-workers. The hours are long but the day goes by pretty fast."
good,"Its okay, there are pros and cons to every job you have. Its not a hard job at all. There is room for improvement. Great place to learn new things."
good,"My co-workers were great, but the management team was subpar. We worked long hours but never got paid overtime. Some team members would sleep on the job and not help with big projects if needed. Management never said anything."
good,"The typical day starts with pouring through emails and prioritizing tasks, which is typical of any job. This position completes bids and proposals, which deadlines are non-flexible and out of your control. "
good,"My overall experience was a learning one, as with all job opportunities. "
good,Developed a strong understanding of the Eastern Range systems and operational requirements.  Specifically specialized in Communication and Telemetry Systems.  Specific assignments include analysis of system performance during launch operations and project integration related to system redesign and upgrades.
good,"0630-1600 day job.  Would come in, get my assignment for the day and do the projects that were needed.  I have learned projects such as SPS-64, SATCOM, RAM, electrical troubleshooting down to component level, Security,Leadership, Security Skills, Various Troubleshooting of different Naval systems, Problem Solving, AC/DC Circuits, Schematics, Electrical Safety, Power Panels, Communication Systems, and Communication Security. Some of which I already knew coming out of the Navy, but Raytheon did help me hone these skills and actually use them more often."
good,"Several opportunities"
good,Not bad company to work for just too big.  Don't have anything bad to say the company was ok.
good,"Very demanding workload with long hours"
good,"Since I left Raytheon in 2002 I do not have any valid comments to make. Raytheon has a union so I had to adapt to not handling material directly. That is a fine line sometimes."
good,"Good days a work . "
good,Enjoyed coming to work. Hours were good. The people were friendly.
good,"Raytheon provides a fairly decent work life balance where it is easy to adjust your hours as needed. It is one of the wonderful perks, however overtime is expected when work needs to get done. Most everyone is friendly and helps maintain a positive work environment. Management is okay. Overall a pretty good place to work, however management could use some tweaking and would recommend making improvements to boost employee moral."
good,"Working for Raytheon Co is a fun experience with great benefits. This company has much to offer.  Management is... and a typical day at work is ... Union Stewards are ... Co workers are- well, a lot of them are 15 year + employees... "
good,"Raytheon is a solid company with a bright future.  Main products are government defense and aerospace systems .  Very interesting work and technology is far advanced as compared to other similar companies.  Core strength lies within their world-class people, innovation and technology.  Company is  currently in a cut back mode as it consolidated businesses from 6 to 4 business units.  Many organizational changes currently taking place as the company re-invents itself.  Benefits are very good and salaries are slightly above that of the commercial world."
good,Raytheon acquired Technology Associates and the transition was very difficult.
good,Government work so way to much paperwork and management to get anything done.  Okay pay and benefits.
good,"Company expectations were communicated although senior level support was communicated, more substance was"
good,"For me Raytheon was a great place to work at. Managers were good, coworkers were great and the environment was exceptional. The biggest complaint I have is that this place is not the place to be at if you're right out of college and trying to climb the ladder of experience. This part of Raytheon tends to pigeon hole people into very focused tasks. Because I came to Raytheon later in my career, was not interested in climbing any ladders and already had a huge background I saw Raytheon as somewhat of a ""coast"" job. I had to push vigorously to force management to keep me out of the pigeon hole and allow me to work on more ""out of the box"" projects. I was able to have a very enjoyable life at Raytheon, but only because I would speak up. "
good,Good company but job security could be better. I would rather work salary as opposed to hourly.
good,Raytheon is moving it's existing production and test division out of El Segundo. New government program contracts have been few and far between.  Benefits and salary were comparable to industry standards.
good,"The owner will hirer anyone. a lot of animal dies due to people not giving water, or the right meds to the right animal."
good,"Responsible for a team of 6 people, also the on call react team to repair and/or replace components on a prototype system."
good,"I spent my day testing and troubleshooting complex electro-optical system using various electronics test tools, schematics, engineering drawings, test procedures, and customer specifications. I also routinely used windows based desktop and laptop computers that utilized proprietary test software as well as the MS office suite. I used lotus notes, MS Word, MS powerpoint, MS excel, and access database. I used Visiprise manufacturing, SAP, and web based production interrupt reporting."
good,"Honed management, team-building, and troubleshooting skills at this job."
good,"Pro:  Good work life balance,  Interesting engineering challenges, Can't be outsourced"
good,"Worked under contracts, large temporary employee numbers, do to work by contract."
good,"Raytheon is generally a good company to work for.  The people are the best part.  They are honest, customer focused, and possess a wide variety of skills and abilities.  There have been quite a few changes and reorganizations over the past year or so that have left many people feeling uneasy about the company's overall direction."
good,"Raytheon is a Top heavy organization that has a tendency to expect total dedication while providing none to 77,000 employees world wide. At one point I was assisting late contracts in Mass. mfg. plants and my bosses failed to give me a review or pay raise while serving out of state. While supplying services out of pocket with extensive hours to ensure profitability was never appreciated. I guess I should feel lucky I had a job upon completion of out of state assignments. After 14 years of service, I was laid off while establishing a new contract and product line. While we were ready for production ahead of schedule, the engineers were laid off and the company ended up defaulting on the contract. It was apparent that Raytheon corporate decisions have little to do with reality or profitability which disappointed me. Fortunately, I was a legacy employee from E-Systems and had earned a retirement that Raytheon was court ordered to pay some 10 years before releasing the engineers."
good,Management is weak in most cases and a poor decisions are made frequently.  People are not a high priority when it comes to advancement or layoff decisions so job security is always a concern.  Co-workers are usually very professional and good people but many share the opinion that they want to finish their career and get out.  Pay and benefits are competitive with just about any other company I've seen so this keeps a lot of employees from leaving the company becasue they recognize this value.
good,Very flexible work schedule and good group of people in general to work with on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing production schedule and preparing daily/weekly reports to Senior Management. "
good,"Raytheon is great for diversity and has good core values. The problem is the company is very old fashioned in a number of ways. Promotions and merit increases are based on meeting certain criteria versus your actual work product. People are promoted based on years of experience instead of the quality of work. I was assigned to do tasks that someone a level above me was deemed unsuited to complete. Even though I was tasked with work above my pay grade, I was not eligible for a promoted due to my years of service being below the average for the next promotion.  While the managers go above and beyond to show appreciation for hard work, it is rarly a financial appreciation. "
good,Co-workers in lab were great.  Started to learn a lot and then it was halted due to union growth issues.
good,Newly implemented procedures and workforce are common.  Employees work hard when hard work is needed.  The current manager give positive guidance is firm and determined to keep the facility compliant with FAA requirements.
good,"Worked with 4 to 7 people on shift, worked nights. Did tours, patrols, gate duty, responded to calls. Loved the people I worked with."
good,"If you're looking for a repetitive, low stress 9-5 job that is relatively stable, Raytheon is a good company to work for.  Slow paced work environment with excess around ever corner. The responsibilities at most positions are marginalized by management so you will be performing repetitive tasks.  Rigid hierarchy with extreme intransigence displayed at higher levels of management.  The benefits are good, including a generous work/life balance."
good,The company is too large to appreciate valuable contributors
good,"Good Company but Layed Off"
good,You had to make work for yourself. Learned to manage projects worked well with others. Managing change orders the people.
good,Adequate working condition; not much learning opportunity with regards to latest technologies.
good,"Support engineers with technical writing of legal and security documents. Facilitate and conduct board meetings for each supporting program.  Perform audits on controls for configuration management processes. Perform data management support for each program, provide software configuration support."
good,This place is a real diverse company but very pleasant environment to work in. My experience was great although was laid off to soon to know anything about benefits.
good,i liked working there because i got to work with the military
good,"Hard work, but pays off with experience. Communication is Key and learn new things each day."
good,Get to work on interesting projects and have the opportunity to take on more responsibility or move around to other divisions.
good,"A typical day at work involved ""soft"" and ""hard"" skills.  The ""hard"" skills were those used for analysis of problems.  The ""soft"" skills were essential for resolution."
good,Raytheon is a decent company with good Training available.
good,"Currently employed, great health benefits & opportunity for growth."
good,I only worked within one area of the company for a short period of a time as a manufacturing intern. The company was a good place to work at - great benefits but very large.
good,"I work there, and now I'm looking for another job. I'm not really sure why they are asking me to write a review of the company for which I work when I work at a customer site and have almost zero daily interaction with the company."
good,"There isn't much growth for the contract division for which I work. Trying to transition over into Corporate seems impossible but I keep trying. It seems as if contract is not recognized as a Raytheon employee (even benefits, retirement, and vacation is different) which I think makes us seem like the ""step-children""of Raytheon."
good,"In the area I work there are very nice people to work with, they are dedicated people with excellent work ethics."
good,The drive from Andover to Waltham (Rt 93 & 128) was very stressful.
good,"This company was very cooperative to my industry learning, however turned out to be very disloyal in the end"
good,Job can be quiet boring at times. Not enough challenge. Hard to advance.
good,This is a okay place to work. Don't remember much about working here except liked to hire a lot of ex military.
good,Great place to begin a career but advancement opportunities tend to be bureaucratic rather than merit based.
good,There is alot of bureaucracy. Processes are slow. The pay and benefits are average. There is not alot of room for advancement.
good,Ok place to work. Don't expect processes to change in a timely manner. Don't expect your ideas to be accepted. But beyond that the people are nice.
good,"Raytheon is a great company for experienced professionals, and the compensation/benefits are great. Not a great place to thrive as a young professional under 35."
good,Overall a good company but could not always do what was required without approval from head office in the USA resulting in loss business.
good,"expectations for performance are high, accountability to standards are only apparent when reviews are imminent"
good,"Good Place to start a career. Lots of fascinating work, and enjoy working on military technology."
good,"Good place to begin a career, but, the good old boys club won't allow you to get very far."
good,An excellent company to work for with excellent benefits. Multiple locations in different states and competitive salaries and benefits.
good,Job descriptions very narrow.
good,Work environment extremely fast-paced; personnel highly proactive.
good,"Raytheon (Now Hawker Beechcraft) is your typical large company. All employees have very specialized routines, there are good benefits, most employees are small fish in a large lake."
good,My time at Raytheon was educational. The company is focused on helping employees with continuous learning. With this said they provide a very attractive tuition reimbursment program.
good,"Decent company for a medium size city. Good training for new hires, and the youngest manger in Aerospace history. My ex manger was still undergoing puberty."
good,"If you are looking for a stable job for a long time, this is the right place but advancement is very tough. It is a good place to start and work for a few years before making a career change in different field."
good,"I have been working at Raytheon for over 2 years since I graduated from college. Raytheon has good benefits but struggles to engage its employees. Raytheon does provide training, but only when it is too little too late. You will start a project and by the time you need the training, you have already taught yourself how to do it. The best way to get a promotion is to leave and go to another company. "
good,"Raytheon is a good company to work for. They are focused on Defense, they try to innovate and have some good projects. However, they are still learning how to be a Software Company. Management although hardworking and they ""care"" can definitely come across as Dilbertesque. Management doesn't seem ""to get"" Software, however they do have a good understanding of the importance of their work. They seem to value Systems Engineers, and this old school form of Engineering."
good,May have just been my team but my team is extremely slow even though we work in an Agile environment. I often see people off task. Although it was great that my manager eventually took matter on his own hands. I think what turns me off about the company the most is that I wasn't challenged enough
good,"It has been okay for me. "
good,"Raytheon is OK to start working here but Medical Benefits are poor to the worst in the Industry and over time many new hire leave after 2 years, but they are the ones the company wants to keep and they tend to get the best raises and promotions."
good,"Got a non-exempt job here out of college. The union was stifling, basically once you're part of it you can kiss any opportunities outside the union goodbye. They pay alright and the benefits were excellent. I know the exempt positions here are excellent but if your an ambitious graduate looking for a foot in the door avoid ALL non-exempt opportunities at Raytheon."
good,They are not a company that helps retired military. Work was ok you are good when they need you. Long term employment is based on years of employment not on experience and skill level..
good,"I spent most of my days filling out paperwork. "
good,"Good work/life balance. Treated me fairly. Tend to not like workers coming in at odd hours (too early or too late at night) even though I was always on-time for work (never tardy/late). High stress positions."
good,"Some interesting work but this location does not emphasize my specialty. Despite a hug attrition rate and several spot awards, annual review was average and raise was well below inflation. I’ve heard many co-workers who have been here for 10+ years complain that they haven’t been promoted."
good,Work loads needs to coordinated by one person and not several managers. Needs cooperation between managers from design and manufacturing centers. Locations need to improve coordination on tasks.
good,"Worked there two years, enjoyed my work and the people I worked with.  Learned a lot and it was close to my home which made my commute really good.  Would put in a lot of hours and needed attention to all the jobs, had to see that all material was inspected to the fullest."
good,"8-12 hour days for Engineers, Scientists"
good,Direct supervisors were very poor. They were concerned more with their advancement & next job instead of taking care of employees. Supervisors used employees to advance their career.
good,"Like most defense related companies it is very project driven. Though they try to support alternative work arrangements, it is very dependent on the individual manager's style. Raytheon is divided up to very separate groups and it can be difficult to understand opportunities in other parts of the organization. Though they do use internal social media... it is still a very divided organization."
good,I interned for the company's BBN division when they were trying to integrate the culture after their aquisition a few years prior. This was after I'd interned for them the previous year and theculture was enitirely different. Peopl were leaving because they couldn't be sure of their jobs staying around while Raytheon cut staff.
good,"It is a good place to work especially for career development; very collaborative and supportive. Good benefits, jobs security and cultured environment."
good,This was a challenging job in Antarctica. Lots to learn and see. Living with people you work with for 6 months can be the biggest challenge. If you want to see the bottom of the word this is for you.
good,"Loved job, work environment and associates but very hard to move from temporary to permanent. Lots of politics in this area, worked 6 years as a contractor, did a good job received pay increases and manager would not fight for permanent position."
good,"The Raytheon company is a good organization to work for, at this time I have nothing but praise for the company.  My only concern at this time is location."
good,"Raytheon is a good place to work straight out of university due to the support you receiving including training (classes for ProE, GDT, Radar, 6Sigma) and mentorship programs as well as a technical rotation program. I enjoyed working with the people there and the work pace was not too fast. Rarely did I work much overtime but that may vary with department and depending on your manager. I was not too keen on the actual designing of weaponry."
good,Raytheon is a very nice place to work accept it was very far to commute but once there it was work and non stop at times. I worked very closely with the Government Intelligence Agencies.
good,"The office structure was very lax due to the management offices being in another state.  Most of the coordination of effort was difficult."
good,good work life balance
good,"Was able to assist with writing and establishing the complete process and procedures for the Quality Assurance and Control of the entire network"
good,"I came in to Raytheon to replace a retiring gentleman of 40 years. Many of the employees at Tewksbury were 'lifers' and retiring all about the same time. Many of the servers were out of date, including a Unisys Laredo that had not been changed since the late 60s."
good,It's a  contract job and  the local management determines the work environment. Cronyism and favoritism is rampant at my location.  If you are outside the clique then don't make any mistakes and you'll never get a chance to advance to another higher paying position.
good,"Very few options for advancement unless you are an engineer. As an executive assistant, room to grow or move within the company are scarce. Pay for non-exempt employees is rather low."
good,"Much more concerned with the bottom line than their employees. Still sort of a ""good old boys"" network. Because it is such a large company, there is a lot of variability. Some areas are good to work for, others are not."
good,There wasn't a typical day at work for me during my time with IIS.  Each week brought a new challenge that me or my team had to deal with.  Whether it was pressure from management or our customer we had to think creatively to address the issue of the day.
good,"Working at DoD site, never seeing the rest of Raytheon it is hard to review. My feeling is that Raytheon having a manufacturers mentality and it's owned huge bureaucracy never understood the IT service group that I worked for adding extra bureaucratic delay in a mission already bogged down by the government customers bureaucratic delays, thus adding more time to an already busy day. Other than that Raytheon compensation and benefits were very good; comparable to all the other large-scale defense contractors."
good,"Nothing to add.  Raytheon is a good company to work for, but RSC/ILS is not such a good company.  My time in Taiwan as  a Raytheon employee was a good time to be employed with ILS."
good,The division of Raytheon (CSR) that I worked for no longer exists. If was a decent place to work. Good benefits when I first started there and great location.
good,"Typical Aerospace and Defense environment.  Very process oriented.  Slower paced projects. "
good,"Raytheon was a great experience and has excellent benefits.  However there was a huge age gap and the culture leaves a lot to be desired. My female coworkers had a much harder time with the culture than I did because of the existing demographic and slowness to adapt."
good,A secure job but wage after 11 years service isn't that much above minimum wage!  Management is poor and not interested in listening to operators.
good,"Typical 8 hour job. "
good,"Routine/repetition in daily tasks most of the time. Was given the opportunity to be cross trained in a publications department. My former immediate manager valued employee opinions whereas current management doesn't appear to care. Mixed, some were back stabbers to benefit themselves. The hardest part of the job was trying to work past the negatives."
good,I was laid off after many years of excellent performance and great reviews. It leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The company is trying very hard to become younger and lower paying.
good,This is a good place to be an engineer and focus on the technical aspects of your career without too much overhead from the management side of things.
good,"Compared to other companies in the same industry they seem to be best around.  Benefits are good, but wouldn't say they are the best compared to other IT companies.  Advancing in cyber technologies and opening opportunities in that area."
good,"It is a great place to earn your money because of co-workers. There isn't much room for advancement; it's usually based on someones retirement. The money and benefits tend to keep people there.  There is a great divide between the hourly-union employees and salaried employees. "
good,"Very good company to get good work experience."
good,"Flexible schedule is great; however, lots of complaints on size of the company/management styles. Still set in old military organization. Lots of process that hinders progress. "
good,"I was the new girl in the office. I had a hard time fitting in with the others who had been there for years.  I wasn't there for very long before I moved to San Antonio."
good,The best part of Raytheon is that the company does take care of the employees. The bad thing about Raytheon is that career progression is slow.
good,"Large defense company with cutting edge technology and commitment to the warfighter"
good,"A great company to work for, though little upward mobility.  Management really cares to receive feedback from all employees which is awesome.  Job Work/Life Balance is similar to other corporations foor which I have worked.  Overall a good experience."
good,"Good work/life balance, needs to improve the finance job culture in Texas."
good,Typical defense contractor. Work can be interesting if you are on the right program.
good,Raytheon is a large corporation that has thousands of employees scattered across the US and some foreign countries. They claim to be one company but fail to communicate from one division to another even when they are located in same building. Communications with employees is lacking.
good,"As a manufacturing engineer, my day to day tasks were more about putting out fires versus working on engineering projects."
good,The job was great the employees were great to work with but it seems the lack of communication through the supervisors is what made the job difficult at times.
good,"We worked daily on an aircraft modification that would last 30 to 45 days."
good,"Plenty of exciting product lines to work on, and there is a great focus on diversity. Being government affiliated, processes can move painfully slow. Executive management is very out of touch with what goes on in the plant. Job security is suspect after recent layoffs and the DoD's decision to cut back on defense spending."
good,typical days was 8 hours and it was easy enough to forget it at the gate.
good,Overall company good place to work for.  Work/life balance is very good but dependency on government contracts makes the place very unstable for employment.  There is too much time spent going to meetings and reporting metrics that no one reads instead of focusing on the job and getting things accomplished.  Management is also out of touch with what it takes to get the job done and what their employees do.  Work loads are often unbalanced with some people having more work that they can handle while others sit around on youtube all day or surfing the internet.  Very little room for advancement and with current government cutbacks likely hood of being laid off very high
good,"I liked the people and liked the location, but periodically having your job at risk gets old."
good,This company tries hard but still comes up short. Nice people and a nice place to work. But this company continues to place one foot in the past and the other just short of the future.
good,"Great time when working in the fleet department.Love working with the publc"
good,This was a good experience with new challenges.  The position lasted longer than original length in term.
good,"Work is pretty stress free. Coming into my first job from being an undergraduate I have learned so much in terms of life skills and career skills. My co-workers are all relatively my age, early to late 20s. We are the ones being groomed to move around the businesses. There are some people just lingering around to retire though. Management in my department was quite weak. To many erroneous layers with micromanagement. I have 5 people above me that all sit on the same floor. The hardest part of my job is balancing when to try and bring in a new procedure, verses when to listen to those who have been around the block. Sometimes a lot of what I do seems redundant or out of date. Often the process just has not been updated. Other times though I get a lot of back lash for trying to change something that senior members don't want to change. I do enjoy the flexible work schedule"
good,This company provides a very flexible working environment. Co-workers are nice and friendly.
good,"For the most part, Raytheon is a good company to work for. The benefits are excellent including the amount of PTO you are given. The people are fun and great to work. The hardest part is trying to solve problems that come up that could have been prevented. Sometimes management does not always listen to suggestions or concerns and that leads to frequent overtime to resolve the problems. The hardest part is working the late nights and sometimes weekends to meet deadlines. The most enjoyable part is working with some great people."
good,"Busy, full of meetings, technical challenges weekly. Management team is very friendly and helpfull, but upper management is distant and out of touch."
good,I enjoyed working at Raytheon for the most part but the work was not that challenging.
good,Work begins at 0700 and ends somtime around 5:00-5:30. The production lines are set up and running and the meetings begin around 0900 and last until lunch. Any problems encountered have to go through multiple layers of groups or teams to resolve. A change to shorten a threaded fastner took three weeks to resolve.
good,"Can be a fun place to work depending on the program you are placed on. Not much compensation when you exceed or far exceed your peers. Lots of good people to work with. Off Fridays are nice to have. High performers are often put in a position to take on more responsibility with not much more compensation. Benefits are good. Starting pay can be good, but raises are peanut buttered across departments. Recognition can be hard to get in such a big company."
good,"Many good employees, management is so-so. Retirement gets your social security subtracted so you loose 25-30%. Also, after twenty you only get 1.3%."
good,"Great employer with many opportunities for young, qualified people."
good,Great On-line training programs for all job skill requirements. Good annual performance review process. Good mentoring program.
good,Work environment not very friendly. Management not involved in the security development or helpful in goals. Lack training opportunities for older employees.
good,"The Good:"
good,"For me personally I took this job mostly because I have worked in defense previously, enjoy testing as an Engineer and its close to home. However there are some big drawbacks I feel like over time could be fixed if management and others would do something about it at the location at work. I generally enjoy the work I do for the most part."
good,"Raytheon during this time period seemed to be underpaying employees because jobs were difficult to find.  Made around half of my usual salary. Work environment was pleasant enough, but it had to be to retain employees at this salary rate.  Economy is better today, maybe salaries have increased."
good,Its a very great place to work if you need good work life balance. Flexible work schedules along with great benefits and reasonable hours. Though it is the defense industry and thus there are a lot of barriers in place that prevent you from working with a lot of the more modern software frameworks and practices. Management is also all very old and often get in the way of progress and at times can micromanage programs.
good,Good place to work but need to get away from the military mindset and operate more as a business. Managers are understanding and provide a flexible work environment.
good,Raytheon has its own set of FPGA development tools that I have not seen anywhere else. Raytheon huntsville uses a development system called CLUE and simulation system called CoCoTB based on python instead of using UVM and sytem Verilog.
good,I really enjoyed working for Raytheon as a training manager in Saudi Arabia. Dealing with a foreign customer was challenging but also very rewarding. Also working with a team of professional was great.
good,"No problems with working for Raytheon, but working at the Aurora, CO campus has it's own set of challenges. Only have experience on one program, but I told others aren't much different, other than being smaller. Expectation is that you're there to get the job done, which I'm perfectly fine with, but a lot of the issues with management, schedule, etc make that more difficult than it should be. Trick is to find your spot and get what you need to get done and move on. Longer term engagements usually don't end well."
good,"It was a great place to work, Leaned a lot was a great learning experience. A place that I met a lot of new people that became like family. Work long hours."
good,It was a great company to work for if you wanted to get the corporate field but they pay the lowest and that's a sad thing.  Not much else to say about the company.  I had a great boss but even he left because of such small pay.
good,At the end of my contract I feel working there was a great experience. It was a very easy move from working as I was in the Military to there since I was working with the Military.
good,"My role was the support of the VMware environment, providing patching, upgrades and provisioning of VM's for current and future projects. "
good,Good company to work for but conditions improved even more once L-3 bought them out.  More “people type persons” in charge and moral improved greatly when L-3 took over.
good,Culture never felt like a team environment. Cliques abound and leadership seemed to be disconnected from truth surrounding office dynamics. Personnel Managers never seemed to be connected with staff that they were responsible for and I worked on three different projects.
good,"I worked for this employer for 10 1/2 years and worked both as Program Manager and Test Engineer, This company uses Matrixed Management, i.e., Manpower Manager is unconnected to me and only handles reviews, discipline, and merit increases."
good,"I worked in the semiconductor sector for many years.  When I worked at raytheon, the culture was extremely different and I was put on meaningless tasks or just closing bug tickets that were 10 years old."
good,"Very business/profit driven entity that is loosing focus (in spite of the what the posters and missions say) on technical."
good,Fast paced environment with an opportunity to grow in the technical sectors of the company. There are opportunities if well versed in the engineering sciences .
good,"Decent pay for role I was in, enjoyed my colleagues, management was ok.  Best part was the people I worked with and we were not micromanaged.  Nice work/life balance."
good,"Raytheon is a good employer with great benefits and fair compensation. The job is very stable with the company projected to grow steadily in the future. The culture has a classic corporate structure and fee with little sign of changing in the near future. The office is quiet and is focused on performing work."
good,"Good place to work.A lot of opportunities to learn and move around"
good,"During my employment at Raytheon, the pace was very slow and the assignments were very repetitive. It did not seem as though there was much room for growth in the company which made it difficult to picture a future in this role."
good,"Raytheon claims to be agile for their devops env but the reality is more a waterfall hybrid with agile tools that leave the job a poorly managed chaotic mess. Tools like Clear Case and (old af) Swing are used which I feel like I'll never use again and leave me with very little skills to move forward with. "
good,"I liked working there, stuff in our lives happen that our out of our control! Otherwise, I would be still working there!! They need to take a better look at how some people can really waste a lot of time during the day and nobody would notice!"
good,Great benefits and decent work/life balance at this company.  They have 9/80 schedules which allow you to take off every other Friday.  Advancement opportunities are available.
good,"I am honored to have been an intern at Raytheon. It's a good company. Don't get me wrong, but I was bored there and didn't really learn anything new. Internships are about learning and being hands on.  I didn't really get the experience I wanted."
good,"Raytheon is a great company for college grads to gain exposure to the IT world. Management is not the greatest and tend to forget about employees. This depends on the contract you are assigned to. The more important the contract, the better the treatment."
good,"First, Second and third shifts available"
good,"It's a huge company so people can have a very diverse set of experiences depending on where they end up. I know people who did nothing there, and I know people who worked their butts off."
good,Raytheon was a great company to work for.  Work was challenging and the environment was fun.  The people were nice and helpful and the management had an open door policy.
good,Raytheon Co. was very structured. Management styles were micro-mangers. Inter company advancements were hard. But overall the company provided steady income and drove new changes for the health of the company and revenue.
good,Liked working for Raytheon great first shift hours good pay got along with all workers lots of opportunities for better jobs
good,No room for advancement unless someone retires. Promotions require a security clearances and RTN does not assist employees in getting one or retaining
good,Good place to work. Good benefits and lots of work. Working on state of the art equipment and lots of different programs.
good,Raytheon is a good place to work if you are at the start or end of your career.  There is not much there for people in the middle of their career.
good,Could and should be a better place to work in. I would have expected a place that had better ethics and a better working environment.
good,Hard enviroment for tech stuff to work correctly.  I am learning a lot.  Great co-workers. The hardes part is getting things to work correctly.
good,"A variety of work was occasionally available, although there were times when schedules dictated.  Management was generally good, although there were instances of promotion/demotion without adequate justification or consideration of circumstances.  My co-workers were generally honest, hard-working, helpful, and friendly.  Raytheon generally provided excellent technical solutions, but failed to foster esprit de corps as a company.  Salaries were a bit low.  Raytheon suffered periods of inability to match the job load with the available bodies; this resulted in undue emotional trauma in hire/layoff cycles.  Professional development was an individual responsibility, and some avenues of company-sponsored professional development were restricted."
good,"Good over all company to work for, good health package and dental plan.Had a good career. Great co workers. Over staffed in management. Need to have a better career path for people that want to move up."
good,Strong engineering company for engineers not for common working people. Very relaxed place of work not stress everybody works together as a team.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you want a stable life/job. Work life balance is excellence. However, if you a passionated person who always to accomplish more on your job, look elsewhere. Endless meetings and layer and layer of mangers."
good,"This job was the same thing everyday. Not a challenge at all. I processed travel vouchers for payment. I also processed supply requests into a commercial system to order anywhere from computers systems for training facilities to wiring the facilities. Developed, maintained the equipment catalog."
good,Lay-offs are very prevalent; population declining rapidly
good,"Finance organization is broken up into program controls, accounting, financial planning & analysis, rate structures and pricing."
good,"Nothing against Raytheon, I was the 3rd generation to work for them and enjoyed what I did. I would work 8.5-9.5 hours per day depending on volume/needs of chemicals. I was the only warehouse worker for HAZMAT, my supervisor/lead would always come to me with ""favors"" which would be shipping things he was asked to ship on top of all of my other duties and shipments I had. I was scheduled to work until 3:30 and most of the time, I would be asked to get shipments out around 2-3 o'clock. I've said many times that I do NOT want to be rushed to get your material out, and it's never changed. My hours were changed several different times to accomodate the company, and with trust in the company I wanted to do whatever it took to help the facility out. Everyday I'd see other employees abusing their computers and on facebook, shopping or looking at things on google, while I'm rushing and working trying to get my shipments on time for the pick-up time. My supervisor had asked me about getting some help for me and naturally I agreed to relieve some stress. I saw a opening position at Raytheon working directly under my Superviser and I talked to him about the position. He said to give it a month and see what happens. 2 weeks later he said that I should apply for the position with that being my #1 priority for that day. Weeks kept going, while I ship out hundreds of chemicals out and wondering why I haven't been replied back to about my application. I was scheduled an interview with the MCP Manager and he said flat out I cannot get this position because of my attendance. I feel this was a"
good,over all a good place to work at but there are down sides to the company like lack of training and everyone has different opinion on  training new people and pay sucks for hard work that is being done. 
good,My time there was great. Due to the nature of our work there wasn't much upward mobility but the atmosphere was comfortable.
good,I was enjoy to jump on the next level.
good,Not a bad place to launch your career. You will have to look out for yourself since no one else is going to.
good,Raytheon provides training for nearly every job skill on-line. Great mentoring program. Annual performance review is based on meeting agreed upon objectives throughout the course of the year with quarterly updates to the plan.
good,"Working at Raytheon was an experience, you are surrounded by a diversity of people. They are not so friendly though, some people are just about work and have tunnel vision. Overall the company is great."
good,Raytheon is a good place to work. There are plenty of opportunities to learn and have more responsibilities as long as you don't expect to get pay compensated for the work.The hardest part in working there is keeping a full team. When we loose someone from the team we tent not to replace them for a long time or not at all.
good,"Past experience has shown me that if you focus on the customer, you will make a profit.  Raytheon's mission statement puts profit first.  I don't agree with these priorities"
good,I telecommute and I found this work arrangement beneficial for myself as well as with the company as it allowed me to work without much interruptions and am able to be very productive. I enjoyed working with our people who I sincerely believe are very professional and knowledgeable.
good,"The company is great, until you want to advance.  There is mentorship, but it is difficult when you are a SME.  The company wants to keep you in the area of expertise instead of developing in another area of expertise.  "
good,"At this time when Raytheon had the contract, I was responding to trouble calls from our help-desk and performing a lot of new equipment installations in the buildings. This required some weekend work. I was also becoming more involved in equipment configuration as the senior engineer was granting our group more responsibility in configuring closet switches and routers we were implementing in the various buildings on center."
good,Excellent opportunities for development and career growth.  Many opportunities for Program Managers. The company has many operations across the country and is currently building its international presence.
good,Good work life balance and good benefits but old school mentality with a lot of politics. Hard to move up the ranks and small annual raises make for lower salaries than competitors.
good,The hardest part of the job was having to stay late to finish up budgeting for the next year to 5 years. It was very tedious and management wanted to make sure that we did our job and why we budgeted the way we did it.
good,"a typical day a work will consist on productivity, quality, and focusing on the rework of our product to be able to work anytime for our customers. what I have learn at work is the ability to work in a fast peace place with many types of products and tools making my job performances very productive. our management try to accommodate us the best he can that way we can have manage and accomplish our goal on time. our culture would let each one of us learn many thing from each other because we all came from different country and it is a good thing to be able to help a coworker also. the hardest part of the job would be to accommodate all our customers and the most enjoyable part of my job is the benefit that the company offer their employees."
good,"Good place to work, with solid benefits and decent pay.  Company  culture needs to improve with regard to building leaders.  Not a lot of experienced leaders with regard to building and developing people."
good,Good experienced workforce and at times challenging organization. Good program management organization but can be slow to get things done. Work is mostly legacy platforms with minimal change in most areas.
good,Work/Life balance is exceptional with a variety of schedule options such as telecommuting and 9/80 schedules. Pay is average but PTO options lack. Direct management is good. The workflow process could be much more streamlined and efficient.
good,"fun place to work, management supportive of individual strengths and weaknesses, progressively squeezed to do more with less till there was nothing left"
good,It's OK. Working for the government is not all that great. It's very difficult dealing with contracts. Pay raises are not all that great either.
good,"Very demanding job: performed site characterization of test media for the underground detonation of nuclear weapons (Nevada Test Site).  Management was absolutely top-notch, and the same was expected of the rest of us.  I was a Geologist, and I was responsible for all of the geologic, geophysical, and seismic investigations at a single tunnel.  We performed daily mapping of the tunnel workings, periodic geophysical and seismic investigations, and provided drilling support both on the surface and underground.  This was by far my favorite job of my career."
good,Solid defense contractor with a good history.  They do keep adding on additional tools and requirements to the Finance group making it nearly impossible to feel successful.  The sales metrics are constantly moving.  It is a good company for young college grads to get a solid footing before moving on and becoming the new CFO's.  For the rest of us it is a good place to put your head down and work.
good,"Organized professional with extensive experience as an Electronic Engineering Technician. Highly innovative, self-motivated individual with exceptional organizational, workflow analysis, and problem solving skills. Recognized for ability to communicate across all organizational lines and exceed goals"
good,"Sub par advancement and job security, but good managemenet and communication"
good,"I was a manufacturing engineer working on the Hawker 1000 corporate jet. 8+ hours daily. Co-worker were very knowledgeable and experienced. Management wasn't to bad, although, at times they were hard to locate."
good,"Very good at making you feel like a person. They spend considerable effort on special interest groups, giving them many special opportunities not available to the masses to help them succeed. Management attitude is a little outdated, e.g., every boss I had acted as if they owned me and I was not allowed to find other opportunities in the organization that they did not find for me. They have a nice flex time system, but then point out that if you leave work early it could raise suspicion."
good,"The typical week involves making new schedules, updating existing schedules, and labor review. The workers at both Raytheon and the NSF were all outstanding."
good,"The company looks great on paper.  However in reality I was subject to routine (though veiled or indirct) terroristic death threats while at work.  I would describe it as a toxic, hostile, overly competitive work environment.  With lots of ex military people transitioning into civilian life and doing AGILE scrum, it ended up with people often acting like jerks.  They also did not encourage collaboration so much as competition.  You had access to some tools while awaiting access, but the process was horribly mismanaged.  They handled the sponsorship extremely incorrectly according to my federal investigator.  They would threaten and drop obscure hints about how to behave while awaiting and obtaining clearance, whereas anyone could simply look up online to find information about it.  "
good,It was a relaxed environment but the program we were a part of was was a train wreck.  They were always looking for ways to retain employees.  I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"* typical day is anything but... somedays I write code for 8 hours, other days I'd be in a lab conducting tests, sometimes I spend all day in meetings, others working on business proposals, some days you'll be doing mandatory training all day, it really is constantly varying which is fun."
good,"Slow paced environment, stuck in cube all day, not many young people. I sit in my cube all day working on projects in a small team of 4 people. Not good for someone looking for a young, fresh, fast paced environment"
good,"Typical defense contractor. Get the 9x80 schedule which is nice for a good work/life balance. Nothing particularly attractive to retain talent. Big time locations are not in particularly ""happening"" cities (Tucson, Huntsville, Andover...). Very conservative coworkers, but the company is executively progressive. Eye opening in terms of how much money is funneled into DoD and just how ""efficiently"" it is used. Everyone is required to become a ""Raytheon 6sigma Specialist,"" but the company still is not very good with efficient work because they are hung up on processes. A great number of employees are baby boomers waiting to cash out pensions and retirement. There is a sense of complacency at times. You won't feel like a true ""salaried"" employee as you're always charging hours to charge numbers accurate to 15 minutes."
good,"great benefits, excellent pay but management made a lot of  changes from supervisors to employees as far as lack of training, and letting contractors with no experience perform the work in the boards, that was a bad mistake!"
good,I really enjoy working at Raytheon. Its a great place to grow only if your job doesn't depend on money from contracts.
good,"The company is getting leaner, but there's still a lot of redundancy (like any big corporation). I learned how to work with different personalities and a diverse age group. Management is mostly late 40's to 50's. There are some bright people in the company. So even it's chaotic, the company actually functions. Very risk averse, none the less. I gained leadership through this matrix environment, because you definitely need to lead with influence. "
good,No room for growth if you don't have longevity within the company.
good,Got to be a part of a wonderful team environment. Very demanding job but I enjoyed the challenges.
good,Great Place to work.  Benefits are excellent.  Projects are challenging but rewarding.  Typical day is collaboration with team members and other disciplines on various project duties.
good,Raytheon Technical Services is where I worked. It was contract work in a very remote location. 12 hours a day 7 days a week for three months then a month off. Pay and benefits good. They care for their employees and are very professional.
good,"For this being my first job after leaving the military, the benefits package was awesome. Great team to work with. Just didn't see myself advancing in this company at the time."
good,"Raytheon was a good company to work with, but it could have benefited from being more organised specially to function as a lead systems integrator."
good,work/life balance is superb however pay may be on the lower end.
good,"I have been  working for Raytheon for 15 years. Since I have started they removed the pension, start new employees at 2 weeks PTO, 3% company stock match and removed the annual performance sharing program which amounts to about a 2-3% bonus annually. The cost of living raises are paltry about 0.5-2% annually. No more holiday parties off site for the Aurora location. Used to have parties at Invesco Field, Denver Museum, and Hyatt downtown... Now it's just in a conference room."
good,"An over all great experience working for Hughes/Raytheon during my employment.  Good working environment and annual training.  Work a typical day from 7:00 am  to 3:30 pm, Mon thru Fri. Sometimes worked OT till 4:30 pm or on weekends."
good,"For eight years I never had a review that was not good or better but there was no way to get a promotion or a raise other than your basic annual bump. The politics of the working group, we were subs on a multi-company contract, did not allow for cross training for other positions. If you do not mind having your job pulled out from under you by managers who think that they can overthrow the Prime on your contract, then this is the company for you. Have a great day."
good,"Raytheon Missile Systems produces military hardware so the culture must be different from most companies.  Security is the most important thing to safeguard thus there is tight control on process and personnel.  It ahs to be that way"
good,"I was a contractor for Raytheon, however, they did treat me well. Pay was decent, it was a quiet place to work. Being a contractor I was not privy to workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was keeping coordinated with the other full time employees I worked with on the team I was assigned to. The part I enjoyed the most was being able to show up to work, pop my headphones on and go to work. Downside to being a contractor is being asked to work a lot of overtime to make up for deadlines not being met or work getting backed up. However, being a contractor also excluded me from having to work weekends if I did not want to."
good,"Raytheon is great for a beginner 3 year work experience.  Raytheon is primarily an engineering and factory working environment.  Depending on what department you work in, you can move and advance your career.  It is difficult to move from one area of expertise to another.  I enjoy working with many people and supporting the security role within Raytheon.  I am at the highest level that I can go within the security field at Raytheon.  I have been with the company for 11 years and have had only one promotion."
good,"Lots of politics"
good,"Good place to work for a contract job, with the contract side there is no PTO, vacation or otherwise. But overall general pleasant company to work for."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for, great benefits and some opportunity.  Job was very fullfilling and was looking to retire from the company.  Would like to work there again."
good,"A very stiff working environment, well structured, but with zero interaction with co-workers. Deadlines are tight with little grey or flex area to maneuver if there is an issue with a product."
good,"I was an instructor.  The contract changed.  The new contractor did not renew the employment of about 25 of us. Oh well. It came.  It went.  "
good,"junior applications management lacked people skills"
good,"The culture of the work environment does not pursue change or improvements. "
good,Defense industry is a strange field.   Tenor is valued more then talent.  However its a fast paced atmosphere that is a great place to gain experience and the pay is very competitive.
good,Raytheon may be good to work for but in the department I am in management was not good.  There is no advancement for movement within the company. Workplace culture is not the best in the department that I am in.  My coworkers have worked together for years and it's hard to feel accepted.
good,"Raytheon attempts to be fair and ethical, but with more than 12,000 employees at my site alone, bad actors do invariably rise to job levels where they directly affect the business and work climate."
good,"Very busy day, could be from facilities, management, or just a numerous of things need to get done.  Management did not give clear direction on most projects and status of company.  Enjoyed the variety of duties."
good,"> The technology was progressive, but the tools we used to support that were underfunded and outdated."
good,"Never a boring day.  learn from various projects and items that I work on daily.  Working with a good team that is good about problem solving.  Usually have to interface with other departments, which makes for a good day."
good,Working on several different types of cameras used in the field out here comprised our days. We were basically left alone as long as the job got done. Certain times of the year got busier than others but not overly taxing on us. The most enjoyable part of working with Raytheon was the people back then.
good,"I did have paid time off, but working in a production environment limited time off. It was difficult getting time off when supporting production. There are always problems."
good,"It's the kind of place you go when you no longer have dreams or aspirations in life.  The union protects the lazy and ignores the hard workers.  No room for advancement when hourly.  The management is the worst I've ever seen, wildly ineffective and zero accountability.  It's basically a day care center for lazy adults.  I'm embarrassed to have worked here, which is why I left."
good,"There are some truly inspiring programs and managers, as well as the opposite.  It depends on where you are at.  It is, unfortunately for engineering staff, a place where you need to choose your boss instead of what you prefer to work on."
good,"TPY-2 Radar Site in Turkey. Site was active 24/7, except when down for repairs."
good,"This half federal and half state operated institution is a founding member laboratory performing research on nuclear bombs. "
good,One time a great company. Misguided management practices in the past 8 years has left the company in a shakey position.
good,"Raytheon has a laid back work environment, that requires a lot of self discipline to complete projects by dead line, while working flexible hours. Your're off everything weekend and recognized federal holidays."
good,"Was well compensated. May have been better working closer to my boss, and not on the other side of the US. Relocation handled nicely by 3rd party company. As with all DoD contractor companies, if you upset the customer, be prepared to be let go(no matter what got them upset)."
good,Great Comapany to work for but Heatlh benfits are expensive and they do not offer any job security once contract has ended. I was very dissapointed with how they treat me once the contract ended. They did not offer any job assistance.
good,"An overall good place to work. Depending on division your origination dictates your advancement opportunities. Management was poor in support, communication, retaliation for alerts, and in many cases absent"
good,Fantastic group to work with! Company culture is well engrained with the long-term employees - pride in the work and the team is infectious. Incredible opportunities to learn and develop
good,"Provided Lotus Notes 8.5.3 and Outlook 2013/2016 on ACtive Directory administrator support for the civilian and military sectors of Raytheon. Created and terminated user accounts, mail-in databases, groups and generic accounts. Processed name and certifier changes. Recertified user and generic IDs. Changed passwords. Moved mail files between servers, Clustered mail files. Ran Utilities on mail files to improve performance. Provided level three support for mail files, calendars, local replicas and archives. Collaborated with team members to publish and update documentation for admins, users and websites. Created entries in the Remedy Knowledge Base to aide users and technicians. Obtained security clearance to provide support to Raytheon account (a government account)"
good,"When hiring a manager, it should be based on experience and not who they know. The last manger and current managers were a father and son, with little to poor experience."
good,"Am getting sick and tired of companies refusing to hire full-time employees, and hiring contractors to fill the gaps... understand recent government regulations (ie; ObamaCare) make hiring employees expensive, but workers have NO reason to commit to or go the extra mile for a company when the company will drop them at the first business downturn."
good,"Good co-workers. Management needs ethics training. Nice commute. Must be a self starter, and research job training independently. Management will only offer special training to preferred employees."
good,"I loved my job here.  I learned a lot about the equipment, prepping, painting, refurbishing, testing, etc.  I also learned a lot about Supply Chain, Configurations Management, documentation audits for procedures and local instructions.  Management had changed several times over the course of the last five years.  I was lucky in that the managers I had trusted me to do my job without using the micro-management method.  Even though there could be several requests for many different things from me over the course of 8 hours.  However, I enjoyed the challenge of a busy day the most because when I was busy, I felt productive."
good,"Raytheon Missile Systems is not for the faint of heart ""Artist types"". They run their company like a well oiled, military machine. You either fall in line and get the jobs done on time or get cut."
good,"There is a lot of things to learn, and remember. These things are very important because if you forget, the consequences are harsh. Work begins early in the morning, around 5 to 6 am. Attendance is crucial because everything is recorded through computers. Missing days can hurt you and the point system that they use. After clocking in, communication is important so that you know where you'll be working. The work is fast pace, with very few people to help you. Training is always offered, it's actually required because without training, the operation can't be performed. There are few people that are nice and helpful. The rest are strict and mean. The hardest part of the job is remembering everything in the order they want. The enjoyable part is that you could possibly meet some of the few nice people there. Management is a 3 or 4 on a scale of 0 to 10. The leads are mean, and problems that go to HR are taken lightly."
good,N/A No Comment.  Easy work just that schedule is difficult to work with. schedule changes every two months. But employer is a good company
good,Great experience working with the United States Antarctic Program. Worked with the directors on the ice (Palmer/South Pole) Stations with administrative support.
good,"As far as the work environment at Raytheon, I would like to have been in a different area, and they didn't want to give me the chance.  Also if you are not in tight with the group leader, then you will have nothing but trouble with the rest of the staff.  It was the wrong choice of job because of the site manager and his cadre that wanted to do things their way instead of the right way."
good,"The pay was excellent but the co-workers and the hours were unacceptable."
good,"Interacting with different groups, lower management was good.  Upper could have been better.  Learn something new every day was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"As a Material Coordinator and M.A P. (Buyer), my day was very challenging due to the pace dictated by Management."
good,Management was a little shady when you brought problems to their attention. I think they just did not want to deal with them. My co-workers were awesome though.
good,"Management structure changed tremendously, and direction was not always very clear. Also felt like they disregarded the recommendations of senior technical staff to the detriment of the system/application, and at times those issues were then made to be due to actions of the technical staff, essentially shifting blame for issues."
good,Raytheon is a good company to work for if you like a standard 9-5 job in defense and willing to go through the process of clearances and not being able to talk about your work.
good,Your responsible for your own career. Take on tasks and projects at work that will help you get a better performance review. Talk to your manager regularly.
good,"Great Benefits, great export compliance tools.  Nice place to work. Very hard to move up. The old who you know rule applies here.  The merger with UTC will make things more complex."
good,A lot of traveling involved with the position.  Management available for advice and help.  Exposure to different work environments and different group of people on every project.
good,Raytheon is usually a subcontractor to other major aerospace firms.  This has driven their organizational structure.  It is difficult at times to make a difference due to this limited thinking.
good,"Co-workers were great, management was okay, as long as you got your work done they pretty much left you alone. not a lot of room for advancement. Not the worst place to work."
good,I enjoyed the ability to travel to both remote areas for work and to school for training.   I also got to meet and work with amazing worldy employees .
good,"Management does not ask the workers what they feel before making decisions."
good,"This is a very stressful place to work. Lots of good people, lots of room for advancement, good pay, but they will work you, it's very fast paced! But there are also a lot of good people and lots of opportunity to establish solid working relationships."
good,Raytheon is a great place to work for.  They need more diversity within the work place.  Salaries are good for Florida. But overall a good company. I would recommend.
good,"Overall a fair job, left for civil service offer. the parking situation was horrendous. the facility was overcrowded and I'm poor condition from age of building."
good,"When my supervisor found out that I was a Senior level 6 engineer, she said, "" I could hire two people for what we pay you"" ? Obviously, I was being compensated at a higher rate than she was.  Watch out for this type of boss."
good,I enjoyed going to customer sites to perform work to get out of the office and meet new people.  I was always able to continue my education with the support of the company.
good,"Coworkers openly and inappropriately discuss and berate thier coworkers: age, orientation , personal information,  etc."
good,"Raytheon has been a good place to work.  During times of growth with work to keep the staff feeling secure it can be an enjoyable place to work.  When there are reductions in head count and closing of facilities the workplace can be depressing."
good,Its very easy to get stuck in a rut there and end up with little to noadvancement and get poor job reviews through no fault of your own. There is a lot of red tape and you can get stuck in a bad assignment for a long time.
good,"fun place to work great people hours change non stop learned alot "
good,"At my location where where I was employed in Hilo, we had a diverse staff.  They were great people to work with and very eager to get the job done.  "
good,"I've spent the past 16+ years overseas upgrading and maintaining sensor packages for ISR platforms currently in use today. Providing real time intel to ground personnel to complete their task at hand, in some times brutal conditions."
good,Can be a great place to learn and grow - but very dependent on location and front line managers. Company currently going through transition with downturn in overall defense industry. Consolidating some places and reducing others. A lot of people worried about future employment. Work/life balance not very good. High pressure to perform. Compensation (pay) is very good.
good,"Configuration Management,  Raytheon Corporation,  Florida, 1992 - 2014"
good,Overall a good company to work for but if you want to advance you will need to apply for new jobs in the company (most likely at a different location).  There were a bunch of good managers have retired in the last couple of years and the new managers only care about advancing themselves (at your expense).  In the last 3-5 years the company has shed about 10-15% of the workforce so there are constant layoffs
good,"More concerned with the product and bottom line than with the customer or the employees.  Attitude was ""if you can find a better job, feel free to take it.""  Still, the pay was decent for Tucson and the job stability was good.  Benefits were awesome."
good,"A typical day at work consists of putting out whatever fire is currently happening. It is a very reactionary enviornment."
good,It was nice knowing that we were building things that was saving lives. The co-workers and the relaxed (but extremely safe) environment made going to work something to look forward to. The pride in what we built was something each of us took home every day.
good,The people that work here are excellent. Site management is down to earth and easily approachable. They enjoy your input and value what you have to say.
good,"Good place to learn but poor benefits and pay.  Atmosphere is one of disorganization, and there is little communication between teams and management and employee."
good,Raytheon is a large company with many resources to offer for both up and coming and more experienced engineers. You have the opportunity to work with cutting edge technology on meaningful products contributing to national security.
good,"The company is overall a good company. Being that Raytheon is a government contractor, there are lots of processes to go through before work can get done. This makes things seem (at least to me) pretty slow-paced. Also, company leadership wants to encourage more Agile style development, but the old way of doing business (lots of documentation and requirements, etc) seems to hinder that process of changing from Waterfall to Agile. Furthermore, most work requires a security clearance since the work deals with sensitive information. The clearance can take up to two years or more to be granted and in the meantime, you just need to keep yourself busy or try to find unclassified work. Overall, it is a good place to work because there are good benefits, flexible hours, good working environment."
good,"The work day consisted of a very safe and professional environment, with employees who took their positions serious.That being the workplace environment i had no choice other than to act accordingly."
good,"Not much creative license, but amazing technology and decent benefits. The pace was slow and the intern program was not very developed but good experience can be had if sought out."
good,"This was a decent entry level position, but there was not to much room for growth. The position required shift work which can be difficult to get used to."
good,Typical defense company environment in that there are labor issues and quite a divide between the production people and management. The technical engineers work in silos and do not integrate with the rest of the working teams much. The pace can be really slow at times and the solution for production issues is to just throw more people and more money at a problem instead of working a strategic solution.
good,"A busy place with many non value task interruptions.  Can be difficult to feel a sense of accomplishment.  Very structured processes and procedures."
good,"Job teaches a lot, but you must learn on your own, or OJT."
good,"Good place to work, nice salary, good organizations to get involved in, and good employee benefits. However, they could do a better job at training and on-boarding employees."
good,Raytheon offered an enjoyable and collaborative work environment and seemed to attract high caliber professionals that came to work each day ready to make meaningful contributions.
good,"Raytheon loves its engineers. they will go out of their way to train them. Support personnel, not so much.  Support personnel has to continually justify their existence."
good,Fast paced environment. Lots of new cutting edge development work and  always a feeling of helping the war fighter to be safer and provided better tools to accomplish the mission.
good,Working as a FSR was very enjoyable.  I averaged around 230 days a year supporting training away from my work site.  My co-workers on my team also traveled like I did and the customer was happy with our work.
good,"Raytheon is a good place to work, flexible hours, decent medical benefits, friendly work environment, a pension plan, 401K match."
good,"I worked for Raytheon over 22 years as a Contractor Program Security Officer.  My first and foremost responsibility was to support and protect the men and women fighting for and defending our country which I took very seriously.  This means that I was an extension of the Government Program Security Officers and represented them in my official duties at Raytheon.  My second responsibility was to my program managers at Raytheon enabling them and all other workers to understand and abide by the Governments rules and regulations for operating a special access program.  My workday was filled with many challenges and learning opportunities. "
good,"Parsons was the second employer I've had on the same Government Contract in a 29 year period. I have worked in 47 States, Two US territories, and 2 foreign countries on this contract. Asking my Job Location is irrelevant because the surveyor doesn't allow you to put ""Nationwide"" or ""Worldwide"" as an option. I put the World Headquarters as the location, although I've never been there. I've had job assignments as short as a week and as long as 3 1/2 years. I even changed employers during one assignment because I started the assignment as an employee of one of their subcontractors. I've worked in -40° weather and 120° weather and everything in between. Sometimes I work inside, sometimes outside. The cab of my truck is often my office. "
good,Fun job once getting started on work.  Fast paced work environment.  Must stay on top of tasks and follow up with management.  Learned how to develop connections and present findings.
good,"I loved my job for many years, but recently management has changed in our area.  I don't feel as valued as I once did. "
good,"Focussed on the task at hand. Cooperative team. Greatest part of the job was working with a multi-national, multi-disciplinary team. Very professional work colleagues."
good,"Management must listen to employees."
good,"Great place to work, however if on just a contract basis it will be challenging to be long term. I would suggest applying for a long term  position, perhaps anything over 2 years."
good,"The company went live with a new program for customer support and hired 12 people. After a few months, they let go of 8 people. I returned to a temporary position for over a year, and when the person I was replacing returned, I was done."
good,fort wayne operation subject to the politics of mother Raytheon.  never had any real control of our destiny. being kept alive so as to not lose talent. much of the core competencies have moved to other locations.
good,"Very fast pace but very satisfying"
good,"Great company to use as a stepping stone. Retention of employees is extremely low, aside from personnel with pensions. Great training available and some incredible smart people."
good,"Raytheon is a large defense contractor. Includes benefits, flexible work schedule, and lots of opportunity to learn. 9/80 work schedule gives every other Friday off, which is very nice."
good,"I've enjoyed my time with this company. working as a Supply Technician in th TES Maintenance Facility. I normally ordered parts, tools, equipment and supplies. Performed Issues, Receiving, shipping and Transfering of said items, Monthly selected inventories and yearly complete inventories of all property, assets, parts and supplies."
good,"they are an ok company to work for. i can't speak to anything else since i haven't work for them in over 20 years, but when i was there it an ok place."
good,this is a typical defense contractor with the typical problems that come along with it. high turnover and low innovation in some areas. still competitive with defense contractors.
good,"Relaxed work environment, steady workflow. Management was friendly. The commute was not too stressful. Great working hours with flexibility.Helpful coworkers."
good,Raytheon Aerospace is a contracted company that builds jet engines for the military. We as a team exceeded goals set forth by management. As a QA/Team leader I was responsible for  the engines to be safe for aircraft instlallations.
good,My position involved a security clearance.  The customer wanted a total object oriented project.  Raytheon provided many object oriented classes mostly around C++.
good,This opportunity allowed for myself to be involved with the engineering industry right before entering college.  I learned a lot and enjoyed the work culture.
good,Good Company to work for. Enjoyed my time there. Good team and great environment. Learned a lot during my time there. I would recommend this company to others.
good,Very flexible work hours and great environment to be in.  Plenty of opportunity to advance if you work hard. Type of position where you can continue learning every day no matter how skilled or comfortable you are in your current position.
good,"Most of the work is government contracts, so there isn't as much drive to innovate and produce as there would be in a startup. Company offers good benefits though."
good,"I liked working there, a lot of smart people. I worked part time at night, it was nice not having people everywhere. Secret clearance is required for most jobs, but not all."
good,A lot of good business structures in place resulting in productive and generally satisfied work force. In many ways they had taken the time to design the product architecture well from the start which meant that the very complex product got be developed efficiently.
good,"Paperwork and troubleshooting, working with Customers. Have learned you can't change others and their work ethic.  Management can use some training. The culture itself is pretty layed back.  Working with many different personalities.  Enjoy the flexibility and being able to work alone, minimal supervision."
good,"Overall, the work environment was very positive.  Work life balance was great and provided learning opportunities."
good,Great place to work especially if you are just getting out of school.  The company does have many different areas to work and also offer work and home life balance to almost all groups
good,It was a good job. Like most it has it's good and bad points. I had put close to 15 years there so it couldn't of been to bad. some shift in management and other issues lead to my resgnation.
good,"Equipment Division was a business unit of Raytheon Company.  It is no longer there.  At the time we employed about 10,000 people and started out in Wayland, MA.  This then became part of Integrated Defense Systems or Missile Systems."
good,"this was a position in an Air Force PMEL lab. we performed calibration and repair of electronic, physical and dimensional test equipment. geographically isolated form the rest of the company.  Supervised and evaluated by AF QA."
good,"I worked there for over 20 years held several positions from electronic assembler, technician to supervisor. Good place to work and learn. Would recommend this place of employment"
good,Great place to work but it is difficult to move up.  I work with some of the best and brightest people in the world and I am thankful for that.  The biggest thing I have learned is that its not just work its what people depend on for our nations safety.
good,"I was submitted to work moving manually dozens of box with more than 62 pounds each one, weight enough to destroy my shoulders."
good,Raytheon is a great company with great benefits.  The only problem I had was with my immediate management and no room to advance.  The department where I worked had a very negative attitude based on our management
good,"Great company with good benefits.  My manager was not local."
good,"come in to work, pass the security gate, clock in, check the floor, make sure machines are full, no spills or dangerous conditions for other workers, take reports of stock, coolant levels, ph and clean machines. i leaner how coolant works in a large cnc machine, how to adjust ph levels in a water based oil coolant. management was ok at first but then got worse when it came to finding coverage, remembering time taken off or agendas spoken of before hand. the workplace among other contractors was filled with raytheon employees, all very diversified between age and race. many older workers are very nice and have fun stories about work to tell on break. hardest part of the job was having enough to do and machine cleaning, the most enjoyable part was the sense of accomplishment after every night having the machines running optimally and smoothly and seeing the results of the up-keeping after months."
good,"Worked with Defense Logistics 'government"" at RATHION Greenville Texas. Really had limited communication with the company. However, The individuals I came into contact with had good working habits."
good,"i am not reviewing raytheon and i find this part of the indeed website ridiculous and it has nothing to do with why i am on indeed, which is to find a new position."
good,A very old company with some dated employee practices. While not union as an engineer it is a union company.  The dynamics were very interesting between the non-union engineers and the union employees
good,the work day was anywhere between 8 to 10 hours depending on how the students were learning.  most enjoyable part of the job was the students graduate.
good,It was a great company to work for on NASA.  This provided an opportunity to work on Network Management tools (HP Openview) to obtain information about TCP/IP networks.  This was relevant information for the project.
good,I had a great time working for Raytheon. Working on radars was quite challenging at time because of deadlines but all in all a great place. I worked on a lot of radar and different types of electronic equipment.
good,"The workplace culture can very.  I have seen some people work minimum hours and enjoy life.  Where others are obligated to work their life away.  For the most part, employees have a decent work-life balance."
good,I enjoy working for Raytheon IDS.  it is a stable company to work and it provides challenging projects. working for Raytheon is an extension of my service to country.  What we do saves life's and protect our warfighter
good,Plenty of opportunities to contribute as long as you take initiative.  People are amazing - many from top universities with creative minds and commitment to the warfighters.
good,"the culture and environment have changed way too much, I'm sure, in the time since I left, so I don't feel anything I would say would be valid for anyone reading it today"
good,"Workplace culture varies drastically, based on whether you work Legacy programs or New Proposals. Legacy programs allowed more freedom to be creative, but with less job security. Proposal work included a faster pace, often requiring overtime with less creative freedom."
good,Travel with little to no notice with no benefits to the traveling. You can be told to pack your bags and you leave tomorrow and depending on the job there is no guarantee that you will go back to where you came from.
good,Raytheon is a great company and there is lots of opportunity to grow a career here.  Their 9/80 schedule is a huge benefit as it's great to have every other Friday off work.
good,I only worked there for a short time on a contract. I loved the people and the environment. It was a military environment where people where mostly retired from the armed services. I wish I was a full time employee there.
good,Presents many growth opportunities for motivated individuals with a Bachelors degree or higher. Employees get out what they put forth. Be prepared to put in a genuine effort.
good,"Raytheon El Segundo has a lot going for it.  Very interesting projects and very good co-workers.  I have not yet worked with a colleague who was not very talented.  People are friendly and very easy to get along with.  The projects I've worked on are fun, exciting, and definitely cutting edge state of the art."
good,"Raytheon was a decent company but to advance, one needed to know how to play the political game (as with most companies) but this one had a different religious slant to it."
good,"Even though Raytheon is a large company, the people and overall work environment make it seem like a small one. Friendly coworkers and great food. There is always something to do."
good,Raytheon as a whole is a very good company to work for and is very innovative in their work. The work that I have experienced is ever changing. We constantly look to improve the way we do things!
good,I worked at Raytheon on contract right after my time in the military ended. I think Raytheon is one of the best jobs I've had to date. My supervisor was very understanding and allowed me to come in at times that best fit my schedule due to me being in school as well.
good,"If you like the remote area to work at you would like the job.  The travel is the worse, but after a week of getting there it is ok. There are friendly people out there to be with."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Raytheon, however, since most of the work is dependent upon Government contracts job security was never guaranteed. It was conducive to work/life balance, and I liked the line of work I was doing."
good,"Good company, Great staff. 37 hour working week over 4 days."
good,"It was a very good company to work for during the period I was there, however as the company grew in size it was focused more on profits and less on the people that made those profits for the company and shareholders."
good,Raytheon Polar supported the National Science Foundation contract to support the USAP. I found Raytheon to be a great company to work for. I especially enjoyed the 9/80 work weeks. We worked  44 hours one week and 36 the next giving us every other Friday off!
good,Great job but layoffs are a way of life. Programs end and cuts follow but that is to be expected in a contract environment.
good,You learn something every day. Time flies due to so many tasks to complete. Co workers are very united; trying to complete tasks as a unit.
good,"Raytheon is a very good company. The workforce is diverse and the company takes diversity and inclusion seriously. If given the opportunity, I would work here again."
good,I felt like they were clear in their expectations and gave the proper support when needed. They have the proper employee development training section.
good,good place to work but hard to develop and move up due to the union. non stressful environment with good management. benefits and vacation/ sick time were a plus.
good,I began working at Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems in 2009 doing Test Equipment development at White Sands Missile Range. Since then the opportunities available to me have been varied and challenging.
good,Liked working here. Always had something to do. Just wish the pay was somewhat higher but wasn't too bad of a place to work at.
good,Enjoy working in a fast paced environment. each day there is something different and keeps you thinking about troubleshooting.
good,This was a great experience coming straight out of the military. The came with a great benefits package and nice work environment. I resigned from this position because of the pay.
good,Super dilbert comics. Employees seemed bored. Full of military and engineers. Although still a great experience and way to get involved in engineering and the business side of the world
good,From cable assembly to system test and everything in between. Willingness to work different shifts helped me learn different skills and saved me from layoffs.
good,Trabajo en el que se tocaban varias ramas de la electricidad y electronica
good,"AvWorks is a good place to work, however there is too much internal politics and red tape."
good,Large company acquiring several small companies.  Not always in touch with the company culture of small companies they take under their wing.
good,"Excellent co-workers. Good direction. Good benefits."
good,Hughes Aircraft was purchased by Raytheon all together I spent 32 years with the company. Did many different engineering tasks. Lot's of opportunity to try different technical paths. Had a great carrier there for 32 years.
good,"great company to work for overall."
good,"Supported second shift engineering had good rapport with senior engineer as well as all employees on second shift. Enjoyed an ongoing learning process. Worked with state of the art military equipment. Troubleshooting, repairing and identifying flaws in designs and testing. Wrote monthly shop data reports identifying issues and areas for improvements."
good,Raytheon was a professional environment with good people.  Plenty of work groups and activities for employees to enjoy outside of work.
good,A good defense contractor to work for. The Raytheon Company is a major American defense contractor and industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in weapons and military and commercial electronics. It was previously involved in corporate and special-mission aircraft until early 2007. Raytheon is the world's largest producer of guided missiles.
good,Company has an upside but lack in good training for management and leadership. Very low morale environment within the workplace due to attendance policies.
good,"Muti-Task - working for 20 Engineers"
good,More than 25 years working with very talented people and very interesting hardware. Never board while at work. Every year something new came along to create and improve.
good,Great working environment where the HR department works closely and strategically with the site leadership.  The offices are new and closely located to Ft Meade and NSA.  Easy access from major highways.
good,"Although it was a very short period in Raytheon, but during this short period I got a pleasure of working with Mersenne Twister and real complex algorithm."
good,This was a company I spent the most time working for which was pretty good.  11 years with this company allowed me to mature in the IT field.
good,1 of the 5 Prime Defense Contractors.  Large Organization.  Established Culture.  A lifetime employer for many; with all of the positives and negatives of such.
good,This is a great company to work for and it has great benefits. They even pay for your education if it fits in your growth and development plan.
good,Raytheon's Internship program teaches you how to manage yourself in a true engineering environment. You have the opportunity to work along side multiple engineers and business professional.
good,"I highly recommend working at Raytheon, great company and equally great benefits. I will miss the overall feel of every day life with them."
good,My co-workers made the job enjoyable. The most enjoyable part about the job was knowing you accomplished your job everyday by completing your tasks.
good,Quality was priority. It's a big company so you were just a number. They had some really good managers and some really bad ones. Most of the people were really great to work for. This is not a family oriented place to work. They expect you to be there and be on time no matter what. I was wrote up for going to my nephew's funeral.
good,"Raytheon is a company that really does make it's employees feel like family.  The benefits and salary were very highly competitive.  "
good,Great Company Culture and an amazing work life balance.  A great place for people looking to start a career for a fortune 100 company.
good,"My typical day can vary greatly depending on what team and task I an currently involved with.  I have been an asset to many different teams and tasks in my current position and have been shared across them as time and needs have risen.  I have been involved in simulation execution and analysis on unix based platforms.  I have worked with software development and implementation.  I have ran simulation development and execution exercises with validation of results. I have presented to customers and been responsible for input material to customer briefings. "
good,Ordered tools for drill. Ran job priority list. I enjoyed working on the parts. VERY HOT environment!
good,"The work itself was fun and entertaining, I learned many skills and traits that carry into daily life. Management needed improvement when it came to how they treated the employees especially during extenuating and life threatening circumstances. The Politics of the company were abhorrent. Most of my co-workers were wonderful people but exceedingly cut throat."
good,Challenging and interesting place to work.  It could be rather boring at times working in production Control.  There was quite a bit of manual work that had to be done rather than through automatic downloads.
good,"Great group of leaders, lot of room to become part of a team and solve issues."
good,"Great company. Good culture. "
good,"Services company focuses on providing high quality, low cost technical services to the customer.  Very customer focused and understands complexities of doing business with all areas of DoD organizations both domestic and foreign."
good,I was able to pass on my experiences to both new and experienced operators during initial and instructor operator qualification courses/
good,Many problems were presented throughout the week.  Each was unique and challenging.  The team equally participated in the process of trouble-shooting and analysis.
good,"I learn new things from this company, and  everyone is friendly and everyone is work as a team,"
good,"Company is excellent about allowing work/life balance. If your manager allows, you can work modified hours and take every other Friday off."
good,"Interface with CAMs, Program Management, and finance to ensure schedule validity, and identify opportunities to accelerate schedule/increase schedule margin. Conduct analysis of weekly IMS updates and monthly cost/schedule integrated EVMS. Lead stand up meetings with program team to prioritize and status critical chain tasks."
good,Good working environment at Raytheon IDS.  Do not know much about other segments
good,"Plenty of options for advancement"
good,"Assigned to the most challenging fast paced new projects and those projects under aggressive schedules. Very interesting motivating projects. Most enjoyable was assembling the products we designed, and preparing to sent to test facilities. Most enjoyable is watching all I worked always hit the Target!"
good,Raytheon is great company to work for.  They take pride in training their employees and teaching them the Raytheon way of doing business.  Recent times have seen the removal of some of the extra benefits of the job but probably no more so than some other big companies.  Would definitely recommend this place to others.
good,Management tends to adhere to legacy methods of doing reporting and analysis
good,"A day in the office is typically very busy, lots of fires to put out, many levels of management with conflicting ideas."
good,"Good employer who seeks great employees and customers."
good,"ATCOTS is still in its infancy, needs lots of work. management appears not to listen in the upper echelons."
good,"The management at this job was wonderful and very helpful. I have learned from this job how to use my time more wisely, give your advice and they took from your advice"
good,"Not for the young and aggressive."
good,I enjoyed my years with Raytheon. I was provided the opportunity to work on great projects with a great team of people.
good,I worked from technical documentation detailing the fabrication of wiring harnesses and installing equipment into the computer racks.   Once the racks were completed the engineering department tested functionality prior to shipment to the customer.
good,Typical day includes review of indirect labor and non-labor budgets and providing analysis of drivers of costs.  Make recommendations to management and provide status on performance.
good,"The focus on the financial management side is on Earned Value Management. Everyone is required to become Raytheon Six Sigma certified within six months of employment, which is a great strategy to improve business."
good,"great working environment"
good,Developed proposals and maintained logistics planning documentation for a variety of programs supporting SOF.  Supervised nine functional area experts.
good,Gained more experience in Governmental Accounting since it has been years since I had worked with Government.
good,"Lots of training opportunities available along with tuition reimbursement.  My particular office within Raytheon had very little upward mobility, which is why I left."
good,It was a good experience.  I worked in Asset Management and this was new area for me.
good,"Challenging and rewarding."
good,"When I first started with E-Systems (later Raytheon) I worked rotating shifts. Despite that, I really enjoyed working in the operations type of environment."
good,The work was varied as was the customer base.  I was given wide latitude up to a point in completing projects/tasks as long as the plan was vetted with management first.
good,Raytheon is great place to work and advance with many skills whichare  being trained on a daily basis. I am not ever bored with job. The company is great.
good,"Company employees are dedicated and loyal workers, often working extended hours."
good,"dod contactor on military base.  change ever 5 years or so."
good,"Edger and willingness to work and qualified to do so. A day at work is typically routine which ranges from vehicle inspections and maintenance, training, station duties to building inspection and fire security checks."
good,"Flexible work hours"
good,"If you like working with brilliant minds, this is the place for you. Each day provides engaging conversation and one is always learning and stretching their capabilities."
good,"Solid friendly employees and support staff. Weak contracts and a lot of financial issues, but good people."
good,A typical day at work:
good,"The job is great and pays well, but some of the people are hard to deal with"
good,"Nice place to work. Nice office equipment, bebefits and salary."
good,"Working at Raytheon is great. Advancement at Raytheon is not so great. It seemed that if you were horrible at your job, then the best thing to do is to promote you to management. Not to say all the managers were horrible at what they did, just a lot of them."
good,great place to start your career and Great work environment.
good,Flexible work schedules.
good,enjoy being a mechanic and working with heavy equipment vehilic
good,Job supports the training of air traffic control trainees. Work revolves around the Federal Aviation Administration's training needs.
good,"Raytheon was awarded a multi-million dollar contract to supply the United States Marine Corp with Medium Range Thermal Bi-ocular units. My responsibility was to assemble the eye piece units. After crosstraining my duties were to test units for image quality and functionality. As the product line matured the work volume increased. Daily and hourly yields of the work flow were measured by matrix and takt charts to ensure on time delivery.A sense of pride and satisfaction was felt as the work flow continued in a timely manner. The staff involved became a close-knit group as we were hired on about the same time. The hardest part of the job was when the contract was coming to its end cycle, from there we were reassigned to other projects."
good,"Great co-workers, great overtime options and very flexible. Management is very easy to work for and always bend over backwards for you."
good,Flexible work hours but there were too many people moving up the management ladder where I had chosen to move up the technical ladder.
good,I train UAS flight instructors for the military. I've learned how to develop training materials for in class and online course work. I enjoy providing my students the tools to succeed in their careers.
good,Raytheon Canada needs to hire us people back from our layoff
good,"Employees are trusted to independently and professionally perform their daily tasks. There are many perks on most main plant sites, such as a gym, convenience stores, multiple food courts, company sports teams and light massage therapy. Management is generally fair with their folks and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the many company policies, especially in the classified areas -- but this will soon come as second nature. The most enjoyable part of the job is the trust and respect I feel I have earned from customers and colleagues."
good,You should really shop the sites and benefits offered. There is a vast array of differing compensation plans throughout the company. Find one that meets your needs and the needs of your family.
good,"It can be a good place to work, however there is a complete lack of progression opportunities given the current management team."
good,"The typical day at work is very busy and productive. "
good,"Everything depends on what program you get chosen for, a production program is different from a developing program. If you need structure, this might not be what you are looking for. More learn on the fly."
good,Day started off with group safety meeting and reviewing daily tasks at hand. Most people were great to work with but you did have a lot of people that were not team oriented and rude.
good,"Daily huddles and performance meetings.  Strong focus on diversity, leadership and culture improvements.  Completing job task amongst a sea of meetings.  Seeing your opinion and work  used to make decisions."
good,Good company. Overworked due to understaffing.  Good reputation so carries weight for future opportunities. ...............................................
good,I worked for different divisions.   Assisting buyers and filing.   Assisting with travel expense reports and materials purchased for use on job sites.
good,"Good place to work on contracts, money is always there. No advancement on some contracts. Good starter job for new job seekers who want to learn a new skill or job."
good,The company offers good pay.  Moving up in the company is a little harder than others and they move up people they like not people who do the best job.  There are a lot of incompetent engineers working here too.
good,"I was hired to bring in expertise in field of diagnostic engineering. Lost the manager with that vision, and then required to operate in a field that was not my center of expertise. Other managers tried to use my skill set, but did not really understand what I could provide. Ultimately, I was compared to employees in a different area of expertise, and could not excel."
good,Overall a good company to work for and allows you to move around in the company to different job positions. However you may get stuck doing a job that has no interaction with other people for your entire shift which is good if you don't want to talk to others. I would suggest getting a position that you could be happy in for a while because you may be the only one that can do that job so you get stuck there.

good,"Most relaxed atmosphere I've ever worked"
good,"It's a big company, full of processes and overhead.  On the other hand, it's a stable and usually sensible place.  Raises are ~2-5%. It will matter heavily with whom you end up working whether it works out for you."
good,Raytheon is a great place to work that is structured and willing to train. Needs an update on work life balance and work culture. Easy to gain experience and knowledge from management but everyone's time is stretched thin due to lack of hiring; they'd rather use the people there to do the work of multiple people
good,I enjoyed working there.  People were very nice.  There was alot of work.  I worked in the supply area.  Lots of soldiers to take care of and Brigades.
good,"Good if you get in young and move up quick...but slow pay advancement means 5-6+ years before you're above service industry pay. Promotions etc. based on seniority NOT merit means lazy gets promoted as long as it's persistent. Also a small town of soap opera-esque rumors. Great fit for some, not so much for me."
good,it is good place to start a career or to advance if you are a engineered  or programmer. Not much opportunity for anyone in desktop support most of  that is contracted out.
good,"Raytheon can be a good company to work for. Good work life balance based on what program you are working. "
good,"Not Applicable. Aerospace industry is too up and down. Best part is 9/80 schedule. Work 9 hours a day, and get every other Friday off. Work/Life Balance."
good,"Great benefits with this company. Diversity is evident though it can use some more diversity in the higher positions.  Fair work and fair treatment, overall this is a great company to work for."
good,I was employee at E-Systems over 5 years. I enjoyed working at E-Systmes.  My colleagues were friendly. The commute was great and i didn't have to pay for the parking everyday.
good,"Some of the best people I have ever worked with, most people are retired or former military and are committed to continuing to support critical missions within the DoD and IC."
good,"As it is a defense company, you should be expected to flex your interests to align with contracts.  Blending defense with a large corporation -- expect an unusually high level of process and for issues to be resolved at a slower pace than desired (e.g. 3+ months to stand-up a server)."
good,Good progressive company to work for. High tech fast pace company leading the defense industry with it's cutting edge radar technology development and advancements in end user capabilities. I would recommend anyone who is interested in a career within the defense industry to apply to this company.
good,Good progressive company to work for. High tech fast pace company leading the defense industry with it's cutting edge radar technology development and advancements in end user capabilities. I would recommend anyone who is interested in a career within the defense industry to apply to this company.
good,"I was tasked with keeping my workers on task and performing at a high level.  I worked effectively with the union stewards and employees to reach our production goals.  I enjoyed the camaraderie of my colleagues, and made time to meet with them outside of the workplace."
good,"Overall, I found Raytheon to be a great company that paid well and gave pretty good benefits. However, the company was held back due to some budget problems. It was very difficult to get approval for the training I needed to actually do my job. I basically waited until another employee was done with all his work and had nothing else to do. There were also some very strong personality types that are difficult to work with if that's not your thing. I spent a lot of time listening to team members arguing about whether a certain computer could really run at the specs that were listed (and they got very angry over the subject)."
good,Your experience will depend upon who your supervisor and team lead are. There are some employees who are micromanagers and/or are difficult to get along with. The benefits are good. The work can be boring sometimes and extremely stressful at other times.
good,I do not wish to participate in providing an opinion in previous employment.  I do however wish to use this platform to find suitable employment for self.
good,I liked what I did but the pay just did not cover my expenses. They were fair on the work load and were very helpful. I would work there again if the pay was good.
good,Always something different each day. Always in an environment which challenge and rewards at the same time. local commute.
good,High paced work environment with hourly challenges. Love the benefits of a satisfying work day. Protecting lives and keeping the boots on the ground safe to come home to their families
good,"Working for Raytheon enabled me to provide for myself and my family for 13 yrs. "
good,"Started as an expeditor, worked my way up to Program Manager. Finished my degree in Computer Science while working here. Eventually wound up in the IT department until I left to pursue working for myself."
good,Management was not great. The company lost many good people with job knowledge and keep people with little to no experience.
good,They really DIDNT PROVIDE JOB SECURITY. The management team had poor communication. Excellent co workers everyone there was friendly.
good,Good company to work for in this area but can be nerve racking with the contracts coming or not. This means loss of work if the contracts are not there.
good,"Working for Raytheon keeps a person on their toes and every day can be different.  The immediate management attempted to do their best to include subordinates opinions and input in daily activities.  Most co-workers were very knowledgeable of all aspects of the position but there were some that ""rode"" the coat tails of others or were just there to get paid.  Hardest part of the job was maintaining the ""what if"" scenarios as realistic as they should be.  The best part of the day would be getting to go around and show the presence of security and diligence."
good,Great place to work. Small team environment with a focus on independent thinking. Upward mobility and great managerial support.
good,"There are many projects and opportunities but only the good engineers are over-worked and pushed hard.  There are many people who cannot perform at high level, and the good engineers basically have to carry the rest."
good,"Raytheon was a great Company to work for from November 2001- Feburary 2015 when I was there your job was secure, not any more. Now just like all the other Companies you have to go through a Temp Service and with a temp your job is not secured. I was laid off and it has been really hard to find a good paying job close to home, it would be nice when and if work picked up at Raytheon that they would recall some of the employees with more experience back to work."
good,Good work environment. Good leadership. Accommodating to job/family balance. Supportive on educational growth. Variety of coworkers adds to job knowledge however at times may be suck in one group without opportunity to change.
good,"Actively employed in Aerospace engineering, operations, acquisition, testing, and integration.  I have more than 12 years of experience on multiple Global Positioning System (GPS) modernization and operational efforts including: Legacy, Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP), OCX, Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), M-Code, from development, acquisition, operational testing through program integration, sustainment and management."
good,"This is an interesting place to work, with numerous opportunities for growth within the organization. Compensation is very good and benefits for the employee and families is above what most other employers offer."
good,"Great job, love the work; but the time away from family/home life is suffering.Work is sometimes challenging, which is good. Job is just too far away from home, and not enough days off to compensate for time away from family."
good,"A typical day at RMS is not typical, there are no two days alike. The changing duties and constant flow of work makes this place challenging. The people make this environment fun and very comfortable."
good,Learned new skills and gained experience I was seeking from a large established company. Too many questionable hiring practices from management. Worked with an excellent group of co-workers.
good,Work at government client's site.  Company gives great bonuses.
good,"Work days were not really ""typical.""  Tasks and responsibilities were customer-driven.  "
good,Several reorganizations during my time with the company attempting to reduce costs.
good,"Large training organization that provides large-scale curriculum design, training development, and curriculum management."
good,"Management and communication are not one in the same.  As long as you do as you are told and not as you think, things will move along.  I enjoy most of the people I work with, which has been a large factor to staying with the company for so long.  The job security is nice, but pay raises and promotions are far too rare and insignificant."
good,I was the Sales Supervisor for a high volume sales center.  We handled hundred of calls throughout the day.  High volume can mean some unhappy customers. I handled all service challenged clients and resolved their service issues.
good,"Raytheon was an excellent company to work for, and the culture is fantastic. I highly recommend this company."
good,"Buean ambiente de trabajo, pero pésima gestión por parte de la dirección."
good,"I work 12.5 hr 5 Days a week "
good,Raytheon is a good company to work for. Managing work/life balance can be a challange.  Given today's professional climate this can be said for most large companies that use the most current technologies which allow employees to work remotely.
good,Great company to work for. Very professional and adheres to strict company guidelines.
good,"Raytheon is a excellent company with many perks and flexibility to move within the company.  The people are professional and friendly, but compensation is a problem.  Young talent is not valued and the company cannot retain young talent."
good,"Raytheon is a top defense contractor working on some of the world's most advanced technologies.  With nearly 70,000 employees there are a wealth of different roles and significant mobility within each business unit."
good,"Work 4-10 hr work weeks, host daily standup meetings, communicate across functions and facilitate flow through the factory. Mgmt. is very political. Work mostly with engineers. Hardest part of job is working with different types of people, most enjoyable part of job is overcoming obstacles with teamwork."
good,Great place to work and at the mercy of program funding. You will have the sense that you are really making a difference.
good,Work was challenging but didn't have enough expertise in the subject or Reliable sources for help with failures.
good,I worked for multiple departments within Texas Instruments and eventually one of the defense areas I worked in was sold to Raytheon. Both companies were very nice to work for.
good,"Working in an operations environment teaches you how to better manage your time and how to prioritize tasks. It also allows you to act fast on your feet and make critical decisions in little time. Typical day is full of meetings focused on execution planning, material statuses and reporting to upper management. Progress on schedule, quality and budget is monitored daily to ensure on time delivery to our customers. All this is done while keeping the lean concepts and safety in mind and trying to always becomes more efficient and do all work safely. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the employees on the floor and being able to see a product come to life and go through it's complete life cycle."
good,Overall a good place to work the people I worked with were very good. My supervisor was great he took care of his employees got the work done The FAA had nothing but good things to say about our work. The only con I had was that they ran out of money on the contract with the FAA and half of the staff was laid off.
good,I was lucky...worked for IDS in San Diego with a great group of people and excellent Navy customers. Truely enjoyed my tenure at Raytheon although I was stressed out the entire time!
good,great to employees Easy to work clean enviroment
good,I really enjoy my time a Raytheon Aircraft company because of the interest I had in corporate jets and culture of the customers who bought them.
good,"While Working here advanced from an Electromechanical Assembler to Tech II, Required Long Hours, Hard Work, and Continued Education."
good,Enjoyed working with a team that worked well with each other in which also had the same goals in mind. I was impressed with the companies strong attention towards safety.
good,Could benefit from more employee programs/incentive. Corporate structure could benefit if greater focus was given to employee social interactions and culture/team building.
good,"As a remote employee it is hard to rate the culture, but it is a good place to work if you are interested in this industry. It was not the right fit for my goals."
good,"There have not been many reasons to not enjoy work, although due to location, advancing may require an additional move to an alternate location outside of Huntsville."
good,"Overall the position allowed for experience and additional knowledge. It also allowed for opportunities to work with other departments and clients, including building relations with management throughout the US."
good,"Worked in Al Assad  northern Iraq flying  survallance balloons  and three towers "
good,Fast paced and competitave work environment. Lots of international travel however not in business class. Thats about the only negative I have working at Raytheon.
good,"Overall the merger is reorganizing company from a 4 business unit into 2 units , expected changes in the upcoming months. overall confident in the process."
good,One of the best places I have ever worked. I wish I could still be there. The only issue is that a lot of roles are contract positions which provide very little security or advancement.
good,"Working at Raytheon is essentially the same as most other aerospace/defense companies. Benefits are good (better than a lot of small engineering/tech companies, but worse than FAANG types) and compensation is on par with defense--again, better than a lot of small engineering/tech companies in terms of salary, but worse than FAANG. A lot of interesting projects, and if you're interested in the defense industry Raytheon would be a great place to work."
good,Group is mixed with senior and young engineers.  Some are more motivated than others. Sometimes people would just show up for a paycheck instead of having a passion to learn and grow.
good,"okay friendly place to work with good standards  with lots of benefits and fun things organised thought the year like world earth day, summer BBQs and Christmas dinners"
good,The missions can be rewarding and at times that is all.  Most people stay because they enjoy working with their peers and not the actual work environment.
good,"I worked there for almost 14 years, was able to advance and move laterally, to better jobs, it was challenging work but very fulfilling. "
good,When I work at Raytheon. the work is very stressful. There are a lot of meeting and you have to work and delivery product on time and on budget. Working at Raytheon is not fun.
good,"My responsibilities required updating Factory Operating System per update request from knowledgeable operators, Engineer Change Orders, Current Prints."
good,The staff is absolutely dedicated to mission success.  The local GTS business has a high veteran population that are always willing to go above and beyond to ensure mission accomplishment.
good,"Good place to work, most of the day is spent behind computer in cube, not very exciting but pay is pretty good and benefits are great, except insurance relatively expensive"
good,"Raytheon provides an excellent platform to grow and learn how government defense sector organizations execute contracts from the ground up.  The company provides ample opportunity for formal education, and its mandatory internal process improvement platform establishes the baseline needed to understand necessary how to succeed in the organization."
good,"Great Opportunities for International work. Everyday is a new adventure. Management varies by site, mostly former military. Culture and focus is always about the customer."
good,Providing day to day service to supported customer of the installation and throughout the state. Customers relied on the warehouse to have the variety of training devices for training and preparing for war. Several universities relied on the warehouse for various training items to prepare them for future candidates to serve in the Arm Forces.
good,"Whether you'll enjoy Raytheon or not kind of depends on where you end up working. Some people like working classified projects, and some people don't. I have enjoyed my work here but I've been with really good teams and just okay teams."
good,On my particular program it can be stressful. Schedule is usually the driving force over quality of a product. Some managers look out for their teams and help unify them and others only look out for themselves. I would say you are at about a 40% chance you will get a good manager.
good,"Commercial Aircraft Manufacturing was a different business than Core Raytheon Business (which focused on defense programs).  We were given quite a bit of autonomy from Corporate Raytheon and during my course of employment the Aircraft Manufacturing (Beechcraft/Hawker) was sold off to a separate entity.  It was subsequently sold off to Textron which owns several different commercial aircraft product lines.  "
good,"Work day consist of inventory counting and maximo system inventory updates. Shipping/Receiving materials and equipment. Management is great here with the JPMRC program. Workplace culture is great, nice group of personalities that makes the job fun to come to. Hardest part of the job is packing and unpacking the JPMRC-IS system for deployments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of accomplishments and a great group of co-workers to make the environment less stressful."
good,"1.> Great Company to work for."
good,Raytheon was great to work for. They had good benefits and ran the company well. The work felt like it meant something. It was great to work with the latest technologies.
good,A typical work day starts early and stays late.  Often 12-13 hour days for exempt employees.  The verbal expectation is that an exempt employee will work 48 hours/week before any paid overtime is offered.  The company has very strong ethical values and strives to provide high quality products at fair prices on time.  Work life balance is the first thing to go.
good,"I did like working there but the management was pretty poor. My manager was new and did not fight for anything, I did like working there I did find some great people that worked there but everyone was a contractor."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my employment at Raytheon.  I was able to explore many different finance areas and advance in the company. The flexibility, pay and benefits were great. I enjoyed a lot of the people I worked with. However, the higher up in the company you went, the culture declined. Many positions did not select candidates based on merit or skill, but inner circle.  I observed several instances where a qualified candidate would apply for a senior position/promotion and never even get an interview because the chosen candidate had been selected prior to the job posting."
good,"- Some days are extremely busy, others are a well paced workload"
good,"I work for an organization which was acquired a handful of years ago. Mentality is small company, but work for a corporation. It is discouraging to want to follow policies and procedures written by the parent company when you are constantly in a battle with your superiors to work outside the processes. I need a change this is not the type of environment I am meant to work in. I come from corporate mentality, team environment. This may be good for some employees and ideal, but this is just not for me."
good,"Finance department was often understaffed, with only 1 finance per team of large engineers but it was a collaborative place to work and there were 9/80's in place so every other Friday you were off."
good,The manager I worked for was a power abuser. He also had poor leadership skills. His racist attitude was what made me leave the company. He had no empathy fr employees
good,"A very large organization with plenty of work to keep you occupied. Working with peers was great. Good team environment. Managment was difficult to work with at times, and at other times they were great. Depends on who you get."
good,"Looking at my roles in new business, technology management, and programs management, the matrix organization structure of Raytheon can be challenging.  Very structured management."
good,"It is a company that is ethical, professional and has been doing a great job on being more diversified. It has come a long way in promoting woman, I had worked there 48 years and had seen a lot of changes over the years. I enjoyed the people, liked being involved in different things, (marketing) and learned a great deal from this company."
good,"Good company with great products.  Engineering driven with support functions paying a high price.  The environment can be very supportive.  Benefits are good, but currently the impact of many employees retiring has negatively impacted work/life balance."
good,"There was no real typical day at work.  I was responsible for the quality oversight of over 3000 Virtual Training Simulators located across the Continental US, so when I wasn't at Military Installations inspecting the simulators for operational condition, cleanliness, preventive maintenance practices, corrective actions, safety, etc., I was at a computer pulling data out of the MIS for reports to management and to identify problems through KPI's, or other reports that management would like to see about the simulators and performed ISO9001:2015/AS9100D audits for Mission Assurance.  I would say I learned more about ISO and AS standards/auditing at Raytheon than anything else as most of my other duties (described aboved), I brought the knowledge with me.  Most of the managers were very personable and easy to work with, though like most places, there were a few that rocked the boat.  Raytheon is a very process oriented and diversified company, and most everyone was easy to get along with.  Hardest part of job was basically given the task to provide quality oversight of the simulators and then left on my own for the first five plus years and then trying to instruct my supervisors on what the job incorporated for the last two plus years.  Travel was probably the most enjoyable aspect of working at Raytheon even though working with the people at Raytheon was a close second."
good,"Raytheon is very good to employees, offering very competitive benefits packages that get better over time.  Many people that work here have been with the company for 20,30,40+ years.  If you're a young go-getter who wants a fast-paced environment it may not be the company for you.  However, if you want a long-term home it's a great place to work."
good,"As I work on a contract basis no two days are the same.   I am contracted to one account therefore cannot really comment on Raytheon's workplace culture.    "
good,"Great company to work at, however as time went on the number of high level managers increased most of whom were retired military.  Lots of layers of high level managers with deputy managers and just not enough people to do the work.   Financial packages became redundant and too lengthy with most of the high level mangers lacking an understanding of many of the charts."
good,"People are great"
good,"One thing I remember most is that Raytheon really cares about its Veterans and it's people. We always had some sort of event going on for moral.  Especially Veteran's day.  They would do a Full Ceremony with color guard, flags, cake, food, ...etc."
good,Working to interface multiple simulations for Army combat modeling in a variety of locations.  Excellent Team with much cross fertilization. Always interested in accomplishing the job with above average results and built a good rapport within the team and with the various customers.
good,"company wide re-organization and with it came layoffs for nearly 150 people at the Indianapolis site, I was among those laid off. It was a company I had hoped to retire from but unfortunately it did not happen as I had hoped."
good,"Work at a fast paced. Never boring. Coworkers are great. Work an excessive amount of hours, not always compensated for. Management for most part is great. Needs improvement on one on one training."
good,Everything about this company depends on which program or project one is assigned to.  Some programs are great with interesting technology and good balance.  Other programs are nightmares with poor managers.
good,Learned about defense environment and strategy in my first position out of college. Learned about basics of manufacturing and quality in this position.
good,"A typical day consists of checking emails.  Working on list of defects to investigate and repair. I have learned a great deal about SAP products, time management and communication. Work place is fairly relaxed. Management is very distant and currently not located in same location. Hardest part of the job is keeping track of all the little steps and unique oddities of working on the defects, Most enjoyable part of the job is sifting through the data and tracking the issue to the source."
good,"I had very flexible hours as a contractor.  I worked very long hours some days and took other days off.  I enjoyed the people and the work.  I learned a lot about software testing and worked on some very complicated systems."
good,"Raytheon was a good place to work, offering much in terms of engineering knowledge to those who desired to become good engineers. There were several large programs, and the majority of engineering skills that I know today, I learned at Raytheon."
good,A lot slower paced than my previous jobs. Management seemed a bit unorganized. I took over multiple duties that were being neglected by full time employees. Production was based around quality rather than quantity though there were deadlines. Very clean work environment.
good,I got out of the military and Raytheon was the first to hire me and until today I am thankful to them for giving me the chance to find a job and settle down.
good,"The work that I participated on the line was fast-paced. As long as we had the parts in house, we were able to complete our part of the assembly and move it on down the line. We were shown new ways of getting our jobs done faster. Management helped when problems arose. Working with others that had different points of view taught me new values. The hardest part of the job was the physicality of working lots of overtime. The most enjoyable part was the good friends that I made and was able to work with."
good,"The job was fun, but having to work long hours and low pay along with having to be available 24/7 was too much. Long days and weekends. The responsibility was not equal to pay"
good,"Many diverse opportunities are offered in many locations worldwide. It really depends upon what you do, where you are and who you work with, just how positive the experience is."
good,Had significant success at Raytheon. Found their engineers to be quite skilled and professional. Management did not have the same qualities that I had hoped. The environment caused competition between managers instead of cooperation.
good,"The people are great to work with, the work/life balance can be difficult to maintain at times.  Sometimes there are too many levels of management between decision levels which can delay getting responses."
good,"Management is ok, but there is a very noticeable divide between salary employees and hourly employees.  Union is ok, I haven't noticed much out of them."
good,Great people to work with each day. Management was really easy to talk to and work with. Benefits were not the best but the extra days off were awesome!
good,Raytheon took good care of me.  Well compensated for the work.  Environment was extremely supportive.  Advancement opportunities were always being presented.  Ethics and Business Rules stressed.
good,In general this is a good company with excellent salary comparing with others companies like Raytheon. The culture for a software engineer is not the best but is good.
good,Good technical work.  Good work/life balance.  Pleasant people to work with.  Chances for advancement with hard work.  Good products and strong sales record.
good,"Raytheon is a great company to work for.  However, in saying that, like any business, Raytheon has it's good things and its bad things.  I have been working at Raytheon for 9 years and I have learned a great deal in the supply chain/Logistics Asset Management area."
good,"Productive and fast growing. My typical work day involves supporting over 450 onsite and offsite users, based on trouble shooting calls and a Track-IT ticketing systems."
good,"Great place for engineers to work. The quality level of employees is very high. Most team members are highly motivated and dedicated to the job. It's been a pleasure to work with the team members at Raytheon. Raytheon also provides a lot of training, for those that are interested in building their skill sets. On the negative side, the work/life balance is skewed to the work side. The management is occasionally good, and is occasionally bad, which is probably similar to most other organizations of this size. There are many options for job growth, but, once you reach a certain level (say 8 - 10 years of experience), it becomes very difficult to move up further."
good,"Raytheon's long term strategy and vision has created stability for the company within the defense industry.  It is a friendly, team oriented culture and offers competitive benefits.   Company encourages innovation, process improvement through six sigma and employee empowerment.  Company has gone through several changes and reorganizations to remain relevant which has caused some turnover and attrition."
good,Work/life balance is great. You are not expected to work more than 40 hours a week. Benefits are decent. My main complaint is the absurd number of management layers.
good,"Good company to work for. Employees are valued, mostly team players.  Rewarding work supporting the War fighter.  Good pay and benefits package.  Good experience."
good,"Great work environment. Management could use some training. Hard place to keep contracts. layoffs very often. Good benefits, college reimbursement,   401k, medical and dental."
good,Most of my typical day was looking for ways to address requests for information. I have a set data pool and would slice it depending on the audience and generate support presentations up and down the leadership chain.
good,"Highly dedicated, diligent engineers work around the clock to deliver the best equipment to our customer."
good,"Good company, good focus on Engineering and IT.  Reasonable benefits.  Variety of contracts and contract work.  Good people are everywhere."
good,"I was employed, and held several different positions.  Learned many skill sets.  "
good,work life balance great working the 9/80 program .Compensation and benefits was very good.  Opportunities to receive monetary Achievement Awards were ok( Administrative Assistance not often recognized for these awards). Learned to very flexible. Often had to change last minute meetings and schedule to accommodate customers needs.
good,"The people at Solipsys in particular were some of the most warm and relaxed people, as well as intelligent ive met. The average age of employees there is probably 30-40 years old and always willing to talk to you about work or just life. "
good,"Good company to work for. Many opportunities with young people with college degrees. "
good,"Raytheon has very challenging and fulfilling work if you manage to be placed into the right team."
good,"Manufacturing facility, so expect to come into work and have your designated responsibilities.  Typical day is 70 percent solving manufacturing issues and 30 process improvement."
good,"Great company, lots of areas and choices to work in.  Continuous computer aided training.  Top products and proud to do a job that supports the war fighter."
good,Most of my career with this company was dedicated to new industrial plant check out and startup projects. This required a great deal of travel away from home. There were times when this made home life difficult. I learned a great deal about the different types of plant systems and their interaction with each other.
good,"Things here are slow and steady. It can be challenging, but things are typically not rushed in the defense industry here. While that might be a good thing, at times there can be too much red tape. "
good,Overall a good place to work.  Rewarding work on products that support and protect the warfighter.Large company that has the typical pros and cons of a large company.
good,"Ability to produce one of a kind test equipment that was specific to a particular microelectronic hybrid device. Nice to work on pacemakers, pacesetters, heart pumps, implantable defibrillators, as well as a wide variety of missile and radar systems."
good,"Raytheon provides a balanced work place, devoted to high ethical standards and values. Every day is a challenge but is rewarding in that I know I am working on something that helps bring the warfighter home safely."
good,"It was a new experince , learn new knowlege, About the Patriot system, managment change to often, is overseas assigment learn different culture"
good,"Raytheon is one of the top providers of defense and space products.  As a Sr. Manager, I enjoy the opportunity to participate in the company's growth in a global market."
good,To long of a drive to complete required work. I would work for them again if the situation arises. Can think of anything else I can say about this company.
good,"A typical day at work - Project management (planning, budgeting, scheduling, meeting, proposing, traveling...). Worked with great managers and associates. The hardest part was lack of job security due to lack of contracts. No contract no job."
good,"Close to home, great benefits, good co-workers, family environment, profit sharing, company produces great products for the military"
good,"Overall, a decent company to work for.  The culture of the company has been on a decline with the recent mergers and so forth."
good,"I have worked for Raytheon for several years in the past. They are a large, recognized DoD contract company that provides many opportunities world wide."
good,"Recently a typical day at work for me usually involves billing different types of invoices such as Time and Material, Fixed Priced and Cost Plus. Performed account reconcilations and analysis of unbilled receivables and revenue."
good,"Not able to discuss specifics."
good,"During my first eight years with the company were the best. All the workers worked together passing on knowledge from one worker to the other to complete the job.  As time went on each employee was pressured to do more work.  Employees did not pass knowledge from on person to another as in the beginning. "
good,Performed maintenance on military tactical equipment for external customers; Enjoyed the work but uncertain of continued employment upon contract completion
good,"The company was great to work for, they offer benefits as well as great pay.The only downside of the company is they will downsize the company when funds aren't there and may cause you to lose employment."
good,"Very Good Company."
good,"At Raytheon, I maintained a mixture of Windows, Linux, and Solaris systems.  I learned a lot about shell scripting here to automate mundane and repetitive tasks such as log collection on the *NIX systems.  I also progressed in my knowledge of Windows Active Directory in terms of custom Group Policies.  My co-workers and I always got along and tended to work as a team, sharing information and suggestions for the best way to accomplish a task."
good,I think being a younger generation at a place such as Raytheon is looked down upon. There is a huge age gap there and it weighs in on day to day work.
good,Worked for tech publications as a Technical Illustrator for parts manuals. Worked as a Sr. Publications Illustrator for Proposals where I was the lead illustrator for multi-million dollar projects.
good,"Good person, quick learner, can to attitude, smart and innovative."
good,"Raytheon hires great talent.  The general population is dependable, highly-trained, and well-educated. There are opportunities to have a great work-life balance and the benefits are acceptable."
good,Work at raytheon was easy and consistant. Many days consisited of just being required to be there and no physical labor. I enjoyed a majority of the job and looked forward to even cutting grass being the hardest part of the job
good,"I was accountable for man hours,all parts cost and running daily reports.How to be responsible to send off all report information to corporate. Management and I had to get along,we shared the same office.But we really supported each other.Co-worker were great! I enjoy a variety of people.Learning the job was very stressfull.the Boss didnt even know it.The young man that trained me  was there for 5 days.So I had to learn fast.That was a little trying.The most enjoyable part was when i finally mastered the job."
good,"Good company"
good,"I was employed there for 10 years. It was comfortable but rarely felt challenged and was growing dull in my skillset. There is alot of automation and most Technicians are not very skilled. There is a lack of continual challenging & learning of equipment, circuits, technologies, etc."
good,"We had a mixed Unix and Microsoft environment.  The work was done in the Unix environment, which is more versatile and more fun.  Microsoft environment was used as a front end and for email, etc."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of performing a Daily Report:"
good,"As a Business Analyst Mondays will always consistently be the busy day of the week."
good,Raytheon is a great company to work for in that it does promote achieving individuals.
good,"I learned a lot about recruiting for a government contracting organization.  OFCCP, Compliance, etc."
good,"I create software test plans, procedures, and reports for a variety of Government Agencies, e.g. DoD and DHS. The hardest part of my position there was writing tests for requirements that were constantly under revision. I enjoyed the challenge of learning about different projects and domains."
good,"Good Place to work , liked the People and they had special events for the people while employed.  They allowed you to perform your job , giving you the benefit of trust."
good,"Working here is wonderful since it has to do with the Space Program. Everything I learn here is great for me to have experience in SAP as well as learn a great deal of additional knowledge in Microsoft Excel. I have learned that Excel is a very powerful tool that is used quite frequently to report many different things. An even more powerful tool is SAP. I have a bit of introduction to SAP here at this company and learn about service entries and how to export reports to Excel to manipulate into pivot tables. "
good,"Never a dull moment at work for me - everyday is filled with different challenges and opportunities to stretch. I've learned how to manage my days by remaining flexible and mainitaining a positive attitude. Management has been the best I've had in a long time. I flow from administrative specialist to training scheduler, and ready to dive into a hospitality mode at any given moment. All of this makes it for a fun filled day. Support our trainers in any way needed, as well as our customer. I've learned how to use Project Management as an excellent tool for scheduling our training, and have enjoyed working and supporting our community by sponsoring different events."
good,"Productive"
good,"The day consists of assisting Marine MEF's in tracking and receiving IIP's for their units, RIPS, and SMU's. Ensuring accountability and all documentation pertaining to the IIP's are correct and accurate. Constant validating of projects to determine shortfalls and assisting with OEM direct shipments. Constant communcation with government entities to complete daily functions."
good,"Review work to be performed, check inventory for future work.  Start working.  I assembled crates for international shipping. I learned that these crates included inner assemblies that needed careful attention to the details.  This was a small shop and I often worked by myself with occasional help from the owner and/or his son, good helpful people that were task oriented, in a good way  The hardest part of the job was maintaining tolerances as sometimes I fabricated many pre assemblies at a time - jigs and saws would wander off their settings.  The most enjoyable part of the job was delivering the completed product to the client.  They praised the quality of the work, as evidently other suppliers quality was not so good."
good,Many management levels hinder productivity. Overall co-worker collaboration tremendous and work assignments were challenging and rewarding
good,I truly enjoyed working for Raytheon. The dvision I worked in moved to Texas.
good,Workplace was comfortable.  Co-workers wer mostly great.  Steady stream of work and was mobile.
good,"I have a strong history of customer interaction providing excellent service with both computer operations and technical assembly actions.  A lot of the time, the facilitator has favorites. And the favorites do not have to work like the rest of the team. But still get the same or better raises as the ones that work hard to get the job done."
good,Lots of opportunities for advancement.  Excellent training and educational opportunities.  
good,"If you like working with brilliant minds, this is the place for you. Each day provides engaging conversation and one is always learning and stretching their capabilities."
good,Management was inexperienced at the division I was at and overall business suffered.
good,"Great place to start career. You learn a lot, but needs to work on growth potential."
good,"This job was an engineering internship at Raytheon Aircraft now called Beach Hawker in Wichita, Kansas. The job was great except the outlook for the company was poor and I was a temporary employee. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the the experimental aircraft which were seeking FAA certification. I worked with composite materials and the new Viper fiber placement process."
good,"A typical day at Raytheon requires you to show up around 8am in the morning. Depending on what division you are in (operations, engineering etc.) you will have an excellent opportunity to learn about that field from multiple experts. Co-workers are usually great people, all wanting to get through the day with success."
good,Working at the Memphis Enroute Air Traffic Control Center at Memphis did not provide me with frequent interaction with Raytheon corporate.
good,"Typical day was long, sometimes 12 or 13 hours, but that was a personal choice. Co-workers were enjoyable to work with. Staff was challenging as most had no technical or construction background. The hardest part of the job was finding time to accomplish what was felt needed to be done, hence the 12 - 13 hour day."
good,For the most part most days were different with a large variety of tasks. I never knew from day to day what to expect as far as work assignments which kept the job interesting. My managers and co-workers were enjoyable to work with and were eager to help each other out.
good,"If you want to just come into work and do a job while getting a slightly better than low-average salary this is a great place. There is nothing wrong with that either, many people want to just enjoy their work and receive fair compensation."
good,It is a good company to work for the best people with great chances for advancement
good,"The Ft. Wayne office provided a low-stress work environment that I didn't fully appreciate until getting into more a more intense corporate realm. Perhaps other locations were more intense, but Indiana wasn't. The big question is whether or not you want to work in national defense. If so, Raytheon is great. If not, go elsewhere."
good,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,I was only with the firm 4 months when the client terminated funding following which I was laid off. Support following the lay off was weak and extremely non-compassionate given I relocated my family for the position.
good,"Raytheon is built on global partnerships. In nearly 80 countries around the world, we work with customers, suppliers and local industries to deliver solutions that help governments preserve their sovereignty and defend their national security."
good,"What a great step up after a career in retail. This position gave me the freedom to work independently while still supporting me if I had questions. After I had mastered my own work, I had the freedom to find more work to do to expand my skill set."
good,Experience was great learning opportunity  was excellent leadership was for the most  part a rewarding experience. Hours were great but you had to do overtime if necessary.
good,"I was hired for a four month contract and ended being there three and a half years.  I learned a lot and it's a vibrant place.  "
good,"They love their engineers here! It doesn't matter what kind of leadership experience you bring to the table, if you're an engineer and want to be management, you'll get it. At least where i'm working at. Everyone in a leadership position is a former engineer. I feel looked down on an awful lot for not being an engineer. "
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work, travel and have an opportunity to work beyond being deployed. Typical work days are 12 hour days and pretty much dealing with everyday job activities from Maintenance to Operations. Workplace environment was pretty relaxed and you are more than welcome to add your input."
good,Raytheon offers opportunities for employees to work on very challenging and tactical projects that are very high consequential assignments. I feel my work matters in keeping our word a safe place.
good,"Great company with lots of interesting work and ability to change locations and jobs.  Certain larger locations will have better opportunity for advancement than the smaller ones, and sometimes no funded training is provided."
good,"Interesting work involving cutting edge technologies. Many opportunities for advancement, international travel/work, education. Best part of the job was the people."
good,"Demanding but fair.  Sometimes there were unrealistic expectations, but strong communication with management provided opportunities for additional support."
good,I'll come in monday-friday 6am until 2pm and clean machines. Make sure the we stay stocked up wit coolant so I had to keep up wit how much coolant was being use through out the week. I also had to operate the forklift to dump Hooper's.
good,"I have loved my experience at Raytheon AST. The people the mission the technology the freedom all make it one of my best job experiences ever. You will work hard, you will be challenged but in the end you will have one the best professional experiences of your career."
good,"In the short term that I have been at Raytheon, I have enjoyed it. However, it definitely is a place where you either have to decide you are going to make a career or you use it as a stepping stone for better opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Raytheon.  I really have nothing bad to say.  I just relocated to a different state... that was the reason i left."
good,"SIGOV aka Raytheon was a great company to work for.  Unfortunately some of the demands were over the top and not attainable by one single person.  I enjoyed my stint there and was blessed with many colleagues I can now call friends.  After my departure, three people were hired to take over my job responsibilities.   I would recommend this company to anyone in cyber security."
good,"There are many different options and directions to choose from as jobs go. You make it with what you choose. Be prepared to have patience and work hard. Honesty, attitude, reliability and being able to multitask can give you a good push in the right direction,"
good,job assignments are not shared.  At times it was difficult to get answers to performed your job correctly.  The people I worked with were very supportive.
good,"Good work habits are rewarded.  Good teamwork and attitudes are rewarded.  So,  the working atmosphere is pleasant.  "
good,I do enjoy working with Raytheon because management has worked with me and given me access to a flex schedule which allows me to attend school without any issues.
good,"Typical day includes mainly desk work, meetings, and working with operations on production.  PDM is the main program used to document and implement changes on contracts."
good,"Raytheon is a good company to work for, including being a member of the union with its job security. Pay increase has been ample and more than fair. Would recommend."
good,"Great company, good people, diverse environment. Being apart of Raytheon was a good decision, I love my job good management, you will be challenged if you become apart of this great company. Growth is hard at first but in the end its worth it."
good,"I worked at Raytheon full-time (More than 5 years). Great people and Mgt.Overall,  - for me - it was the best ""first job""  I could hope for.   A lot of the skills I learned from Raytheon I still use today."
good,Overall Raytheon is a typical company.  It was a company that cared for its employees in the beginning and now is only profit driven.  And that is why I got laid off during a 25% reduction
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Raytheon, and I learned a lot. It was like working with family, that you actually enjoy being around. So I was lucky to be part of a great team."
good,"Raytheon, Is a good company to work for, they have good working environment. The jobs have good technical content and are enjoyable. The range of jobs are good and they have a good employee engagement program for progressing your career"
good,The company seemed to be deeply interested and invested in employees' advancement.  Flexible work environment - ability to work from home frequently enough.  The culture/bureaucracy was a mixed experience but overall I liked working there and I appreciate the training and management experience I received as well.
good,"Raytheon is a sharp, fast-moving company which provides a challenging but rewarding work experience. Working on multiple projects simultaneously is the norm."
good,"Employees are encouraged to own the results of their work.  Some managers are fantastic, others are still stuck in aging management techniques of bullying results."
good,"The culture is informal, friendly atmosphere. Training is available on-line to better your position.  Management is always available to answers any questions you may have. Benefits are better than most companies in the industry."
good,"Prepare nightly deposit of student loan payments to the FDIC in Dallas, Texas. Organize the preparation of opening mail, sorting and counting the checks, money orders, and cashier's checks for the OCR reader and box up the daily batch for deposit."
good,"I used this company as a building block into my field of work, very accommodating company, as long as your work stayed in the guidelines of the contract no one would bother you"
good,Very high paced and sometimes stressful environment but there's a lot you learn that will help you further along in your career whether you stay at Raytheon or leave.  9/80 schedule is nice
good,"I love my current job, but I would like to have that perfect job.  Currently, I have to do many things without direction, because of accepting challenges of the status quo is difficult for management is difficult in the defense industry"
good,"I worked with a lot great people. Very flexible work schedule. The company definitely supports work life balance. However, I felt like I was underpaid for the amount of work I was given. Lots of employees got away with doing nothing."
good,"No issues with management or the people, a personal reason of wanting to get closer to the Westside of the US. There are a lot of guys counting down the days to retirement that let it be known."
good,"I keep attendance for Shipping and Trucking departments, gathering hours for Payroll Dept.  I kept all confidential employee records.I did enjoy my work for the most part but was caught up in a general lay off after almost 3 years of employment."
good,"Pros:"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the day to day exchange with folks.  Management is not as enjoyable to interface."
good,"Contractor for a few years, didn't see any opportunities to go full-time.  No Benefits allowed and I was an in-house temp"
good,"There is a lot of opportunity and ability to move around within the company to do something you enjoy. There is the ability to easily move up in the company, but requires doing less interesting jobs."
good,"We were up early and took a van from the provided housing through the streets of Kabul to the military base.  I either researched the internet and interviewed people on the base for information for my presentations or was presenting to NATO personnel during orientation.  I learned a lot about what life is like for the average Afghan and about current military life for personnel in a combat situation.  Because it was unsafe, opportunities to actually go out and see the culture firsthand were very limited, but I took advantage of any chance to do so.  People that I interacted with on a daily basis were sometimes killed because their lives were spent completely outside the safe zones.  Every day was filled with new learning experiences and I loved that!"
good,I have worked for the company for over ten years now and really enjoy it. The company is very flexible which is great if you have small children. They allow us to flex our time no matter what department you work in. Just be consistent and don't take advantage of the system.
good,"There were many flaws about the company overall, including things like speaking on diversity and the importance of it in the work place, but I never actually felt that in my experience. It is very much a white male dominated company, and that is clearly seen in management roles as well. However, the work-life balance is great. PTO is generous and I never brought work home with me. Anytime I worked over 40 hours I was compensated."
good,Raytheon is a great company to work for and the build a network. The culture may be different depending on the location which is expected for such a large company.
good,"I was a college hire in the Raytheon corporate IT department. the culture in this department is very slow and boring.  It seems as though people don't care if anything gets done, because nobody is accountable and nobody ever gets fired.  "
good,The typical day at work was filled with high expectations. The thrill of examining daily work schedules and job reviews was the most enjoyable parts of the job. The hardest part of the job was wondering if you're going to get laid off this week
good,Nice jog to get experience.  Promotions are given out when you deserve them.  The pay is great.  The managers only giver preference to certain types of people.
good,Great place to work and wonderful for career advancement.  I started making 24k and ended up advancing making over 100k.  Great work and also held a top secret SCI security clearance.
good,Raytheon was the sub-contractor on the Logistics contract.  Mostly supportive employer but due to the uniqueness of the support needed not much iteration was given to us from the management
good,"My experience is limited to a small area. There are many things to like about Raytheon, but despite wanting to become more diverse and to move more women into management, it is still very male-dominated."
good,"Here you are allowed to perform your required work load with minimal supervision. Assignments and monthly work requirements are assigned, then daily schedule is your responsibility. A good group environment with lots of variety around location and travel to sites."
good,Good Company. Good place for a career. Good salary. Some education costs are paid for. Worldwide company with good standing in the community. One of the better companies to work for.
good,The people were great and management was great. Hours were flexible and accommodating. Overall nice place to work. I liked the balance of work and life.
good,Competition for advancement was tough and there was a lot of back biting to get advanced.  Working at Raytheon was stressful at times.   Management allowed for flexible work hours as long as at least 8 hour days were worked
good,"It was a good place to work, the pay was good, the work environment "
good,I got job thru a temp agency. Enjoyed the position for the short time I had it. Was not a stressful job. Relaxing environment and coworkers were friendly and helpful.
good,Raytheon is a good company to work for.  The work is steady and interesting.  Management was good and looked after their employees.  A great place to start and/or step up to the next level.
good,"I worked for Raytheon in Antarctica, and in the Marshall Islands. The job gave me experience with large contract responsibilities, and interfacing with a government customer. Ethical and responsible activites were the cornerstone. These jobs gave me the opportunity to see remote and wonderful parts of the globe."
good,"Great place to learn and evolve "
good,"Enjoyed my position there. Flexible work., moderate pay, advancement opportunities."
good,They don't Push workers for production numbers because of a much greater focus on quality. They train employees better than anywhere else I have worked. Their is a lot of room for career advancement.
good,Raytheon was a good employer to work for.  They provided a lot of training for manager and staff and treated their employees well.  They gave incentive and service awards and showed appreciation to all of their employees for a job well done or overall project successes.
good,"One of the most organized and well planed out companies I have had experience with.  Goals were set and the teams were set on task to meet milestones.  Successes were rewarded, and lessons were learned from failures.  The culture of the Midwest was felt in every person working there."
good,"Good place to work. It's challenging and the coworkers are great. Their smart, dedicated and truly behind their product and support for the United States military."
good,"Decent place to work. Management needs a revamp, but other than that... it's ok this is just some extra characters so I can continue to post my resume up on the site."
good,Great benefits and environment with advancement opportunity.  Hardest part was working for several managers of completely different departments.  Conflicts happened all the time so if not able to resolve then had to get main manager to make decision based on importance of requests from other departments for workload that needed to be done. Left company due to a moving to another state.
good,I worked for the PATRIOT missile department which provided missile and missile parts to the US Military.  It was more like a military environment.  I first worked in the purchase order department then moved into the procurement department.
good,"This is my 1st job at american corporate company. I learned a great deal of Corporate IT environment settings, from making data cable to  setting up the data switch, file server and network printers. It's fun to work here."
good,"I would characterize Raytheon Space & Airborne Systems Co. as a typical aerospace engineering and manufacturing organization. I worked with unions, EAST Local 1553 and the IBEW Local 2295. I endeavored to employ a collaborative problem-solving approach to labor relations. I retired in August 2016 due to a reorganization in HR in which the 6 HR generalist positions  who reported to me on a dotted line basis and participated in Steps 1 and 2 of the grievance procedure were removed from any labor relations support activities. The result of this change rendered me as the sole exempt resource for all labor relations programs/processes. This was my primary basis for retiring from Raytheon."
good,Good teamwork atmosphere with plenty of help from co-workers and supervisor in areas new to me.  The work environment was usually running at a medium to fast pace with everyone pitching in.
good,"job is fast paced and very difficult, management really does support you when things become difficult as long as you are putting the work in and keep them informed weekly."
good,"Working here was very laid back as long as you met your deadlines. No added stress, except for the length of your contract with them. I would recommend this to someone for a place of employment."
good,Spent all my time with Raytheon Missile Systems. Exposed to several programs.   For the most part my management helped me to find exciting work. The company did an ample job of creating an inclusive culture in the lower ranks anyways.  You were rewarded based on performance.   I wish the mentoring and training program for young engineers would have more straightforward.
good,Great first job out of college.  I learned a lot about relational databases and the work environment was very enjoyable.
good,"Took the job, even though I live 75 miles north of Lawton."
good,Stimulating and at times stressful. Had to work cross functionally with various teams in order to get hardware moving at all times.
good,"The contracts are exciting. The equipment and items you are working on are high valued items. For the most part part people are friendly within the environment. Do not focus or worry about the people who sleep on the job or don't have any work ethic. Those people know somebody and won't ever get in trouble. Leave them alone, and don't try to get them to work. It won't happen. On the upside, having Raytheon and the duties you've performed look great on a resume."
good,Raytheon is a great company to work for and it showed me the world of Systems Engineering which I enjoy very much. A typical work day is 9 hours with flex time. I have learned a lot about the integration of system of systems and data analysis. My co workers are great and working as a team is easy.
good,"A great place to work."
good,Lots of work to be done. Management is pretty good and has your back. People are willing to work hard and are generally good team players.
good,"Great camraderie, too much away from my family. Good co-workers, very helpful supervisors.  Great healthcare benifits, no promotion possibilities/contract work."
good,Products provide a very unique production environment that allows one to engage and feel accomplished.  The technology at Raytheon offers the ability to enhance your skill set and create a sense of pride when accomplished
good,"My jobs responsibilities varies every day, I'm in charge of all the printing, and I also service the hallway copiers, and  take care of the mail and overnight packages. I am also responsible for printing our proposals."
good,Highs and lows.  Typical defense contractor.  Can get stale after a while.  Stability based on defense budget.  Lots of available locations.  Lots of products.
good,Raytheon believed strongly in compensating employees for going above and beyond his/her scope of duties. I believe this makes employees work harder and appreciate their employers more. The hardest part of this job was sending contractors to the Middle East - I worried for their safety.
good,A lot of contract work is done here.  Best instructional designer jobs in metro Detroit.  They really focused on training done right.  Very innovative.   Often there is not enough work in the pipeline.
good,"Performed all duties associated with repair, rework, inspection, quality control, assembly in manufacturing environment and testing outgoing products."
good,"Great job to get into if you like big business (70,000 employees)"
good,This company offers many opportunities to gain experience and develop your skills.  Tons of different job positions available across many areas of interest.
good,"Was grateful to find work once my husband got stationed in Hohenfels, Germany (very small military installation). It's very difficult for spouses to find work when stationed in another country. They were very nice and I learned a lot of leadership skills from Raytheon."
good,"While working there I was very content, but Raytheon being a union run company didn't allowed an hourly worker to be involved outside the job description. The hardest part of the job was knowing you'd be laid off."
good,I thoroughly enjoy what I do.  I work and assist men and women in uniform with the logistics of shipping and receiving training equipment on a daily bases.  I never had a chance to serve my country and I feel that the work that I do is fulfillment enough.
good,"The people are great, the work/life is great. I have worked here for nearly 10 years. Not much room for advancement. Company doesn't seem real interested in growing it's people. Overall, it's a stable company and a pleasant place to work."
good,I worked for them for several year . It was my first job after the Navy . I worked as an aircraft mech. I enjoyed my time with the company very much ad highly recommend this company .
good,Computer aided design and hand drawing. Learned to use the Unix operating system. Fun and awesome place to for. Co-workers were very helpful and fun.
good,The position I hold with this company is a contract position but overall it was a great experience and one I would repeat if given the opportunity.  I made a lot of friends and professional references who I feel I can reach out to in the future.
good,"Good innovation place to work for."
good,great co-workers and a good culture to work in. The long hours is the hardest part of the job. Management cares about its employees
good,A everyday work a Raytheon were fun of surprising events that help me to learn and develop myself as a individual and as employee.
good,"A typical day at work was rewarding."
good,"Good work environment, excellent cafe, extensive variety of jobs are available to choose from to advance career opportunities in company"
good,A serious but compassionate group of scientist. Highly intelligent and confident in their work. Strive to bring out the best in me.
good,Good company but weak medical/ dental benefits. Company offers more to their corporate employees than to company contracted employees. Over all a good company.
good,"As usual with a big company, you dont hear from any higher ups unless something is going on."
good,"Overall, Raytheon is a great company to work for.  It solves challenging problems and has fantastic employees."
good,Come in each morning and printed off the work that came in over night. Management is not the ones to look over your shoulder. You learned your job and management expected you to do it without supervision. My co-workers were the best. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers when they needed help.
good,"-Prepare for next mission"
good,Interesting work. Job security a bit worrisome. Profit sharing was nice. Yearly salary increases okay. Good co-workers.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo genial, donde los jefes te hacen sentir parte del team."
good,"In the work space its nice but need more for the time you are in"
good,"Excellent place to work. My management was excellent, effective and well meaning. Raytheon management left a bit to be desired."
good,"Typical day was pretty monotonous but I found most managers were pretty good about not being micro-managers.  We were trusted to get the job done.  I learned that you need to network.  Management was solid but had a hard time with recognizing good work and effort.  "
good,Working at Raytheon has always been a very interesting place to work.  It is a constantly changing environment with great training programs and opportunities to grow an learn you profession.
good,"I would control access to plant site"
good,The Job was well paying and the work was a challenge being the only expert available was interesting.  The contract part was  the least fun because after 8 months you were unemployed again.
good,"standard help desk, time divided between security, support of 200+ pieces of software and hard ware issues"
good,"The day usually begins around 7:00 A.M. and ends around 5:30 P.M.  I've learned a lot of technical skills but I'm no ""techno geek.""  My management has consisted of senior engineers who are over worked (their Blackberries are always ON.)  My current co-workers are fabulous; we truly make a great time.  That is, after all, what it's all about, TEAM WORK.  Hardest part:  the long days.  We work 9-hours days, with every other Friday off.  However, those 9 hour, more often than not, turn into 10 or 11 hours.  The best part:  the acknowledgement I get for a job well done, and the enduring friendships I have made in the last 15years."
good,Very good company to work for and the people are very nice that come there to pick up there equipment from the bid sales that they have won other than that I don't have much to say.
good,On an average day things can move pretty fast.  The people who work there are all brilliant and educated.  Great place to work.
good,"If you have a degree in engineering, this is a good place with room for advancement."
good,"A good place to work, interesting programs and people. Rewarding knowing the warfighter will gain huge benefits from deployed asset being development today."
good,People had a good life/work balance. Learned a lot from smart engineers. Learned how to use Rational DOORs database and Excel.
good,"Come in do my job and leave"
good,"A typical day can start with creating a PowerPoint slide and end analyzing 20 million rows of auto part application attributes or editing a video presentation for a national meeting. No 2 days are alike and that is what keeps it interesting. I enjoy my job very much but the 50 mile drive to work takes a toll both mentally and financially."
good,"Working at outdoor antenna test facility. Learned fluid cooling system for radar antennas. Testing radar systems on test range and around town in McKinney. Co-workers were excellent and we all worked very well together. Built test setups from scratch, Built and fired rockets at the antennas for simulations of enemy attacks with RPGs. Also was responsible for the indoor antenna test facility and was laboratory manager for the system integration lab. Set up all test facilities for this. Repaired anything that would not function correctly. Set up testing on towers. The entire job was completely enjoyable. Best job that I ever had."
good,"Good management,variety of equipment,training ok,second shift work life.learned a lot."
good,If you can be hired direct this is am awesome place to work. Everyone is so willing to help you succeed and grow in you field. They have opportunities left and right to learn and improve you skills. I really like how the company takes care of their employees and family is important to them.
good,Raytheon is a great company to work for. They take good care of their personnel. I just wish the specific contract that I was working panned out.
good,"A typical day for me at Raytheon was very enjoyable and challenging. We were required to wear many hats and learn new skills. I developed surveys, created and managed databases, and managed a digital asset management system. The most enjoyable part of my job was planning and executing live webcasts. Cameras, audio equipment, lighting, and encoding equipment surrounded my cubicle. It was heaven to me. Because budgets were tight I had to integrate and figure out how to use surplus equipment the Video Department was throwing away. I learned how to make things work on a shoestring budget. Management focused on the big global market most of the time, so it was challenging at times for management to understand the daily challenges the team faced. Something common in global companies. Overall a very positive experience with management. My co-workers were very supportive and always took the time to teach me new skills, and allow me to teach them as well. The hardest part of the job was meeting customers requirements with old equipment. Also, not being able to experiment and develop new innovative ways to live stream company events. The most enjoyable part of the job was the many, many people I knew and worked with over the 13 years I was at the company. Many were legacy employees who had worked for the company 30+ years. That says a lot about a company when you've been with them for 3 decades or more."
good,Enjoyed all 10 years at RAST! Many challenges risen to ... many friends made ...
good,"Great group of people to work with."
good,Great company with benefits day to day routines are not for public knowledge for security purposes.
good,"Overall, Raytheon pays well and the benefits are hard to beat.  Raytheon does that to ensure they lock people in, but the culture can be hard to get into and progression has more to do with how long you've been around rather than how good at your job you are.  Some people will take jobs they are not really ""in to"" just to get in the door.  My experience has been, ensure you REALLY love the job you are going to be doing.  It will be about 2-3 years before you can move into something else.  Raytheon is a good company and has all the pluses and minuses of any large company, job security, good benefits, slow progression, many layers of management, etc.  If you are going into a job you know you will love then Raytheon will be a great experience.  If you are going into a job you are unsure about, then your experience might be a little tough for the first few years.  I hope this is helpful and good luck."
good,Be prepared to work on exciting cutting edge designs and cutting edge hardware.  You will be given great responsibilities but will also be held accountable!
good,"While working at Raytheon I learned a bit about working with networks.  Part of my duties included monitoring Applications and Processes as well as maintaining connections with proper IP addresses with external users.  "
good,"Provides a solid place to work, adequate training, and good management."
good,"I loved working for Raytheon, if I could be there now I would! Unfortunately they had lay overs due to headcount."
good,"A typical day on the GPS Program keeps you on your toes.  The dynamic Progran requires you to utilize critical thinking skills regulary.  Since the start of my career working the GPS Program at Raytheon I find myself learning something new everday.  My critical thinking skills are much more advanced than they were before.  Most of all I have learned how to correlate the different Financial Analsyt job aspects to the various responsibilities based on the audience and purpose behind the data being presented.  As an example, I have learned how EV is linked to budgeting and how both are linked to funding requirements.The management staff is very strong but at times struggles to communicate and relate to the rest of the staff.  The finance team that I work with on a regular basis, along with the Control Account Managers, Financial Planning Group and Management staff that I support are very supportive all work collaboratively to ensure all tasks are completed effeciently and timely."
good,Had some good co-workers and worked for some really great bosses.  Enjoyed the on-site fitness center.
good,"The work environment was relaxed and the people where great to work with,  I learned a lot and picked up a few good experiences while I worked there.   "
good,It has been an amazing experience working for Raytheon! Raytheon keeps their employees best interests in mind. On several occasions I have witnessed Raytheon eat dirt to prevent pay cuts.
good,"Repair and calibration, but mainly calibration. They taught me just about everything I know about calibration."
good,"Sometimes exciting, sometimes boring. Lots of bureaucracy, lots of government regulations to keep in mind. Work is sometimes monotonous.  Get a lot of visibility with upper management, but position isn't always well respected in finance. "
good,Learning new technology and room to grow in the company. Great place to work as a single contributor and/or as team member.
good,> Up at 4:00 AM
good,"Worked as Communications Security Responsible Officer responsible for cryptographic and classified materials for the eastern launch range. In addition, worked as a Secure Voice Responsible Officer responsible for keying operations as well as maintenance on Secure Voice devices. Wrote policy for COMSEC technicians. Provided training when and where necessary to insure compliance with Air Force directives."
good,"Setup lathe for 2 DPT tools, edit programs for part being ran, test"
good,Pros:
good,My experience with Raytheon australia was that it was a great team environment and there was support from both my team members and management staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving positive feedback from the customer on a job well done.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Raytheon, the mutual respect between management and employees, the opportunities for advancing to other areas of interest."
good,Typical aerospace corporation with employment that swings with the DoD budget and national economy. Aerospace competition has changed over the years and the way of doing business has changed.
good,Fast paced environment
good,R and D Department was excellent and work was enjoyable and challenging
good,"I started as a temp helping with inventory. A year later I was being sent to New Orleans to help build navy ships. I learned to turn coils, read cable tags, install and hook up ship boxes, and many other shipboard installation rules."
good,"My experience at RTCS was not in any way typical, as I worked for a company that they acquired before Raytheon acquired them, and worked remotely as part of the team from the original company."
good,"The government sector has been declining in recent years and the forecast is for more declines. Unfortunately, the company leadership does not want to expand its technical expertise into commercial areas. As such, the company's future growth potential is bleek. Opportunties for employees are also bleek."
good,"I was allowed to write very interesting code for the Cadillac infrared camera system. It was a great experience, in the setting of a very large company."
good,"Typical work day 9-10 hours of which were about half the time in meetings. There was alot of planning that was always implemented late. Deadlines were always met no matter what issues were causing delays. NO overtime, the work was not measured on how much time was spent but on what got done."
good,"Fascinating industry, high level of urgency as company seeks to align its offerings with defense priorities. This is reflected in a sometimes exaggerated degree of anxiety, as jobs and careers are often on the line."
good,"My personal was good overall, the company went through various organizational changes while I was there. But the last several years were good."
good,"overall raytheon is a very good company to work for, its just the management is terrible. not the higher up deputy manager or project manager. It's the immediate managers, they treat adults like kids, micro manage, and hold grudges toward their employees. and its so bad that its to the point sum of my co workers and myself really dont wanna come to work at time because its such a hostile work enviroment."
good,Productive and enjoyable days
good,Great company to work for but try to avoid the lay-offs. Locations all over the workld.
good,"Engineer peers are some of the best in the nation. Considerable diversity considering the Defense nature of the work. Get to work on advanced technologies that can not be found anywhere else. A business model of under-bidding to get new contracts can result in high stress environments with a lot of blame-avoidance characteristics, however it is possible to learn to ignore bad management behaviors and just enjoy doing the work. Highly flexible work hours, excellent work-life balance. Raises and promotions can be slow, must negotiate aggressively at entry to compensate for this."
good,"Typical work day consist of meetings, reviewing documents and codes. It's a lot of fun if making big ticket software is your thing. Great benefits and lots of opportunity to move around the company."
good,"machine shop,set-ups,lathes,mills,cutting steel,aluminum,stainless.Precision cutting at goverment .D.O.D.specs.Most enjoyable part of job was getting projects done that passed quality control,had over 95% rating"
good,This company provides ongoing training and career development.
good,Raytheon offers competitive salary and benefits. 9/80 is a huge benefit and provides a good work/life balance. The aerospace industry isn't very stable with the defense budget uncertainty.
good,Excellent defense contractor with a solid product line. Ability to be exposed to many technologies. you will be challenged on a daily basis.
good,"Benefits are good, pay is competative, advancement is available"
good,The infrastructure and resources are in place to help you thrive when opportunities become available.
good,Raytheon is a world class systems integrator for the United States Military. There is also the opportunity to work on international projects. The work is challanging and the people are outstanding. Schedules are aggressive. Pay scales are competitive with other large defense contractors. Benefit package is very good. Flexible work hours and 9/80 work weeks are a plus.
good,"The workplace culture progressively evolved over my time period. They valued their workforce and its expertise."
good,"My team was great to work within, productive and challenging. The company overall is good, with interest in long term projects with the Australian Defence Industry."
good,Raytheon is a great company to work for I enjoyed the experience of being employed by them and would welcome the opportunity to work with them again should the opportunity arise
good,Good company with average benefits. Every other Friday off was nice but it was sometimes interrupted. Management did seem to care about employees and salary was decent. I'd go back.
good,"Good place to work, has the same issues as most large companies in defense industry, but well run.  Would recommend it to people who want to work in the industry.  Good job security."
good,"The best part was that everybody works together to get the task completed for the good of the project. I enjoyed working with my helpful teammates."
good,Great benefits. Solid personal time (paid-time-off / flex schedule). Family-type culture; good people to work with. The company needs room for internal advancements
good,Thank you for this opportunity but I think I will pass. Raytheon is a good strong ethical company. I have enjoyed my many years with them. I have had to chance to work and learn from some of the best.
good,"Raytheon is a huge corporation and management varies across the board.  My demographic area was experiencing major personnel restructuring, so there was a degree of uncertainty about employment."
good,"Worked as a remote employee yet received excellent support on a daily basis as necessary.  Culture of professionals."
good,Really enjoyed my 3.5 years at Raytheon. The people are great and so are the products. Only negative was career advancement (i.e. promotions) are hard to get.
good,"I have worked at Raytheon for over forty five years. Started at $4 an hour, now earning $41.46 an hour. Raytheon has provided me and my family with a good life but can’t wait to retire."
good,"Good Place to work with intelligent people, support our nation and explore lateral movement from within.  Flexible work hours, opportunity for travel and work remotely."
good,I learned how to build equipment and work on things that were very interesting and complicating at the same time. Working on new things day in and day out made it fun and exciting. Training in house was convenient.
good,"Employees lost to competitors, combined with large influx of lesser skilled workers adds to stress and responsibility for senior employees who have not yet defected to competitors."
good,"Easy and fun place to work. The work can get monotonous, but your coworkers keep it fun. Most supervisors are great and easy to talk to. Ok pay, but it should be higher considering the work done there."
good,"Overall good company. Excellent to have a 9/80 schedule. Culture is very dependent of what campus you’re in, but I didn’t ever have a problem. I ultimately wanted a job that would challenge me more."
good,"Worked for this company in two different divisions. Even offered a contingent job offer to come back a third time. "
good,"Some projects are quite interesting and technically challenging, but it is also very possible to get stuck working on something not particularly engaging."
good,Government Procurement is very structured. There are a number of rules and regulations that must be followed. People who are methodical see value in structure. People who prefer to make decisions on the fly and not follow a plan would not be happy in an organization where they must follow rules and regulations.
good,"Very talented management, engineers and operators.  Dedicated to safety product quality and meeting customer expectations.  Great culture that values diversity."
good,"Each work day for the most part offered something new and challenging. The amount of time the company takes to share and instill their business values into their employees shows a testament in what Raytheon is about, where they came from, where they are looking to take the company and how you can become a part of it. The culture is dynamic and in a way requires the individual to be able to collaborate with employees on projects in order to complete the task at hand.  The company does offer and highly promote from within which in my opinion bolsters that mindset and mantra and creates a strong unity amongst peers. The demands to meet dead lines at times can be overwhelming due to many factors but this is why the company pays accordingly to top performers within the ranks."
good,Provides ample opportunities for those interested to participate and engage on assignments that promote leadership and management skills.  Instills a collaborative environment to build strong teams to work collectively as a unit in achieving program milestones.  Promotes strong software engineering practices and open to new processes and methodologies to improve productivity.
good,6am-2:30pm Monday through Friday. Overtime offered periodically. Lots to learn when I first started. Excellent benefits as well as job security. Room for advancement. Overall a rewarding place to work.
good,"- Top notch senior engineers"
good,"The defense industry is heavy laden with red tape and bureaucracy, but a career with Raytheon will be what you make it.  You have to be very proactive (and patient) to develop your skills here as there will tend to be very little training to get you up to speed.  There are many great projects to work on here.  Get a sense of where you want to go and you can make a path to get there."
good,"I was working in contract,I had a 12 month contract there,but I don't really have a comment.I just had a good experience.I got paid well enough to keep my home running and we made night vision cameras there."
good,"An interesting place to work with something always going on."
good,Raytheon is an excellent company to work for. The screening / background investigation takes a long time to complete. The employees are friendly and the work atmosphere is great.
good,"A very busy which I really enjoyed."
good,"Lots of travel."
good,"Good place to work. As years went by, it took a turn that limited my career opportunities. In looking to go further than they could do for me. All in all, a good experience."
good,Overall great company to work for.  It was a temporary position.  I was not aware of this when I was hired.  Other than that everything was great and interesting.
good,work in a warehouse pulling orders for shipping as well making sure that every movement of item was logged and the item was the corret one an maintaining paper work
good,Good place to work.  Good salary for the area.  Difficult to fill positions; experienced stressed manning.  Affords opportunity to advance.  Will pay for college classes.
good,"I have worked for many Defense companies, and I have been the happiest at Raytheon. The company tries to get continuous feedback from its employees and it seems to actually listen to them."
good,"Day to day I interact with users to fulfill various requests. from adding or removing equipment, adding or removing users from areas and other security related jobs functions. I've learned how to carry myself in a professional setting and improved my IA/IT knowledge greatly. The management is determined to help you grow and seek better opportunities as they like to promote within the company. The culture at Raytheon is to increase the diversity and inclusiveness of their employees. Difficulties in the workplace would include maintaining compliance with the NISPOM CH.8 and ensuring users are following security requirements. The enjoyable parts of the job are interacting with users and admins to resolve issues and creating a holistic work environment."
good,"Overall a great place to work, especially if you are straight out of college. Like how I was. You are able to get your foot in the door and build your career from it."
good,"Raytheon is a solid employer with a typical work environment for a large defense firm."
good,"Raytheon is a good place to work; they provide training, benefits, and a good salary. Sometimes advancement is difficult however and sometimes other things are difficult, but they are willing to offer support in many situations.  I have a lot of friends at Raytheon and they have been very supportive."
good,"Very good company to work for, but not right out of college. Cut your teeth at another company to fully appreciate all Raytheon has to offer because people believe it is a stressful environment, but if you have worked elsewhere first... it is a good environment."
good,Raytheon offers a dynamic work environment. Employees in E&P do work long hours and the business rhythm is fluid; however the pay and benefits are amazing.
good,"This was a solid company to work for. Good benefits, good pay, plentiful PTO, good company culture. Management can be a hit or miss. Colleagues were good to work with."
good,"Worked all over the US doing first responder systems, then Kuwait and Iraq."
good,"My entire time here at Raytheon required me to seek out the work assignments and I had next to zero supervision. I worked primarily as individual contributor on many assignments, and the overall experience was a stark contrast to what I was expecting. In short, I was thrown into the deep end of the pool, but I learned quickly how to swim."
good,"Good benefits, excellent work environment. Management has changed since my initial hire. Telework is available. The are limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"Day to day was pretty relaxed and I learned a lot about embedded systems. There are a lot of intelligent people in management. The workplace culture is nothing like the typical fast-paced software developer environment you see in the movies, but there is a lot to learn and a relaxed environment to do it in."
good,"It's a company of aggregate cultures with multiple acquisitions over the years. Primarily a defense logistics company. Days can be long , but fruitful."
good,engineering company with great products for our warfighter.  great technology and good people to work with.  diverse product portfolio and good customer relationships
good,"Depending on the group there is a possibility of getting 9/80's. However, you can expect to work most of hem. The Bureaucracy is unbelievable. Mostly due to the culture and some due to the nature of the work."
good,Older workforce. A lot of room for growth. It is up to you to determine your career path. 9/80 workdays are nice. There are a lot of levels of management which can be good and bad. I love my managers but have heard horror stories
good,"Raytheon is a company that you can start in an entry level position and move you way up. It is one of the few places you can work until retirement. Other then the facility being closed down this is a great place to work. As a Veteran it gives me a sense that I am still providing to the fight, It may not be in the capacity that I was before but I am helping the Warfighter with their day to day operations with the products I support."
good,"Expert professional staff, hard group of workers, good managers and leaders, interesting job and plenty of chances to expand your knowledge and skill set."
good,The work was rather routine for the most part. I learned to use Microsoft Scheduling software to prepare proposals.  Had some experience assisting a sister unit submit a large proposal.
good,"I have had a overall positive experience in my time at Raytheon as both an intern and contractor.  I'm hopeful to continue my professional career with the company if and when my work experience commands a full-time, salaried position as opposed to a contracted, hourly role."
good,It was good work - period.  Very interesting and challenging and I loved the test and analysis aspects of it.  Some of the policies and procedures were not that great.  Always challenged to move around to different positions.
good,"As far as the job work/life balance, Raytheon is number 1. As long as I have worked for this company the work life balance has been the best every! I have truly enjoyed working for this company."
good,"this was a great place to work. There were many different skill sets working together to develop training. Unfortunately they were predicated on government contracts."
good,"In a typical day, must go to meetings through out the day, sometime this can distract us from activities needing our undivided attention."
good,Although Raytheon had a very diverse work force very few of this diversity was represented in upper management.  The work schedule was flexible as long as the standard 40 hours were maintained and self management was encouraged which was a good thing for self starters.
good,"Raytheon is a LARGE company, and as such, they have a set culture, and it is easy to be pigeon holed into one small area of interest.  Which is great if you love that, but I personally like working at a small company, where one can wear many hats."
good,"I only left per this was a temp position. I do not like how they handled the transition to closing the project, but that is to be expected when you just don't want to leave."
good,"A total diverse culture.  Truly an equal opportunity employer.  A friendly work environment.   The work was easy going, low stress environment.  I truly enjoyed my five years working there.  I left because I was a U.S. Army Serviceman and was deployed for 911."
good,"Exciting programs, quick paced. Not for the timid or lazy. Very energetic and motivated leaders. Opportunities for advancement for right people. Enjoy working there."
good,"Morning safety meeting on work  to be done. Perform jobs either alone or with others to safely complete the task at hand. Learn from others knowledge and share personal knowledge.  Workplace culture is extremely important, and our team got along and helped each other.  Hardest part of the job is taking care of  unexpected plant crisis. Most enjoyable part is team work and good attitude of fellow employees ."
good,"Enjoyed working with Raytheon.  Amazing technology, good management.  Very long hours and full days.  Lots of work to do and gained a great insite of Government Contrat work."
good,"worked on a contract field team, learned a lot and good working environment, the only thing i didn't like which i knew going into the job was the 90 day contracts, we got renewed for over a year but it finally ended"
good,Professional in their field. Deployed to Afghanistan. Currently working the Counter IED program. Been the lead in the program for 5 years +.   I really dont know what more you want me to say
good,"Maintains immaculate files of documentation used and prepared by Production Control Clerk, employee will analyze work orders and other specific detailed production information to include man hour accounts and budgeting analysis."
good,"Answered phones, worksheets, filing, faxing. "
good,"Work/Life balance is generally good.  Secure job but flow of business is not generally exciting.  Advancement can be difficult.  Not a bad place to work, just not generally a lot of career opportunities."
good,Job was very laid back unsupervised work. Pretty much come in and get your work done. Everyone was very professional. overall was a very nice job experience. I love the job wish it was full time instead of contracted. contract up in September. So I  have to male sure I have another one before hand.
good,"Process daily export transactions and a company focal for export compliance.  Interaction with multiple programs, freight forwarders, traffic, licensing, and Customs Border Protection.  This is a very dynamic position that challenges you to be up to date with customs regulations and company policies."
good,Raytheon is a fun place to work. the research and development part of the job is fun and challenging working with the physics and engineers. what is best is that they value my opinion.
good,"Very demanding job in critical datacenter environment.  The government customer was unreasonable at times which impacted morale, My program didn't have any upward mobility."
good,The day usually starts out with continuing where I left off the previous day. The goal is to keep up with the schedule. The management is supportive if there are roadblocks to complete the tasks. The hardest part is when information is not available and it takes time to find it. The most enjoyable part is when the problem is solved and on time.
good,Now part of large corporate America. Was a small high-tech company that allowed for advanced prototyping with large rewards.  Alas the company was sold and it is not the same
good,A relax atmosphere and people are willing to help each other. I was able to learn new techical items each year. The managers are there to support you. Sometimes the hours can be demanding and depending on where you work.
good,"It is cool working for this company, just have to learn to deal with the different types of personalities. I enjoy my job and I would recommend Raytheon to anybody."
good,"Performed all the testing and documentation which included vibration, temperature and humidity."
good,Performed quality audits on airport surveillance radar equipment at all levels of assembly. Checked solder joints and hardware connections. Interesting work for someone who embraces electronics. Was hired through an agency for 6mos contract. When contract expired was not contacted by HR regarding my status. My manager told me just to keep coming in until advised otherwise. Worked for a full year and did not receive any job offer for permanent employment. Moved on to better wage and job with benefits.
good,"I signed on as a contract employee; what that means is that when the contract ends, so does the work. With the timelines on our Projects, there was plenty of over time. In between, we worked a normal 8 hour day. I learned a lot from my co-workers, who were very knowledgeable on the projects that we worked on."
good,"A lot of the cons are not with Raytheon but, rather with the government contract restricting/limiting management. The culture is entirely mission focused where I work with little leeway for deviation from established procedures. Minimum breaks or time to take care of other business."
good,This company was a very good company to work for. They gave good benefits along with good pay. I was sorry when I got laid off when they laid off 15000 employees nationwide.
good,The leadership really look out for all the employees to the best of their ability. Great benefits and the family to work ratio is great for those with families. The only downside to working with this company is the lack of job security due to the contract based employees.
good,"My experience at Raytheon was a good one. They had excellent benefits and workers that supported each other. The company really focused on employee career growth, which I did not appreciate until I left. The programs were cutting edge technology which was very appealing to any engineer."
good,"A typical day at work is maintenance on the Patriot Radar, admin. duties and radar operation. I have learned much about IF and RF systems in my time with Raytheon. Management treats us well, however, I feel they are growing apart from the needs of individuals. The hardest part of my job would have to be traveling for 3-6 week periods and being away from family. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing the work I am doing is making our systems better for our war fighters."
good,Goal driven workplace. Could cut out some engineers that are lazy and would be much better place to work. Most days are well worth going into work and making a difference. If you are willing to put in the time and effort yo will get rewarded.
good,"Great place to learn several different functions and meet lots of people from different cultures and backgrounds.  The company is worldwide with over 80,000 employees. Depending on your particular position you may have the opportunity to travel and also communicate with people and companies from around the world."
good,"Work started at 7:00am Day shift only. I always had several electronic boxes to work on. Each box of 5 types had its on challenges. I worked self paced with little to no supervision. "
good,Enjoyed working for Northrop Grumman. Good home life balance. Worked on a wide variety of projects. Fair amount of upward growth.
good,Empresa de origem norteamericana que teve as atividades encerradas no pais.
good,Worked as an Systems Engineer got lot of great experience. Great Company to work for to gain expertise. Company supports its employees.
good,"Raytheon is a contract company that assigns me to ACDelco."
good,Awesome place to work.  The management is very supportive and the work life balance is really good.  The job culture is great where everyone is passion about what they do.
good,Huge company with experienced individuals with a lot of knowledge to pass down. Also a company with a long history in military contracting.
good,"My day starts at early with meetings and customer work request."
good,Worked very well with staff and management.  Worked cohesively with staff to complete day to day tasks.Organization provided numerous opportunities for professional developement
good,This is an excellent company to work for. Management is compassionate and focused. Communication is above-average from what I've seen.
good,"Decent company to work for and specially for those starting off their careers."
good,Clean environment and great benefits. Company does more than average among the several jobs I have worked for in providing ways for its employees to better their health and ways of living.
good,"I have / am continuing to learn a great variety of skill-sets that make me a greater asset in the workforce. Given the tools that Raytheon provides, I can apply them towards being an asset within another company due to my current situation with the facility shutdown."
good,"I loved working for Raytheon SIS.  The people I worked with were great.  I reported to the Accounting Supervisor but also did a lot of work for the Accounting Manager and occasionally managers of other departments as needed.  I was responsible for processing payroll and transmitting  to ADP.  The reports received from ADP were reconciled to the General Ledger by me.  Along with payroll I did reconciling of the 941 reports, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Consultant/Contractor accounts and other requests from my superiors.  I worked closely with Human Resources regarding new hires, terminations and inquiries.  I hardest part of my responsibilities was trying to get everyone to submit their time sheet on time. I made it fun when hunting people down to get their time sheet submitted  The most enjoyable part of my position was when I solved a problem or could help someone else solve a problem."
good,"Work Life balance is great.  They bend over backwards to help you with you work schedule.  They are outstanding, they have a genuine interest in their employes. "
good,Working for Raytheon Company can be rewarding and always alive.  Management and co-workers all strive to do their personal guset to make the company a success.
good,"Entire time with Raytheon was spent in the Middle East, where customs and ways of doing things are different from the US."
good,"Laid back work environment"
good,"A normal typical day at work. Learned a lot about ways to handle sensitive components. Yearly training, to retrain on soldering and daily meetings on safety and the company. There was no difficulties of the job and you get to enjoy it with your colleagues!"
good,Ability to work in multiple locations. Not the compensation of a smaller company but reliable. Work in an autonomous environment. Good work life balance.
good,The work is challenging and that what counts for me. I have worked there a total of 13 years. The most fond experience is working in teams where the team member cared about me. The job culture is more demanding with the DOD sequestration.
good,I worked at a job-site and assisted in the testing of a deployed perimeter security system. The internship was interesting and challenging.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Raytheon. I have witnessed them time and time again taking care of their employees and their family, and always doing whats best for them. Their human resources department is excellent and their managers are very approachable. The benefits and pay were excellent, however they did not promote advancement in an employees knowledge even when it would directly benefit the job."
good,"Navigating a large company has it challenges and benefits. Many opportunities exist within the company due to the complexity of the work. The most rewarding component is working with some of the most intelligent people in the industry. A solid, well respected company but currently facing the funding challenges all of the defense industry is under. However, it is one of the companies doing the best during this time and that speaks volumes for its reputation. At times, the pace and day to day responsibilities make it difficult to manage work/life balance. The key to success is getting into the right functional organization, having the ability to take on many extra responsibilities, and being flexible. Not all leaders equally developed and good to work under. Overall, the most enjoyable part of my day was the people I worked with and knowing I made a difference in how they did their job."
good,"The company adheres to the highest standards of work ethics. "
good,Good company to work for.  Benefits are good. Co-workers easy to get along with.  Supervision very understanding and easy to get along with.
good,People were friendly money was good work was challenging and rewarding
good,"Raytheon is a great company to work for. A large portion of my job as a member of the IDS/RMS International Product Support, Consulting Project Management Liaison is facilitating meetings between the US government, foreign personal, Raytheon, and other government contractors. This is a job I would have never thought of doing but I do love it.  Just knowing I am able to successfully set up a conference of 150 people with 12 different vendors, 30 foreign dignitaries from 8 different countries that don’t like each other very much and the US government is a great feeling."
good,"Always something new to learn, giving you a sense of accomplishment."
good,They allowed flex hours and the people were of a very high caliber.
good,"Raytheon is an exciting place to work especially if science and technology is your interest.  It also employs people from diverse ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds and promotes respect for all."
good,"Great pay/benefits, room for advancement, great co=workers."
good,The workplace has a good atmosphere and fun people.  The job can be repetitive and not much changes.  There is not much room for advancement and the company is top heavy on Management.
good,Nice company with great benefits and fun people and a place that likes its workers
good,"Pros:"
good,"Raytheon is a great company. It is filled with very intelligent employees and it seems as though everyone works diligently to accomplish the company's objectives. Individual development is also encouraged and even required at this company. With that being said, it is a very large company and, as a result, is limited in what it can provide it employees. Although the salary and benefits are fairly competitive, it is extremely difficult to get a promotion or a raise (at least in Internal Audit) without dedicating years to the company. This is also a testament to the retention rates of the company as it is a great work environment. However, while I am diligent, team-oriented and have been recognized as a valued member of the team (and I do feel that way), I do believe that my experience and intelligence would be more valued at other organizations."
good,"Support engineering customers with test bench set up, supplies, equipment, cables, components. Test and calibration. The hardest part of the job was learning the the internal operation of the test equipment. Most enjoyable part was helping and orking with all the engineering lab users."
good,"I performed 9-10 hour work days, with the latitude to work from home when absolutely necessary.  My engineering management skills became very sharp while being mentored under top-notch management professionals. I became well-adept at customer relationship management in dealing with government contracts/representatives.  The most difficult aspect of the job was the red tape and politics of government funding processes, while still contractually meeting deliverables and deadlines.  The most enjoyable part of the job was contributing to, and witnessing, the growth of my team towards very high success rates."
good,On the typical work day would travel usually 30 to 60 minutes to work.  Everyday was always a learning curve with ever changing events.  The hardest part of the job was being away from home for long periods of time.
good,They have good work life balance and great benefits. The cons were that they had too many reorg which meant things changed a lot and also change managers often.
good,Lots of opportunity for advancement but also at risk for lay-offs due to government program cuts.
good,As far as money wise a great place to work. Rules are very strict maybe to strict ( but its understandable).
good,"A stable job and good environment that promotes asking questions and looking fro assistance. An older company with older employees and still set in its old ways. Good benefits but the days may be monotonous at times depending on the job you have. Came in as new hires, when they havent hired new people in a few years and the learning curve is quite high. No real training for what I am supposed to do."
good,"I review proposals for organizational conflict of interest, answer data requests from corporate, document incident reports from our sites all over the world, document incoming and outgoing correspondence."
good,"I work closely with the Finance department to make sure that the invoices that I have approved on the Syncada system have been paid as well as that they were paid to the correct charge code assigned to that shipment. I work with UPS and any freight carrier for any shipments that are outstanding that were placed in a different sort key. I ship pallets, boxes, etc for the MSTC program as well as to our personnel out in the field or other sites using the ITARS system for all OCONUS shipments and UPS, FED EX or any freight carrier using the TMS (Shipping Smart) System for shipments CONUS. I receive packages in the warehouse and distribute out to personnel or if it is a material/equipment box or pallet, I receive it in to Maximo and close out the purchase order. I create hand receipts or a material issue document in Excel and hand it off to the person that it goes to upon their signature. I receive in purchase order invoices from different sites and make sure that the invoice posts in SAP for payment. I maintain all PCARSS, Disposition, Shipping, Receiving and ROE paperwork for the PMO in Orlando. I work closely with the Property Manager to get all necessary paperwork to present to the Government for the disposition of all government property. I present the customer with a DD1149 form upon completion of the transaction per Government approval. I issue out DD250's to customers when we issue the property to them. I conduct a 10% monthly inventory to different sites for accountability of all ROE per policy and follow up with entries in to the EROOM along with conducting a 10% monthly"
good,"Design of complex radar systems"
good,"Plenty of room to learn from other engineers."
good,Surrounded by passionate experts in many fields of engineering and analysis.
good,"no lodging rembursement"
good,Raytheon Company is very competitive in the Defense and Government sector.
good,"A typical work day at Raytheon was mostly laid back.  Times did get stressful but for the most part you were able to go and do what you needed to get done and no one watching over your back.  I learned something new about in my position everyday.  The hardest part of the job was trying to move up.  Didn't seem to matter how hard you worked and how much praise you got from your customers, management never commended you for it or compensated you for it.  The enjoyable part of my job was my colleagues.  I loved working with my program personel they were always very helpful and taught me a lot. We also received free lunches (monthly) when we met our metric goals and that was pretty great too."
good,"i enjoyed the work environment, although my partner was not productive but manager was fair and took action to make things fair. i liked the people i worked around, very helpful and i do see room for advancement."
good,"Information Technology product and service sales, project management, customer interface and lifecycle planning, six of which are industrial in nature and span work requests for simple service and support to multi-year complex phased projects in many different building/asset settings from wind tunnels to Administrative office suites and supercomputing facilities. I was responsible for daily and monthly project progress reports for tracking contract proposals and other documentation through signature/approval processes and advised/informed subcontractor and staff relationships accordingly while coordinating with clients, handling inter-departmental communication, and relationship cultivation. "
good,"Excellent work place and friendly people."
good,Great Company! Nice People. Great Benefits! Need to be a self-motivator.
good,"Gained great experience in a number of different areas, such as configuration control, material control and builds and administration."
good,I worked for Raytheon full-time for more than 17 years. Training through webinars are available. Typical day is meeting with the Team in the morning to see what hot items need to be completed for that day. Sometimes programs will have to many meetings during the day were no 'real' work can be performed.
good,"any tools needed will be supplied, great people. Close to home and has flex hours."
good,Raytheon was a great company to work for. They have above average benefits.
good,"Raytheon Polar Services operated and maintained the three stations on the Antarctic under contract with the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a twelve year period ended, March 2012. The NSF, which dealt with grants to universities for scientific research, walked a fine line politically as a federal civilian agency to find balance between the scientists that wanted to perform without oversight, policies and procedures and the Government that required compliance with Federal laws and regulations. I did not find the NSF prompt or clear in its own directives and Federal mandates. I believe the NSF left many of those unclear, leaving Raytheon vulnerable to unmerited criticism, especially related to award fee. As the internal controls manager, I could not always implement what was needed to minimize risk to the program and personnel because of the internal and external resistance. As a former DOD IG auditor, I was well aware of the influences in Washington D.C. I think that Raytheon leadership did a superlative job under the circumstances."
good,"Worked for great people, always learning."
good,Great career potential during favorable business conditions.
good,Worked with engineers to research suppliers that could delivery the material that was needed in a timely manner.
good,Was a great place to work. But with the new changes to benefits and management changes going down hill a bit.
good,Well managed. Attention to safety and employee wellbeing.
good,"My work day consists of working in different aeras. I start working in a lab, then move to stock room where I order, revieve and issue supplies. Take daily and weekly inventories and report to management. afternoon I take care of mail service and route incoming and out going mail and packages. Iam a team player and get along with all my co-workers.The hardest part of my job was making sure that all supplies were dilivered to stock room in timely manner so they could issued. Everything was enjoyable about the position I held at Raytheon."
good,"Typical day at work involves coordination of reports with engineering and program management to meet weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, and 5 year deadlines. Fast paced environment with constant pressure to meet functional and program goals."
good,"I liked the workplace, coworkers and supervisors. But promotion was hard to get. They provided excellent probationary training and better than adequate feedback on how you were doing. Performance evaluations were fair to the individual and counseling was provided to those who needed it."
good,"Revenue Driven company, diversified company, tight deliverables"
good,"Lots of oppurtunity to learn and grow in this company, there is always a need for effective and high quality leaders."
good,"Raytheon employee here, it's good to get a job here so come and apply."
good,"Awesome company to work for, I'd go back in a heartbeat! Salary for all is within market for the position, benefits are great but expensive, culture is comfortable, management is knowledgeable. Work/life balance is almost non-existant. Too few people for the work required and very long hours are often necessary to accomplish. High stress environment but rewarding if you can handle it. Job security is sketchy right now due, in part, to the lack of defense spending."
good,"Managing a fire prevention bureau involving inspectors, alarm technicians, and extinguisher manitenance, community fire safety instruction and annual Fire Prevention Week activities, fire investigations when required and emergency response when needed."
good,"I liked working at Raytheon Fullerton. Plenty of variety and many opportunities to challenge a person. Most managers were old Hughes Aircraft employees, so still very people-oriented. Nice facilities. Smart co-workers, well-maintained offices, variety of activities to maintain interest besides just work."
good,This was a great company to work for because of all the wonderful people. Coming in to work every day is just an enjoyable experience because of all the positive and friendly people that make up this company.
good,"Work was very exciting and well worth the efforts placed to train our battlefield soldiers in the laser engement task which used laser versus real bullets to train marksmenship on targets. The laser system was used on rifles, as well as tracked vehicles and their larger gun aquisition."
good,The company has great benefits and they constantly looking at better ways to do do business. You have an opportunity to earn a six sigma certification.
good,"Ratheon is a stable and well respected company in the business, aerospace and defense manufacturing sector.  They have a rigorous compliance training that keeps all employees up to date with current governmental compliance requirements.  Management treats their employees well."
good,My time was Raytheon was a positive experience.  I was able to learn a lot and make many valuable relationships.  I would highly recommend them as a great company for anyone who would want to work there.
good,I have worked here for many years and gained additional experience in the Aerospace industry.Also gained more experience with proprietary hardware and software. Supported over 3000 users locally and intentional.
good,Typical day would be standup/sprint review and work closely with team of developers. Great management there to help you out when needed. Ping pong table was nice.
good,"Company is going through a merger therefore, future is unclear.  New CEO has not been wholly established therefore culture is not established"
good,"Completed all job reports and logs immediately following service calls. "
good,"Everyone is very friendly, humble, and supportive of each other. The company culture, at least at this job, is very mature even for me. Everyone seems ultra stable, but I think this is a part of working in the defense industry. It can be a bit boring and slow with innovation, but the job is extremely secure and the benefits are second to none. A typical day at work involves quite a bit of beauracracy, waiting, and paperwork, and that leads to a very low amount of daily stress. I find this true for most job titles in this company. The velocity is not a high as you would find in the commercial sector, so this is a great company for those who want to lead a quiet life."
good,"Working for Raytheon as a systems engineer offers good compensation and reasonable duties. There are challenges and opportunities for advancements for employees who are interested. Many positions, including this one, are at the customer site and require daily interaction with other contractors, Federal employees and sometimes military personnel. This is an ops support position with little in the way of software development required. Engineers in this position are required to be on call periodically, but in my position, it is unusual to have to come in to site outside of normal work hours."
good,"Raytheon's an atypical defense contractor.  They follow the rules and guidelines, stress accuracy and innovation.  I work on classified material.  They are growing."
good,Great place to stay for a longer period of time. It's
good,"A great place to work at, with its own challenges depending on the different project. Each new project gave me the opportunity to learn and excel in different areas of expertise."
good,I learned a lot and the management was fantastic. There is always someone willing to help when your stuck. My coworkers taught me a great deal about the Software Engineering discipline.
good,"Engineers are great - really hard workers. They are technically astute. Will do whatever is necessary to meet schedule."
good,"A lot of the work is technically cutting edge, and the company has extensive resources in terms of Subject Matter Experts, labs and test facilities to address just about any engineering challenges. Given the types of products and the customers, some task assignments can involve much detailed documentation that can have an engineer feeling like their job is meetings & paperwork rather than generating or improving product designs. Most enjoyable (for me) - getting to have hands-on experience with hardware in the labs. Hardest part of the job - finding time for the above between all of the meetings and paperwork. Culture has been generally favorable for me - people care about their jobs and each other."
good,"Raytheon was a good company to work for, with a few exceptions.  I worked for them for 17 years, from 2002-2019.  When I first started working there, everything about the company was outstanding.  They put their people first, because they knew that people were their most valued resource.  The last few years I worked there, they lost sight of that fact, and all they cared about was the almighty $$.  They asked for loyalty to the company, but yet, they were not loyal to you. They lost A LOT of talented people to other companies, because they put money and business ahead of their most important resource (people).  Their integrity seemed to go downhill starting at about 2010 as well, when we were entering into a new contract.  "
good,Was a great time.       Great culture.           Great people.  I would work there again.  Class act as a leader.  Trained Marines.  Fitness was a must.
good,"Interview Process is a bit rough. However, the diversity and culture are amazing.  Great place to have work / life balance."
good,"Great culture and great people. Depending on the job, I've traveled as often as weekly (worked in Dallas for 4 years), to as little as once a year. Management and all personnel are the best and chosen wisely upon hiring. I have nothing negative to say about the company - I was always supported by upper management when needed. The only down side has nothing to do with the company. Government contractors work at the pleasure of the U.S. Government. When a given contract ends, or if a re-compete fails, each employee must find another place to work within the company, or look for another job elsewhere. The company doesn't do much to assist when this happens, but there's plenty of warning before it does."
good,"Very large company with big respect to their employees. Rayton has numerous offices in North America and in United States of America."
good,This is a face paced business with a focus on being on the bleeding edge. You must constantly be ready to stay abreast of the latest information or be left behind. Management style could be better but that is consistent with the industry.
good,"A good place to work, on the whole. As the work area wasn't air conditioned, it could get hot despite the fans. I do wish the depot hadn't been shut down."
good,"I worked at Raytheon for over 4 years, across several roles and ultimately had a pleasant experience. Good pay and great benefits. Very large corporate environment - whether that is good or bad."
good,Raytheon has a diverse employee workforce and provides a good work environment.  As a contractor I was able to participate in some of the functions .  The 9/80 schedule is really to have every other Friday off.
good,"Not a bad place to work, great for getting feet on the ground. Management can be stiff. Encourages team work. Depends on position and location, attire can be casual."
good,It was for the most part great days.  I enjoyed the people and the job.  It was challenging and sometimes stressful but still rewarding.  I would do the same job over if the opportunity came along.
good,"I can't speak much to Raytheon. I became a part of them after they bought the company that I use to work for. However, our company culture was unchanged."

good,The hardest part of the job was meeting all the demands of Raytheon and the government with a shrinking workforce.  The good part of the job was the fast pace with many and different challenges throughout the day.

good,"I work there as an independent contractor only. I do not work full time. Therefore, I can't give more details experiences but so far I used to love working there."
good,"If the plant where I worked for Raytheon at was still in operation, I would still be there.   I loved the variety of tasks I performed and the people I worked with.  Safety & quality focused organization."

good,Great place to work for for either personal advancement or life long career company. Raytheon is a strong contender in the contracting market and provides many strong opportunities.
good,"A structured work environment, some may not thrive in the structure.  Must be good at branding yourself and making yourself an expert. The work was interesting and challenging. Management would give you tasks and expect you to work independently, and generally did not micro-manage. There were many talented people, and was a competitive environment. They offered after hours training coursed taught by their own subject matter experts."
good,"Good job, friendly people. Monday - Friday, government holidays off, two weeks off for Christmas! People are nice, sometimes a little too busy but other than that it’s"
good,"While at Raytheon I was a contract employee.  The work was fine, the environment was fine.  MY only comment would be that my contract was terminated early do to budget constraints."
good,"Very good work-life balance. Very laid back, but in the end they're too relaxed. Stuff is slow because you deal with the government. Management is typical managers and stuff takes time to get approved. BUT you work on some cool stuff! Very good starter job, or job for security."

good,"One of my top 3 organizations to work for.  Great vision, mission, and support for employees.  My previous supervisors all commented on how they relied heavily on me for making their jobs easier. My success is primarily a result of being a self-starter, a creative thinker, a problem solver and an independent but collaborative worker."
good,"Very structured environment.  Extremely different from department to department.  Emphasis on documenting.  Mostly UNIX and C, little chance to branch out to new things."
good,Productive Workplace with many opportunities. Very collaborative workplace working as a team. Learned many functions of the organization working in Program Management Department.
good,I loved that you moved from base to base.  You traveled around and got to meet and see new places.  The team was small so it seemed more like a family than a work crew.
good,Work was difficult but I love a challenge and my peers shared the same mindset. Management was very hands-off and allowed us to attempt bug fixes in newer ways and maintain our own code repositories.

Send out e-mails and or update task list, fill out time card, go home."
good,"Relaxed environment, friendly co-workers in a collaborative environment, and helpful management that takes into account your career goals. I worked in an agile environment (SCRUM lab) so I can only speak for that environment, but it was a good experience and much more interactive and collaborative than working in a quiet cubicle office with little interaction with fellow coworkers. Good benefits too!"
good,The job was not difficult based on my level of experience. I cannot disclose the level of the job because of the nature of security. The most difficult part of the job was not having enough staff in certain key positions.
good,Enjoy working at Raytheon and having a solid career.  I would recommend to others.  The company is dedicated to its employees and customers.  Solid company.
good,You will have opportunity to learn while working here.  Company provides training opportunities including attending training class at some training companies such as Global Knowledge.

good,"A strict Government driven shop, stuck in the 1960's. Drops are restrictive and monotonous, repetitive, without any improvements or modifications made."
good,"it was a good place to work,, lack of work put them out of business, worked in the papermills, chemical plants doing 3d design using autocad , great co workers"
good,"Fun, exciting place to work to learn and grow.  Very supportive staff, co workers, and management. The only thing you will have to worrk about working here is the chance of a lay off if they lose the bid on a government contract."
good,Raytheon Portsmouth RI - very nice place to work. People and management collaborate and provide a good working environment to express your thoughts and are caring.

good,"Good management, good people, challenging work;"
good,"Raytheon is a great place filled with great people. Overall I am very glad I was given a chance to work at this company. As an entry-level engineer, I was given some big responsibilities from day one. The position I had made me feel truly valued as an employee. The drawbacks of Raytheon included a bloated management structure. On daily bases, I would find myself giving the same status to several different members of management often without any feedback given in return. The advantages Raytheon has to offer are a competitive compensation package, challenging work, and a chance to work with other talented engineers."
good,Great environment and excellent team of people who made the work life challenging. Solid relationship were cultivated and established.... The environment was tantalizing with the ambiance of the rivers and ocean. The experience at Patrick AFB and Cape Canaveral Station was one of a life time..... Enjoyed the opportunity of working for Computer Sciences Raytheon (CSR).

good,"enjoyable to work with this company for nuclear plan engineering division, good salaries and benefits  people were also very helpful and employee oriented"
good,I often tell people I get paid well to do a job that I love with people I like very much. The work goes through feast/famine cycles.  The hardest part is keeping busy during the down times.

good,"Company provides a very professional and modern technological environment, is well ahead of most competitors in initiatives and promoting team involvement."
good,Raytheon was a good company and had great benefits. The only down side which you will find just about anywhere is a ton of training modules assigned each year that take up time and are completely useless.
good,"With everything in the world currently going on, this company is set to grow exponentially over the coming decade.  Missile defense as well as attack are within their portfolio and the products are set to grow in the coming years."
good,People I worked with were a great group of people and were fun to work with.  it can be a fast paste and busy place to work and it gave me an experience with different assembly work.
good,Programs for the military were always unique and interesting.  I enjoyed hands-on learning combined with training.  I was always impressed by my colleagues and greatly enjoyed the work.
good,We were treated as adults with VERY little micro management thus allowing us to complete large amounts of work. I also enjoyed the opportunity to learn new things such as proficient tractor operation.
good,Raytheon is a good company that provides fair compensation to the their employees.  The work culture is largely relaxed and promotes a cooperative spirit among workers.

good,"The typical day at work was to quickly understand the changes to the daily flight schedule and adapt to the highest need of the operation or the customer immediately. I learned how to manage a very complex operation with various components of aviation, such as balancing airline operations with cargo operations, or the constant need for general aviation's attention for time and resources. It was fun but very taxing on physical and mental resources. Management was excellent to work with and always willing to help with guidance and advise to operational concerns. The hardest part of the job was working all the hours to keep this size of operation running efficiently at all times. However, the most enjoyable part was meeting all the great customers and employees we would had at our facility."
good,Nothing wrong with the company and it's changeling work.Intelligent and knowledgeable co-workers. Friendly environment. Long days but rewarding working with the United States Government.

good,I learned a lot in this position. I learned the database and how to teach others the database for procurement.  I did purchase orders and requests for bids for the building of paper mills.
good,Very nice place to work. The folks there are friendly and always lend a helping hand. Growth oriented atmosphere. Always ready to spread knowledge. Always specify promotions and diversifying ones self.
good,Raytheon is your average engineering environment.  There is opportunity for advancement along with compensation; pending on your discipline I'm sure there are pros and cons to the management style.

good,"It is a fast paced environment but the people are fun to be with, and the ability to learn new things is great. If you like to travel and work extra hours."
good,"All I can say in the five years I worked there I learned a lot about the defense industry. Worked with a great group guys who always put their best foot forward and always showed support in a team goaled enviroment. The management for the most part was supportive but a bit demanding at times with unrealistic deadlines.  Raytheon allows the employee to be able to showcase their skills and feel good about themselves. There's little micro management thus allowing the employees to work freely with little supervision. Work-life balance is good but could use some tweaking. Raytheon hires mostly retired vets who are very talented and know what the customer expects as they were once the customer at one time. Unfortunately, many contracts were dropped due to the change in our Government back in 2008 inadvertently causing massive layoffs. Hopefully if things change positively with our Government, Raytheon will prosper again."
good,Lots of opportunity here to improve the machine that tends to get in its own way more times than not.  Great for new grads to get their experience level up by being mentored by seasoned engineers.  Great for professionals if you can deal with the inefficiencies the commercial world does not suffer.  Great work/life balance as we work 9/80 work week

It is extremely rewarding to know I may save lives due to the training that they have received using our system. I have enjoyed being an RF team manager here but like I have said I am at my 20 year mark and it is time to do something new.
good,"Always a positive learning experience. Every one is great to work with. There are great teams that work together.In the department I worked in, I helped my engineers, and was allowed to help other engineering departments as they needed. So that kept me pretty busy, I like that type of team work."

However, as an engineer, there are far too many processes wrapped around our development efforts and that can stifle creativity.  Security can also slow things down enormously.  Many of the company policies don't make sense but were knee-jerk reactions to a failure somewhere in this huge company."
good,I worked for the company for 2 years and I believe that they provide a great environment for recent graduates as well as a great work/life balance.
good,I always had a positive experience there. cutting edge technology and a chance to make a difference. That's all I have to say at this time.

good,"Good company to work for can be very demanding at times. Difficult to get promoted. "
good,Raytheon Great Company to work for.  Good bennies and perfect for the Cival Servant Retiree.  Typical day at work consists of about 6 hours instruction and two hours of paper work or class development.  Management is all ex FAA so it is like a big team.  Everyone gets along.
good,Many opportunities to learn and advance your career.  Ethics are strong as well as diversity.  Coworkers are great and supportive.

good,"Raytheon offers a flexible work schedule to meet your specific work/life balance needs, along with telecommuting options to help avoid long commutes.  This is a matrix organization, so sometimes management seems surprisingly out-of-the-loop.  My co-workers were extremely intelligent and talented."
good,The first level supervisor are fair and good to work for but company policies beyond their control can be frustrating when problems arise.
good,"I typical day at work is exciting because of the daily challenges I get to work with peers internal and external customers. I have learn so much in my 9 years with my company. I have gain great experience and have been able to apply what I have learned from aquiring my MBA from college. I work with a vast number of diverse type contracts. I work with a great team in my department. My colleagues and I meet often to work complex issues to minimize delivery slips. The hardest part of my job is not being able to meet with some of my end users to discuss their challenges. I feel that if I were able to discuss challenges with customers from time to time, I could have a better understanding of their needs which would enable me to maximize customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job is the autonomy my leadership has empowered on me to do my job."
good,"Working for Raythen is very rewarding, as a security officer you keep the facility and its inhabitants safe. The job pays well and has great benefits."

good,They were a government contracting company and very big company. I worked as an Accounts payable clerk.

If they charged it you had to go to buyer to authorize or deny. we had to talk to vendors and had to fix problems concerning invoices. We generate reports and had to cut checks for the purchases. I also keypunched time card for payroll. I became an emergency responder at Raytheon and they sent some of us to a shelter in D.C. to make sandwiches once a month. Good job!

My co-workers were friendly and eager to share knowledge for the most part. The hardest part of the job was dealing with hourly employees because they belong in the Union,  and they sometimes get in the way or performing duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that what I did mattered to our war fighters."
good,"Strong large company with numerous opportunities for job growth.  One of the main benefits is the ability to grow with the company, and to find yourself in new, challenging roles at any time."

My job involves working with adobe software mostly flash and photoshop, always learning new software to improve my skills and implement them on my daily tasks."
good,"Typically I teach and mentor Department of Defense, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Government contractor students Human Intelligence Source Operations. The hardest part of my job is being away from my wife. I work in Arizona and she works in Colorado. The job itself is not difficult but the different levels of experience in the leadership can be a challenge. My co-workers range from mostly four to six years in the military, to a few career 20 year plus military experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to graduate soldiers and DA Civilian in order to fight the War on Terrorism. It is a pleasure to see the hard work you put forward with an outcome of success."

good,"Typical day was usually planned from day to day, sometimes boring but usually interesting in the sense that it is a defense business."
good,"As a contract Recruiter, only worked there for 6 months. Really didn't get the opportunity to figure out the culture from the corporate side. Did a 6 month contract and that was it."
good,"This is a company one can stay and grow with; it has great benefits, career opportunities, and is a supporter of a balanced work-life style."

Based on this methodology, proposed a Documentation Road Map that detailed the relationships and priority flow down of the standards, policies and guidelines for each department."
good,Almost 26 years of employment at Raytheon (was previously Hughes Aircraft Co.) says a lot about working for this company. Ethical and fair company policies made it a great place to work. Was laid off for lack of work due to shrinking government defense budget.
good,Good benefits and friendly co-workers. The work I was performing was not very challenging and didn't relate to my degree.  I was hoping to have more mentorship or guidance coming out of college.
good,"This was my first job in contracts and I learned so much!  I was hired to work on transporting contracts data from their former ERS to the SAP system.  This gave me an intimate knowledge of the specifics of the company's contracts and the corporation as a whole.  "

good,I enjoyed working at Raytheon.  There is a lot of technical work and flexibility to try different roles.  The compensation package is very competitive in the industry.  Promotions for career minded individualism can be very difficult however. 
good,"Raytheon Company is very competitive in the Defense and Government sector.  The company has been around a long time and continues to perform well amid fluctuating times.  However, there are alot of changes happening behind the scenes, in order to remain competitive... Very important to build and maintain a strong professional network, mentors and advisors.  Get involved in projects outside of regular job.  "
good,I came to Raytheon out of graduate school and I've had many opportunities to develop myself into a highly sought after EO/IR systems engineer.
good,"One of the most difficult lessons to learn at RMS is that every program that you work on will have a different culture. The tools used by each program may be universal but the way that talent is utilized differs. Obviously, the bureaucracy involved with working for a large company can be irritating at times. However, the pride of delivering a successful product to the customer is enormously rewarding."
good,enjoy the work and some people . hope to advance in the company
good,* packed alot of different things/equipment for the goverment * alot about shipping and receiving * pretty good * really good people but very slow...they worked for the goverment * nothing was hard...was trained well and pretty slow pace * working with different top secret things

good,"I have learned allot working for Raytheon, in addition to my Configuration/Data Analyst position I am the Point of Contact (POC) for the pricing of new business for our dept."
good,"Raytheon is always looking for the brightest and best but shy to keep them. In the past 3 years they have under gone tremendous amounts of cuts, layoff and firings. Enough to make you skeptic of applying for long term work. If hired you will be greeted with hundreds of pages to read cause management is busy with their own thing to have time to train you. It is a get up and get at it atmosphere. You are highly recognized for your hard work but not compensated for it. The work is filled with high morale due to close work with military clients."
good,It's a great to work at! I would recommend the company to somebody else!
good,a typical day was met with exiting challenges and production goal with over all good guidance and reference materials to be found. there were many oppurtunities for advancement

good,Excellent benefits with friendly people. Worked there 15 years and never had a problem.
good,"Good company,lots of technical challanges, great salary and benefits. Great work life balance"
good,This was one of my favorite jobs. Being responsible for an OpenVMS Cluster and providing support was something that I had learned well wile at DEC.
good,"Management, at least in Fullerton, CA, is great. They are very approachable, and are truly invested in their employees to help them advance their career.  Overall, it is a great place to work with great pay (as long as you are able to negotiate).  The only con is that they work with very old technology, which may stagnate your career if you are there too long."
good,"Oversaw worldwide customer projects accounting for overall project management, including critical product effectiveness spread across several vendors and accomplishing critical defense project lifecycles, while exceeding customer expectations."
good,Great work environment and good benefits. Opportunity to work in different projects and getting exposure to new tools. Management is always active and listening to employees.
good,"One of the best things I liked about my time at Raytheon was the ability to have multiple tasks that varied from day to day.  Although the overall work was the same by the week, it was nice to have it varied so that I could keep myself busy."
good,"This is a fast-paced environment.  Training is lacking, so it is helpful to come on board with experience in the function you are applying for.  Highly recommend this employer."
good,Raytheon offered a balanced Life/Work atmosphere with many opportunities for advancement. They have many benefits to support their employees. They also offered Mentorship opportunities.
good,"A typical work day at Raytheon White Sands Missile Range consisted of PMCS, operation of equipment, troubleshooting, and testing software. I learned how to make use of time management, read blueprints and schematics. I enjoyed working with knowledgeable management and working with a diverse culture of co-workers. My conclusion to the hardest part of my job was learning a wide range of vast complex parts and components of the ECS and Radar system, but the most enjoyable part of my job was learning something new everyday."
good,"We had a growing team in a complex environment.  We were supporting a client with multiple contract companies as ""one team"".  I was looking for a greater role in the project and moved on."
good,Great company to work for. People are very professional. Management recognized job well done. I would recommend Reaytheon to anyone looking for a career path
good,"Good place to work.  Overall good work-life balance, good compensation, and good career advancement.  Culture is a bit traditional in it being a defense-contractor."
good,"Raytheon Professional Services has provided me with employment for 20+ years. The company is large enough to allow lateral movement, but not much vertical opportunities within the field of Instructional Design."
good,I worked alongside great colleagues and high ups who were always supportive and innovative. This motivated me to want to grown in my position and personally.
good,"flexible schedule with a great team. management always available and willing to help. standard office culture, few monthly events to boost morale. Hardest part of the job is the learning curve."
good,Raytheon offers a great work/life balance for their employees. Many employees work from home several days a week and only drive into the office for meetings and/or events.
good,I schedules laptop refreshes for the whole North Texas area that consisted of about 4 sites.  I ordered the hardware and schedule with the techs to do the refreshes and send back the old assets to HP
good,I was able to implement new processes with minimal resistance or upper level politics. The company was big on Six Sigma (implementing improvements) and keeping a healthy environment for its employees.
good,Worked offsite with other subcontractors but we all got along great. My manager was always open for suggestions and always helpful when needing guidance.
good,"Raytheon is a company with a great culture which supports employee learning and development, as well as having a flexible schedule, great for work/life balance."
good,"My internship project was great but other interns weren't so fortunate. The people, co-workers and management, were really great though and I believe they really wanted me to succeed."
good,"I learned how to work harder and admired the  kindness that my former boss showed to all of his staff.  He was a great guy.  This was the best area that I worked at there, to my surprise.  I didn't wish to  go, but when (another) boss calls and you've got the clearance, you have no choice.  It turned out great for me."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Raytheon.  I learned a lot and the used the Company training tools and programs to increase my business acumen, the mentoring program to meet company leadership and learn from them, which resulted in a promotion from team lead to Program Manager in a two year period."
good,"Raytheon is a very good company for a broad array of technologists and non-technologists. They are involved in very challenging programs largely for the government that make a difference. The only downside is that you are responsible for finding your gig and securing a position when your current contract/program is coming to a close. If you can't find a slot, you're laid off."
good,"Raytheon is a good company to work for.  They pay higher than average and the benefits are outstanding.  The only drawback is as with any large company, you get lost in the mix.  Not close knit like smaller companies."
good,I had a great manager and great coworkers. The work was challenging and rewarding but the technology stack is ancient. There are two main problems that I would point out:  the problem of 'why change it if it ain't broke' and the problem of 'it would cost too much to update it'.  The office I worked at was small but I had more than enough personal space.
good,"They helped me grow professionally, gave me a lot of freedom to execute my responsibilities, provided education classes to make me a better employee, and treated me respectfully. This was one of the more rewarding empolyment experiences I have had."
good,"The leadership here is really great to work for, but the fact that it is contract work does not give you long term job security.  Advancement here can also be hard as there is very little turn over of senior managers"
good,Work changes each day. Many things are learned on your own with minimal supervision. Most of what you learn is written on procedures and/or policies. As work is constantly changing so are expectations. This is why understanding priorities is important.
good,Raytheon Systems was very good to me. My team was unequaled from both a skills and personality perspective. I learned almost everything useful I know today about IT work from my time there. I was sad to resign but the culture there had become such that they were searching for reason to let people go to save money. I wanted to get out before they tried to force me out.So I did
good,"Typical work day is a fast paced nine hour work day supporting two Vice Presidents.  I schedule meetings, book travel, submit expense statements, move calendar appointments around and help support other Executives in the area when needed."
good,"This job is decent and laid back for the most part. If you don't mind working away from home for extended periods of time than this job is nice and you could do it forever. "
good,"I typically work an eight hour day. I do not have a manager who us a micromanager, which is appreciated. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we are adults and are able to get our work done and prioritize tasks on our own."
good,"Columbus involvement is extremely distant but Raytheon has been extremely commutative. "
good,Raytheon Canada was a great company to work for.  I learned a lot in the 20 years I was there and was able to advance my career.  They have a great online education system to help create new skills.
good,"Good job security for software engineers at least. They have good work/life balance policies. You can flex your hours between weeks, so you work more one week, and take those hours off on subsequent weeks. Makes family life very easy to accommodate. Generally positive from the perspective of a guy who landed his first big boy job out of college."
good,Hard work with dedicated team. Management doesn't follow policy on professional behavior. Company has an excellent web page system for accessing everything you need on one website. Benefits and IT support were very good.
good,"-Have had both and good managers at Raytheon, the bad have been placed elsewhere and I have been happy with my current leadership."
good,"good management, flex schedule available, learned to use new tools and training is available through online services; the culture is good; always looking to improve and provide the best or latest technology. a great place to work."
good,"Employees share knowledge and provide assist with getting projects completed on time."
good,Job was well suited to my experience in the military and was able to gain knowledge of foreign military sales an communicating with customers from different cultures.  Also offered an opportunity for travel.
good,Very good work environment with a family type environment. Management was great with no micro management. Parking was always great and my commute was not bad because I could utilize public transportation. The security devices that I managed were always maintained at the highest levels.
good,Great Company the best I could have every imagined to be honest. Just think it's time for a change in my career path. It's just time to move on to and start looking for other opportunities.
good,"Raytheon is a good place to work.  Raytheon provides a great benefits package, and is a world wide organization.  Would recommend to anyone to work for this company."
good,"Raytheon's culture is built on trust and respect.  The management team is great, overall, and they offer great benefits. Work/Life balance."
good,"Typical day allowed for using a large skill set and application of independent thought and action. Learned about maintenance management, shipping, supply, logistics, and management. There were many times that decisions about operations needed to be made at the ground level and management allowed for decisions made by the individual RFE to affect the program and shape the best product support possible."
good,This was a great learning experience for me since it was my very firs job as an A&P Mechanic. Great mentors were assigned to me and i learned a great deal from them.
good,"They are a strong company with a forward focus on technology.  If you've never worked for a large defense contractor, this is a good start."
good,"great DBA team and busy environment with excellent management policies."
good,"Company embracing SCUMS an providing training for Scrum leaders will enhance the agile culture RMS peruses."
good,Left 2010 after 30 years so may have changed but good place with opportunities to advance and good salary. Lots of location so movement requirement possible. Was moving away from manufacturing own products.
good,"Raytheon is a great environment for learning, career development and job security.  Raytheon is also process oriented with a lot of red tape and beaurocracy."
good,Manufacturing defense contractor with plenty of room for employee advancement. Multitude of programs which promote different skills and experience.
good,Work days were full with numerous tasks and project to perform. A safe comfortable work environment was provided with adequate tools and equipment to perform the job at hand. Benefits provided were substantial. A good work/life balance was available and compensation was per industry standards.
good,"My time at Raytheon was a great career experience, Upper management was very helpful and understanding. We all had one clear direction and one goal in mind to provide great customer service."
good,"Good company. They recognize talent and promote from within. It can be a stressful environment at times, but employees are compensated well."
good,"Great Exposure to culture and groups within profession. Raytheon will really have you drinking from fire hose. There is always plenty to do with opportunity if you're hungry enough. Although you have to make it happen yourself, you cannot rely on peers and recommendations. Management will always dangle a carrot in your face no matter how valuable you're to the team."
good,At Raytheon you can be fairly confident that you will have a stable job with interesting work that can effectively last eons if you want it to. Unfortunately compensation does not always accurately reflect work quality.
good,A nice fast-paced type of job with great people to work with as well as great management who cares about work balance life.
good,Enjoy working here. Can be a little redundant at times but overall its a job that pays well for the area. There is opportunity to branch out with the company and work overseas.
good,While at Raytheon I was able to move up the ladder there. I was a pyrotechnic technician and electronic technician. I started from the bottom and rose to the top becoming one of the supervisor their. I had to plan team schedules so we can help train the U.S Military. I also became a first responder.
good,"Company works hard to give employees flexible works schedules such as the 9/80."
good,I is a good place to work. Great people make it easy to make it through the day. The hardest part of my day would be the morning and evening drive home. Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing im building product that help save and protect people.
good,"Had a great time at Raytheon, learned a lot, wish I was still there!"
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Raytheon.  Very good learning, growth and career opportunities."
good,Raytheon has hundreds of internal class to that support each career function to help its employees excel in their field. There are opportunities to transfer to other departments and job functions to add variety and better employee experience.

good,"Raytheon is an employee oriented company, with challenging technical opportunities in the aerospace field."
good,Outstanding Company that provided a quality life/work balance
good,"Typical day consist of inspecting targets and lift assemblies, repairing or building targets and maintaining the range. "
good,"Raytheon is a good company to work with. During the past 8 years,"
good,"My typical day at work consisted of tackling numerous procurement requests, answering employee inquiries, greeting and escorting Clients, answering phones, maintaining databases and filing records.  I learned Government Contract procurement procedures and Accounts Payable and Receivable.  Working with the management team and with my coworkers was a cinch.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up  with the workload and the most enjoyable part was working with some of the great people there."
good,"In the two brief years I worked there, I was shuttled around between 5 different shifts.  They claim to be friendly towards people continuing their education, but it turns out to be the exact opposite and you often have to rely on the mercy of your boss to attend class and exams.  A lot of worth is based on your longevity with the company...maybe that's how it worked 30 years ago, but the workforce is changing, and I would rather see incentives that are performance-based rather than you simply out-lasting all the other people around you.  The company does offer great wages and decent benefits, but one has to wonder if that was due to the CBA or the company's kindness."
good,This is a great place to work. They were very flexible with great benefits.
good,Good work-life balance; challenging assignments; training provided to enhance skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the freedom to express one's ideas to get problems resolved. The hardest part of the job is to work in an environment where there is continuous lay-offs.
good,Work was pretty laid back. FLex time was great as it helped for others who had children and needed the flexibility. Co-workers were   always there to help whenever needed. Hardest part of the job was when management was changed around because they weren't always uniform in how they ran their department. Best part was the freedom to flex time on fridays and that your co-workers were more like friends than co-workers.
good,"Very good company that has been very good to me over the years - offering challenging assignments, opportunities for growth both personally and professionally and there are some real hard working colleagues that I enjoy working with everyday!"
good,"Ability to participate in various aspects of business decision support as a valued member or program and functional teams. The company is receptive to that type of support and its culture embraces continuous improvement initiatives, the Six Sigma process for business and process optimization and the value of mutiple functions solving business problems"
good,good company got to move around and work on different power supplies and performed high voltage checks on them
good,"Fast paced work environment with challenges.  Work with strong problem solving and decision making skills.  Adapt  to quickly learn new systems and processes.  Independent and self motivated.  Able to support multiple managers and leaders while working in a team environment.  Able to work flexibly in a fast paced, changing environment with various disciplines.  Able to meet critical deadlines and develop / apply solutions and process improvements.  Co-workers easy to work with.  The most enjoyable part of the job is completing several deadline in a single day."
good,"Work is contractual based. Learned about project management, client and supplier interface and communications. Most people I have worked with are good, hard working people. Hardest part of job is looking for the next project/program. Most enjoyable part of job is the variety of experience that is obtained from working on various contracts."
good,"La empresa comenzó de la nada, convirtiéndose en una de las más importantes de la provincia. Siendo ejemplo para otras del sector industrial. Tanto en su gestión, organización, ambiente laboral, etc..."
good,Raytheon was a great place to work. Excellent benefits and people were very easy to work with. Company was stable and work/life balance was acceptable.
good,"fast pace jobs, with lots of training and oppertunities for college reimburstment. Managers are to standard. Co-worker are friendly. I loke my job because I get to server my customer and provide of warfighter with the material to keep us safe. It si very rewarding."
good,Was challenged with a large data archiving project. Was given leeway to design and prove a new Informatica process which was successfully used to archive about 650 IMS tables to Oracle. Supportive management and co-workers. A great opportunity to stretch my Informatica skills.
good,"The work day/OT is reasonable (9/80 work schedule for bargaining unit, no mandatory OT) with great pay, PTO, insurance, tuition reimbursement, etc. Management is committed and is easy to work with if you are as well. The work can be hard, but you will learn a lot in the process. I wish there was more disciplinary action instead of heavy reliance on the few people who are willing to go all out to get the job done. Bargaining unit is self serving; aside of pay and benefits it's more of a hindrance than a help for all but those employees with highest seniority. Good opportunities for advancement outside bargaining unit, but layoffs occur very frequently in all areas. The people you work with are the hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job. Met some of the most difficult and immature people working there, but I've also met some of the most interesting and hardest working people there too."
good,"In a typical day I reply to all data calls from our corporate headquaters (organization conflict of interest, proposals not on contract etc.), populate matrix on funding, manage training of contracts deparment, solve funding issues, and organize employee events."
good,Defense contractors are vulnerable to the political climate... when times are rough they lay off lots.
good,I loved working for this company! I know I was only a contractor I would go back if ever called........ I miss you guys! No free lunches but this place is all about the learning experience.....They cultivate leaders.
good,"I came to this job from retail, and it is like night and day. With Raytheon, the compensation for the job at hand is exceptional. I have fun at work and enjoy the laid-back environment it provides"
good,Good place to work for tons of opportunities great experience.
good,Company encourages group activities. Excellent Education Program. The company gets the job done and has a great reputation with its customers.
good,"Raytheon hires a lot of top notch engineers, and works on maintaining a good work / life balance. My only gripe is that they, like most large companies, can get to be a bit bureaucratic."
good,"Raytheon is a very serious business oriented company. They clearly understand customers/stakeholders expectations and meet and exceed their business objectives. They treat Employees well, pay well and provide perks per industry standards. Offer necessary training and provide opportunities to grow. Good company to build your career.Financially sound company and they will be here for long!!"
good,"Programs and projects provide lessons learned and growth in the specific areas of personal interest, and in all areas of business related to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics.  Opportunities to move into management and into other technical areas is encouraged; manufacturing, procurement, quality, systems engineering, leadership roles, analysis group, materials and processes, and much more. Great company to establish work experience."
good,"Welcoming and supportive for new Software Engineers, with lots of potential to develop in your chosen career path. "
good,"As we grow older (and sometimes sick), we start contemplating the life choices we've made in our lives, and to my record, no one ever wishes they had spent more time at work working.  It's always a regret that more time wasn't spent with family/friends.  Having a proper work/life balance allows a person to not have to regret this later in life, and this is of paramount importance to me.  Working here at Raytheon gives me that healthy work/life balance.  Added with the ability to work remote from home just adds another level of my appreciation for where I work."
good,"It is an excellent company to work for, they are always innovating and abreast of the latest technology. Their compensation and benefits are really good."
good,Wonderful professional people and very supportive on the onboarding process.  Excellent facilities and parking  available to contractors and employees
good,Several opportunities for growth and development. Company promotes a diverse working environment and offers several flexible work schedules. Rotation programs are offered in many fields of study.
good,"great company, room for advancement, good benefits. Cool holiday parties. Management can improve. locations world wide........................................................."
good,As long as there is a Union this will be a great place to work. Benefits and time off is better than most. There is assistance for continued education.
good,"Great company to work for as a whole, good training and opportunity for advancement. Pleasant/comfortable work environment and great co-workers. Very good employee benefits package but pay is low for the cost of living in area. I very much enjoyed my time at Raytheon and if I didn't have to relocate I'd probably still be working there. Raytheon is a lifetime career orientated company."
good,"Richmond (Canada) office was an exception and was not indicative of other sites. "
good,"The Orlando team embraced an ""all hands in"" in a collaborative approach to work activity. For the most part, individual team member contributions were welcomed and expected."
good,"I always enjoyed managers that were mostly hands-off and let the individuals thrive. They also did their best to ensure that requested PTO days were given, especially if a good amount of notice was given. I can't recall one instance of PTO being denied. As a Systems Administrator, the technology was somewhat behind the curve, though they were working to improve on that aspect and stay current. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. The people made each day at work feel less of a chore. The most challenging part of the job was the lack of new challenges. The routine occasionally grew to be boring."
good,This was a good company to work for. I like that I was able to move around in different areas. I left because I needed to move away for personal reasons. My only complaint is that making improvements was slow and difficult being that we were so close to the end customer (the different military branches).
good,"I loved working for Raytheon Foreground Security but I was a bit of a fish out of water in that organization. Raytheon/FGS is mostly Pen Testers and SOC people. I am a Static Code Analysis specialist and I was the only one at Raytheon/FGS while I was working there."
good,"Raytheon is a large legacy corporation that is continuously doing what it can to best serve the needs of its existing customers and their legacy programs while exploring new areas of opportunity and innovation.  It is challenging and rewarding on multiple levels, but it is and will always be on the employee to communicate his/her interests to management to be positioned to take advantage of those challenging and rewarding opportunities that continue to become available.  I think it is a terrific place to work, and have only posted on this site to keep my eyes open for a golden opportunity for personal growth ... possibly to even one day return to Raytheon with new skills that will afford myself and the company even more opportunities for innovative new endeavors."
good,"This was a great place to work (no counting the LA traffic).  HR was always helpful.  They work a 9/80 A/B schedule so you either have the first payweek Friday off or the second payweek Friday off (most people took the second).  I was on the first week.  I liked it because if I needed to take time off later in the week, I would have the time to flex after my day off and still get in my hours for the two weeks.  My manager was GREAT.  He was always willing to help and listen to me.  He even pushed education in order to inhance my career, even that meant that I left working for him."
good,"I really enjoy working at Raytheon, but your experience will largely depend on your team-leader, manager, product line, etc.  There is a lot of opportunity for self-growth and advancement."
good,RMS Tucson has seemingly endless opportunities for engineers to work on very exciting projects. Plenty of experienced managers who help you grow and the work/life balance is ideal
good,Overall people are very strong technically and very collaborative. I would recommend people to work there to become experts in an engineering field.  There are world class experts in almost every area.
good,"Raytheon Professional services is a good company to work for.  As a seasoned professional Instructional Designer, I learned new techniques for performing detailed analysis work. This technique lead to a far better curriculum plan and developer blueprints.  I really learned a lot.  I worked  on an expat assignment for the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense."
good,I work in Raytheon IIS. Most of the projects for this side of Raytheon are concerned with creating software and doing information assurance. If you are interested in Software then Raytheon is a great place to work.
good,Great management at the company even with the merger. Very happy to be at Raytheon but due to contracts closing many employees had to find other positions
good,"Raytheon is a good place to work, interesting projects that are not so big as to obscure the end goal. People were professional and fun to work with.  If it wasn't located in So California I would not have left for Seattle."
good,Great company to work for if you are a permanent employee and not a contractor.Great work life balance and the management is great. I just wish my position was a permanent one.
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work. The job is stable but advancement is slow. A lot of times people that aren't working hard and sucking up get the promotions and those that work hard and allow their work to prove their worth get promoted slowly."
good,"The internship revealed a strong culture of learning at Raytheon. I was impressed with how knowledgeable and approachable the employees were. During the internship, the hardest part was developing system requirements and thinking about how to begin developing multiple sub-assemblies to achieve our goals. This was my first time feeling like an electrical engineer and I loved it."
good,Overall it was a great place to work. Definitely stressful at times and could get overwhelming but the pay is fair. The people there a great and it makes it easy to find help and make new friends
good,Raytheon is still trying to build it's company in Colorado Springs.  With that there are lots of positive and some negative things with it.  Overall I've really enjoyed working at this company
good,Many long term friendships that after 25 years have developed into relationship with our children and their friends. I am going to my Goddaughter's wedding at the end of the summer. I met her father 25 years ago.
good,Raytheon is a great place to work to gain valuable experience. The company also provides some flexible work hours and a work/life balance with great benefits
good,The job was unique and requires over 17 top secret clearances.  There is high level of trust and exceptions of each person.  Because of the sensitive material we never discussed our work so all conversations was about our personal interested or hobbies or home life.  We never competed for one another jobs.  We all learned in time to do all aspects of the jobs.
good,"The culture takes some getting use to, but once you're in and begin to navigate the work environment you can be successful. The Managers usually encourage career growth."
good,Everyone was professional mostly military personnel. Traveled out of the country 80% of the time hardest part. The most enjoyable was the family environment great relationships made.
good,"Great job, creative and smart people. Always new and interesting work if you like challenging yourself. Supportive managers that will help you grow however you need to seek your own help and be willing to leave your comfort zone if you want to get anywhere in the company."
good,Flex time to allow work life balance made it easier to maintain perfect attendance. Attention to respecting others while getting the job done was a strong emphasis in the working environment. I learned the importance of integrity and the impact it has on self and others.
good,Highly Ethical with lots of training.  Opportunity to expand and grow.  Management listens to ideas. Will work with daily schedules of personel.
good,Great company and place to build career. Fast paced with ability to work on state of the art technologies. I would recommend anyone to work for Raytheon.
good,"Advancement was always available. Work hard...you are rewarded by either a bonus or advancement. Management understood. Six Sigma was a huge part of getting things done, and it was employed wisely."
good,"Contact work--budgets, customer focused.  Worked with great people, willing to learn.  Management rarely around--they were off managing larger projects and seemed to forget we were there unless something went wrong.  Overall good experience."
good,As a intern at Raytheon I got a really close look at the environment people worked in. It was a very fun place to every body cheerful with a smile on their face. As an intern I didn't really get to see much because thing was classified and my access key card could only open certain doors.
good,Working at Raytheon has been very challenging and rewarding. The company has served me well for the last 6 years with its very supportive managment and rest of the engineers in my team.
good,"pay scale above average"
good,Enjoyed fast paced environment. Very competitive. Busy job working for site executive for corporate headquarters of IDS. Enjoyed working with many different people and the organization skills that I was challenged with.
good,"My days started at 6:30 AM and went to 3:00 PM. "
good,Training soldiers and marines always a pleasure. The biggest dividends are seeing those soldiers or marines that were trained return from deployments
good,"Interesting work, good management, good benefits"
good,Large defense company with many great opportunities to move to different departments and continue growth in your career path.
good,"Working large defense programs you'll sometimes get lost in the fray, Raytheon is no exception managing large slow-paced defense programs."
good,This project is very good to learn Radar professional knowledge
good,Great company to work for lots of diversity and ethics. Good benefits 
good,I worked directly with UAE solders in operations and maintenance of all electronic sytems
good,International work can be most rewarding. Special programs have good strong teams.
good,I learnt a great deal of skills while at raytheon which have helped me during my recent study towards a degree.
good,Great office environment. Most people are fun and easy to work with. Benefits and great compensation for what I needed to do. Management was easy to work with and open minded. My only wish was that I had more work involving different tasks rather than performing the same task over and over again.
good,I've had the opportunity to work with a broad range of very talented people. The work environment is fast-paced and interesting when the work is plentiful and can be a bit slow when work is harder to come by.
good,"Unusual days in the sand. Frequent rocket attacts, facilities poor."
good,Fast paced work environment with flexibility a must. Daily requirements to challenge the every day tasks and to be innovative.
good,"Raytheon has a very supportive management team, exceptional benefits, and a very welcoming culture. It was great to work for such a good company. It is a wonderful place to work."
good,This is a great company. Work-life balance is well respected at the company and compensation is competitive. Hardest part of the job is learning policy and procedures that vary by customer.
good,"I enjoyed my time there immensely."
good,"Nice place to work very out going culture/ can be fast pace some times, Management was very strict some times but very honest with there employees. Pay was good."
good,"A great place to work with the chance of advancement within the plant. Once you are full time the perks are much better. Time off work as needed, also you can get the mandatory hours you need to get anyway during the week. Also you can get all the overtime you want as long as there is work to do."
good,"big corporation, great place to work for.  good benefits and great pay."
good,"Retired from Raytheon, Enjoyed my time there. The Management was very receptive to the needs of both the customers and employees alike. I would recommend working for Raytheon,"
good,Learned alot on many projects.  Only leaving because I got stuck on a team where the tech lead was remote and it was hard to get enough guidance.  Otherwise a great experience.
good,"My work was test related in a new construction shipyard on ships under construction in various states of completion.  Work was often hot, dirty, and stressful.  This work is not typical of work normally done by Raytheon but was an offshoot of design engineering work performed for the U. S. Navy LPD 17 Class Amphibious ships.  The design and integration work was accomplished in San Diego, Ca.  I was responsible for system installation, initiation, and testing before turn over to the U. S. Navy"
good,"Outstanding Company  Loved working with the program manager for the Warfighter Focus Program in Kabul.  Unfortunately,  I was not comfortable with the prospect of living full time on a military compound in the middle of a war zone."
good,"I love the people in Salt Lake.  If there were any way for me to advance in my current job, or move into the business side of things, I would. I'm only considering leaving for advancement."
good,"Quality of work was very important, and that is much appreciated.  The expertise was fantastic to draw upon when needed.  Management is trained for best management practices, too."
good,One of the most cooperative work environments I have experienced.  Staff at all levels worked to solve issues and work across group boundries in a professional manner.
good,"If you like research but want decent pay, like some awesome challenges and be around with some of the smartest people in town, this is the place to be."
good,Everyone I worked with was willing to go the extra mile. we were a team.
good,"Busy with coordinating departments, budgets, projects and Customer issues. Very rewarding job our customer was the Department of Education and turned a profit of 14 million annually with Garanteed Student loan, National Student load, and Direct Student load."
good,"Excellent place to work. Company is very good to employees,and works with employees currently enrolled in school."
good,I liked what I did every day. I did not like the union though due to not being able to advance and getting payed as much as someone who sits at there desk all day and reads the news paper.
good,"Assembling and adjusting procedures to achieve and maintain critical tolerances and measurements, for example, assembling compressor or turbine sections to assure proper clearance between rotor and stator assemblies, assure proper clearances in main bearings to allow for heat expansion, or matching turbine nozzle vanes to assure required airflow. Using precision measuring instruments common to the occupation such as micrometers and feeler and stretch gages to check used parts for deviation from original specifications and selecting matching parts, and dynamic balancing machines to determine and correct imbalance of rotor assemblies. Using dial indicators to check and adjust end play of gears and rotors and measure vane openings when assembling jet engine nozzles. Selecting proper tools, assembly jigs, and fixtures to perform work efficiently and safely. Using torque wrenches to get required tension on bolts and"
good,"Raytheon is the cream of the crop. This company has everything from great training, to excellent salaries and great benefits. I highly recommend this company to anyone who wants a great career."
good,"This was my best job ever, Good management with overseas possibilities. Allowed to work very independently. very good work environment and culture. Was very happy there."
good,"Great, stable place to work!  Excellent benefits with paid Holiday, vacation and sick days.  Very nice people to work with.  Great atmosphere and no overtime."
good,"Very flexiable in allowing you to set your time of work.  I mostly started at 0600 and was off at 1430.  I learned that a contract to support another company is not a guaranutee.  It is a year to year decision.  You have not control.  If the contract ends, it is time to find another job.  I enjoyed working for this company, I wish I could have stayed."
good,"The management was very reliable, understanding and helpful in flight progressions. They allowed very reasonable schedules and permitted lots of family time. The atmosphere was always relaxed, but the job was done right the first time because there was that mutual level of respect."
good,"Excellent Company with great benefits. Difficult to get hired on full time.  Flexable hours and demanding work."
good,"Come in work clock in start working everyone is nice to each other and talkative too. I learned multiple jobs bonding, making cold plates ect. The management is great friendly and nice and understands you if you have a problem. The co-workers are the best nice always has a   smile on there face and welcomes you everyday you come in. The hardest part of the job is just moving around a lot to work when your already started something but other than that its pretty easy. The most enjoyable part is the amount of breaks you get and how friendly the co-workers are."
good,"6:00 to 2:30"
good,"Raytheon is a good company to work for, there are many oportunites for development and if you decide you don't like the type of work you are doing, you can always move to another part of the company.  They have great benefits and training resources."
good,They have consistency of work flow. They believe in holidays and giving their employees time off. Employees can get early vacations with pay. They also have great benefits. They believe in taking care of their staff.
good,Over all a great company.  But through the years benefit packages have gotten worse.  Those of us who have been there lost shift premiums and are slow to advance.
good,Raytheon is a great company to work for but I was promised a full time job after contracting and they reneged. I did have 5 different managers in 5 years so that was also an issue. The benefits were great (for full time people) and co-workers were wonderful to work with. Training was abundant and helpful in career development. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was in the field where you could work independently. Iwould highly recommend working for this company.
good,Accomplished much detail work daily.
good,"off site employee  8 hour work day, worked multiple shifts, no weekends. Management failed to uphold aspects of the contract and therefore it has now been lost by Raytheon."
good,"Management was very strict, not much breathing room. Downtime was excessive. Waiting to get contracts was brutal. Coworkers were very nice and did work as a team. no real leadership, waiting for layoffs was brutal with no announcements, you would clock in and managers would tell you to go. NO NOTICES of layoffs."
good,"Functional Management vision and motivational approach is unfortunately offset in one division by dysfunctional, at best, program management. A typical day at work involves requesting approval to issue proposals after management review, contacting customers to ensure satisfaction in performance"
good,"As an intern, there was very little to review in the span of time I worked there. "
good,"Even though the work can be fulfilling, the focus on the job is all about making the schedule; leading to, sometimes, unacceptable results and product quality."
good,"Job was eliminated so not great for job security at IIS.  Great colleagues and challenging work.  One of the best network of peers I have ever worked with."
good,"Blackbird Technologies and what's left of it's staff and executives are wonderful people, great culture, feels like home. But, new staff (some management), new company changes are not ethical, not qualified and dragging the name of Raytheon in mud."
good,Co-workers were nice to work with.  Poor management for the area I worked in.
good,I like my job. I need a challenge after 23 years of working here. Not much room for advancement for me at this time. I will begin school in the fall to continue my Bachelors Degree.
good,I had high expectations for this company when I was recruited. I left my previous job of five years with an offer of pay increase and opportunity for growth. I was sadden to have been laid off based on their budget cuts shortly after 5 months.
good,"About working at this company in Riyadh (Raytheon Technical Services Middle East Ltd Intelligence, Information and Services)"
good,"Everything is fine here, except for Job security."
good,"I provide operational leadership to the operators within a Class 100 Advanced Products Assembly Center.

I am responsible for staffing, managing day to day work execution, product quality, meeting customer goals, people safety, people development, requesting supplies, coordinating and conducting training and scheduling production plans.  Responsible for providing leadership to teams from 20 - 30 employees in a team based manufacturing environment on 3 separate shifts."
good,great company very prductive
good,"I really enjoyed working at Raytheon. The Flexible work schedule was a major plus, especially being a summer intern. Aditionally, all employees were very willing to contribute to helping me learn the daily actions of Raytheon BBN Technologies."
good,"it really depends on which program or project you work on at raytheon, I worked on a big program so it was hard to move up in the workplace and get recognition for my work."
good,"No comment at this moment.  A typical day is relaxing. I've learned quite a deal while working here.  The workplace culture is great.  The hardest part for me is understanding the engineering field, since I don't have a degree in that field."
good,"Unfortunately Raytheon lost the contract that caused concern due to the lack of information and history of the contract winner.  I choose to take a higher paying position with a more stable and higher value contract entity."
good,"At the reception desk, you have quite a few people to greet that are very nice, military and civilians alike."
good,"Good technically challenging work. 9 80 works schedule. Hours can be long. Opportunities to grow, workplace culture is good, lots of senior engineers working."
good,I learned that working with a like minded team helps to make sure that all goals set forth are met for the customer. The best part of the job was the interaction with students and the training which I was able to give while on platform and through exercises and testing for understanding of material given.
good,"I was only working a short term contract but they treated us like gold so, I and everyone else on the project gave them 110%. I would love to work with them again."
good,"Open the pool each day and close it down each evening, depending on schedule and hours. "

good,"For the right people that can pass the security standards I would highly recommend this place, the attitudes are right, and the people are great. Understanding Managers."

good,Working for Raytheon Defense Systems in UAE (Abu Dhabi) and (Dubai)  was the best job ever. The work was great and the company took care of every single need and want. Getting to start and finish a security project for an entire country head security agency was complicated but exciting. I look forward to another chance to go back.
good,Very fast pace. Project was behind schedule so management were very nervous to try to keep up with schedule. It would have been a nice place to work for if it had not been of schedule chaos.
good,Great employer. Very supportive and productive. Raytheon is excellent place to work. I would recommend Raytheon to any person looking to challenge their minds and broaden their experience.

good,Worked here since my graduation which has been more than 9 years. Work environment is good. Supervisors are very helpful and treat you with respect. Co-workers are capable and you can learn a lot from them.
good,Worked in an aviation and medical simulation environment for military contractors. My experience with each contractor in the same work environment and job position was positive for the most part. The work culture within the military community is always a fun job.
good,"Enjoyed the work. Work and life balance was difficult at times due to the management of deployments, etc. Promotions and advancement was always available."

good,Uma empresa de ótimo escalão. Uma empresa que valoriza os funcionários independente de qualquer cargo.
good,"Love the pay, benefits, and current role but culture is very tough to acclimate to and I tell most people to give it a year.  HR&S organization is a very 'silo'd' in New England and the Company overall has  a very young Senior Leadership team and typically promotes younger, less experienced members vs. those with lots of experience from various industries."
good,I worked in a reproduction department with 2 shifts. We made blue prints and secret and top secret documentation for the military and DOD (Department Of Defense)
good,"This is a very typical defense industry environment.  There is a lot of emphasis on getting the job done well and on time.   "

good,Good job the only thing i did not like was when i got laid off after working there 7 years and had to find another job. it was a very laid back job as long as you did what you were suppose to do.
good,"I would have liked to stay in my position until I retired. The manager that I had was very poor. For some reason, he did not like me. When a huge reduction in force was on its way, he suddenly moved me to another program and I was laid off. i.e. last in, first out."
good,Aerospace. No specific comment allowed. Good cafeteria. Good food truck in back. El Segundo has a nice little downtown scene. But it was a temporary assignment. Nice while it lasted.

good,Nice job to get just out of the military.  Worked for them on a small island in the south Atlantic.  Very little home time.
good,Everyday you learn to work with a new situation.  The people have been here for a very long time and are knowledgeable yet not very open to many new ideas.
good,"I worked with their Professional Service Group that was contracted to GM.  There was not much room for advancement, however the people you worked with were very good."
good,"NOTE: I am a contractor for a security company. My review is based solely on security company. Raytheon is a GREAT company. Its clean and well maintained. The security company and supervisor made promises that were not kept! Also if you're sick or need a day off supervisor made threats of ""firing"" you. And don't make complaints about anything because you will not be heard."
good,A typical day at work is no different than any other company. Some days are reasonable and some days of work are stressful. Project based culture where you are accountable for each hour work spent on the project.

good,Great company. Very process oriented. Sometimes stressful and demanding. Closed environment. Lot of restrictions and compliance to rules. Micro management. HR department sucks.

good,"Travel to supplier locations to resolve both technical and administrative issues with Supplier contracts.  Guide suppliers in RCCA and Quality relayed processes (FMEA, QPs and metrics). I learned time management and high level of organization skills.  Immediate Management was distant (Dallas, TX and Boston, MA), we worked in a Cross Business Function supporting multiple projects. My peers were great, there were 26 of us across the country, we all supported each other.  The hardest part of the job was the very extensive travelling (about 95%) and having to be away from my family. The most enjoyable aspect of my job was the new challenges weekly to work with new programs and projects."
good,"Overall a really good place to work. The ""El Segundo, South"" is a better-than-average campus. Compensation is commensurate with So Cal Defense industry - very high in comparison with most other industries. My work was satisfying for most of my time there. Non-engineering support roles are relatively underfunded, but have been improving results because of efficiencies afforded by technologies. Many of the middle managers are resistant to change, and slow to recognize the benefits of improving contributors' ""soft"" skills (e.g., communication, negotiation, process focus, customer focus)."

good,"Not bad fun place to work. You work a lot of hours which sucks  sometimes"
good,Good Company to work for.  Advancement opportunities depend on location. Lots of beneficial training.  Good medical benefits. Working remotely is a perk.  Would think about working for company again but in another location. Overall recommend this company.
good,"The typical work day consisted of meetings with key leaders, sponsors, and technical resources to ensure project success.  Days are fast paced and generally extended beyond the standard work hours.  I was able to take advantage of the companies work remote work and 9/80 work schedule.  Overall, I find it a great place to work."

good,Company growth is managed well across all business units.  Raytheon maintains high ethical standards for employees and in dealing with the Government.
good,Learned much about Earned value methods and third party vendor relations. Long project timelines and always work to be completed
good,The people with whom I work are excellent and professional individuals. The job requires a great deal of flexibility to ever changing training and mission requirements. Requires to be comfortable with both classroom and field training environments.
good,Very good company to work with. I enjoyed my stat there. Very helpful co workings willing to show and train you on things you had not grasped completely.
good,Raytheon is a great company.  Its a defense contractor for the government which provides products to keep this country safe.  The tenure for most employees are at least 20 years are more.

good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot about airplanes and the importance of keeping to schedule with very little room for error.
good,A typical day at work is supporting the War fighter for the Air Force by maintaining ground communications network.
good,The good:
good,"A typical day at work, would be, arriving to work at least with 15 minutes to spare. Clock in, gather all my supplies, check my safety equipment, read instructions to what I'm going to be working on to see if there has been any changes to the SOP, then work deligently with fewest errors as possible. I have learned more indepth to what I already knew about electronics and more hands on the more I know and feel comfortable. Management was tough, but fair. Co-workers are great as long as everyone is on the same page. Hardest part of a job to me is interacting with co workers at times. You just don't know if they left home unhappy and brought it to work with them. The most enjoyable part of a job to me is the pay check."
good,"I would recommend this company to any one who is looking for a job in business, military contracts, engineering or computer networking."
good,"There's no strict time to come in, except that standup meetings are every morning at 10am. They encourage working with others or on your own and even working remote, if needed."
good,"Pros:"
good,"great place to work, the culture is very inviting and after learning the basics you are let off the leash so to speak, i havnt worked here long but most employees enjoy the work"
good,Raytheon is a great place to work and grow professionally. I've been there for almost 15 years and started at a low level. Raytheon presented many opportunities to move up and pursue my goals.
good,I really enjoyed my position at Raytheon.  I was learning so much and doing more than what was expected of me. There were times when I had to work overtime and they were fine with that.  All 5 of my Project Managers said I was helpful and caring
good,"There are tons of great managers who are intelligent, patient, kind, and encouraging, and inspiring. A lot of opportunities to learn and advance your career. Everyone is great to work with, very helpful and responsive."
good,Raytheon provides an excellent place to grow your skills and learn from exceptional engineers. Management does a great job providing access to training and tips to advance in the company.
good,"There is a possibility, however, to get ""pigeon-holed"" into a position or area of expertise. Micro-Management was an issue for me, but understandable due to the nature of their business and clientele."
good,"Day and night shift work together in a friendly environment, pass downs of shift work completed always given along with team briefs.  Great place to work they make it a fun and new things to do every day."
good,"A typical day at work involved putting on body armor for the drive to the teaching location. Once there we provided English instruction and test preparation to the Afghan Air Force. The students were generally great, receptive, and engaged. Occasionally classes would be cut short by a power outage or a security threat. I learned perspective from my students; most were born shortly before 9/11 and had grown up with war. Most had a story about a family member imprisoned or killed by the Taliban. As a teacher, I learned to tightly structure instruction around the needs of students - a classroom of young Afghan Air Force officers has little patience for extraneous material. The workplace culture was generally supportive amongst coworkers. There was a camaraderie born of our unusual circumstances (those without a certain temperament tended not to stay long in theater). My immediate supervisors were supportive and realistic. The hardest parts of the job were the fact that you were a) basically always ""at work"", b) so far from home, and c) generally confined to those areas where security could be provided by friendly forces, however I would call the pay commensurate with the disadvantages, and management was generally accommodating when it came to scheduling time off."
good,I have Fun at work.  I truly love what I do.  I enjoy my job.  I have a great report with employees.  My manager is the best.  I love everything my work.
good,I worked around great people and management.  The only reason I would leave is to get into a different work field or to get better pay.  Sometimes it is easier to advance by leaving and then coming back instead of going straight up the ladder.
good,"Raytheon knows its mission and executes strategies and tactics to support it.  They are very much ""on script"" with highly development processes.  Employees are given minimal autonomy, but the pay, benefits, access to training, and career development resources are all excellent."
good,"I like Raytheon even I have to pay for my own cup of coffee. everything top secret here but I have no complaint. "
good,"Raytheon is an exceptional company to work within and as a market leader with vast opportunities, employees can make contributions that are meaningful and satisfying. Contracting through an outside agency, however, does not allow easy transition into interviewing for another position as a permanent employee once a contract is completed. I found that I had invested extensively to develop professionally, had received positive review of the work generated, but yet was not helped to move to another subsidiary or department for continuation of a contract at the end. This was very disappointing."
good,The job required more experience than what I had. I learned new job tasks to perform the duty required. Management was okay. Workplace culture was okay. The hardest part of the job was working the radio. It was enjoyable because I learned new skills. This job is part-time and I would like the opportunity to return to become more proficient at the job.
good,Great Defense Contractor to work for.  Great diversity however some programs may have too many retired Army Colonels or higher who sometimes have problems adjusting to a civilian culture.
good,"Raytheon has a great work-life balance, that you are able to manage your own schedule daily. I like that every other week that I had Fridays off in order to spend more time with my family."
good,"with a great mission"
good,"Getting customer to valid equipment on site to prevent discrepancies."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about this company. They have excellent benefits, and is a good place to start a new career. There are people in management who tend to hire people who act, and look like them."
good,"There are a lot of opportunities to advance but usually only to a certain threshold then you remain in orbit indefinitely."
good,I was with Hughes Aircraft/Raytheon for 32 years.  All in all it is an excellent company to work for.  Raytheon does have great team effort and individual education is encouraged.
good,Great benefits compared to other companies of this nature; flexible schedule that allows for a nice work/life balance. Enjoyable work environment with co-workers who love their work and are great at what they do.
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work - challenging projects, with challenging obstacles to overcome. Adapting old-school aerospace heritage to new-school high-technologies..."
good,Many years working for Raytheon & Texas Instrument nice place to work great people understanding about family great benfits great bosses great location
good,Limited job security as jobs were linked to specific government contracts. Provided a great opportunity to gain experience in management and with Federal Contracting regulations.
good,"Each department varies but overall most areas are flexible in terms of a typical workday's start/end time as long as required weekly hours are completed or PTO/Modified time is recorded. The culture is distinctive to most Engineering/Manufacturing businesses - relaxed, casual and friendly but also can be very busy and stressful at times depending on volume of work or items that are contractually due. The hardest part of the job is trying to resolve an issue when the single point of contact isn't available. I have seen in multiple areas the lack of cross training where only certain people know certain things and when they are unavailable, everything is at a standstill awaiting their return. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendliness amongst peers/management, the flexibility and having every other Friday off. :)"
good,typical day was conducting a closing of a department within the company.  Not much was learned and not too challenging.  I did enjoy working none the less
good,"Good people, hard to fit into at first.  Some very good people working here.  There are a lot of places to transfer within the company and travel is limited for most."
good,"Job is easy"
good,It's a hard company to break into but once in the benefits are great. Fair leadership. Potential for advancement. Works as one big cohesive family. Good company
good,This was a great job. I loved learning new and interesting things. the engineers I worked with were exceptional and I learnt something new each day for 5 years. We had company toonie and loonie draws for employees who wanted to participate each Friday. Elegant Christmas parties for employees. Good benefits and company profit sharing.
good,Helicopters had major components that had to be replaced at certain amount of flying hours.  It was a challenge each day as you had to climb on top of the aircraft to do any king on inspection or maintenance.  The structure of the helo took a lot wear and tear due to aircraft vibrations (a major issue with helos) and the helicopter was continuously in repair for structure issues such as cracks on the frame and panels of the helicopter.
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work. The culture in the work place is great, the staff has it's pro and cons, but at the end its a good place."
good,As a senior systems engineer I was exposed to many levels of very challenging and exciting work projects. An excellent learning experience for engineering and science in general as it applies to critical US military products.
good,"Coordinate construction designs for air traffic facilities with the FAA, contractors and local authorities.  Review FAA designs before submitting to contractors for bids."
good,outstanding people. great benefits. fun place to work.. I had chance to grow and learn new jobs... given the chance I would return.. such a great company..
good,"Raytheon is a great company overall."
good,"Working  for Raytheon at the Schofield BAX in Hawaii was at times challenging and demanding due to dynamic changes in scheduling from the Army units that use the Range. I have learned much more about team leadership, and program management that I expected coming from a previous leadership position in the Navy as a Chief."
good,Raytheon consists of several divisions covering a variety of industries --  many of which are government defense related. I always took great pride in the high quality and technologically advanced products we produced for the military (our end user).
good,"Raytheon is a good company to work for that works hard at it's ethics, environmental safety, and inclusiveness programs."
good,Expectations are high in this fast paced environment.  If you are willing to work hard you can go far.
good,"great co-workers, interesting work. management was easy to get along with. Loved the job"
good,Managed front office. Badged in visitors/clients. Co workers were excellent. I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,great place to work and retire with lot of opportunity notjing more to say
good,"A typical day was going to our group meeting with first shift, swiffering, alcohol wiping areas in the clean room, cleaning bathrooms, mopping, taking out trash from cubicles, and helping clean other buildings as needed."
good,"Early mornings with flexible work schedules. I learned that you can make a difference in the lives of others based on the attitude you carry. The hardest part of the job is living and working in an austere environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching, coaching, and mentoring."
good,Good Company and they have great benefits.  Flex schedule and well educated co-workers.
good,"Through Raytheon I added many skills to my resume, here are a few:"
good,One of the best places I've ever worked.  What I learned here shaped me as a professional.
good,Aerospace and Defense industry is in decline. I want to work in a more secure industry.
good,"There are no typical days, each day presents new challenges. I learned how to work with the US government concerning logistics, how to work with the military concerning shipping requirements both domestic and internationally. The coworkers were respectful, friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with multiple programs who all had there own agenda's each day. The most enjoyable part was the satisfaction of supplying the US soldiers with the equipment they need to protect the US and it's allies."
good,Fun place to work. Good hours lots of overtime available. Nice co-workers
good,Every day brings new challenges.  The company is very willing to give you a work schedule that revolves around your life.  They are also more than willing to assist you in any way. Co-workers are great and highly knowledgeable.
good,Dealt with Military and Foreign visitors. Would set briefings with local government agencies. I learn the values of other countries as well as our military personal which are great and thanks to them we live in this great country. My co-workers are very reliable the hardest part of our jobs was to get management understand the importance of our job and why certain procedures had to be followed. I enjoyed coming to work every day dealing with different people from different countries and their customs.
good,Very laid back atmosphere and offers flexible work schedules to accommodate work/life balance. Offers excellent benefits and compensation packages. It is amazing to be part of an organization with such an outstanding reputation. And it is the people that make you stay. Working with brilliant minds who are looking out for the security of our country makes me feel proud.
good,A typical day would involve breifings to the team on work required to ensure the 'big picture' would be seen and better understood.
good,Great place to work for until it was bought out by another company and they laid everyone off.
good,"Checking e-mails, shipping items, inventories"
good,"Routine daily task, be attentive to details"
good,"Good experience on this company before they closed there door for production here in Mountain View,CA"
good,"My Raytheon manager always told me this is a great company to begin and end with.  I agree with his sentiment.  If you are looking to start in this field, it's fantastic to mentor you to success.  Yet, if you want to get promoted and be given better pay increases; leave them for a few years for a few promotions and pay bumps before returning."
good,Great team to work with. I have been working with this team for about 11 years and they have became a family. Very enjoyable place to spend time building stronger training systems.
good,Great place to work with opportunities for advancement. Competitive pay. Great insurance benefits. Stable company. Seemed to be well managed. I would work there again in necessary.
good,Excellent company with a motivating mission. Willing to invest in employees to foster growth and global collaboration. A company comprised of very intelligent individuals.
good,I believed working at Raytheon was worth the experience and shared many great talents with other co-workers for them to endure. I recommend anyone with the right qualifications to work under a government based corporation such as Raytheon.
good,Interesting work. Good management depending on who is your manager. Tucson controls most of the work coming to Huntsville but once you make connections in Tucson you can work some really cool programs. Decent cafeteria food.
good,I worked overseas with the company on a great team with a great mission. Raytheon provides the perfect opportunity for a transitioning service member that either retired or served many years. Provides a way to make the transition to a ‘civilian’ job but still work within the military framework. Raytheon provides great benefits to their overseas employees and is a great company to work for. Only downside is their overseas work is dedicated 24/7 and not standard rotation schedule in and out of theatre. That being said you can take PTO on a set schedule to break up your time in country.
good,"Check Emails for PO updates, vendor responses, acct status. "
good,"My role is very broad and every day brings new challenges.  Raytheon has a commitment to ethical behavior and leadership.  This is not a place that holds your hand or micromanages.  There is an emphasis on flexible work environment (working remotely) and employees can work nine days out of ten (9/80 work week), which allows for good work/life balance."
good,I enjoyed my time and would work there again if I could find a position in Nevada or Arizona related to my skillset. Some of the positions had flexible time which was nice.
good,Excellent pay and benefits.  Production hours within the Operations Department are long and can be challenging for work/life balance.  Other areas are much more accommodating.
good,"Great working culture, nice facilities, takes the job very seriously. Protocol and meeting deadlines and group goals are all priorities. Benefits seemed good, though I did not apply for them."
good,"Great place to work.  Up to the individual to progress in their career.  Opportunities are plentiful if you think outside the box."
good,Raytheon was a fantastic company to work for.  They paid very well for the area.  The only drawback was the fact that it is only defense work for  Fort Wayne.  The loss of multiple contracts caused several years of layoffs.
good,"I work for higher up branch officers, LTC, 2 start generals, and provided all IT support. I would come in to work and drive and 1 1/2 and work more than 15 hours a day and drive home. I was tired often no time to self but enjoyed the environment."
good,"participated in daily meetings and feedback. Manage site areas and preparation for daily tasks. depending on the day and orders that needed to be out, most days are very busy and challenging."
good,Co-located with military personnel offered an experience like no other. Working side by side with the US Army allowed for direct communication throughout the program.

good,"Contract employee: Great company! Enjoyed Every aspect of my employment. Did not want to contract to end. Challenging, Employee oriented, exceptional people, exceptional leadership.  First Rate!"
good,this is my 5th company and raytheon is by far the best company i  have worked for .  there is definitely work that is stressful but the people there are relaxed and happy . Current manager is good too
good,It was the experience that lead me to go after my degree. Because I want to work in a progessive company despite budget cuts at the time I learn more about computers and was given task that where both stimulating and enjoyable. The company kept normal bank hoildays and didnt seem to mind a little over time.
good,Working with a company well known for their outstanding commitment in helping the community and for allowing growth within the company. Strong management within the whole company.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Raytheon, and would be happy to work for them in the future. They gave me many opportunities to expand my skills and to work on new projects. They encouraged me to stretch my skills."
good,"It was a very relaxed atmosphere.  When crunch time came there was alway someone available to help out.  We worked as a team sometimes, such as on year end events, etc...which I enjoyed even being the shy one."
good,"Enjoyed working at Raytheon, and great career stepping stone.  There are good stable programs at Raytheon and the overall compensation/benefits package is good."
good,Raytheon does well at training it's employees and really invests in their career.  Raytheon is competitive with wages and has great benefits.  Personal time off is average.
good,I enjoyed working for Raytheon as a production assistant. There were many opportunities to challenge myself. I excelled within the special environment we were working in. The machines we used were very interesting and they have shown me how quickly a specialized production environment functions under consistently short time constraints. I had fun working for Raytheon.
good,"I enjoy working at Raytheon.  I have worked in defense contracting for ten years.  The people are hard working and driven to success.  "
good,"I was able to pick what I wanted to work on, and the stress was not too high. the workplace culture was fairly laid back and the mangers looked out for the people under them."
good,You get to work in a location that the majority of the people on earth will never get to experience.  It was a fun job that allowed me to meet people from all over.  The travel around the job is great too.
good,Very good place to work had to relocate to take care of father. Very good benefits and retirement options. Health insurance was very good. Hope to get a job with a company as good as they are.
good,"Daily morning status meeting of open items and issues."
good,"I worked on a long term contract for a particular customer. The working environment is top notch. This is a collaborative, team approach environment. The rest is company confidential."
good,I started as a ME in the machine shop working with the high speed machines. I was responsible for improvements in the machining area. I went to training to become a six sigma expert.
good,"I've worked for Raytheon for just under 10 years.  I cannot say anything bad about my employment with the Raytheon organization.  The culture is inclusive and you learn something new every day. They promote hiring from within if you are trained to do a job, and a typical day at work goes fairly quickly as you stay busy most of the time.  There is plenty of management support in development."
good,"I learned a few new systems, and worked on some new types of equipment. Worked with good people, and got to know some of the Saudi military personnel."
good,lots of interesting products manufactured. lots of training and opportunity to move within the company. great benefits and retirement options. very good company.
good,"The only issue I ever had with working at Raytheon was the management rotation that only seemed to take place when it was unnecessary.  If a program was struggling, management wouldn't change.  However, when an area was doing well, they would switch management around and the area would suffer almost every single time.  I understand that the rotational process was designed to provide experience to those members of management seeking to beef up their resumes, but I think they could've found a way to do that without having such a detrimental impact on general production, product quality, and commitment to customer satisfaction."
good,"Raytheon Missile Systems values collaborative activities producing an exciting working environment that values creativity, innovation.  Management is continually reinventing methods on ranking and rating contributions of the employees, valuing personal as well as professional life balance.  The hardest part of the job is finding specific skilled personnel with self-motivation early in their career.  Mentorship-apprenticeship programs are objectively measured that occasionally miss the intangible aspects of teacher-student relationships.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the ""light-bulb"" turn on in a junior engineer, when they get it and begin working autonomously."
good,You work in a fast paced and no nonsense community. Most of the work I did was on classified government contracts and in northern Virginia. Traffic was the only issue I had with the job.
good,"Great people, great place to work. But sometimes there is more Overtime then you want or can handle. And the Waltham office has the worst traffic I have ever experienced."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is rebuilding a users computer and recovering all of their data. The user data at Raytheon is both sensitive and critical. When they discover that I recovered all their data they are extremely happy and grateful.
good,Raytheon is a Great place to work!  They provide great benefits and great compensation!  The work is exciting and rewarding.  Management is understanding of family!
good,Raytheon provides a well rounded and growth oriented environment with a focus on training and professional development.  They adhere to and fold into the culture of the company an element of excellence and customer satisfaction that is evident in all business dealings.
good,"Work 9 hours per day, attend daily production meetings with Program Teams and support groups plan schedule and release shop-orders from the computer ERP/MRP system, work on the Production shop floor identifying issues, expediting the appropriate personnel to resolve issues affecting production, coordinating priorities within the Work-Cells, prioritize assemblies to be worked on and management reporting as to progress of the builds."
good,"Working 9 hours a day was good, taking classes to improve your knowledge of development, testing and what the company entiles was good.  The most enjoyable part is sharing your knowledge with other developers/tester"
good,Never had a job that truly care for you like family. No stress always help with any situation. The best company I work for since I retired in 2004.
good,"The recession a few years ago got everyone nervous about keeping their jobs and companies, to include Raytheon, understandably sought to cut costs.  Many benefits were reduced and the cost to the employee, particularly for health care, went up.  Now that the economy and company are well-off, the benefits we lost have not been restored.  It's the new norm, and I'm certain this isn't unique to Raytheon, but nontheless, a company that wants to retain it's talent should pass along the prosperity as quickly as it makes cuts when times are tough."
good,Diverse international programs allow for enhanced opportunity for travel to multiple locations. Travel well coordinated and supported.
good,I've met a lot of people from all over the US.  I've learned a lot about different cultures.  My co-workers are a good group of guys in and out of work.  Management is easy to talk to.  I appreciate being able to get out of work early and spending time with my wife and kids.
good,"My most enjoyable part of my job is the compensation.  I work extremely long hours not including the extensive travel that is required of me. I have learned a lot from my colleagues, as they are true professionals of their craft."
good,"The only down side to working with Raytheon, as with all DoD Contractors is the loss of a contract can result in law offs. Other than that this is an outstanding company to work for."
good,A great place to work. Have excellent co-workers. In enjoy work on Fort Bliss. I enjoy working with and instructing soldiers.
good,"All customers must be our top priority per their requests."
good,Was taught the waterfall and scrum engineering cycles. I enjoy the scrum environment more than the waterfall. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the development schedules.
good,The most enjoyable part of my workday is the diverse community.  I love the people I work with and their profession and technical competence.  My managers are unique but very competent.  The hardest part is the facilities.  The work area is inconsistent and humbling.
good,Strong defense and aerospace company mainly focused on government contracts.  Lots of opportunities for growth.  Productive co-workers.  Can be too bureaucratic at times.
good,"Excellent work environment, cutting edge technologies, very smart engineers, nice people.  One of the best companies that I have ever worked for."
good,"management is great and easy to work with. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of being the first at work. "

good,"Very productive place and great for on the job training, besides a great diversity culture. Great working hours: 9/80 schedule"
good,"I worked in a class 1000 and 10000 implementation. I learned Indium liftoff processing,mounting/demounting. operating Laser Interferometers.promis. Receieved achievement award for reducing cycle time by assisting in the planning, and implementation of a bladder press for wafer cleaning process. Clean and inspect wafers. Trained fellow employees on several operations. Work well with Management and with co-workers. The hardest part of the Job was gowning up and de-gowning. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a friendly group of people."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Supportive management, quality coworkers, challenging assignments"
good,"Raytheon provided me a great experience in my introduction to manufacturing.  Within months I was able to gain command of my SAP system, move material, predict production ability and competently assign work to meet commitments.  I learned to collaborate with ancillary functional support team members like Quality, Engineering, Safety, Materials, etc, to identify Continuous Improvement opportunities, diagnose with Lean principles and implement improvement plans."
good,Really enjoyed working at Raytheon until California started bringing all their union ideas to Texas
good,"- Flexible work schedules (9-80s)"
good,"While at DISA I was part of the Mobility team supporting the Lead Systems Engineer for mobility on mobile applications. DISA has been tasked with the designed the Mobile Strategy that would be used by the Department of Defense based on the different Pentagon CIO Memos and initiatives for transforming the existing DoD infrastructure to be mobile enabled."
good,"I loved working for Raytheon. It won't pay well for entry level employees, but it would be a GREAT third job, ( meaning you start working there, leave, and then go back.)"
good,"Work itself was very enjoyable, too much favoritism with management who would allow some co-workers to do very little then pile the work on those of us who actually worked.  Difficult to work with co-workers who didn't respect rules for breaks and lunches, too many who would abuse them and a few of us would have to pick up the slack because of it."
good,Great company to work for.  Sequestration had hit Raytheon hard.  Several layoffs have effected long term employees and created an atmosphere of uncertainty.
good,"Perform work in Document Control, Physical Security, Alternate COMSEC Custodian,Assistant FSO. Process Personnel Security files. Developed with colleagues security briefings, skilled & certified in JPAS & SMS & Access Commander, DIAS, EKMS.also, ITIL Foundation Certified.  Assisted in receiving a Superior rating in our most recent DSS inspection."
good,"raytheon was a very enjoyable place to work.  It offered the challenges that met my skill set and offered me the opportunity to excell over the 13.6 years I was there.  Work hours were flexible with the core hours being 09:15 through 15:30, as long as you had in 8 hours - which wasn't hard to do.  The work was, both, very interesting and challenging as I was a team member supporting the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC).  I enjoyed working with all the team players as well as other programs I supported.  Management was always supportive and listened to my advice.  Some process's changed because of my feedback.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes too many meetings that conflicted with my SCRUM iterations.  The most enjoyable part was every day to include very interesting travel locations; i.e. NASA Wallops Island VA."
good,Raytheon overall has great integrity and core values along with above average benefit packages.
good,"A great company to work for."
good,"was a great job if you can get in, not much else to say... they require more text but adds no value"
good,"Summer job the last 5 years inbetween semesters, learned aspects of company and information security. "
good,Everything was great. YOu learn alot and the people really help you 
good,Enjoyed working there
good,Long hours with good pay just a 90 day contract. Started 6:00 am left at 5:30 we had our on work orders when finished with one when on to next hot work order. Relearn to use many tools that Ihad not use in many years. Management trusted we new are jobs so left us to do our jobs. Meet many new co-workers and enjoyed their differs. Hardest part of job was just a 90 day contract. The most enjoyable part of job ALL OF IT.
good,Raytheon was a great company to work for. Great co-workers. Limited advancement. Good benefits.
good,the typical day at work is very for filling. i have learn alot with and about the company. It gives you a chance to interact with differnt departments and how things work at the company.
good,GReat place to work and co-workers were great i learned alot from this job.
good,I conducted emergency preparedness activities for the National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Eastern US building.
good,"Duty to the customer comes first. Co-workers are generally well qualified for the positions held, site leads however are not always chosen according to experience and qualifications, but rather according to longevity."
good,Professional workplace. Helpful coworkers. Helpful instruction. Responsibilities abundant. Push for excellence and knowledge on subject area.
good,Raytheon actually cares about there employees. They listen to all issues and are very open. Paternity leave was a big plus for some. Benefits were great

good,VERY well organized re scheduling and individual deadlines. Employees were both efficient and good natured. Very much enjoyed both the work and surroundings. ( I am a published writer of both science and science fiction.)
good,"I had a great opportunity to work with great people and an excellent company, the only thing for me was needing to be home, the job is overseas in a combat zone, pays well and has great benefits."
good,job suited my experience in the military field. All my jobs at Raytheon were working in some capacity on military projects or R&D type programs. This is over 35+ years at the company.
good,Product quality is highest priority. Very collaborative place. Lacks culture but has incredible resources for learning and working high tech missiles.
good,"I love working at Raytheon! Everyone is included, and it’s one big team. Raytheon values ethics and customer satisfaction. It is a very rewarding company to work for."
good,Excellent company with competitive salary and benefits.  Company culture is inclusive and based on teamwork and dedication to serving customer.  Outstanding rewards and recognitions programs.

good,"I enjoyed working in an environment that was friendly, helpful and understandable. Work hours are on point, the supervisors are very helpful, and the coffee made it a plus."
good,Built on strong relationships - people always willing to help and make you successful. Management is supportive of trying new things and appoaches.....
good,Raytheon is a company that provided me with a professional work experience that was challenging and rewarding. I was allowed to grow and learn while providing a high level of customer service to our customers.
good,I thoroughly enjoy working at Raytheon and gaining exposure to large engineering projects and work I never thought I'd be able to work on. The most enjoyable part of the job is the collaborative cross-discipline atmosphere that is cultivated throughout the programs.
good,"Productive & efficient workplace, however the work-life balance can sometimes be lacking due to the prevailing company culture.  Overall a good company."
good,"Raytheon is the combination of many different companies merged over time.  As a result it is geographically dispersed and culturally rich.  IT has major operations in MA, TX, CA, VA, CO, FL, MS, and many other states as well as numerous non-US locations.  No two sites or Business Units are quite the same in methods of operation, mix of tools, or management styles.  Raytheon tries to be more a more like one company, but long standing cultures, both good and bad, are not easy to change."
good,افضل شركة عملت بها طول حياتي وافضل مديرين وزملاء عمل وادارة
good,9 hour work days that support the 10/80 work schedule every other Friday off. From military learned the skills to thrive in a civilian business capacity. Innovative culture always in process improvement mode.
good,Very professional staff and management.  Management very flexible.  very safe and secure working environment.  I like what Raytheon's mission is and its core values.
good,Muy buena no tengo ninguna queja trabaje muy agusto y todo muy bien organizado profesionalmente y personalmente.
good,This was a short-term contract job with Raytheon -Homeland Securtiy Division.  I was hired as a subject matter expert to test surveillance equipment that Raytheon was developing for U.S. Customs & Border Protection.
good,"Great coworkers, interesting projects. Infinitely flexible schedule as long as you get your work done on time. My division works mainly on small research projects, which are greatly hindered by rules made for $100 million programs. Taking months to place a $100 order on digikey doesn't result in projects getting done quickly."
good,"I worked for Raytheon Technical Services (RTS) for around 10 years as a casual (as-needed) contract employee, with pay determined by the US government. Management was very knowledgeable about the systems I worked on, and was always helpful when I called from a remote location to get technical and troubleshooting advice. The job was maintaining unmanned Differential Global Positioning Satellite receiving, processing, and transmitting sites in the contiguous 48 states and Puerto Rico, making it a 100% traveling job, I had no problems with management or coworkers."
good,"Raytheon as a company is a great place to work for.  Management is on point when it comes to taking care of their employees by keeping us informed of what is going on through quarterly meets and an open door policy."
good,"Its a great place to work, there are a lot of opportunities at Raytheon if you know where to look. Management consists of some people are more experts in their field rather than actual leaders, which does present some issues from time to time, but everyone is good spirited."
good,"Though I was hired as a Molder/Finisher? That lasted one year. Then the ""bumping process"" started. Every job I had at Raytheon was fine. Management treated everyone fairly. Engineers and other coworkers were very nice to everyone. The environment was excellent. Laid off. Was recalled 3 years later. Was working at Tyrolit. Turned down the recall."
good,Great place to build upon the many skills I learned in the military.  Many opportunities to enhance and create processes for improvement. Management provides latitude and encouragement to seek solutions to team issues.
good,"My strongest feelings about Raytheon are about how rewarding and impactful our work was.  I always felt that what I was doing mattered, and much of it helped save lives.  I felt very good about what I, and we as a company, achieved each and every day.  The work was challenging and frequently drove me out of my comfort zone, but the company allowed me the freedom to expand my skills and learn.  Working on programs that were politically sensitive or otherwise high-profile meant having to expand my focus to be aware of outside impacts that could, and would, affect our daily business.  While this could be stressful at times, it was also a constant reminder that what we did was very important."
good,"Good employee-friendly stable company"
good,The company had a very inclusive atmosphere. Everything had a policy or guideline so there was never a feeling of favoritism or favor. This company believed in diversity as well.
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work if you desire a stable, low-risk career in the Aerospace and Defense sector. Depending on your role, it provides great work/life balance and benefits (9/80, 4 weeks PTO, Paternity Leave, etc)."
good,"Joined right out of the service.  Good work, treated fairly.  Advancement from assembler to inspector in under a year.  Training programs were excellent, as were opportunities."
good,Raytheon was a customer of ours at CE Precision. They did a lot of cross training and had flexible hours. The company let us wear shorts and the employees were great.
good,"I had two job functions from 8.00am till 12.00 I did production kitting for the production dept. after lunch I moved over and did the receiving inspection and entered against the PO's. Management was great. There wasn't really ang hard part to the job I really liked working there."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with opportunities to use education, expertise and experiences to solve problems. The Executive leadership communicates expectations clearly. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with. Everyday, I am given opportunities to meet new people based on the projects I work on."
good,The most enjoyable times are when customer acknowledged my perseverance to mission. I love working in high tech and military environments. I have recurring friendship and correspondence with many Engineers and technicians
good,"Great company. Extremely competitive compensation. One drawback would be that there is not a lot of room for advancement. However, that is subjective to field or specialty."
good,"Raytheon is an excellent employer, the only draw back is that the firm establishes employment based upon contracts v. what the employee can provide to the Corporation."
good,"Train students how to operate an Unmanned Aircraft and utilize its sensor payloads."
good,Excellent place to work.  Just were not stateside locations available in the area I wanted to work/live. The overseas locations had great compensation packages but if you wished to work back in the US the selections were limited within my specialty field.
good,"Work required many secure databases and work was enjoyable. Very few meetings. Takes a while to learn all the different systems and databases up once you learn it, the work is very smooth and detailed. Contract was only for 6 months."
good,Highly regimented work environment.  A highly professional work environment with top level professionals. Management places a high focus Six Sigma and on continuous process improvement.
good,I really enjoyed the benefits and flexible hours Raytheon UTD offered.  My management as great and the team I worked with was very knowledgeable and supportive.
good,"Raytheon SAS may be the best place to work at within Raytheon. This part of the company makes a tangible product that you can point to and feel the pride of being involved in the process. SAS still offers competitive pay and benefits, namely annual bonuses, compared to other business units within Raytheon. The best part of working there was I always felt like I was learning something; I never felt like I was the smartest person in the room, and I was constantly being challenged. The hardest part of working at SAS was feeling isolated from the rest of the team and the IT organization was oddly arranged, making it hard to retain some very qualified team members."
good,"Raytheon provides a challenging, career growing environment for all engineers to succeed in. There are many different opportunities among different programs to contribute in an exciting ways."
good,"I worked there for several years which I enjoyed. It was a good place to work. I would have continued to work there for several more years, but the original company sold out and the new company down sized."
good,"I was blessed to be able to have had the opportunities that were given to me when employed here.  My managers were fair and did what they could to help me succeed....what else could you ask for!"
good,"Good work balance, great management and good work culture. Very interesting projects, Flexible work hours, although the administrative approvals take a little longer."
good,Like with any government contract servicing company job security can be a issue. While working there I learned a lot and the work environment was excellent.
good,"Typical day at work is arriving and ready to your job to the best of your knowledge.  Co-worker very in attitudes.  Management is decent for the most part.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the deadlines, due to product failing test or shortage of parts.  The most enjoyable part of the job is on time deliveries."
good,"Managers and co-workers are hardworking, very supportive and very patience."
good,"best place to work. Great people and the PT 16 hours i work were my times and days to choose, which was very accommodating and very close to home.Wish I didn't move away."

good,"ver good enviorentment for work place,more responsibility,learning many many new things.co workers are helpful and very friendly.management is good. and last my most enjoyable part is my job duties............"
good,"Company management is nice and personable, business is nice for people wanting a work life balance.  Flexible schedules are nice, and compensation is good for the work.  Company downsizing does happen, but they try to maintain as many people as possible to fit business needs. They have a few siloed business units that need some work to make it truly one company."
good,The employees are easy to get along with and management stresses quality productions over numbers or quantity. Daily morning meeting to answer any issues or just to review job priorities.
good,"The culture is as diverse as any you will find in a workplace. Advancement can be difficult at times because people tend to stay in positions for a very long time. I had to leave Raytheon once for General Dynamics to move ahead, but ultimately found myself back again. It I a very good and solid company."
good,Raytheon is a large company able to accommodate most any niche position for technically-minded people. They are stable and strong in their industry.
good,"A typical work day involved working on detailed information with various weapons projects.  The work schedule was (5) 9 hour days"
good,"Large company. Can gain much experience working here if you seek the opportunities. More management than workers, makes working for company difficult. Great people to work with!"
good,"setting probers to run wafers.calibration and repair of probers, testers and all equipment to do with the test area within the semiconductor area"
good,Great company to work for. Fun and exciting people I work with. We supply first responder equipment throughout the world. It is nice to know that the work you are doing saves lives everyday.

good,"A great place to work if you're innovative, assertive, ambitious, and team-player."
good,I was a quality engineering intern for Thales Raytheon Systems during my sophomore year of college. I was impressed by the conditions and state of employment while there. I left after eight months due to my school schedule.
good,"Working as a Quality Engineer at Raytheon I conducted frequent audits of the Quality Management System determined areas for improvement and corrective action, I collected failure data analysed it for defect trends and when a trend was detected. I developed and executed a plan for containment, isolation, and resolution of the defect."
good,"Very tight work schedule"
good,"As an intern, one could find work to do on a basis of need.  Engineers within departments could ask for assistance, and interns would then be taken under their wing and familiarize themselves with whatever project was involved.  In my specific case, I was pulled from one of the projects and instead assigned to re-do the department intra-net website to preserve it as an information resource.  This bore plenty of complexity, and sometimes would render itself tedious; however, the times when one could work in a laboratory and help with testing new and developing projects were welcome and easily the most enjoyable times of the workday."
good,"I so enjoy working for Raytheon.  The experience has been very positive, and my fellow Engineers are the prime reason that going to work everyday is exciting.  The hardest part about the job is the keeping up with the developing technologies."
good,"Good place to work.I enjoy working there,management and co-workers was good."
good,"This is the best job I ever had! I always felt like I was contributing to a worthwhile cause: national defense. I always felt appreciated."

good,"Good place to work for a really long time.  Good pay, good benefits.  Most people don't want to leave."
good,"My co-workers and direct supervisors were some of the greatest people I have met in my professional career. No matter who was the task lead, everybody worked together, rather than under each other. All group projects were a joy. The managers and leaders were flexible and trusting, and listened to the ideas of those under them."
good,"-A typical day at work consisted of prioritizing the most critical schedule demands for material, and expediting crucial material to and from suppliers and feeder groups to meet a fast-paced manufacturing environment. This was a difficult task, as we were dealing with perfection quantities and the tight schedule driven by Navy demand."
good,"Great work environment, had the opportunity to work on all types of planes control panels, I really liked this job because I love working with wires. The aircraft industry just was not stable enough for my family."

good,"It's a good company to work for, but you had to like contract work"
good,Good and stable company with many opportunities. I have gained most of my engineering experience here.
good,Placing buys from MRP system. Management is very helpful. Hardest part of the job would be the repetition of steps for one order. Most enjoyable part would be that you worked on Aerospace projects.
good,Flexible schedule and telecommuting makes the work/life balance here great. Co-workers are hard working and intelligent.
good,"Never heard of Raytheon before Now, but the itself is on the move I like that, d-t-d @ wk well I start at3;30am slow than progress mildly"

good,Raytheon offers many opportunities and a challenging workplace. Very close and strong team work exists among engineering and technicians. Supportive management.
good,"Raytheon is a great company to achieve your career goals. You learn about the teamwork and process improvement culture on Day One. Opportunities abound if you don't mind the hard work and dedication required to prepare yourself for the challenges and competitive environment. Pay is good and the benefits are above average. Given the business climate and customer demands at this time, I would rate Raytheon as an excellent career choice."

good,"Lots of favoritism, everyone made me feel like I was walking on egg shells there. Many employees who have been there for many many years I thought be more than welcomed to help you learned an easy  productive way to get production out without errors. Well I was absolutly wrong about that. Instead they were very aggressive, touchy with there items that belonged to the company, gossiping, favoritism, supervisors cover for their favorite employees, allow employees to walk all over supervisors and managers. The one thing I can i did enjoy was actually being able to do something that I truly love to do regardless of all the mess. But wasn't and isn't good to have all that going on while dealing with million dollar products. I tried to personally go to the supervisor myself because I was being harrassed, bullied, injured, and when I mentioned to the supervisor what was going on I was pushed out and wasn't able to fulfill my dream job and i was a very good employee. I had the CEO of IDS come from massetuchets to give me an Quality Control Assurance Coin because I saved 500+ CCA boards from being produced with an malfunctioned component that was sent by the manufactured itself in that condition."

In the beginning I didn't have many skills with a computer and quickly learned that fear of the un-known was replaced with wow I can do this. My favorite part of working in the Tool Crib was organizing all the Vitmars (tall, twenty plus drawer tool chests). I had free reign on how I wanted to implement change and learned I was a natural at organizing which has always been my passion. I like to make sense out of chaos. The work place culture was a bit like high school, too many people wanting to gossip and loll around, didn't care for that so kept to myself and did my job the best that I could."

good,"I definitely learned a lot with this being my initial company to work for."
good,"Raytheon is a great place to work. I have enjoyed working there over the past 12 years. I have found that you make your own career there. If you want to excel you go for it.

The pay and benefits are very competitive. The hardest part of the job is that due to its size it can be challenging to get things done in a timely manner. There are many layers of management and an overlapping matrix organization. This can also be good for someone who is a strong self starter and willing to reach out and take opportunity. There is also a sense of pride in that we have the opportunity to support our war fighters and to provide them with top of the line products that will save their lives."

Management's aim is for excellence and sustainability for all projects. The company is contingent on government contracts globally, primarily for USG, which posed the issue with some new entry-level and/or down-sizable employees job security.  Once war is declared by the USG, seems to be the best time to be hired and sustain job security.
