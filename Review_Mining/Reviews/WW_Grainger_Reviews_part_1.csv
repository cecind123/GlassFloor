rating,review
bad,"was a ok place to work just poor management ,they would make you work way to fast and if a error would happen you they take it to far not a fun place to work"
bad,It depends on who you know not past experience for advancement. Manager lets you know how much they dislike their job which makes your job worse. If you work overtime or a holiday once they expect you to do it all the time.
bad,"A company where favoritism means everything/work ethic means nothing.  Management is absolutely horrible.  Only butt kissers move up at this ""Company""."
bad,Management is bad. You never know what time your getting off. I'd avoid unless your absolutely in need of a job. The culture in the place is the worst I have ever seen.
bad,"Inventory and managment are horrible. You are set up to fail and never advance in this company. "
bad,"Poorly managed.... that's all I can say about it. The management team is always coming with ways to screw over the employees. Like with the work load. They dont make it to where you can make your productivity because they're always taking production from you. Like they want you pick 50 items and hour which I use to do and more and at the end of an 8 hour shift I would end up about 200 picks which should be 400 are more within an 8 hour shift. Then they would use production to screw you over after they known they have took production from you and gave it to someone else to help out the production. JUST WRONG PERIOD"
bad,The heel of the company micromanaged unrealisric sales targets and to many metrics. I was in the top 1 percent but watched this dept. Go downhill over a period of 3 years. Dont reccomend unless you are using the job as a stepping stone or resume bolster.
bad,"The company is a great place to start to out to build your customer services skills. They offer work from home and are open 24/7, 365;  hours so your work hours can be flexible. If you challenge them or attempt to make changes and you're not friends with your leads you won't get ahead."
bad,The branch operations to coordinate fulfillment needs for customers was moved to another country. Makes no sense to have this dept moved to a foreign speaking work force.
bad,"Would not recommend if you are looking for a stable job. management is poor, the company puts its needs ahead of the workers needs. Very disorganized and safety is ok at best."
bad,"Employees backstab each other, by trying to take each other to H.R over comments that where said 6+ months ago. It won't be that comment that day that gets you in trouble, but once you make your fellow friend or coworker mad, or forbid a safety issue, they will use anything and everything you ever said to them against you at H.R. "
bad,"Management shows favoritism, punish the good workers. Promotions and pay raises only to the employees that kiss they butt. They make they own rules!!!"
bad,"The days at Grainger are extremely long and requires a lot of administrative work.  Expect to work over 50 plus hours per week.  Grainger use to be a great company but, the company culture has definitely changed."
bad,Grainger was okay until all the seasoned managers started to quit and we were left with nothing but new managers that had no idea what they were doing and harassed employees to get more work done but allowed others to slack. Would not recommend this company to anyone who has actual talent and work ethic. Everyone with this company is so lazy.
bad,I can not stress enough to not work for them! It is a terrible company that does not care about its employees. To Grainger you are a warm body in a seat.
bad,"Paranoid Mgrs.. Hostile work environment. Drink the cool aid, or they get rid off you.  51% employee engagement. Everyone I work with hates their job."
bad,"They do not care about their staff, They have become so corporatized and they have lost so many employees and have no organization, most of the bosses are terrible"
bad,"This is the worst of corporate america. Having worked for other fortune 500 companies, I can say with certainty, that this company only values it's shareholders, and no one else is considered."
bad,Can work without being harassed every hour of the day. No communication between the managers and employees. No communication between the managers and supervisors. Coming to work everyday and not able to start you day with all the supplies you need.
bad,"Awful place, awful people, kool-aid drinking culture, passive pats on the head for doing a good job, no time to think constantly taking call after call so the company can be as lean as possible"
bad,Work environment is a joke. Everyone does whatever they want just a waste of time. If looking for an easy job than this is the place for you. Stay on a contract forever never getting any benefits and never moving up since they minimum of effort is expected
bad,"Making sure all clients receive the same service and remain customers who will return and give excellent reviews of the service and company. Keeping up with the needed inventory to maintain company guidelines and service, counter and or phone service"
bad,Awful job..no set policies..never leave on time.managers are horrible..jus a real bad job in general. Turn over rate is in the high 70s..hr is useless..run run run
bad,"Would never work for this company again and would not recommend this company to any prospective employee. Their way of soliciting business and keeping business is not ethical. their way of keeping up with existing customers is unpractical and they should not be allowed to over charge their customers for the same products that other companies can offer for less. "
bad,"Corporate takeover, they worked us like slaves until they closed down the department.  Disrespectful and treated us poorly was a disgrace to see this happen in America."
bad,"This company does not care about their employee's, I worked my tail off and it was never good enough, constantly being put down, other employee's were allowed to get away with what seemed to be murder and for other's they were held to either a higher standard because they were related to the owner."
bad,awful management....do your research before to go for this company.it is my sincere advice.Its is non multicultural company so be sure before you go..
bad,i was temporary and didn't stay long. most enjoyable part was clocking out. counted inventory and that was it
bad,My direct supervisors are unethical and congenital liars. I have had to defend myself to them on 2 seperate occasions for actions I was told directly to do. I do not recommend working for Grainger.
bad,"Job requirements are unclear so metrics are unattainable. Culture is not collaborative and people do not like to work together. Goals of Leadership keeps changing, so it is impossible to know what our priorities are"
bad,"I had been with Grainger for 4 years and when I started I absolutely loved it. They always showed appreciate to each and every one of us. Now, they are worse than any other company out there. Management threatens that they will fire you and can replace you in a second. Every day you are reminded that you are just a number and someone to make them money. They constantly raise the metrics to make it almost impossible to hit but yet they want perfect customer service. The managers and senior managers are so rude and play sever favoritism. If your not kissing their you know what, you won’t get a new position or a raise. You have to be glued to your work while the managers can just screw around all day every day! Oh and let me add, if you need a day off because maybe your child is really sick, we’ll expect to get wrote up! Every day I drove to work getting sick, knowing it was going to be another terrible day! This place is a joke! The ONLY thing good about this place is the health benefits. I would never ever recommend this place to my worst enemy! Honestly, I highly recommend looking else where to work because you will NEVER be happy."
bad,"very micromanaged stressfull bad upper management favortisim and worst place to work feel like a prison"
bad,Rode around to certain areas of the building to pick up my packages. Also had to put them on a belt to get them shipped off and made sure everything met requirements.
bad,"Never be critical of management if you work here, they will hunt you down and fire you.   Always put on a plastic smile in front of anyone as if you tell them the truth you will be weeded out as a trouble-maker"
bad,"Worked there for five years. Management is the biggest problem. Promotions are usually by attrition. Everybody works in fear of loosing their jobs. Honestly, worst place I’ve ever worked . Life’s too short to deal with Acklands."
bad,I did not care for working for Grainger. Extremely stressful and micro-managed. I would never recommend Grainger. This has bee my only Call Center job.
bad,I would never recommen no one to work there. They lie to u about the job and the turn over there! U are over worked and under paid!!! Work life balance is trash!!!
bad,"Very unethical management. Lack of confidentiality. Prejudice work environment. Favoritism. If you're not part of the ""in"" group and go bar hopping or golfing with upper management, you won't progress in the job. Would not recommend this job to anyone!"
bad,Management is moving around so much that you rarely have a supervisor within your area to help with any questions or escalated calls. No real opportunities for advancement and the training program is inconsistent.
bad,"Everything about this place is completely wrong. There is no organization, in the interview they will tell you that their culture is phenomenal. It's all a lie to get you a job. No one talks to each other besides the supervisors that don't do anything. They have pointless meetings, all departments are extremely rude. The customer service is terrible. And the company only allows you to have 12 hours of pto each month, their attendance policy isn't flexible. Their overtime on the weekends is first come first serve and there are only two slots to fill. They send an email at a specific time and if you want to work overtime you have to be the first one to send an email. This is during a call, a meeting or whatever you have going on. So basically it's Hunger Games for only four hours of overtime on the weekends for two slots to fill. So good luck with overtime on the weekends if you are an overtime warrior. The training is terrible, I'd ask a question that I felt was valid and the trainer, nor the manager would be able to answer my question. And the more I didn't understand how things actually worked with the grading of the calls I'd ask more questions and the management and the Q&A team would make me feel uncomfortable of asking legit questions. And they have 10 minute breaks, what is that?"
bad,"Do not waste your time at this company. Micro Management at its best. The sales reps that have been there for a while do nothing but stay at home. New employees have to fill out pipeline reports, travel with managers that no nothing about the industry. No room for advancement. Horrible pay. I'm earning twice as much since I left. You really have to watch your back working here. All sales reps talk to each other by phone at night and start gossiping. They like young sales reps so they do not have to pay them much, yet will force them to resign after 10 years to avoid paying them more and giving benefits. Horrible place to work!!!!!!"
bad,"to many work related injury no safety "
bad,Terrible company to work with. There is waayyyyyyyyyy to much drama and wayyyyyyyyyyyy to much sneaking around and wayyyyyyyy to much dishonesty there. Would not recommend to anyone
bad,"This is a terrible place to work.  They pretend they care about employee satisfaction but they belittle their employees and do NOTHING to gain trust.  They monitor your every move and give you occurrences (marks on your company record) if you punch in two minutes late.  DO NOT THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.  Someone will find out you did and you will constantly be harassed by management because they see any independence as downright unacceptable behavior.  If you want to be a worker drone that never has to think for themselves, this is the place for you!  On top of it all, everyone that works here doesn't trust the management so they are all miserable.  If your coworkers are unhappy, you will eventually be unhappy too."
bad,Turn and Burn company.  Sales jobs are temporary at best.  Micro Management at its best.
bad,There are plenty of promises but no actual follow through. Senior management (outside of the branch) has continuously handcuffed the location for no reason that we can fathom. There is zero engagement in the warehouse and multiple people are currently looking for a new job - they refuse to give us the manpower to perform at the levels we are expected to attain and it is taking its toll
bad,"If you want to be scripted like a robot, and get in trouble when you answer the phone the “wrong way”...Grainger is the job for you! A lot of work you must know. No raise after additional training, helping 5 times the amount of customers. No Human Resources on site person who will actually talk to you benefits will randomly get cut and don’t ask a manager for help, they are useless and barely know the job they are telling you to do. Never opportunity for advancement"
bad,Very top heavy with management  has concern with making money than care for the customers or employees  works only top self companies that can spend  only with Grainger
bad,Be aware that you are responsible for your own development. The managers will not help you develop in your career even though they are measured on that.
bad,"There is a lot  favoritism towards certain employees and others are the work horses. Competitive, lots of short deadlines and heavy work load. It’s stressful work environment and your job is always changing."
bad,"I worked here as a temp as a picker at the Tukwila, Washington branch.  This place is fast-paced, and you're mostly always on your feet, so prepare to work.  The only things that truly matter here are your production numbers and gap times.  You basically work so you don't get fired or let go on a daily basis because there are people whom I have seen here who have worked and done a great job but never got hired on and they ended up leaving.  I was making my production numbers as well.  Last time I saw my production numbers I was picking at 100% in some areas and 200% at another.  So, I don't know what I did wrong. "
bad,"Unfortunately, everything went downhill with AGI. Micromanagement at its finest. Stay away, or maybe if you need a temp job. Most people left already in senior roles and AM roles. You are just a number with false expectations. This used to be a great culture with great people. Now it's fear based tactics."
bad,"My time (1 year) here was a waste as a top team member I was harassed by management ignored by hr and left with no chance to move up although my numbers were hi and my customer review were good, I would never recommend this place to anyone not even my enemies! Not worth the lies they fill you with when you start do yourself a favor look for something else!"
bad,"If you want to never be fired never complain. The managers are sneaky , they lie and the fight amongst each other and then bring their petty negative energy to the floor and project it to their team . No job security. HR is a joke you can tell them your being threatened, assaulted by a co worker and they won’t care if that co worker does good ."
bad,"typical no where job, poor training, lousy pay.upper mgt thought their attitude was wonderful, constantly being told look what I've done you can get here too !"
bad,If it paid a dollar less I would’ve been quit. Managers show favoritism. Pretty much have little to no life. Attendance policy is ridiculous. Can’t wait to leave this place. Every morning I wake up dreading going to work because it’s almost guaranteed to be a bad day. Certain people get away with almost everything where as the next person can be fired for that same thing. They ask more and more of you but want to barely give you a raise. You go to supervisors for help depending on their mood you’ll get snapped at or ignored completely. Complaints don’t get addressed. Management is just terrible and the only way to move up is by kissing up to the right people. It’s just bad all together. At the end of the night certain people can just stand around where the “non favorites” are asked to finish other people’s work. It’s just ridiculous.
bad,"Grainger as a company is not bad. However, the division of Inside Sales in San Antonio is a joke. I would advise if you need a quick, temporary job, some sales experience or even starting out of college, then apply but don’t stay too long past a year. You get a territory of customers called “CSG” (Customer Sales Group) in a specific segment (Manufacturing, HVAC, Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial Services, etc) Your CSG won’t change except if they add a new business in your CSG. Anyways, the expectations are 30 dials, 100 minutes and 12 QC (Quality Calls) "
bad,You work 12+ hrs a day 7 days a week. Its never enough. When RSVPs are around management preaches work life balance but when they are gone you are expected to do nothing but work. There is no family time with Grainger. They could care less. You take time off but emails and phone never stops. Outside looking in it seems great but once your in its horrible. You cant get any help they always just blame you
bad,"Constant layoffs, poor upper management, lack of career advancement, uncompetitive compensation, clueless senior leadership, slow decision making processes"
bad,The managers have no clue what they are doing. If you want to work 60 plus hours a week this is the place for you but be prepared for the taxes to take your whole check
bad,"they talk about team work,they are not about it.it is a negative environment."
bad,So far some Management is miserable to work with. They don't pay enough to deal with the immaturity and poor training. Its enough money to survive until something less stressful comes along.
bad,I havent seen such turnover .if you can suck up then this company for you.if you are hardworker and wana do a job then i am sorry this is not for you.in my short span of time i have seen two top manager went on stress leave.one got fired.one forced to resign and one resign.so if u thinking to join think twice.bcos management are really jerks.excuse my language but no other word came except this.
bad,Worst Company ever. You won't make it past five years in sales. Micro Managed to the max.
bad,Management lies with regards to safety and adhering to DOT standards.How you're treated on site with some of the manufacturing plants are not within OSHA guidelines and Grainger does nothing about it and they don't want to hear about it as people from the site plants will spit on you. Use vular language screaming and yelling at you and not treating you with courtesy and respect and Grainger does nothing about it
bad,"Going through a ton of changes, no room for advancement, position was consistently changing with not a lot of instruction or direction. Every position is micromanaged and there is little to no job security."
bad,"No room for advancement,poor management, stressed environment,hard to get promoted,get wrote up for every little detail, glued to a headset,lack of opportunities a college degree doesn't benefit."
bad,Toxic 80's style management and culture. Turnover rate is 80-85%.  Never know what time you will get off. Favoritism determines whether or not you can get a transfer and whether or not you can even get a cent for a raise.  Management keeps taking more and more little positives away from the workers as time goes on. Even supervisors leave just as fast as hourly workers due to working conditions.
bad,"You have great benefits, for insurance but can never get off for a ""Dr or Dentist appointment, Difficult computer processes and metrics for the job are a joke."
bad,Great environment to learn in. But leadership is lacking- many are only in it for their own advancement. Company continue to cut employees with high tenure in all departments. Constantly concerned for your job.
bad,"I have only worked one other place that put you thru so much training and yet was so eager to fire you. out of 400 employees there were less than ten people I trusted, management...0."
bad,"working here was bad. Poor management, no career advancement, horrid pay. Went into the position thinking it was a sales position, but all it is, is a call center. Do not be fooled!"
bad,"Used to be a good company to work for, but now is not even tolerable. Leaders without relevant qualifications or even college degrees were put into roles they are not ready for. Almost the entire level of upper and middle managers was recently fired and the unprepared people that remain are now in charge of things during a time of massive change.  Leadership has become mean dictators. Recent reorgs have been a challenge and the new CEO is making changes that are not working - too much, too fast. He seems out of touch with the people and the fact that engagement is suffering. It is very political and you have to ""luck"" into a job or play the game to get ahead. The corp office is cutthroat, political, and competitive. People on your own team will step on anyone to get ahead. Good results are not valued over political maneuvering. Benefits keep getting cut at the team members expense. People used to be valued but are now mistreated and overworked."
bad,"It really depends on what department you work at with the company. I worked in the slave division (inside sales) where management and the director treated the entire northbrook office poorly. It was like two companies inside of one. The people at the Lake Forest office loved their job and were happy to go to work, where the people in northbrook were mistreated and threatened on a daily basis, just not a healthy environment to work in."
bad,"Sr. Management has no idea what's going on, not sure why they have planning meetings because they never stick to the plan - it's constantly changing. Hourly team members and supervisors are treated horrible and expected to work 12, 13, 14 hours daily. If they have to leave upper management gets mad. High turnover along with injuries. If you want a life or family time don't work here."
bad,management is terrible and the people are getto  they don't see you as a person only as a tool and there no paid time off I really don't recommend to work there
bad,"It's very demanding in the day time "
bad,"While the pay, benefits and paid time off are above average the amount of stress that comes with the job outweighs all the positives. The interview process is extremely stessful and is why many people don’t change positions. Management is constantly changing and it’s common to have 3-4 managers in a year."
bad,Simply put you are hired to do sales but once on sales floor you are in a Call Center environmental. Sales are not the focus unless reflected poorly on upper management. What they care about is not the relationship you have with customers but that you make a certain amount of calls with a set amount of mins. These days that are transitioning to micromanaging and scripted phone calls.
bad,"I worked for Grainger for almost 2 yrs. And in that time I saw more new managers than I could count. In the beginning I was told that my accounts were my book of business and to run it how I felt. Not true. This place is just another call center. Management positions are given to people who know someone, and not based on their proven track record."
bad,Management there really needs a lot of work. I loved the job at the beginning but it turned into a full blown call center. Their expectations is ridiculous.
bad,"If you value hard work, accountability and leadership, look elsewhere! This place has NONE of those things, in fact,it pays to be lazy! Run from this place as fast as possible!"
bad,"Mucha falta de promoción, falta de apoyo por parte de los líderes, en prestaciones está muy bien, pero para subir de puesto tienes que ser muy amigo de los líderes de la empresa para que te tomen en cuenta"
bad,"Don’t let the pay fool you. Leadership will support you until they are being reviewed for their own lack of performance. You don’t need to hear this from me. The proof is in the employee turnover, management resignation and executives that have no left the company. Don’t suggest improvements, ask for help or expect things to change. I’m sorry to say a family founded business which extended to its employees has turned rotten."
bad,"They are terrible at management, they have almost an entire management staff hand picked on the buddy system. They all came over from AllState insurance together and have no idea what they are doing. Coaching is comical and it is a telemarketing job(not Inside Sales). You will make no commission based on their business model and work for strictly your base most months. Don't make the same mistake I did, wait for something better."
bad,"Depends on the manager depends on you moving forward or being happy with this company. They DO NOT CARE about us at the call centers. They tell you, there will be better shifts to work but, you are stuck on the same bad shift for well over a year. Needs help with workforce. Helping there people that work odd hours to still see there family, would be nice as well."
bad,"not a good place to work management have no heart, they dont keep they words they every last min type company...... only thing good is the benfits"
bad,"Grainger pays well, and has great benefits. This does not compensate for the high stress, micromanaged environment. It seems they are more concerned about numbers than high quality work, and great customer service. Most employees have entirely to much work, causing employees to not have the time or desire to take ownership of issues or situations."
bad,The management in the warehouse makes there own policy and don't follow company policy.
bad,Management is not good. one of my managers was a bully and i was afraid to speak up about injustices. Managment and frend relationships. Highly inappropriate. over all bad work enviroment
bad,"Easy, fast-paced job, good work for summer student at Distribution Centre"
bad,They have great pay and benefits but once you’ve been at graingrr for a certain period of time they just write you up so they can push you out the door they don’t care about turn over and do whatever to hit there numbers that’s all they care about.
bad,I'd never work here again. My family member got sick and I was assured that I wouldn't get fired if I had proof that I was with her and was fired before I could even bring in my proof
bad,"Management was great until about a year ago. Things at Grainger started changing and now management is poor. Management has no respect for an employee who works in the field, sends out meeting request 5 min before they would like to have meeting. Management has been hired outside of Grainger and management has no idea about how customer work  or customer policies."
bad,"Stressful workplace, decent for a younger person. Would not recommend for anyone looking to make advancements in their career. Large turnover in management, making it difficult to start relationships for advancements with the company."
bad,"I came at time when Grainger outsourced IT and laid off many own employees. Starting from the top level management and down to system architects and all others,  Replaced generals with soldiers without any experience.  Terrible situation seeing such things."
bad,"Supervision was non-existent.  Management talks a big game, but talk is cheap.  Hungover forklift drivers.  Fox News blaring in every break room.  Vending machines in lunch room were always empty.  The quiet room was like a college freshman frat party.  Most employees are disgruntled from working long hours and not having the drive or aptitude to find something better."
bad,"The only good thing working here was that your co workers are good guys that you get along with. Other than that I would advise you to weigh up other options. You are worked 10 hours a day non stop with very little down time leaving your exhausted at the end of the day. They always wonder about why they have high turnover, they just need to have the higher employees work a few days to understand why. They say safety is number one and I could name a few instances where all they care about is reaching and hitting goals for the day instead of safety. Management was very unprofessional with handling different situations and man management was very below average. The pay is decent but not worth working 10 hour days where mandatory is overtime, and overtime is usually every day, very rarely do you get out on time. I would suggest looking st other places apart from the Roanoke Center."
bad,"Staff was fun to work with, managment made work environments difficult. Indecisive business decisions and poor communication"
bad,Great co-workers to work with. Worked very well and had an excellent manager that was always willing to help all of us with any questions that we had.
bad,"I have been employed with Grainger in Minooka, Illinos for 1.5 years and I am currently looking for employment. Work life balance is non existent, poor management, never knowing when you will get off is frustrating, If you have small children prepare to miss them a lot and not make it to extra curricular activities they may be involved in. I have been hearing things will get better since 2016 and they have not, still working long hours even though I chose a 5 day 8 hour schedule. Overtime is mandatory and  it's everyday! Fridays are the worst you will work until 7pm. Transferring to another department  is very difficult once your in they keep you right where you started. The Mezzanine is the absolute worst department there.I would only recommend the Minooka, Illinois location to someone if they could not find other employment and needed something immediately, but again once your in the hours will prevent you from looking elsewhere and if you get an interview you will have to call off and take a point that will stay on your record for 4 months."
bad,The manager only comes down once a week needs to be more. The lead person in charge when he is not around is not a people person. She can’t work with a diverse group of people. This is a very cliquish work environment. Co- workers take lots of breaks and don’t like to cover others when they need a break. Work load is not evenly spread out. Do not respect one another. The group currently working there works good together but not with new people. Lead person likes to leave a lot to go get Starbucks. Your ideas on improving or changing the way something is done is not taken seriously unless it’s something they like. Sales person on site does not like to be asked questions in regards to items carried. Overall this is just a terrible work environment. I was very unhappy with the lead person and manager. I felt like they played around a lot while I worked. Numerous times customers would be waiting at the counter while they would just be gossiping in the back.
bad,"Horrible management.  Totally unprofessional.  Think they know Everything about everything in the world.  Check your brain in at the door, they do not want to hear it.  Management consists of arrogant, backstabbing, incompetent people who should not be in their position."
bad,This place has a management team that sets you up to fail. Unrealistic goals are set for you everyday. Being a top performer here does nothing but guarantee that you will do twice as much work as the person next to you. The expected rate is unrealistic do to the sloppy way they handle thier inbound receiving. If you can tolerate all of this the pay is pretty good and so are the benefits.
bad,"The big corporate feel might be for some, but not for me.  Job eliminations left and right for no good reason.  You're just a number at this company.  There is no respect for the individual."
bad,"Customer is always right.  Even in cases of inappropriate harassment.  I believe in excellent customer service toward clients, but the company takes it too far as in enabling the client to mistreat the service representative whether sales or other.  It should not be expected for an employee to endure harassment of any kind."
bad,"This company has been struggling in this very competitive market for several years now. Share holders and investors are their top priorities and employees are on the bottom of their list. Benefits are average at best and the fact that employees have to pay to attend the yearly company picnic says a whole lot. Over 40 branch store locations closed last December and management has been changing, vice presidents are quoting, and employee moral is at a very low point."
bad,And it was nothing but typical corporate b/s. There is a reason they are no longer in business. It was nothing but a big lie from the minute Grainger took over.
bad,"This company takes a long time to confirm a position, this is after you've interview with them several times.  In addition, the planning for who will perform what job function is pretty poor and they tend to hire contract positions without confirming a budget."
bad,"loved my job, co-workers were great,,,but at the end of the day they didnt care about how well you did your job. it was more about how long you worked there and what you were paid. They could hire temps for 1/2 the wage and of course 1/2 the ability..so they did. and who suffers...well me of course and the customers too...."
bad,"I was in training and they let me go after 6 weeks stating I wasn’t fast enough.  I was thrown in to a busy time and the trainer was no help at all. All she did was complain and told the supervisor.  I was let go a week for Christmas, which I feel was not so nice  thing to do so to someone trying to support their family.  More training should have been offered and a new trainer."
bad,"Horrible company to work for (Imperial Supplies in Green Bay.  Inept management, dishonest and with poor ethics.  The people you work with are great people, just trying to survive."
bad,"They reel you in and you think you've found a wonderful opportunity."
bad,"Toxic culture, 80s style management.  Get on board or get out, metrics are top priority.  Management feels customers should conform to Grainger's model or are not a good fit for the business.  Stifles innovation, lots of ""yes-men"""
bad,"8am-4pm"
bad,"Management treated me as I was incompetent and the would not honor my disability. They perceive to care about their employees but don't wanna follow laws . Their training class had changed up constantly trying things different , they didn't  know what they wanted to do and they were not consistent ."
bad,The environment that employees are exposed to is a toxic one.  There is no job stability and jobs are meant for temps only.  They have no loyalty to long standing employees.
bad,"Best part of Grainger is the people who worked for me, our team was a great group of men and women of all ages who worked well together."
bad,some people can make a career of this place if they have lucrative packages.  really you train yourself here or other reps that are nbice will show you the ropes
bad,"With broken promises and no advancement. Lies were told as usual even from the start. Dont expect supervisors to assist with your career, they are concerned about themselves."
bad,"This company is good depending on your goals. My experience there was not insightful as managers were using me to boost their stats and not get any compensation or rewards for my work. No possibility for advancements since Mangers need to keep its good employees to hit their target goals. And lastly higher management will not take any advice or recommendations you offer simply because they do not value your opinion or judgment (whether they acknowledge it or not)  hence why they are so lost and disorganized. Managers would have at least 3 meetings a week to discuss ""changes"" that kept being pushed back primarily due lack of leadership focus and implementation (actions)."
bad,"No training, extremely high standards to pass the ninety day, double standards by supervisors and management. Was a very cut throat environment, no teamwork."
bad,"Leading North American multi-channel distributor of facility maintenance supplies with sales of $5 billion in more than 500 locations throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.  Channels included e-commerce, catalog/direct mail and B2B stores."
bad,"A lo largo de 6 años en esta compañía tuve la oportunidad de consolidar un gran conocimiento en diferentes áreas como ventas y mercadeo, dentro de un ambiente laboral muy sano, sin embargo no fue posible suplir mis expectativas salariales y por ello hoy me encuentro en la búsqueda de una nueva oportunidad laboral."
bad,Metrics are all that matter. You're a statistic. Short breaks and it takes forever to get anywhere there because the facility is so big. Work out room and cafeteria are awesome if you can find the time to go.
bad,"Worked for them for over 10 years, started off great...but when the economy went south, they started getting rid of people. They started with the most experienced people first....just my opinion."
bad,overall it was a very nice place to work everyone worked together as a team   if wasnot a good place to work i would have not been there for 37 years it was a very  friendly enviorment to work with a great benefit package
bad,In the pass it was a fun place to work. Before I got laid off it was a fun place to work. After new management the employee were very it stressful. The environment was not a great place to work.
bad,This is a male dominated environment. There is not a lot of female presence. The hours are long the culture is a mixed bag. There are some great supervisors.
bad,"No matter how desperate you are for a job, or how annoyed you may be at your current job, there are some companies you’re better off not working for.  Accepting a role at this company can set your career back and even jeopardize your future success.  Please, do not work here"
bad,"Bad supervisor, uptight, high and mighty , puts himself on a pedestal and looks down on those who he believes to be below him, poorly run facility and dangerous work environment"
bad,Most of management is oblivious. There is a lack of ownership which leads to poor results. When anything goes wrong many are argumentative     which only adds to the issues.
bad,You will work until everything is completed & they don't care if you have kids or not to pick up. Leaving before everybody work is completed will result in punishment
bad,"Lots of talk from Management but no action. Each day is all about hitting the manager's numbers."
bad,"This was a great experience as Grainger hires contractors to assist with the overflow elements of their Annual event. In addition to the Annual Sales & Trade Show, I had the opportunity to work on other meetings."
bad,A company bogged down by corporate policies. They require a drug test everytime you drop or damage a product or packaging. Even if the product only falls a few inches off the pallet. Constantaly being let off early because lack of work. It is either go home or stay and push a broom all night. With as big as the warehouse is you could push the broom for miles.
bad,"The supervisors don't care, I would prefer to work somewhere else. It was not a fun job and too many people on help phone that sabotage the employees."
bad,"The managers at Grainger always have a secret agenda, they will bully you until you are gone. I was the top salesman in the region and they found any reason to be on my back always."
bad,Racist company in Minooka Illinois. If you’re black forget about trying to advance. Management and Human Resources is a joke. Very high turnover rate.
bad,Unclear leadership and poor training. Company is a lot like high school if your at the cool table your good. Poor leadership would rather you fluff and tell BS then identify real root causes.
bad,This place is not for the avarage hard workers. They show favoritism to certain peolpe and not to the hard workers. Theres very little room for advancement.
bad,"•	Maximize sales for designated account package by growing sales within existing accounts by using the Core Value Proposition"
bad,"Not a lot of work life balance, base salary is very low, and it is very demanding. However, I have heard other positions within the company are more desirable"
bad,"While working there, on a weekly basis I was given one more task on my job description... and no advancement in compensation."
bad,Great people to work with but unreachable goals to even hit minimum.  Management was not helpful and was very difficult to work for.
bad,"Should you join organization in entree level position, probably a totally different outcome. Otherwise- complex processes, insufficient training and resources."
bad,Worked at Grainger for one year. It wasn't the best experience from a management standpoint.  Very little training and management wasn't engaged to assist in coaching reps.
bad,"Never knew one day to the next if you still had your job, when i frist started there 4 years ago i loved it! so many people with over 25 years within the company and then it all started going down hill"
bad,From corporate this company has no clear direction it wants to take. Entirely to many management positions that cloud team efforts. This company will most likely be bought by amazon within 5 years.
bad,Grainger started out promising  the world but will cut you off at the knees to suit what it is they want.  They only want part-timers but demand you work more only when they need you!  I've worked my butt off for over 3 years for nothing!!
bad,"Management is horrible, and evil. Can't trust anyone. 70% Of the sales arms don't receive any commission, or the company takes your commission back. So dishonest."
bad,A very high intense micro managed company. Kept in the dark about important mergers and company's future. Very secretive on company's future and mergers.
bad,long hours and management does not care...hours are long and short staffed..never see upper management on floor.... hr. dept. is terrible...money is good but profit sharing is bad
bad,"This use to be a great place to work, but over the past few years’ upper management has been focused on increasing stock prices, so their stock options will result in larger payouts.  Meanwhile, local account executives goals increase so they will make less income."
bad,"Leadership is out of touch with reality.  Its very unfortunate because it makes everyone's life harder but theirs.  A lot of promised, very conceptual but extremely poor execution.  No one will admit how bad things are.  They live in a fantasy land."
bad,"This was once a great company that valued hard work and dedication. Been with the company over 11 years and have seen leadership change 180 degrees. Was once very proud of the company's name. Now it's just a job... I've seen hundreds of people lose their jobs. I've seen hundreds of jobs outsourced to other countries. The work life balance is non-existent. The company's sales goals are unrealistic. You have a good year and make money, the following year it's nearly a guarantee your sales goal will be so high you can't obtain it. The turnover is at it's all time high..."
bad,"The job is not bad, but it is VERY much based on who you know and who likes you. If you speak your mind like your asked to share, you become 'black listed' and they look for a reason to fire you. Most of the managers do not take the time to learn the struggles the employees face and do nothing to help when they learn of them. There is no room to advance unless once again you know someone. The pay is all screwed up and new people come in at a higher rate and do less work. Turn over is always high."
bad,"I would only suggest working here as a stepping stone out of college. for a year or two to gain experience. The Janesville facility is hard to navigate due to so many family members working together there that there is a lot of preferential treatment based on who you know and not how well you perform your job duties or how hard you work. There are hard goals set for you that you must accomplish on a daily basis and will negatively effect your review and raise if you do not meet your goals. Not very organized and in constant flux. I was re-organized three times in the last year I was there, which meant new management, new goals and new duties. Very sales driven which creates contradiction in your job duties on a daily basis. The mid level management team is not trustworthy or fair. If you work here for a few years to gain experience it will give you a good opportunity to learn how to work well in a bad environment but I would not count on promotions or making any money."
bad,Turnover rate with management extremely high. Company does not support front line management. During my short tenor eight management personnel quit or was forced out. Unethical place to place.
bad,"four managers in four years; two of which had never managed anyone before, one had never been in sales (the relative of an important customer)."
bad,The company lacks good managers.   They look to the outside for jobs to fill instead of hiring within. Grainger always say we have the best employees that is what makes Grainger great.  Maybe they should promote from within.
bad,"Hard, hot, heavy, stressful work. You can never do enough, fast enough. No matter how much you do, you didn't do enough. I'd only go back, and I could, if it meant my child would be homeless otherwise."
bad,Grainger is an amazing company but some of the management there needs to really step it up. Can't mention names but I will say this. There needs to be someone supervising the supervisors. My team managed itself yet my supervisor got credit for our efforts? Wish i would've moved departments.
bad,Employees are required to work until all orders are completed for the day.  So if you still have work to complete up until 8:30pm you can't leave until it is done.
bad,this used to be a very nice place to work but has declined drastically.  There have been several individuals who have been at the company for over 20 years who have left due to the change in the culture and the lack of job security.  The company has fired and threatened to fire individuals over not using Salesforce correctly.  I believe that it will be a good company again one day but currently...not so much.
bad,"It was kind of busy and fast pace work place but horrible management, horrible supervisors! New ideas how to do the work  everyday but nothing ever worked! It just made workers confused and caused more mess and mistakes! Manager and supervisors were faking! They pretended to be nice and carefulness to workers but deep down they were horrible!!! They did not treat workers fairly!!! It was a very unsecured work place! I ended up had to find another job because you would never know when will you become a permanent employee or when will you loose your job there. Most of people were okay but some people were bad!"
bad,"Management is poor, especially for work time. Qork to life means you work as much as they want and have no life."
bad,"This is not a company to work for now . Very biased in terms of employees and management  are just puppets to older employees who think they just run the show . U r treated as dirt  and will not even be given a chance to speak , let alone be heard. "
bad,I have met some of the best people there but the upper management is bad.Not a day will go by without them saying you can be fired for anything.
bad,"Newer contact center with no HR employee manual.  Everyone is treated differently.  Company does not care about people as humans, only metrics.  Horrible management and no 'concrete' HR guidelines.  They only concentrate on what you do incorrectly even if 98% of your performance is above par."
bad,"no work life balance. a day off is not a day off. plan on working 24 hours a day seven days a week, weekends, holidays, when you are on vacation, when you are sick"
bad,"Excellent workforce, equipment is old and unreliable, building lighting and cleaning is excellent. Management is not reasonable or personable, time off is hard to attain. Work home life balance is poor. Good pay and benefits. Used to be a great company to work for but in the last few years they have lost their value for the employees."
bad,"I've had good jobs and bad jobs...this place by far is one of the worst! The bins are extremely hot! I mean HOT...passing out hot! The co-workers are stand-offish and some are downright rude and hateful! I was told a set of work hours when I was hired, but quickly found what I was told was not reality. I was employed fir 3 months and in that time 2 supervisors left and 10 employees...the turn over rate is at 54%. That should tell you something! There are no breaks, just a 25 minute lunch.  Long walk to the break area. They constantly harass you about production and errors so you better be near perfect and do it fast! It's very discouraging to try to improve when they are writing you up for every error and low numbers. They say safety is #1 but it felt like numbers were more important."
bad,They say they care about work and life balance but all they really care about is BUSINESS NEEDS. mandatory overtime. nearly no room for advancement even when they add all kinds of responsibilities. they just milk you for whatever they can get and when you make a mistake they chew you out
bad,Company going thru changes and it is a hard time to work there... It would be ok for short term employment but for a stable long term career this is not the place.
bad,"When I started with Grainger the attitude was all about customer service, but in the last couple years it has changed to meeting matrix.  Management does not care if you have had sales growth with your accounts but if you do not meet certain matrix then you do not get good reviews."
bad,"Working for Grainger was a learning experience.  While I greatly enjoyed my position and my customers, I feel direct management lacked the proper skills to manage a team of account managers.  I did not feel that I was given a fair opportunity to succeed and was constantly being threatened by the loss of my job.  While I do feel I had great support from my team members, I do not feel I had the support or guidance from direct manager."
bad,"Working at Grainger is to be at the whim's of whatever deployment management is trying to implement. This leads to a chaotic, unpredictable workload, where processes you have been following suddenly become coachable offences. In addition advancement is primarily handled through interpersonal relationships rather than being merit based. If they like you, you might sail through, if they don't they will throw up endless roadblocks, blindside you during reviews, increase your workload without compensation or be presented with impossible goals."
bad,Grainger is being severly mis-managed with short-term visions taking over very large decisions.  The culture there is awful and many people are only there to be vested in Profit-Sharing.  Otherwise they would be leaving the organisation as well.
bad,"New management shifting corporate direction just initiated a RIF which included long term tenure employees.  Company direction is now uncertain."
bad,great company that is family oriented. great employees that are always willing to give a helping hand. wide variety of culture and respectful leaders.
bad,people leaving (on their own or given packages) non-stop.  Politics everywhere.  Successful managers leave.  Lots of favoritism.  Strategy changes every 6 months.
bad,They tell you one thing when you are first hired and then it is completely different once you get in there. Management is hot/cold. Stressful place to work and difficult to balance home/work.
bad,"I left many years ago but felt compelled to voice the issues. During my tenure, I went through 7 different District Sales Managers. You had no voice, just a number and poor leadership. They want you to drink the kool-aid but they would not support you if you needed. It was pass the buck attitude. "
bad,"Grainger likes young employees and does not pay them well.. Once you reach 40 years old, they will do whatever they can to make your life miserable so you will quit. Do not waste your time or your life working for this company, you will regret it- TRUST ME!!!"
bad,"Management does not take the time to develop you and most are full of empty promises.  When wanting to look for another job within the company, it could lead to many brick walls, as the other departments want experience.  Working with sales can sometimes be stressful."
bad,No job security.  Your position can be eliminated at any time.  They prefer to hire from outside rather than promote.  No compassion for unusual circumstances.  It's just a job with a paycheck.
bad,"Inexperienced sales management with heavy handed management styles.  Poor sales support model - Zoro website (Grainger owns Zoro) directly competes with all Grainger sales representatives, while the sales reps get outrageous sales goals and no credit for Zoro sales."
bad,"Morale is horrible, laying off people all over the place and closing branches. Constantly telling staff closures and re-structures are completed and then more come. Unstable - management doesn't know how to support staff... I would imagine it to be similar to working in a zoo lol"
bad,No work life balance. Basically modern day slavery. They will not be able to accommodate any request unless you let them know prior to your hire date.
bad,productive work place with not so good management. And its all about the number even don't they tell you is not about the numbers. A lot of politics if you tell me.The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company. The compensation is below average, the work is mentally draining, and the company is constantly making changes that further stress the employees out. Not a fun place to work!"
bad,"Lo que más me gusto del trabajo fue la libertad de realizar las traducciones de manera personal y avanzar a nuestro propio ritmo."
bad,"Not Good, stressful, very unprofessional, and managment shows alot of favoritism. I have been there almost 8 years, management does not help unless you're their favorite, it's hot, its dirty."
bad,"Structure of the company is too big, there isn’t much of a culture.   Smaller and local companies are easier to work with and are more personal.   Grainger really doesn’t care about its clients, just what they can get out of them...."
bad,"After two years there they higher all insurance for management. No promotion opportunity because you have inside sales going against managers, outside sales and outside candidates. Commission structure is eh hard to hit then they raise your goals by 10% and I’ve seen it with many people I’ve worked with. I would go for a branch or outside role before inside sales."
bad,"When I started at Grainger I thought it would be a great opportunity. However, I was misled. There is no opportunity to make commission - the idea of ""uncapped"" commission is ridiculous. Your goals are raised even if you were not in the book of business the previous year. The books of business are hand selected and if management does not like you you are out of luck. "
bad,"They shift managers around so much that you never get the same one longer than 6 months. The turnover rate is ridiculous. They beat their best employees to the ground until they have had enough and quit. If you do good work, you get punished by having to do other peoples work."
bad,"It doesn't matter if you are consistently making your monthly goal, if you don't have 20 meetings per week you are chastised like a child. If your opps are not closing in a certain amount of time, you are chastised, didn't follow the script, you are chastised. "
bad,They worry about productivity over anything. Management is terrible there. They only advance people that they like. They do a background and drug screening but they have one supervisor there that has a DWI. How is he a supervisor?? I guess because his cousin works in the H.R department. I worked at the Grainger facility in Roanoke Texas. It's rating last on the list of all the Grainger D.C. Now I know why. I stressed for months that it is not far how they write up certain people and not everyone for not hitting productivity. They moved up one chick that worked in my department and she never hit her numbers. Where does that happen at??The supervisors goes around and let others employees now that they are firing other employees. Management is so terrible. I worked the night shift and I see why they have a high turn over.
bad,Good company to work for.  Promotion is possible depending on what department your are in with room fir advancement.  You are encouraged to contribute your ideas for improvements.
bad,"The pay was okay, but the chaotic nature and inefficient processes and tools made it challenging to provide the level of service you are held to. Constant monitoring and sneak tactics of your performance made the experience of helping others worse. Not all of the clientele were awful, but a majority were unbearable and rude."
bad,"The building is awesome and they have a nice lunch room and a room that you can relax in, also a small gym. the work life, however, is terrible. They place you in areas that you struggle and unless they like you, they will let you slowly get written up and fired in an area that you cannot perform well in."
bad,"Trabajar para Grainger es un compromiso y una buena oportunidad ya que tiene oportunidades de crecimiento, pero realmente busco algo mejor para mi futuro."
bad,"I'm a current employee at the ILDC , I work in the warehouse  the management really does'nt care about the people they give you high rates to acheive  and the company has a high turn over  rate just ask,, The advancement oppurtunities  are slim to none irf you kiss but yea but other than that no,,If you need work ok but do not get comfortable ..Better management company would be alot better .. Also if they really focused on the survey they give the employee  yearly ,,Duh why give out a survey if you not going to listen to the employee at all . Beware if you want to work for a  company thats going to bust ya but go for it...."
bad,Great benefits but not worth the stress.  And these folks don't play well with the FMLA sytem.  As soon as I took FMLA I went from being the first shift emloyee who never got in trouble to the worst employee in the building according to them.  They found a reason to fire me after that.
bad,A typical work day at Grainger was always stressful the job I had to do was package chemicals into a box and we would package so many of them during a day and it would be exhausting to the point have of us wouldn't work their again.
bad,"Done with job disruption, and lack of corporate transparency for the employees who keep the company from losing revenue. Grainger has no clear path and if they do it is not shared."
bad,"The market has opened up more opportunity for growth and Grainger simply hasn't kept up. They offer lower pay and less training for their managers and new hires alike, and it has led to a disgruntled staff, with an extremely high turnover at all levels."
bad,Fast pace work place you cant leave till work is done. You don't have a outside life due to hours. It seems all they care about is Grainger and their attendance policy is too strict. They only give you to excused absences a year.
bad,"Grainger is so big it was always remodeling auditing items on the shelve putting everything on the shelf into a computer, This in tell help with items in inventory and stock"
bad,"If you do not want to move up come to Grainger.  Current org structure makes it difficult to move into vertical positions.  ""Good 'ol boy"" management and the culture promotes a toxic environment of poor direction, unhappy employees and people not well suited for their roles."
bad,Do not train well in the environment in which they are working.  Management is disconnected to employees due to proximity of location and where employees are located.
bad,"The company is changing so fast, it is losing site of it's employees and customers. If you want a place where the employer cares, don't work here. That was lost about 4 months ago"
bad,They over promise and under deliver.  They promised a company car and never delivered so I quit.  To big of a company to care about a sales rep.  No one answered the phone when you needed help.
bad,"It's a good place to start your training for power equipment, but if you are looking for a company where managers treat everyone the same and have room for advancement, then Grainger is certainly not the place for you. Management is very racist and lazy. If you are not Hispanic they assume that you are not a hard worker and rarely ever see any management on the warehouse floor. I was fired for borrowing a tape gun and fired, whereas a Hispanic group got caught stealing company property and just put on a final warning. They say one thing but turn right around and do another."
bad,Too much change and trying to execute too many projects at once and can't get traction with the projects that matter. Good experience but i would recommend anyone work for this company.
bad,"Overall good environment. State of the art warehouse. Direct picking with real time production of each employee . "
bad,This place was an awesome place to work until a majority of the good managers left for better jobs. What does that tell you? If you work hard hey don't recognize it but if you suck up and brown nose all the time then you get recognized. I stayed overtime everyday cause others would slack or they would leave right in time no matter what and if you didn't stay management would make you feel guilty. Management fired people where I worked so they could bring in temp workers. If you're desperate then I'd apply otherwise look elsewhere. Granger is a waste of time.
bad,"I was recruited by Grainger to take over a flagging account base of 40 accounts."
bad,", the door is usually open. My coworkers are all very friendly, I even just started a weekly board game lunch with them. The hardest part of the job is sharing an office with my direct manager, that can be a bit frazzling at times."
bad,"High turnover, poor management, too many products, company mission statement changed too often. Local management had no respect for employees"
bad,"At my branch in Memphis, TN the culture seems to be micromanaging. Boss does not empower you and will never seem to see your point of view. Your opinions are not heard."
bad,The corporate office decided to close down this facility.  I found this position that I was hired on for was not what I was hoping for.  I did learn a lot about sales and customer service management.  My position was to be an accounts relationship manager and to call businesses in a certain location in the U.S and find out their business needs.
bad,"Overall , I would like to say a fine job at GISIPL ."
bad,Good Training that was on going..Some of the best co-workers you could ask for. They were always helpful and positive in their approach to their job and their fellow employees
bad,I wish the management was more responsive. Employee's concerns aren't as urgently addressed. Most people in my team were older people who were not willing to change and opt more efficient ideas.
bad,"The company has constant staffing issues as far as having enough people to do the job.  Their dedicated computer systems are fraught with problems you have to work through in order to do the fundamentals of your job, and the systems support for these issues is sorely lacking.  The management is promoted from within the company, but almost always uses people from other departments that don't understand the aspects of the department they're supervising.  Customer demands were frequently difficult to meet, largely due to overpromise of sales teams, and the morale was generally low with almost no confidence in leadership.  They do pay for your mileage when you have to drive to different client sites."
bad,"Level of labor was truly inconsistent. One hour you're trying to catch your breath, and the next you're sitting on your hands waiting for materials to pack!!"
bad,Pay is decent. Employee morale always down. Management either hires the wrong people or they just can't get good individuals to stay. Overtime is mostly mandatory 10 hour days 5 days a week.
bad,I enjoyed the job itself but the policies were not employee friendly.  They do offer training and depending on which supervise you get there is an opportunity to be successful
bad,This job has helped me learn more things about a warehouse. productivity wasn't too bad as long as you stayed busy. had a good relationship with my coworkers.
bad,"Lack of training and heavy turnover rate, most employees no more the management. Managment will push employees to work fast and fast some time working through breaks"
bad,"Poor leadership with no direction.  Constant turnover the past few years.  Okay place to start career, but to be used as a stepping stone for the next job."
bad,"Please note that in recent months it is my understanding that many changes have taken place, so this information may be out of date.  In my experience Acklands Grainger, there is little to no room for advancement via merit.  If you know those in charge and can leverage that relationship, do so.  Otherwise, move on."
bad,"Constant changes that are not for the employees benefit."
bad,"Grainger was a great organization to grow and develop your career. Their sales training provides a great foundation for growth and they emphasize continuing your development.  However, their once-great culture will continue to change as they realign the organization by reducing the customer facing workforce and adding additional leadership."
bad,Very fast paced and stressful.  Constantly changing with no clear path. Poor training and no path for advancement.  Not a proactive company. The do more with less culture was constantly being pushed.
bad,"Worked in the corporate office for a few years, and the culture has certainly changed a lot.  Leadership has changed dramatically and people are downright miserable to work for.  Grainger has tried to improve it's diversity for leadership positions, but continues to make highly questionable moves on their Director level and higher teams.  There is a lot of red tape to get anything done, and getting approvals can be crippling.  Grainger has gone through several reorgs which are to ""compete"" in the new world with the likes of Amazon, but have done a poor job retaining talent, and frankly, given poor reasons for the types of people they have retained vs. let go.  Overall, job environment is very unstable in 2018 and would not recommend working there now."
bad,Lads on the floor are good great selection of shifts to work but work is not steady lay people off but have guys in on overtime not poor communication between departments
bad,"I learned a great deal working, but was also put in stressful situations. Policies were always changing and clients made things even more difficult. The ability to perform through skill is an inaccurate statement."
bad,storied company beginning a major change to embrace e commerce as opposed to retail storefronts and a traditional methodology. Company seems to have a hi degree of integrity towards clients & employees. Definitely will be in  a state of flux which will result in a stronger culture & entity. Another company trying to deal with the forces of governments intent on driving business out of canada
bad,"If you are OK with fast pace work then you will be OK. It wouldn't be bad if they had set hours instead of start to finish. People that have families or small children I definitely would not recommend Grainger,"
bad,"Having exp doesn't really matter; the Co hires you for your exp, but it's mentality is all 'relationship-based'.  Exp doesn't get you to the next level, it gets you lateral moves so you can get 'more exp'.  those that get advanced roles are usually the ones with no exp but have done a great job 'running' a project. This is a major unspoken complaint throughout the org.  Turnover is high, staffing is a struggle and the Co doesn't know how to retain good qualified people. It's unfortunate."
bad,I'm thee 6 months and do my job well.  Shutting down division and throwing us out on the street.  They dont care about employees.  They care about bottom lines and people that fit in.  You can perform well in your position but it doesn't matter. It's who you know not what you know.
bad,"Grainger's UX department is led by a self-conscious management team of 'consultant-types' with little to no UX experience, who prefer young staff they don't find threatening.  I witnessed UX researchers deliberately tank user tests to kill the work of political rivals.  Grainger's broader culture considers initiative to be rebellious and swings through cycles of re-orging, layoffs, and panicked rehiring.  At the same time, there is no particular drive to complete any project at any particular time.  And long periods of mandatory idleness (up to 6 months), waiting for instructions from upper management, encourage staff to take off early, goof-around, or watch Netflix.  Just don't let anybody catch you trying to help.  On the plus side, they pay well in salary and benefits and if you factor that as an hourly rate, their pay is extraordinary."
bad,A typical work day consisted of you receiving an unobtainable goal from a manager that is not willing to listen to why the goals given to you and other team members are unrealistic. Management knows everything while at the same time knows nothing. Coworkers are very skilled and under appreciated and that is why turnover is very high. The hardest part about the job is going to work and dealing with management.
bad,"The company is going through a lot of changes right now leaving a lot of employees left behind.  Grainger claims to be concerned with their employees' happiness and engagement, but at the end of the day, it call comes down to what is best for Grainger.  "
bad,"Every year they try something new to motivate the team members.  Nothing works.  They have lost their way.  They are not competitive on price, so they cut price which impacts revenue.  So, they cut people and teams continually.  It is sad as this was a once great company to work for.  More layoffs, more cuts, more mistakes.  Unfortunate."
bad,"I started my position at Grainger with an intention of advancing with the company for a long term career.  I quickly learned from others that its not what you know in the company it is who you know.  I have quickly learned that corporate initiatives leave little room for feedback from the employees that actually work with the customer.  I struggle with these initiatives as my customer point out that the direction of the company is not mirroring the goals of the customers.  Small customers can get our products cheaper on amazon, then directly from the source.  That says a lot.  Grainger wants big customers, corporate agreements, or the business if not worth their time.  It seems as if they have forgotten where they came from and what made them successful when they started out peddling motors from the back of a pick up truck."
bad,Company has excellent products and customers willing to spend money.  Account Executives are lazy and only concentrate on key customers and let bleeders go.  Management only cares about bottom line and keep cutting down retail staff.
bad,When I started I loved this company but they slowly kept taking more away and made in a very uncomfortable environment to work in.  Became more focused on a script than actually making sales and meeting customers needs.  Coworkers were fantastic but management is filled with people who simply have no people skills. Call volume is too high and you have no time to do after call work and get in trouble for doing so.
bad,Company has changed over the last few years. No longer the best place to work in Savannah as they claim. They have flooded the sales floor with about 6 to 7 more salesmen that are needed for their sales. So no one is really making a good living.
bad,"There was practically no room for advancement for minorities in customer service, nor anywhere else since I had worked there. The customer service role did not require a college degree, only a High School diploma. I applied for over 50 positions there throughout my 8 years and got nowhere. But they paid for my Masters degree. So obviously I tried to get a job in the field my major (Integrated Marketing Communications) there. When they did not give me a job at headquarters, I got a new job where the employer appreciated a higher education and diversity. I hardly ever saw African-Americans at their corporate headquarters during my frequent visits. I sure hope that has changed by now."
bad,I started calling on 300 accounts and also cold calling for new business as well. With that amount of work your days always went by pretty rapidly.
bad,"Culture seemed to focus on bully management. Simple mistakes while learning were often followed by anger and personal comments. Jobs were often ""jokingly"" threatened. The expectation that you would work hard and be rewarded was followed by the realization that hard work was the reward. Managers were poorly trained in encouraging employees. Managers received the largest bonuses, pay raises and promotions. There were personnel that had been there for over 5 years without promotion while some personnel that were better ""liked"" were promoted twice during the last year. The last year the performance review raise was averaged for most employees at 2% or below, while inflation ate away at least 6% of our earnings."
bad,"My review is for the distribution center. The corporate office culture is different. "
bad,overnight 4 pm until 230 am. problem solver. poor management where metrics are the main priority. hardest part is locating mixed or mislabeled product. best part is my fellow team members that i work with.
bad,"1-2 hours of overtime every day, you never know when you’re leaving, management is constantly changing and making unnecessary changes to the way departments work in the name of maximizing efficiency to the point where you can’t go to the bathroom without your rate falling below standards. Also management absolutely will retaliate if you attempt to go to HR about anything"
bad,"Great benefits & pay for the area and the work youll be doing. Decent co-workers well at least the ones that weren't kissing up all the time, terrible "
bad,You definitely have to be best friends with your manger because they choices if you will make money or not. Also they changed so many things that it’s not even worth working there. Hourly is really the only thing your going to get at this time.
bad,"They are a great company however with the advent of Sales Force they focus too much on the metrics and not enough on sales time."
bad,"If you are not in sales you are not the top priority.  The Work/Life balance isn't what they claim it to be. However, the compensation is fairly good."
bad,Not sure where Grainger is headed. The said that keep stock was their future in March and in November they are asking Keepstock people to go part-time.
bad,"Constantly changing upper management and poor work/life balance.  Fear of losing position.  Advancement dependent on who you know, not what you know.  Continuous ""do more with less"" mentality creates increasing job stress"
bad,The DC has taken the personal aspect out of the job.  You are a number.  Hit your numbers and you're all good.  Don't hit your numbers and you're out.
bad,Grainger was consistently one of the top places to work but the company has been in decline over the last 5 years. Constant reorganizations have caused a number of people to lose jobs and has created an unstable culture where people no longer matter.
bad,"Fast growing industry.  The schedule varies day to day which causes any other scheduling very difficult. One day you may work 7-3, the next day 12-8.  Very fast pace environment."
bad,"If you're needing money and don't mind knowing what time your shift will end, this is a great place...especially if your 18-34.  Promotions are few and far between, along with raises.  Continued stress from upper management for quality and productivity makes Grainger difficult to handle for some."
bad,"This company use to be ok but now it not a good environment to work in.  They ran off all of there good workers and now they can't  keep nobody to stay worker there turn over rate is horrible. Management is so bad all they do is sit around  and find ways to get you fired.  You not moving up, you only good for putting away or picking  just being honest with you. They only look out for people who kiss there butt. Raises are bad they  nickel and dime you. H&R only look out for the company so if you have a problem its not going to get fixs. The only good things about this company  is the benefits and starting pay other than that I wouldn't recommend you to work there a waste of time!"
bad,"Not a company I would recommend. The company is not growing financially as they'd like too. Job Consolidations occur too often. Management puts pressure on sales reps whilst giving them limited resources. Workers are overworked and under paid. If hired, stay away from sales position. Company is only focused on growing via e-commerce."
bad,"Don't be too good at your job, or else you will never get promoted.   Healthcare is good, but they are out of touch with their employees and business.   They fake being progressive until it's time to put fully invest.  The first sign of trouble,  they revert to 'tried and true methodologies'"
bad,"Terrible training. Several complicated processes to accomplish a simple goal, which is to sell overpriced merchandise to customers, plain and simple.  They preach ""back to basics"" non-stop.  Maybe they should practice what they preach starting from the top down, such as realize they are a warehouse distributor/catalog company, and keep it simple.  Adding complex, nonsense procedures, multiple computer programs and processes, only leads to unhappy customers.  CSR's are robots programmed to push shipping and argue with customer's who want to pick up at a branch, because they are slowly doing away with the branches altogether and want to get customer's ready for ship-only business with the company in the future.  No job security. A lot of customer's are realizing Amazon has the same or comparable product at a fraction of the price."
bad,Depends on the team you are in. Not much flexibility. Growth is there and pay scale is good
bad,"First thing coming into the job they lie to your face. They tell you the hours, but guess what you will be there 2-3 hours after your shift ends every day. No one cares about you, management or HR reps, they don't care about anything you say. There is no work life balance at all! They don't care if you have kids, pets, or family waiting at home for you. The turnover rate is unbelievable!"
bad,"The benefits and pay were the best part of this job. Everything else was dependent upon what department you worked in. And trust me, the managers could care less whether you like your current duties or not. Heck, they hardly cared for their employees at all."
bad,"To many managers that came from elsewhere and have no experience doing the job. Popularity contest. Don’t care much for their employees, only numbers."
bad,"Enjoy working with the Excellent Customers"
bad,"I had 2 good managers at grainger and 2 awful ones. I left because of horrendous management. "
bad,Didn't get to enjoy the job culture as much as I want. Had a short Temporary contract with Grainger. Seems like a great place to work however pay isn't a factor to stay long.
bad,"Day to day operating at store level was fine, I enjoyed my job and working with my colleagues however, company management on a higher level was deplorable to say the least, the general lack of communication from upper management was abysmal even upon the company going into administration when advice and guidance was of paramount importance we, at store level received nothing. "
bad,"Your ideas will only be taken seriously if you have Managements approval. Highly flexible in location and hours for working, excellent compensation. Reorganize their departments, and remove people constantly."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of taking incoming calls for internal/external customers, problem solving, order placement, and assisting customers with navigating the website. I learned about all the different products they offered, which is over 1,000,000. There is some good management.  I became to build friendships with my co-workers. Multi-tasking the work load at time was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming knowledgeable within different departments of the company."
bad,Stay until finished.  Hardest part of the day is at 5pm when you're ready to leave.  Hours are very abnormal.  work life balance is very tough to adjust too.
bad,"I helped customers find the item(s) best fit their needs "
bad,"Sales/hitting your numbers are everything.  You can pretty much run your own day to day duties as long as your hitting your numbers.  They give you great training in the beginning.  A lot of turnover in the management, so that can frustrating."
bad,Benefits are great but management sucks and they are unnecessarily fast paced and stressful. I feel it is a fear based culture. No job aids or documented processes or training.
bad,This is a good place to work if you are just starting out. Performance is based off of metrics. The opportunity to advance is there only if you choose your words carefully during an interview honesty is not a thing that gets practiced you are expected to lie your way through the ranks. Breaks are way too short and everything is micromanaged. Supervisors treat you like you are stupid even though you have a degree. Raises don't happen that often and management wants you to be a good little robot the harder you try the more it's not good enough.
bad,"Every day things were so hectic and unorganized for no reason. Employees don't work together or help out when it is busiest, and a lot of people sit around and socialize while a few of us do the majority of the work. Also they switch employees around to different departments sometimes more than once a day, no consistency at all."
bad,"excellent"
bad,I have really enjoyed my time at Acklands Grainger and have been lucky enough to work along side some great co workers. I have spent ten great years at this company.
bad,"Grainger is an alright place to work at, just bad management. Hope they get it together. It's an overall nice place to work at if you're used to doing the same thing day in and day out with no plans of advancement.."
bad,"I have been in the Grainger family 10+ years and have witnessed a number of changes in the company, both good and bad. The people are great, and pay and benefits are ok. Employee moral has significantly decreased over the years as the company no longer seems to value and respect it's employees as they once did."
bad,Grainger was a good company and I had good managers up until my last manager. She was terrible. She didn't support her team. She was all about her and advancing herself.  Do the best you can and document everything.
bad,You have a scheduled start time. But you never know when you're getting off. Management seems unconcerned about your issues. Overtime is a guarantee. VERY hot.
bad,"The pay is decent, and that's what keeps people working there. It's a decent job for someone that doesn't have a college degree, or has just started working after school."
bad,"management is very poor. my manager was having inappropriate elations with my co worker. Any time I would ask for his assistance he would forget it about or say he was busy but had no time going over to that co-worker to giggle, exchange phones and flirt. "
bad,"Great company if you are in the service area of the organization. This is a service based company that happens to have a sales force. Account Manager role should be clearly called Sales Representative. Extremely difficult to reach goals in the sales area. Company regularly loses top performers due to poor people management, unrealistic goals and communication. Customers are leery of new reps since there is so much turnover. Goals could be achievable if there was more focus on customer relationships and overall growth and less on daily sales numbers and spending 20 hours/week in front of customers."
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,It was an ok place to work. Constantly have a supervisor looking over your shoulder and unrealistic expectations with there point system. Not great when it comes to balance on work and life.
bad,alright place to work for. the pay was very low considering the type of work that was required and what other companies paid for similar work.
good,Management made poor decision our whole team got laid off because they decided to bring in a new contractor we trained their new guys then they fired us the whole team and the new guys don't care at all about the work they do have poor work ethic and lower the quality of service for the on site service staff its sad because I loved working there I took care of people and helped them fix their problem but they don't care when they have a problem we fixed it when our team got a problem because new management were on our own.
good,"Going into my larger accounts and selling to my internal contacts all day long."
good,do not take a sales job for this company working for this company is okay as long as you don't take a sales position if you take a sales position they will harass you consistently. And they will not fire you they will harass you to try to make you quit. Most of their employees here are stressed out.
good,"fast paced enviroment, strange first shift hours. Great part time job"
good,"When I started at Grainger 15-20 years ago there were many talented driven passionate people. I learned many things from them and am very grateful."
good,"Executive leaderships decisions as of late are questionable especially after coming off of a fantastic year financially. Won the world series and decided to rebuild the entire Digital team, this will be a great case study."
good,Just not a good place to work  you work till finish and you never know when that will be . The harder you work the more they take advantage of you. not cool
good,"There is no such thing as a predictable day at this job. Everything here on a daily basis is unpredictable. The management lack interpersonal skills.  As, a result the morale has decreased in the entire building in Minooka IL."
good,"This is a decent job as far as pay,pto and benefits but they are very fake! Don't care about the employees at all, like to play favorites for advancement. You can succeed only through kiss up and hard work is gone unseen. Management pays no attention to extra work you put in day in and day out."
good,"You are killing the branch business, too many changes, risk adverse managers who are afraid to challenge the moronic decisions coming from corp. It used to be a fun and challenging place to work, but not anymore."
good,"My experience with Grainger was limited due to part-time status. However, it was a great work enviornment with lots of people. It allowed me the freedom to attend college full time as well as work."
good,Great place to work with proper compensation.  Tough to grow in the ladder.  Which lead to no satisfaction in the job.  Yearly bonus is very less.  Expect many changes.
good,"Most of the supervisors and management here are ego driven. The culture has changed drastically the last ten years. Used to be blue but thanks to the upper management and a (now former) HR person it is a deep red culture. It is all about the numbers per hour. Once you make that number, they will change it the next month."
good,"Nice pay for the work being done.  No advancement.  Just moving around, with different titles, doing the same thing, for the same pay for different branches of retail.  Got an exceeds expectations as year end review, was told it was 1 out of 5 in 500+ agents, but we all got the same raise at the beginning of the year.  Was put on an impossible action plan that lead to my termination, even though there was no issue with attendance occurrences or meeting monthly goals."
good,"I went into this job, excited and thought I had found a place long term. These people are masters of deception. I left my previous job. Bc of all the overtime we were forced to work, so I asked in my interview if this was required. Manager showed me the percentage s from the prior years which were less than 2 percent. I was told ""very little, if any"". so I took his word..I was there almost a year and could count on one hand how many times we actually got off on schedule, while other departments were on schedule, our Dept was always 45 mins to an hour behind. Extremely unorganiized, management would literally watch you, all four of the to managers, less than 30 people in Dept when u were working alone and it was a 2 person job at all times. Very degrading and they seemed to enjoy it, this was taken to HR many times to no avail. Equipment breaks daily, never fixed permanently. If u want to"
good,"Great company to work at. They tend to run your life and create an environment where you have no work life balance."
good,"Work with Supply chain, sellers, and buying team. Company is lost and trying to find itself. The company focuses more on expenses than quality work environment. Employees are in constant fear of layoffs."
good,"Health and safety is substantially low and management are terrible especially with decisions plus chances of pay rise (no matter how experienced you are) are very minimal. All through out the worst company I have ever come across when it comes to management and how you are treated."
good,Leadership direction and overall culture is terrible. I believe from my time there that the company is going to continue to erode.
good,"Regular administrative assistant position, with the ability to work from home. Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual reporting along with requested reporting on a daily basis. Schedule and plan meetings, attend operation reviews. Support multiple teams at once and multiple directors."
good,"Overall Grainger is a good place to work, but it do not provide oppurtunities for growth in the Lafayette area.  Grainger has a great benefit package."
good,"Great company with great a plan, there are a lot of great people that work for Grainger, but it is a demanding industrial. ."
good,Managament made for a poor work place. Employees never felt secure with their jobs.
good,Very heavy on the management and upper management.  Poor communication.  Clicks and bad attitudes in the middle management.   Good employees leave there jobs not because of the job but because of bad management.
good,Wasnt best place to work for none stop work targets was always high and out of reach for the lads to fulfill and wages wasnt good for what you had to do
good,"Changes happened and retracted. Long term goal is muddle. If you are here to collect the pay check then perfect place to be. If you care about career, then you must play the politic game."
good,Was unfortunate to be one of the branches that was closed in the Edmonton area. And even though I have lots of experience they didn’t offer me a job at the DC. I feel like they just used the branch closures to get rid of the older employees. And that left a lot of us without a job and very little change of finding another one this late in our careers.
good,Recent changes in management have changed my outlook of the company as a whole. The company;s overall focus has changed to administration and not so much about the customer.
good,"The culture the leadership present sounds good but lacks class in actions. There is no true care about team members in any of their actions, making for a an unbalanced work/life culture."
good,"This was once a great company to work for with a great culture. Sadly now they are shutting down branches and cutting positions. The big problem is the same management team has yet to solve any of the internal problems. Management continues to say that everything will be fixed in ""18 months"" but they have said this for the last 3 years. There is no chance of getting promoted now because they have eliminated so many positions. They just cut 40% of their sales positions and are now looking to fill most of these roles back at a lower Salary."
good,"clock in as you are required to stay within adherence.  Stressful, not good in training, fast paced and must like a constant change! Be good on comput"
good,A typical day was clock in at 7 am and clock out at 3:30 pm. There was not time for much else. I was on the phones from start to finish. I  was stuck to my phone and computer for 8 hours a day.
good,"I was doing a three hour commute one way everyday in a company car and 97% of the time my equipment did not work, which was stressful being out in the field and trying to do your job."
good,Not a bad place to work.  Vacation is good.  Retirement has been cut back twice since I have been working there.  Management is sketchy at best.  Tend to tell you one thing to your face and do something completely different behind your back.  Lack of communication
good,Fast paced and stressful. Only a 30 minute lunch and one 15 minute break regardless if you work 10+ hour shift. They don't care about your personal life.
good,"Leadership team expected too much form management level employees - working through lunches, taking work home, to mentorship, not enough training time, so support system."
good,"Quasi corporate company, tenured staff are entitled- very hard to fit in if you come from the outside. Stunning facility in Mettawa IL.  Might consider going back if job and salary fit."
good,"This job just is not for me. Benefits are great, for us full timers, and vacation time is great. The vibe IMO leaves something to be desired. If you don't have any goals in mind then this is a good place to work for to just come in do your job and leave."
good,"Typical day is driving around on an ""order picker,"" and selecting orders off of shelves. I've learned how to select orders going outbound, or putting away product inbound. Management has changed recently, lots of first time supervisors that has turned the dream job into something less satisfying. What's difficult in thinking of leaving is that I seriously like, and get along with all of my co-workers. They have to be the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Seem to have lost their way a bit.  Still a culture of kingdom building.  Upper management needs overhaul.  30% of new hires it I/T leave in first year.  Similar exodus rate in other areas of business.
good,"Only hire part time customer service and refuses to allow people full time (they are more concerned about the shareholder than employees and customers)."
good,The position was very seasonal where the bulk of sales were done during three months
good,"Grainger has a great profit sharing program but the time they expect to get from you in return is nights, weekends and holidays after you have already completed your typical 10-12 work hour day.  The most difficult part of the job is the persistent paperwork that is required to do anything.  Daily call reports, quotes, pipelines, calendars, forecasts, projects all have to be reviewed by multiple parties at the end of the day.  Don't forget color coding for target prioritization. Grainger loves conference calls! Emails from management, emails from customers, emails from project teams.  You must be a fluent multi-tasker! Co-workers and customers are the best part of the job!  Too bad management doesn't reward their seasoned veterans for hard work and effort through the years. You will always be considered  for what you can do for them today not what you did yesterday."
good,"When I started working at Grainger there were a lot of negative Nancy's. I couldn't understand why. I enjoyed the work and my coworkers, but after being there for a while I soon realized why.  Employees were great but unfortunately management needed and attitude adjustment. Management was not encouraging or motivating. Grainger was a revolving door and instead replacing bad management they would just rotate the manager to a different department."
good,"My assigned customers were resellers and Grainger's prices did not leave enough meat on the bone for them. Customers flatly cited price as the reason for their ""no"". Not much lattitude on working with price. Frustrating. I came to hate my job."
good,"drama, popularity contest, inconsistent, rude coworkers, immaturity...I could go on. i would not recommend this place to anyone unless they got to work from home. which take about 40 years to do."
good,peers were great management was not. At times managers would openly admit to not knowing how we manage to do our jobs because they could not keep up if roles were reversed.
good,"Grainger is a Great company to work for. They have great benefits and they do pay fair. However, many of the thing that one needs to be content depend a lot on upper management. In sales, the metrics are high, the pace is fast and they don't give a lot for you to develop your own business. How they want you to do it, in a cookie cutter fashion. But if you are successful, you do have great recognition. You must however play by their rules in order to advance your career."
good,Grainger is a good place to work for some people. They are not a progressive comapny...more reactive. Meet some great friends and customer while working there.
good,"SO much has changed, I wouldn't know where to begin"
good,Friendly atmosphere with upper management take the time to accurately know your name...however the end is not consistent not knowing if you have to work over 15 minutes or 30
good,i worked for grainger for almost 4 years it went through many changes from top to bottom salary and commission could be better. focused on wrong ideas
good,"Overall good company. Inconsistent on firing practices in my opinion. People still employed after blatantly breaking company policies and laws, which affects job performance and customer service, while others make a small mistake unrelated to job performance and are let go."
good,Benifits are where its at they have 401k and profit sharing. They offer health coverage which is good. They are a decent company to work for if you live local
good,"I Pm conveyor system daily,"
good,"The positives at Grainger are the people you work with and deal with on a daily basis.  However, leadership seems confused on the go forward strategy of the organization and are slow to react to competitors and market conditions."
good,"Work individually for 90% of the time.  Manage my own business and grow my accounts through customer relationships, Grainger sales strategies and product knowledge."
good,"We have a morning meetings, make sure I have all equipment needed before I get on the orderpicker. first half of the day putaway, take a break and play pingpong which is the best part of the day and then go back second half to putaway the remainder. Its nothing really hard about the job until management make it hard."
good,"The company doesn't know how to attack the medium sized market."
good,"Great team, everyone is extremely knowledgeable, due to the vast variety of product sold you learn a lot about just about every type of product"
good,"Outside of Sales, there are very few advancement opportunities if you are not willing to move to Chicago."
good,I enjoyed working for Grainger and part of me would still love to be there. The biggest downfalls was almost every person that I worked with was always very afraid to lose there job and it caused a lot of grief.
good,Company has very rigid views and not much room for advancement if one to three mistakes are made
good,hours are long
good,You play the largest role in your development! You must be active and mobile in order to see giant gains. Hard Work and Smarts dont take you far in this company.
good,"W.W. Grainger offers a good compensation and benefits package. The company is a strong company with significant growth. However, the managment does not value employees and sometimes the work evnironment is very hostile."
good,"I worked there for 14 years. The first 6 or 7 years was the best time. But they started changing plant managers like under wear. And every new manager had new plans and rules. Finally, Grainger planed a new DC in California, they told use the KC DC was 75% over staffed and started letting people go, targeted the most tenner people. They now have a very high temporary work force."
good,"beaucoup de pression et cie très mal organisé, les clients quittent car mauvais service du centre d'appel"
good,"The pay is great, but you have to be very careful who you talk to. Management is good.. until its not. The closer you are to management, the better off you will be."
good,"did placement for trIOS there"
good,"I was unhappy with management as far as training. I ran into production issues and when I asked for help and retraining, I was ignored until it was the last minute and I was about to lose my job. It was very unfortunate."
good,Be able to work on a quick time frame. Constant heavy lifting and cleaning out bays expected. Long work hours. Decent pay but not the best management.
good,"Good company overall, but the standards are a little high. Most of management is good but some are too hardcore which makes it difficult to do a good job (or feel like your doing a good job). Benefits are good, better than most company's. You do work for your money."
good,"Grainger was a good place to work as far as pay and benefits. the work was fairly simple, just physical. They were always looking for ways to improve."
good,Grainger takes care of it's people and it's hard to find a part-time employer that is willing to do that. Upward mobility is nil at the retail level but there is room for lateral movement within the company.
good,Things started off great but gradually the environment began to collapse and it became toxic. The new changes that were implemented ruined the trust that we built with out clients ultimately causing us to lose business.
good,"Pulled orders, load and unloaded product from trailers.  Stocked shelves and operated forklift, straddle and crown lift. Also on the safety team to make sure the warehouse was kept safe for the other warehouse staff'"
good,"Position driven, driving the best workers out. Constant change and change back...no development.  Growth is not a focus in a positive light. Customer Service is not what It could be and should be."
good,"The company had good benefits such as profit sharing 401K and medical(only had a $300 deductible). That's about it. For a warehouse job, it does pay pretty well. "
good,"Grainger tries to promote from within, but the restrictions on promotional opportunities make it to where 1-2 reps out of 1,000 get promoted each year, meanwhile managers, HR generalists, Staffers, Tech agents etc are all hired externally. You are told to set up your IDP (which you cannot access from home) somehow in-between phone calls while still assisting your customers and without help from your immediate supervisor. Once you decide on a Career path the expect you to adhere to it. Say for example you say you want to do help phone (Senior CSR position) but a different senior CSR position opens up that you are qualified for and know you will excel at, if you apply for that against your IDP, you will be viewed as emotionally unintelligent and it will tarnish your consideration for future positions. They try hard to create a culture, but it's just not there."
good,Grainger was once a great company for employees but no more. All they care about is dividends for the stock holders. On the present course I believe this company may crash and burn.
good,"People are nice, but not trustworthy"
good,"good company to work for. Takes care of they,'re employees."
good,fast pace and high stress environment great people but horrible management. A lot of favoritism was going around while I was there and many people got away with not doing much
good,"Do the delivery in the morning or delivery days do the price change serve fix phones test consoles or phones for trade in keep the shop organised an presentable."
good,"The Inside Sales division in San Antonio was not strategized effectively when originated. As much as 85% of the management team has no sales or management experience. There is a 4 week training that does not position success on the job and there are uneffective managers to assist with the lack of. The organization frowns upon being labeled as a call center. However, the culture is call center based along with call center metrics assigned. Said metrics can lead to termination for lack of meeting. For example, if revenue targets are met but the # of dials, discount program sign-ups, or certain conversations do not meet target goals then the employee is subject to a write up and/or termination.  In training, you are told to treat your territory as your own business and make money. That does not coincide with what is actually allowed to happen on the sales floor. The company benefits and work life balance is the only promising thing with Grainger, San Antonio."
good,the job itself is easy. the time we get off would differ on a daily basis. fast paced job picking customer orders. no advancement for moving up in the company.
good,"Goal setting is confusing and complicated"
good,"Job description didn't match job, training didn't match job. Management was awful from day one. Had to pull teeth to talk about development. Manager was unapproachable. Made you feel dumb for asking job related questions. Micromanaged. I was successful with sales but my manager hated me and it showed. Department wasn't returning on investment so strategy changed every few months. Overall this job was very stressful and even if you were doing well it was never enough. I was making only 30 cents more than the new employees. Regardless of me being there 6-12months longer. They were Caucasian males and I am not."
good,"I enjoyed the experiences and development I gained over 10 years with Grainger; but I found that the culture and infrastructure was changing at a much too rapid pace, which created many gaps in our service and often made our employees feel over-worked and under-valued (pretty much across the board)."
good,"Grainger's business model is outdated.  When I first started working there, they had over 500 branch locations but now they are now below 100.  The e-commerce model is taking over industrial supply sales."
good,"Leadership decisions and placement very poor, de-stabilizing company results and negatively impacting employee productivity and morale. New management does not provide performance reviews or feedback to employees. Priorities are not clearly defined or executed on."
good,Grainger is great place to get experience and get your career started. Starting with Grainger will help open other doors. Great staff to work with but not much room to advance.
good,"Like most companies Grainger has it share of issues, but overall the companies not bad to work for. Depending on your manager. The biggest issue for most or I should say myself is the compensation."
good,"The facility is very clean.  The pay and benefits are great.  The employees are good but the first year turnover is very high. "
good,"This job is boring, none progressive and very demanding. Management are not to bad, fair and easy going. Most enjoyable part of the job break time...."
good,"Over worked, lack of leadership and direction."
good,"fast paced call center enironment, taking back toback calls. strict quality assurance guidleines. difficult to advance to other departments if unable to relocate"
good,"Jobs are not secure as the company has attempted to sale, go public and now going through a reduction in force. The culture is stranded but it appears they may be working on this."
good,The company has a great business model to service their costumes with exceptional next day or same day service of top quality products.  The team members are fun to work with and the training is excellent.  Easy to open customer doors because of the brand recognition.
good,Pretty much top down management style and old school management values. Not to flexible to hearing new ideas or different work concepts.
good,"Un día tipico en grainger es llegar a tu lugar de trabajo, ordenar por donde empezar a trabajar, leer correos, dar solucion, salir a comer con mis compañeros de area."
good,"Great teammates, I learned a lot with their training program.  Wonderful brand recognition.  Enjoyed the profit sharing."
good,"Atmosphere was negative. The company claims to be a good environment for employees to expand their horizons. The co-workers I encountered were not friendly. Instead of helping, they criticized. There was not proof that any of the hourly workers were promoted. Several had been there more than 15 years and still in the same job."
good,"Used to be good place to work, upper management is struggling many many layoffs in branchs, corporate office and outlying office. Changed PST to much lower value"
good,A day at work pulling orders dropping them off. Working with others that all ways went well. Management going through some big changes why I am looking to leave. hardest part about the job who much we can get at one time.
good,"This company has been a great company to work for over the last 10+ years. As I have learned more and more about different facets of the business, I have not been challenged to leverage my extensive entrepreneurial and corporate business background to assist in organizational advancement to the degree to which I am satisfied."
good,Grainger has great benefits that can be hard to find with other companies and their sourcing team has been blowing up forecaster goals.
good,"Good company without tremendous opportunity for advancement. Learned to analyze how a customer purchased, maintained and dispersed inventor.  Main objective was giving time, space and dollars back to the customer through managing inventory."
good,"This is not a blast to Grainger but a highlight on how a bad manager can ruin your experience with a great company.  Grainger offered a great training program and left it open for me to work with  my manager; this is where it all went downhill.  My manager was never available to answer any questions and on the rare circumstance that she was available (via cell phone), she would either make up a solution or have me reach out to another co-worker on the team for help (something I had done before contacting her).  During out bi-weekly coaching sessions where she would go into the field with me, she would show up at least a couple of hours late making me look horrible in front of some of my biggest customers.  When I finally achieved some success, she was quick to discredit my work behind my back with my co-workers and chalk up any success to luck.  The manager was horrible and I am not OK with the fact that she ruined what might have been an opportunity for the rest of my life.  Word to the wise, analyze your manager before taking the job!"
good,This company is vey stable financially and offers a wide range of career path
good,"> Fast paced atmosphere"
good,A stable company with a poor work life balance for some areas of the company.
good,Previous manager to my departure was more focused on the people.
good,Great Company. Excellent Opportunities. Terrible Sales Team Leadership. You can't put operators in sales and think its going to work unless that person is educated.
good,"Overall a good company to work for. However, advancement opportunities are already pre-determined. It will be difficult to find advancement opportunities if you do not know someone."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with so many different types of people at all different levels. From Maint. Staff to VP's and in some cases Owners of Organizations.
good,Great team! High stress job with a lot of after hours commitment required to be successful.
good,"A good place to get your feet wet in the world of sales. Tons of perks such as your own car (the grainger mobile) a laptop and cellphone...everything paid for! Plus, if you're any good at selling, you can make some money. In certain areas the selling goals are much too high, but if you are good at your job, there is money to be made."
good,its and alright place to work some of the people there are nice others are dorks and the management needs improving for there lack of communication threw channels of net work and the staffing arrangements done poorly last minute
good,Overall great place to work with bad management. No work life balance! You work very long hours. Hard to be crossed trained in other areas. Forklift drivers make the same money as pickers and packers
good,"Great job but turnover rate is very high  "
good,"IT is a revolving door of leadership and ""flavor of the quarter"" processing frameworks.  Career development is highly promoted, but lacking in delivering for many individual contributors.  Managers with poor performance and understanding of skills needed continue to be promoted and rewarded within buddy system."
good,"This place is a great place to start off your career in property managemnent."
good,"This place is good as a temporary job. The pay is decent, but they were in the middle of cutting people's benefits when I left. Most of the people were very nice and the atmosphere was pleasant. It's hard labor, so expect to break a sweat."
good,"Was a good job, friendly people to work with who care about their customers.  Training and technology was adequate.  Management tends play favoritism if you are looking to advance."
good,Friendly workplace with fun coworkers. Sometime we know when we start but no idea about the closure. Management team decisions does not always match with the reality.
good,ok place to work but very slow in getting management to help you do anything. I wish they would promote people faster the management here is very slow to act on anything.
good,"Not what it used to be. A lot has changed at this company over the years, new manager does not fully value the Grainger way. Culture has changed for the worst."
good,"Grainger was great to me until they decided to cut expenses, then I was treated like an outsider and given no help to stay with the company. Company is not interested with promoting within."
good,"Follow the group as the company has a clan mentality and you could end up on the wrong side of cut-throat politics.  This is a do as your told place and don't think outside the box.  If you do, make sure you have buy off all the way up cause it's not your idea.  However, decent place to work if you're with the right leader.  Pay and perks are above average."
good,"poor associate culture. a lot of ""its not my job"". most of management looks the other way to associates hiding in the isles as opposed to addressing it. they rely on associates with better work ethic to compensate as opposed to addressing said issues. constant horseplay over the radios. associates playing music through radios, harassing each other through directed remarks over radio which are meant for professional communication. general unprofessional conduct on this medium. once again management does nothing about this"
good,Typical high paced production job. You learn the essentials of the MRO market. The management in the Supply chain side is not the best. The culture is extremely diverse which is a plus for this job. The hardest part of the job would be constant lifting which could possibly cause strain on the back. The most enjoyable part about the job is the relationships you can build between your team-members.
good,"Well paying, there are lots of things to learn but to advance with the things you learn is hard and takes a lot of time unless the manager favors you. Decent hours unless you work nights. Needs to spend more time doing team building."
good,Good company with a solid future.  Internal procedures too complex but isn't that true for most?  Great brand recognition and reputation for service. Good benefits.
good,"I worked at AGI for less than 3 months before a mass termination meant I was out of a job because my ""position no longer exists"" "
good,"Grainer is a good company but the corporation in a whole cut many employees to embrace electronic service over face to face. While a person should not take things personally, true loyalty is one sided."
good,Company has been run into the ground due to over paid head office staff now 400 people are out of work ..................................................
good,my position was eliminated and they closed the rcc and relocated to the west coast and opened ncc.  they didn't go above and beyond to secure tenured employee's future jobs.
good,"As a phone agent, your duties are fairly consistent, but the metrics that you are tracked by change often.  Grainger has high standards and aggressive goals. Grainger's systems are extremely complex, and change often.  Usually there is not much training given on the changes.  Grainger hires awesome people and offers extensive benefits, but the work life balance that they used to offer is not available in most positions."
good,Getting your supplies ready before you and stretch so won't have any injuries. Grabbing your cart and pick your items on the symbol and place it in the box. After that you put the on the conveyor so it can go to packering.
good,Provided me great experience yet it was difficult to achieve work-life balance. Old school culture clashing with company that wants to appear progressive.  Constant cost pressure and slow to make funding decisions.
good,"Prospecting, telemarketing, current client visits.  I learned more about the different services and products they offer.  Management needs improvement."
good,"Benefits are really expensive compared to any other company that I have worked for. Payed nearly double what I did at my last employer and the deductible was higher."
good,Great place to start if you are freshly graduated out of college.  Co-workers are friendly and great to work with. Place orders for account managers and customers via email or over the phone.
good,Grainger is a strong company with a good culture if you are at its corporate office. Field based work experiences are not the same at all. The message gets lost between corporate and the field.
good,"I have worked for Grainger off and on since May, 1981.  I have held positions of Warehouse Associate to Distribution Center Operation Manager."
good,Every manager at Grainger has a different style of managing when it comes to structuring your day in the field. There is a lack of structure when it comes to how sales is conducted in this company; partially because the company is consistently downsizing and changing its sales approach. Workplace balance is mediocre. The pay and benefits do not make up for the time spent on the job. The team and my peers were fantastic!
good,Grainger is the best at training their salesforce.  They do tend to promote from within.The company culture is very relaxed which makes one learn to be a self motivator.  I took care of a territory in West TX and Eastern NM.
good,I do not enjoy having someone hover my shoulder all day long so this place was not right for me. The job is easy and it pays ok though.
good,"This is an excellent company with great benefits.  However, some of the management team lacks on leadership.  The teams who I worked with while employed were against each other due to the lack of leadership among departments.  Also, you will need to be friends with the management team in order to grow within"
good,"If you are on the sales side of the business you can get away with pretty much anything, as long as you preform and don't anger the wrong people. The ops side of the business does a lot of the heavy lifting and get beaten like a rented mule most of the time. however it is still a great place to work the people are great it is like one big family."
good,"A typical work day of work consists of servicing customers based on a set route. Maintaining set inventory levels of product purchased through Grainger, to free up customers to focus on important matters in their business."
good,Good pay but a lot of the upper management is awful.  The higher you are on the pay scale the more volatile your position is.  Lots of upper change.
good,"Typical work day starts with reviewing customers you are going to be visiting. 8-10 sales calls a day. help customers, manage inventory, safety."
good,"Typical day involves taking 60-70 calls on product selection,troubleshooting and finding replacement parts and alternates."
good,"great senior management, middle management to driven for advancement rather than customer satisfaction. The wages are not within what I would consider competitive for the roles assigned."
good,"Trabalho bom, aprendi a organizar melhor o tempo, ouvir mais as opiniões dos colegas de trabalho."
good,Days were not terribly difficult if you wanted to be a back slapping buddy group. If you want to just work and get your job done would not bother working there. Only very few members of management care. Hardest part of day was not getting caught up in gossip and backstabbing. Most enjoyable part of day was knowing that I did my job correctly even though majority of coworkers did not.
good,"A good place to work. I think we needed more help. They closed the "
good,sair por causa de mudança de local e falta de promoções meu primeiro emprego de carteira assinada
good,Great people to work with. Respectable compensation (ie: PST).
good,"Sales with Grainger is typical sales job--must be able to take criticism and negativity easily. You receive a company vehicle, but they do track you with GPS so you don't have as much freedom as you think. "
good,"meeting, stretching,picking,walking alot, i learned how to pick quality parts, how to pack the orders correctly, the pick & pack process, management was good at listening attentively, my co-workers were awesome and got along with just about everyone, the hardest part of the job is keeping from getting errors & getting your productivity in a month, the most enjoyable part of this job is the co-workers and friendships u make"
good,My experience with Grainger was a great one. I learned alot but also I learned that politics plays a part in job security.
good,"Was in customer service.  Used to be a great company to work for.  Now customer service is becoming scripted and you are not to question anything about it.  Indoctrination is a good word to describe it.  Also is becoming extremely micromanaged.  Everyday is like walking on eggshells.  Branch and district management is hit and miss.  More miss than hit.  The only reason some are in their positions is because they like to hear themselves talk.  Most have no management or people skills, they just regurgitate information and are good at drinking the ""kool-aid"".  Was without a branch manager for 2 years.  Nothing good can come out of that.  Just an example of a bad district manager.  Upper management was not concerned.  No room for advancement in the branches.  Now branches, I believe, are becoming a thing of the past.  New strategy has all phone agents going to call centers.  Company now is satisfied with internet sales and shipping product to customers through a distribution network and on site inventory opportunities.  Customers are ""encouraged"" not to come to the branch to pick up their product through the new customer service scripts(indoctrination) called Back2Basics. Middle management only advance by walking all over people and leaving a trail of dust.  If you're satisfied with a dead end, robotic job without quality supervision then the branch/customer service side of Grainger may be place for you."
good,A typical start of every day would be dealing with record labels and ordering new releases. After that I will look for any potential within the shop to see where I can maximise sales and shop profits. As it's only a small shop there's only two other members of staff who I work closely with and value their ideas on how we can together promote sales whilst offering the highest standard in customer service.
good,Has an account base that is protected. See 4 to 5 customera a day.
good,"Got hired through a staffing firm and began working in November 2005. This was my first stint in corporate america. Training and workshops were great. Noticed high turnover of managers as I went through five bosses in four years. After the third year things went downhill. Company went on a rampage to operate bigger, better, faster, and cheaper at the expense of employees."
good,To much pressure for no reason from managers and supervisor. They make it uncomfortable when you're doing great. Great benefits good starting pay. To much pressure for nothing when you're doing great.
good,"its a good company depending on what department you work in., as for Financial Services, management needs alot of work., and way too much favoritism. Also not releasing for other job opportunities in the company."
good,"Grainger is a great company to work for. However, I do believe there is a lack of opportunities to grow within the company. The managers make you feel trapped and do not want you to advance"
good,the employees where great but management sucked. it wasnt a fare work environment to where employees had to cut corners to make quota. HR was not helpful either.
good,"Company is huge on productivity and rate. Management is a joke. Unrealistic expectations. Very high turnover. Groups of potential new hires weekly, makes current employees feel that there’s no job security. No room for advancement."
good,Too many changes and big layoff to higher younger employees at a lower rate. Hundreds of people were losing their jobs that have worked there for many many years.
good,"Decent pay and benefits, extremely stressful, not much job security anymore, poor management, constant change, unrealistic expectations. Not the same environment it used to be."
good,"Enjoy the people, some departments are super supporting and let you learn and develop new skill sets. Work Life balance is an issue and lack of new opportunities is the biggest issue."
good,"Grainger has made several adjustments over the last couple of years with store closures and layoffs.  As was put, ""in an effort to stay healthy as a company.  Any company would do the same if they are in a position of declining profits, it is business."
good,"Culture de l'entreprise  perdue entre le Canada et les États-Unis"
good,"Was with the company for 2.5 years. In that time,I had 5 different managers.  The company did a 180. They took away from the companies that have been loyal for 30+ years by taking away our ability to source things for them all because they don't hit that magic dollar amount with us anymore. In one instance, we effectively shut down his production line since we were the only vendor the sourced company used. Between that and closing 25% of their branches, they haven't been giving ""full service"" customer service in about 1-2 years."
good,Grainger lays people off constantly and its scary. I was one of the lay offs in 2016. But I couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Grainger was a good company and now its unstable.
good,Incoming calls from team members.Take escalated calls from customers.The hardest part is making sure everyone understands change.The most enjoyable part being able to help everyone.
good,"Received outgoing and incoming calls from businesses with Grainger accounts. Processed returns, exchanges and assisted customers in finding products they needed."
good,"Good people Bad management."
good,Very stressful environment. Weekly meetings to strive to do better. But it doesn’t seem like it all! If your not making calls quickly on top of adding customer service quality. And you take longer then expected on the call you will get talked too. Customers call in to complain about their missing shipments etc. Three strikes and your out from employment.
good,"Call center. Most of the upper management is unrealistic in what they expect the representatives to accomplish in a set amount of time. Very competitive environment is encouraged by management. They are a very large business, but they out-source their leave benefits. The people they outsource their leave benefits to, like maternity leave, are atrocious to work with and will fight you the whole way on letting you take your leave."
good,"Grainger's employee's are where this company shines. Management are scared of the upper-brass and the set-up for failure is rather high because of it. The rates for Quota aren't up-to-date, they never adjust even though the inventory is constantly changing. Poorly run, the warehouse associates save the day from management."
good,if your looking for a good job with benefits and other perks grainger is a great company to work for. the people there usually mind their own business and are very supportive of others as they start.
good,Didn't like how they hired a few of us only to let us go 8 months later. I don't like how the people in Lake Forest (the HQ) have their noses in the air if you want to transfer to their location.
good,Changing and challenging industry. Grainger is adapting to a new environment for its' business. It is a good company to work for with good benefits. Be ready to learn.
good,"Being an account manager at Grainger used to be a great job. The pay was good the work life balance was good and Grainger cared about its employees. Then everything started to change. As profits fell due to a very very delayed reaction to price transparency Grainger seemed to get desperate. Instead of freeing up their sales force to go out and sell more, they began to micro manage and place unrealistic goals on their sales people. It used to be a fun, competitive place to work, now you just feel like someone is looking over your shoulder every second. If you want to get promoted...good luck! It would be easier to leave the company and get hired from the outside. As an internal candidate you are forced to jump through hoops and network and create development plans months in advance for roles that may not even be open. If a spot opens up and you haven't been working on development for that specific spot, no chance. No matter how good of a performer you are. And even if you are a fantastic performer, no comes to you with promotion opportunities."
good,"Company Restructuring and uncertainty of future. Closure of branches to do more on line shopping, Customers not happy with change in the company and how they serve them."
good,a fast paced working environment and competitive. good benefits and good profit sharing. strict work schedule but off the weekends. there is opportunity to learn
good,"-Good pay "
good,The pay and benefits are great. However it is very hard to advance unless you are friends with upper management. Promotions are not necessarily based on work ethic or good metrics. It is based more on your likeability.
good,Job started out great then they took away part of the commission plan and it just went down hill from there. Nothing I was told in my interview process was completely true was told this was a sales center not a call center but it is in fact a call center
good,"Grainger is a great company with great benefits, their management needs a little more training in people skills but besides that it's an amazing company"
good,"I would come in and expect to make x number of calls and convince customers from my accounts to buy more from us."
good,This company is profitable but there is too much micro management.    It seems like management is afraid to let their employees do their job without them looking over your shoulder.
good,"If you are an experienced sales person than Grainger is a good company to work for.  However, the management team does not seem interested in training individuals with no experience, and would rather brush them off than actually help them to be successful."
good,Recruiting Manager creates a clear distinction between their team and contract recruiters. Little respect is provided to the contractors and their opinions/suggestions go nowhere.
good,Good place to work a lot of changes to policies and profit sharing. Benefits were okay but overall company is headed in right direction.
good,"Morale and work culture gradually declined over time. Unfortunate, because it was once a great place to work. Was given a lot of responsibility over time. From my regular job duties, to handling and arranging for the pick up of hazardous material. I learned how to complete purchase order corrections online for corporate, and worked with various managers throughout the company on a daily basis. Co-workers were always supportive and we all worked well with each other. Hardest part of the job was starting over with new managers and the constant change with management who all had the same ideas coming in but didn't realize we had already tried or implemented some of those ideas in the past. Most enjoyable part of the job was taking on new challenges and volunteering to do special projects."
good,Compensation too small for the amount of work. Company not as transparent as before. Plenty of resources to help you succeed. Management is good but need to work on coaching for career advancement.
good,Go seek out opportunities within an existing client base. Seek out ways to cut operating cost and increase efficiency within each account based on the utilization and consumption of MRO materials being provided by Grainger. Expectations not realistic within timeframe provided to grow territory.
good,Overall the company is a good place to work at.  People are great to work with.  Corporate leadership does a moderately good job in keeping team members informed.  Just don't have enough resources to do the job.
good,Too many processes that it's unrealistic to get this job done in a 40 hour work week.  This puts strain on a good work life balance.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Leading a team of 15 students in the development of prototypes."
good,"This is a great place for those who are just starting out their careers or who have significant experience in MRO.  Coworkers are somewhat supportive but it's more of a ""sink or swim"" type of environment."
good,Business focus has changed and there are alot fo unhappy employees. So much need for improvement in Team building activities and social interaction
good,"Project and Operations manager in a quick paced and ever-changing environment.  Managed up to 50 full and part-time employees from varying economical and diverse backgrounds.  Formed a group of workers, where high turn-over was common, into an efficient and proud crew by treating them with respect, friendship and by providing   performance based rewards they had not experienced before."
good,".Learned a lot about the products which was great, made the day to day easier helping clients and locating exactly what they requested.  My co workers were great to work with alway lending a helping hand if there was a big job for that day and vica versa. "
good,"Good to work with Grainger, lot of learning potential."
good,"Broad Based Industrial Supplier, Great people and supplier support"
good,"Overall, the work/life balance is the most challenging aspect of working at Grainger.  Pay and benefits are good.  The most enjoyable part is interacting with the team members."
good,"Nice place to work for! Flexible work place, friendly environment"
good,La carga administrativa consume todo tu tiempo y realmente no te permite desempeñar tu puesto como debe ser.
good,Working on different project. Meeting famous politicians.
good,"Grainger is the leading supplier of MRO items in the US. Working as an account manager for this company will offer many unique learning experiences. These will, combined with the on boarding and ongoing training, make you a better professional seller."
good,Back in the beginning it was a great place to work. I would always look forward to talking with my customers and making new ones!
good,"I've never seen so much turn over in sales people in my life. I had 3 DSM's and Regional Vice Presidents in2.5 years. I went from being the new guy at my branch to the Senior Rep after 2 years. There is tremendous pressure to hit your numbers at all costs....I've never seen such ugly corporate culture, us vs them mentality, I hit my goal and had a tremendous year and I was still miserable."
good,"There is never a dull moment or a predictable day at Grainger. I have the pleasure of visiting a wide variety of customer industries. One moment I am talking to the Safety Director of an Oil Industry and the next I am talking to the Maintenance Man of a Hotel. Time management, drive and self motivation are a must to keep your head above water. The constant interaction with my customers and their satisfaction keeps me smiling and wanting to do the best that I can."
good,A typical day at work includes 3-4 customer visits a day as well as a tremendous ammount of admin. The position has allowed me to continue to hone my consultative selling/solutions sales skills.
good,"Maintained operational excellence within the dept., planed, assigned, and directed work, resolved problems, coached, motivated, and supervised employees, ensuring integrity of all incoming and outgoing shipments, met deadlines/target dates, and ensured that all warehouse safety rules/regulations were followed to provide for the safe implementation of all procedures and the safe operations of all warehouse equipment/machinery"
good,"It used to be a great place to work,  Now they just try to get you to do more work for the same money while they lay people off, blaming company performance."
good,A lot to learn. The employee are fun to work with.Customers are friendly and have been coming to Grainger for years so its easy to build a rapport with them
good,"When I first started at Acklands Grainger, it was like a family. Most employees interacted in a friendly manner. There were many social events outside of work that most employees attended at their own will. It was a fun and productive workplace. Almost a decade later (as Grainger gained more control of the Canadian side of the company) the morale is extremely poor. Employees are brought into a managers office weekly to discuss their failures (very rarely rewarded for success) New metrics were introduced to coincide with bonuses. Rather than focus on an individuals strengths and success, the new scale compares the success of the Saskatoon DC to the American counterparts. Management uses scare tactics and regular mass layoffs to keep the employees quiet and obedient."
good,The company is good and is positive overall.  The IT inner workings are in need of some culture change.   New frameworks are added too often without enough time to adjust and get settled
good,They will train just about anyone to become a inside sales rep. The pay does not match the effort you put in or all the tasks that are required of you. Moral seems to be fading by the day.
good,"Poor company culture, cost cutting measures have forced out the experienced workforce to make room for new younger and cheaper employees. Benefits have been cut compared to the past."
good,Great pay with decent benefits. Company provides alot of support to train. Goals are challenging but achievable. Work/life balance needs some improvement.
good,Meet with floor supervisor for daily jobs. Counting and scanning and sorting different products and placing product on proper shelfs.  Not there long enough as it was a contracted position.
good,"work volumes have depleted, but Grainger is a great company to work for. Great pay and benefits, management not so great, that's the downfall, the change in management."
good,When I first started I enjoyed the environment now the environment has completely changed and I’m thrown off by it because there’s a lot of stuff going on in the background
good,"Working customer services , experience working whit the system SAP"
good,"High pace environment with tight work schedules and production. Overall a good place to work, teams have good work ethic and company is busy and efficient."
good,Very big on gathering employee feedback on an annual and semi-annual basis to ensure the company is focusing on ensuring the culture remains at the level that employees want to be there.
good,Had a great time working here the first year and a half before management changed and once management changed and I started getting micro-managed even though I was exceeding numbers it started to get a bit stressful. The territories are also responsible for dividing up the total number of sales dollars amongst the reps and if you have a bad regional manager your goals and your number can be ridiculously high for no reason and you wont have anyone to complain to.
good,"Pays well, benefits are great, discounts on almost everything. Management is terrible. The manager was in the office twice a week. Other Sales Associates knew more than the manager. There is a peak season where part time associates will work up to 8 hours/ day but there is a season where you can work 4 hours and maybe even 3-4 days per week which isn’t even worth it. Part time CSA’s were told to be available to take on a full time role within 2 years and after being there for 2 years, not once was I offered an advancement in the company."
good,"Big warehouse, fast paced and often overwhelming to a point of stress. One little mistake you will be drug tested or suspended, there is hardly and room for error and mistakes."
good,"Standard warehousing work in a fast paced environment, Grainger has many opportunities for those who are willing to put in the effort. Possible jobs that use or do not use powered equipment."
good,"Loved this place for 5+ years. Then came a change to my direct manager. Constantly negative, no positivity. Blocked from an advancement opportunity. Terrible experience for the last year I worked there. Great time off and benefits."
good,"Great sales training, and great people in the ranks. Sr. Leadership is totally out of touch with what is happening. "
good,"its hard work & really hot in the summer."
good,In this role you collect payment on past due invoices but also take on challenges to work through with internal and external business partners from a finance aspect.
good,"territory"
good,Grainger was a very conservative business. The main fault I had with it was that it eas a very cut throat atmosphere and employees would do anything to get ahead.
good,During my time here I thoroughly enjoyed the work. There was always something to do and management were patient and helpful. Was a great job role over xmas while I was a student.
good,"A typical day in a reporting analyst role consists of developing ad hoc reports using MS Access/Business Objects/Tableau while leveraging Teradata universes. I got an opportunity to practice MS Access, SQL, Business Objects and Tableau skills. The hardest part of the job is to understand the data sources without any documentation and prioritizing work. Since it's an open culture to walk by and request different kinds of information, it does impact regular work productivity. But the people are really nice and understandable and it's super fun to work in a cross-functional role."
good,"Trop de changement de direction, pas de direction claire. Objectifs de rendement instables. Peu de considération pour les employés"
good,Grainger is a good company to work for. The branch show room allowed me the opportunity to learn about industrial equipment and helped in my getting the customer the right tool or part for the right price.
good,not enough emphasis on training employees---not flexible with work schedule--people not important and not treated equally. communication is very difficult with Grainger
good,"The company it self is incredible and the facility is very nice, high trend of turnover was ongoing with employees and managements, culture is not high held expected ,2 years worked there enhanced my ability as strong ethic warehouse associate nothing  more , no room for advancement unless you locked into buddy system"
good,Great environment to work in!! Great benefits and opportunity for advancement. Great management teams. Easy and engaging training classes. Great pay!! You will learn lots about company products and catalog.
good,"In order to move up in the company, it's not what you know, it;s who you know.The managers only are concerned with the employees meeting their metrics such as dials and minutes. Many employees have stated that they feel that they are telemarketers. There is a high turnover rate."
good,Job takes a lot of sitting down and patience. Must adhere to a specific script which is hard for a lot of people to follow when talking to different people all day.
good,A lot of changed going on within the company. A lot of new competition driving Grainger to have to make price cuts. Good company but focused on the bottom line.
good,"as long as you show up, meet production, and mind your business..its a good job. no ac in the warehouse. mandatory overtime. ................................."
good,"This position was Sales and Customer service, It was an industrial industry and appealed to other companys to advance their sales. The company was well organized"
good,"Good place to work , great work life balance but it is who you know not what you know that gets you promoted.  Great workout facility, good campus, and good cafe"
good,"virtual work environment"
good,"Grainger has great benefits and pay. However, they are still stuck in old school culture and ways of working. They need to start to evolve so they can attract and retain top talent."
good,A typical day at work consists of managing inventory at different locations.  You learn to be self sufficient and resourceful because you are not micro managed.  The daily travel is the hardest part.
good,"Plan, set-up, manage, organize meetings, attend meetings, maintain confidential information for businesses and staff, upkeep operations in database, manage calendar for customer calls and other events of importance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  The experience you gain from working with thousands of manufacturers and their account managers is countless.  Working with a large diverse group of individuals helps broaden different cultural experiences.  "
good,Didnt get to experience the full experience while working there as I was just helping pull orders and count inventory for two weeks. I would love to experience a job like this
good,Regional management and Higher seem to not understand day to day operation in the On-Site Representative role.  Management seems to want to get away from  On-Site role unless the customer is a large customer.  Midsize and smaller they want to go to g-commerce  to compete with Amazon.  This makes job security and advancement limited.  Due to Upper Management trying to compete they are downsizing the branched and other departments as well as changing Full Time positions to Part Time.
good,"good company to work for with great benefits. there are many locations, so it gives you the opportunity to relocate if you're interested. good team environment"
good,"The team makes you feel you are just a helper, no involvement in any team meetings.No benefits.Other department gets to work from home but not mine. Pay in on time."
good,Very stressful job and a lot of problem solving involved. Customers could be very rude and impatient. Management was very helpful and experienced.  I would encounter something new everyday.
good,Acklands grainger is a fun place to work. Its to bad that they are closing down the medicine hat branch in April. My job is mainly taking orders over the phone and dealing with customers on a daily basis .I really enjoy working here .
good,"You had to finish your order with in a certain time frame, use a stand up lift with a harness and stand for a long period of time, supervisors always on you to perform better while being busy everyday."
good,"Grainger is a very well run company from a B2C standpoint."
good,"The Breaks and Lunches are short only 10 minutes and 30minutes, you barely have time to make it out door before you need to make a uturn.constant calls, good training, a lot of products"
good,"You worked very hard, breaks arent long enough, you couldnt use you PTO when you wanted to. You worked long hours. They sometimes gave the employees free lunch"
good,"The best part of Grainger is the people! I love everyone I work with and the benefits are very good at Grainger. You will work VERY hard, but when you have the right manager (as I have in the past), this is not an issue as you are self-driven to do more."
good,A typical day is just getting work done and enjoying the people and the atmosphere at work with my peers.I enjoy my job because i do a various things throughout the day.I would love to move to another part of the company soon.
good,"New senior management has become so focused on cutting costs that they have lost focus on customers and what has made the company successful."
good,"Top managers thinking paradigm is centered around customers and all departments are always encouraged to focus on serving the customer the best way. With the new SAP system, the job is done more professionally and there are lots of opportunities to learn."
good,"Learned how to use SAP and Excel on a daily basis. Good company, would have liked staying there. Definitely want to look at career opportunities down the line."
good,A good place to work. The workplace culture is positive and safety orientated. A typical day consists of satisfying customer needs and supporting fellow staff members in their tasks
good,"potential opportunities for growth, good pay and benefits, practical hours for individuals with children, great place to gain some industrial experience."
good,"Can be strong work/life balance if in the right department."
good,"The biggest company you haven't heard of!  A fortune 300 company, with a strong US parent and a big opportunity to lead the evolution of industrial supplies distribution in Canada!"
good,"Grainger has great benefits and has a great culture. There isn't a lot of leadership from your managers. There's too much turnaround which interviews take up a lot of your managers time.  Sales has become a game of metrics, which is causing less of a focus on actual customer needs."
good,"Solid organization working to become great company. Cultural and organizational changes impeding progress, while remaining top MRO supplier in industry."
good,"Working here was good. Good, committed people dedicated to their company and job. Unfortunately, it was a temporary position and I could not stay on, would recommend though."
good,This company is very good at making work life balance a must for each employee.  The people and company is wonderful.  They teach you your job and look forward to you moving up in the company.
good,Too much work and not enough pay and the hours seemed long at days. Supervisor wasn't at best and did not handle conflict well. Overall i would say keep looking
good,Tough future ahead for the company as they find the way forward against new purchasing trends and marketplaces. The environment is changing and the current direction will take years to achieve results.
good,why on earth wold I have to do this just trying to apply for another position and if this is confidential does this matter what I put here I don't think it would would it
good,"The company paid well for the location but with resent changes in the company, long term employment seems to be up in the air. The company wants to go to online shopping whether the customer wants it or not."
good,"Great Organization to work for. They have a strong culture and management is making adjustments to meet the shareholders expectations, as Grainger has a tradition of profitability."
good,"Grainger is extremely fast paced and you must really love talking on the phone because you will take call after call. You won't have time to take a quick breath or anything. As soon as you hang up the phone from talking to a customer another call comes in right away that you will have to take.  "
good,Good people with the same goal The ones who get it done.  Good experience with commercial and government accounts.  Need to be savy with RFQ and procurement analysis.
good,Its been a while since i worked in this company. It was good when i worked long back. Not sure about the condition now. Please disregard this comment.
good,for it being my first job i was able to learn a lot within a couple years. i was able to experience new departments within the company and share and gain new experiences
good,The office is well organized. People are friendly and easy to get along. However the productivity is low due to team's lack of proper experience. Also it's hard to get help from help from other department.
good,Working in this environment is completely different depending on where you are assigned. Job seekers may need to ask specific questions on what they will be doing
good,Good place to work. Pay is above average for the job that is done. About 5 dollars more an hour compared to other similar job.Chance to move up is company is likely.
good,"Our team was very productive, worked hard, got along with one another, enjoyed each others company, as well as having great fun.  We acknowledged each others work as well as helping each other when needed.  My manager was awesome to work for.  The hardest part of my job was the many fields that needed to be updated to see the final result."
good,Positive work environment where performance and hard work are rewarded where leaders strive for positive results.  This organization has extensive sales training and resources to help aid in success.
good,In the 2 years I have been there they have made so many changes and removed so many long term employees it doesn't make me feel like this is a place you can have a long term career. Especially if you are located in western Canada.
good,I approve of the new CEO.  Job could improve their commission structure to not take away money if enrollment of discount program isn't priority iverfeed revenue.
good,"A typical day at Grainger consists of strategically presenting cost savings and solution based opportunities to help drive the customer take cost out of their business.  From facility maintenance and safety services, 5S projects, EDI platform adoption, consolidation, and your MRO expertise to help manage their inventory, your typical day is having high level conversations with the right contacts to further grow your business.  Management at Grainger seems to be rapidly changing.  The people at Grainger foster a great team environment and are awesome to work with.  The hardest part of the job is getting to the right contact and finding out what's most important to them.  The most enjoyable aspect is gaining those conversations and truly helping the customer achieve their goals and safety culture"
good,Great to work for leader in the industry.  Lots of opportunities and great culture.  There has been a large amount of senior leadership changes and the company is trying to make a major shift to online revenue in order to ward off non-traditional competitors like Amazon
good,There is not much I can say about this company. The work that I did there was very cut and dry as a typical sales job. I am looking for other opportunities.
good,"Changes take too long to take effect, if they even happen at all."
good,"I had a really great time working with this organization, the work was not easy but we had a good challenging team and time just passed."
good,Its is a cool place to work.  The stress is moderate.  Lots of product training and sales training.  You get to meet many people from different suppliers and you really learn the basics of supply chain.
good,Until they had layoffs unfortunately. Great benefits and support system. Company has a lot of changes occurring right now that seem to hint that they are not in good shape.
good,"Sales for Grainger is a great opportunity to learn about strategy, planning and how to successfully drive revenue but it is a complex company to sell for. There are several departments to coordinate with and some of these resources are not supportive."
good,"9.5-10 hour days"
good,"I am a current employee for over 4 years and after reading the other reviews, sounds like a different company. They talk about there profit sharing, well in the last year they have been slowly taking that away. They benefits were great but now are slowly becoming very costly. Every year I have been there the expectations have gone up every year. They keep expecting more and more out of you all while taking away the benefits. I currently work in a distribution center that is run by a bunch of number hungry managers. It all starts at the top and there isn't much there. We have been on forced OT since about November of last year. (Now its mid January)  Great place to build a resume but would not recommend a career out of it. Buyer beware!"
good,Customer service contact (call) center with approximately 100 calls processed in a day.  I have been able to utilize my experience with numerous computer programs and assisting in EDI and e-Procurement order processing.  Our direct management listens to our concerns and follow through with changes that are brought up by the work force.  The pace has increased in the past year due to growing and process changes which have been difficult but we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I love helping customers as well as internal representatives.
good,"typical day at work-order entry, pick and stage orders, product research,shipping and receiving."
good,Grainger has good work life balance but there is little room for advancement. The job in very monotonous.  Great vacation time and benefits although that may be changing soon.
good,"While initially Grainger had terrific benefits and an employee based culture, it has over the past year made cuts to benefits and job security is not what it was. What would have been a high scoring review just a year or so ago is just another average company today."
good,Great benefits great company to work for. Just not the company for me. Supportive management in employee growth. Major changes happening to help the company grow but is taking a huge tole on employees.
good,I learned how to run machines on a 12 hr shift. This employer was an easy and relaxing job but there are times when it is too easy.
good,Grainger is a large company that does what is needed to get the job done and satisfy the customers needs. Grainger has what customers want when they want it. That keeps them coming back.
good,"A typical day is calling on accounts and finding their needs through a series of selling processes.  I have learned to become a better listener and care more about the customer and their needs.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with price as it is now becoming the only objective that all customers are going to rather than a brand name, or company."
good,"I learned a lot about the various areas of business, having worked in 4 different departments during my employment period. Co-workers were friendly, approachable and knowledgeable. Made some great friendships that last even today."
good,Grainger does a great job providing opportunities to its employees. Consistent and professional interact with coworkers and upper management. They are a great example of a world class business that cares about the relationship it has with its employees.
good,"Grainger is a good lace to work and offers many opportunties for growth, although you may need to be willing to relocate.  Management was fair."
good,"Grainger headquarters is a beautiful place to work. However the work life balance is not to be found. Management places extreme demands on you with very short time spans to complete the work. You will have no choice but to work 60 hour work weeks in order to complete the task assigned to you."
good,"Contributed to aspects of Suppliers Performance via date changes, monthly mailings and receipt variances. Received Branch Stock Requests from the field and created purchase orders. Completed excess returns to suppliers."
good,Nice Company to work for except they keep you in the dark and blindside you. Exspecially when it comes to just elimanating your job.
good,"Great place to work Monday to Friday 8-5"
good,Dealing with customers daily. Work environment was good. Management was good. It was a short term.
good,"	Responsible for heading credit control activity for south region’s 3 branches @ Aditya Infotech Ltd with turnover of 95 crores and 5 branches @ Grainger India with turnover of 66 crores by handling 720 and 400 dealers & End customers respectively."
good,"Was able to learn many things and how to work new equipment and able to help new hires, which I enjoyed."
good,"Employer offers 3 weeks vacation, paid sick days and a pension plan. Due to a lack of staff I do not receive adequate breaks."
good,Good company / products. Closed Mid Market organization which eliminated close to 300 positions
good,"Great place to work, benefits are among the top in the field. Advancement is stale as the company is going through changes and the emphasis is doing more with less. "
good,Great company for anyone is works well independently. The brand is well known for providing quality products and customer service. Excellent bonus opportunity.
good,"Stable company, good benefits, takes care of employees, great company if you want to get comfortable"
good,staff was pleasant. warehouse work repetitive. management accommodating. Learned SAP. Customers were gruff impersonal men for the most part...hardest part. Most enjoyable part was getting to know the many types of employees.
good,Benefits are not bad. They do care for employees sometimes but not all the time.
good,"Not really happy with treatment of employees, they were not always  very fair."
good,Great company but not many chance for growth and promotion.
good,"warehouse work, stock, deliveries, customer complaints, customer orders and questions. investigating items that customers may need"
good,"Striving to be the leader in MRO, Acklands Grainger positions themselves to be the single source provider of all things industrial"
good,Rising revenue company diversifying into international markets through organic growth and acquisition.
good,Low pay. Horrible place to work for little to nothing in making money
good,"Trabalho tranquilo, sempre aprendendo coisas novas, direção razoável, ambiente amigável , parte difícil é a comunicação, parte agradável é poder atender 100% os usuários em relação às solicitações."
good,-15 B2B sales calls a day.
good,"Typical day is very busy doing a lot of different tasks. I've learned a great deal about organization, scheduling and customer relations. Management is nothing like they tell you. Friends pick friends and jobs are given to undeserving people."
good,pay is very go.od for what the job is.
good,Everyone is Graingers customer. It is great trainng ground for new sales people
good,Good work schedule balance between home and work. Heavy workload calling potential buyers.
good,"I enjoyed working with management, and my co-workers, Great pay, and hours."
good,A part time job that was stable but unstable hours. A step up job if that is your field.
good,the hardest part about this job is staying out of the peoples way who has been there a long times because they feel threated and will run you out
good,"A Typical day at work was being a bin picker. Which basically means walking around in circles, getting orders and as you go around you pick the items they ordered, which could be from 1 item to bulk items, you put them in the box and when your done you put it on the line to be put in the truck and delivered. But you also had to work fast and efficient. I learned how to pick the items with this device you wear on your wrist and you use it to scan and type in the items. The management was very nice and made sure if i didn't understand something that it got explained. The hardest part of the job was carrying the heavy bulk items, the most enjoyable part of the job was as you walked around getting your items you could talk to your co-workers, or you could listen to music."
good,Overall a fun and full of non-typical days at work. Everyday is a new experience. Management is helpfull and willing to help me move to the next level.
good,It was an ok job. Just place order of customer. I would set up customer with new account numbers.
good,This company did not encourage growth and development for employees
good,The workload is manageable and my manager is open to my suggestions regarding work. The building is well maintained by the management.  I would recommend this company to my friends.
good,"While their MRO solution evolves, the rest of the company is left behind.  They are not innovative enough, culture refuses to mature and their is no accountability for failure.  They pay well and respect work life balance, nice campus too."
good,Grainger had it’s  strengths and weaknesses as a company to work for. They paid well. But you also had to work really hard for that money  I enjoyed the benefits and the money. But I am glad I no longer work there as they push their people to the limit and beyond.
good,"Call Center environment. Great place to start, ""stepping stone"" role "
good,Grainger is a great campus and top class facility working out of the home office.  Company has evolved to more micro managing over the years and limits the advancement opportunities of its employees.  Grainger is awesome in it's total rewards and benefits package but monthly and yearly target revenue are unrealistic.  Compensation package is lacking.
good,Weekends and benefits is the best parr of the job. Salary is not good. Im beginning to see a more diversified culture than usual. I dont like that u have to stay on a job 6 months whether its a fit for you or not.
good,"A typical day in branch sales was not too bad. The customers were generally good to deal with. The job itself could be challenging (in a good way) in some ways. Management is what can be hit or miss. I had awesome managers but in the end it was the final manager I had that pushed me towards finding another company. Being in a rural area, without being willing to relocate, there aren't many advancement opportunities. But I suppose if one lived in a more urban setting or was willing to relocate, this would be a great company to stay with."
good,They care about the numbers and if your unable to stay over time advancement is difficult. The job isn't bad but can be fast paced. Management doesn't always have experience on the floor so they don't always understand day to day problems that may occur.
good,Acklands Grainger was a decent job.  The work provided was very basic and repetitive but the co-workers were fun and easy to work with.  The management was sometimes controlling and it felt as if each worker was expendable.
good,"Fast paced environment that needs to slow down and realize impact of decision on outsourcing positions, not training individual roles and expectations. Company has changed a lot in the last 5 years."
good,"I learned a lot while working at Grainger.  Inventory control, Business management, new product launch, and vendor management.  Grainger is a large organization with over 10k in employees.  The employees and teammates were the best part of Grainger"
good,warehouse setting. I put away inventory. fast paced. boring. have to make your numbers. training is good. its not for everyone. have opportunity for advance
good,"Friendly, safe atmosphere. Not the most knowledgable/developed management. Advancement opportunities are difficult to obtain. Definitely a 'who-you-know' culture."
good,"Your job is to make 30+ outbound calls, spend 100+ minutes on the phone and 12+ quality connections with your book of business per day, month over month. It’s challenging to grow your accounts in different categories when your customers only purchase what they know they can get from Grainger."
good,the all situation was with my boss not promoting nothong  plus he took all the credit for our work and he was always motivating with fear(if you dont do this you will be fired)
good,"Territory/Counter sales included phone and walk in customers from automotive and industrial trades."
good,"Grainger is a great place to work, especially if you live near one of the head quarters locations, it will have multiple opportunities. They have limited the amount of work from home positions but are willing to work to make employee happy."
good,"I work 37 hours a week but have to have to work 15 to 20 hours overtime to get a decent wage, as a van driver there are no opportunities to advance, but the lads are great to work with and the job is good, got good relationships with all the people i deliver to, overall its a good place to work just the wage structure and management let it down"
good,Acklands Grainger has a typical Fortune 500 work culture. Brand new office in Markham with a better flow of workplace and group discussions. Good experience
good,"Job environment is pretty standard for a corporate office, attire is business casual.  Must be a fan of cubicles, but the benefits are good.  Sales incentives are offered."
good,"Work  performance and review is based on metrics. The training provided is only partially complete, support is available while working. I have learned about problem solving with different systems. How to use opportunities in the most positive way. "
good,Management is too strick with policy & procedures. Management is also quick to write-up employees on occurances & tardies regardless of the situation. Therefore I feel job isn't secure enough. Co-workers are great & willing to always help as well as teach in utilizing tools & knowledge of products & services.
good,Great pay and phenomenal benefits. Great people to work with. But lots of seemingly knee reaction type of changes. Lots of managerial oversight that can disrupt work flow and efficiency. Claim to have balance of work/life balance but don't practice what they preach.
good,"it has good benefits. Paid time off. Good health insurance."
good,The people i worked with were great but the managers were not so nice when it came to conflict. Issues would arise in the building and no one seemed to want to help. With  this is was very hard to trust managers. Other than that the work was hard but i was a very fast learner and caught on quickly. I liked the challenge to make myself better each week on getting my numbers higher.
good,"inestabilidad laboral, con directrices no muy claras y relativamente nueva en el mercado"
good,"My review on Grainger is not valid as I worked there 10 years ago. At the time, the culture was very KPI driven and strict to achievement of very limited and specific sells goals to exclusion of most anything else."
good,"The management has been inexperienced since I have been there and it seems there is a lot of ongoing changes at that position. "
good,"Busy atmosphere. Constant workload, not much down time. Competition among other like business very high. Expectations among fellow team members very high. Constant pressure to succeed."
good,Amazing place to work for until they you became a robot with statistics. And it seems like the company is similar to Geriatric High School. The benefits are okay. The pay is the highest in the area
good,"A typical day would involve meetings to discuss project statuses, deadlines and application support.  Management was fair.  My co-workers were great.  We had a very good working relationship that evolved into personal friendships.  The hardest part of the job was the on-call rotation that sometimes interfered with my personal life.  I enjoyed the flexibility of being able to work remotely when needed."
good,"This is a good place to work.  The work is interesting, and challenging all at the same time.  Lots of exposure to new, weird and wonderful customers, products, experiences and situations.  The people around you for the most part are awesome at what they do and are willing to help you get to where you'd like to go."
good,"When I started at Grainger sellers had a desirable level of autonomy. We ran our territories our way.  Now corporate is micro-managing from the top down.  We just switched to salesforce which could be such an amazing tool for us, but instead corporate is using it to get their claws into every single detail of our day down to our commute time."
good,"nice place to work, wonderful co workers and enviroment.. . the management there is very good and  dependable .. the hours are wonderful really gives you time with your family"
good,"The atmosphere was nice. They employees were really nice. But, you never really new when you started or ended your shift. Lunch was also never a confirmed time. Still it was a nice company to work for."
good,"Working here is hard when you can not get full time benefits. It takes a year if you are a part time flex employee to receive PTO. They also do not give bereavement to Part time employees. They will give you extra hours, but still not worth the hassell."
good,It was very hot in the warehouse with no a/c but in the offices it was ice cold and the bosses still wanted to work you like animals.
good,A challenging and rewarding environment with complex customer interactions and procedures.   Benefits are very good and profitable for employees.
good,"Handled incoming calls from customers and provided unmatched service for product inquiries or purchases. Assisted in training of Mainframe System to new trainees. Was given title of team mentor"
good,"Coordeno a equipe de vendas e busco sempre obter melhores resultados."
good,Management is forward thinking. Goals are tough to meet consistently.
good,"Grainger is a great company. I wish I would have landed a job there before I went back to school, or had a family. You are constantly busy and time flys by."
good,"good people"
good,"They hook you with the large profit sharing and good pay.  Then when things happen that go against your ethics and morals, you find it very hard to leave."
good,"Criação de diversos tipos de peças para divulgação da empresa e seus produtos;"
good,"* Typical day...reviewed workload, attended meeting, adjusted workload, emailed/programmed, lunch or meeting, emailed/programmed, attended meeting, and planned the next day's workload."
good,"Management was nice, coworkers are friendly, however it is extremely hard to get days off. For vacations you request them off the year before. You are monitored constantly and must adhere to your schedule. You allowed two 10 min breaks and one 30 mins lunch. If you need to use the restroom besides those times, it can affect your daily ""accessibility score"". "
good,"I really enjoy this work environment was a great place to work for . Great benefits and great insurance .Lasted 5years cause i thought was the right place for me. Only reason I left this company because the place was too far on a daily basis. Company was located in Niles , when I moved into the south chicago area it became a very difficult commute every day."
good,They seem to really treat their employees good with a generous profit sharing and up to 3weeks vacation time after 1st year of fulltime employment
good,I have been exposed to great learning opportunities for both product and safety services.  Grainger support is strong with many career development opportunities.
good,"Company had changed business focus from branches to web based business.  There was a lot of change , which made the culture somewhat suffer.  No longer customer facing in branches"
good,First thing in the morning we had a team meeting and would stretch. The day consisted of pulling orders from an RF scanner and placing them in the appropriate size box then sending them down a conveyer to prepare for shipping.
good,Great experience for sales reps earlier in their career. Great sales training and coaching to get started in the right direction. Processes and resources were slow to assist inside sales reps which in turn slowed productivity. A good experience overall.
good,Grainger fosters an environment that allows you to use skip level meetings and open door policies with senior management to achieve your career goals.
good,It was a start to finish job. Some things was heavier than the lifting requirements but it wasn’t a big deal. I  wanted more hours. Management showed a lot of favoritism.
good,Great workers but management changed their wants and needs depending on the day. Great work environment but to be told something different everyday got old.
good,"Good job for a short period of time"
good,Benefits and pay are great. But the feeling of being replaceable is there. It is hard to move up sometimes and reorganization happens often. Sometimes take steps backward instead of learning from past mistakes on process management.
good,Excellent managers that provide great support as long as you work hard.  Hardest part is keeping up with constant change in processes. Workplace culture is filled with high energy
good,"Grainger is a good place to work, if you have a decent account package.  Difficult to add or remove accounts from package."
good,"If you are looking for a work-life balanced job, Grainger is the place. Also, benefits like 401K and manager incentive programs are commendable. However, don't expect other recognitions or career advancement opportunities here."
good,I gave 10 years to Grainger and they closed our local branch. They did take care of us with a good severance stc. But recently an opening came up in our region again for an outside sales position so I applied. Grainger Talent acquisition didn't even give me the courtesy of a call to say I was not considered I just got a form email....I am highly qualified for the position management is blind.
good,"Loved having opprotunities to grow, had multiple roles and responsibilities. The training and technology changes were always ahead of the curve and I felt we were beating the competition with the highly skilled staff. Workplace culture is a call center atmosphere now. Was great to work with and collaborate with other departments to see tasks to completion. Benefits were good."
good,"Grainger has been a great company to work with, they have great benefits (health, discounts, transportation, location), the salary is on the upper end and the work environment is the best I've seen."
good,"Amazing Company, but has recently changed the entire leadership and culture of the company. Has gone from a culture of being able to share your Street Corner and influence change to one of only Metrics matter and little input from the filed."
good,"This is a great company if you are starting out  - they believe in training their employees and will help with your career development.  They have high expectations for their employees and will support your efforts to get ahead with a career development platform, internal groups, a super HR department."
good,"My typical day at work is getting boring due that I do the same routine everyday. "
good,"It's an okay place to work.  I'm part of management, but executives are pretty easy-going.  Company isn't doing very well right now so tension is pretty high."
good,"Grainger as a company is great. They provide outstanding benefits and Paid Time Off, however the culture of the workplace is still a call center. The job is extremely repetitive. They tell you they don't use a script , but they critique everyone so much that they basically create a strict script. Advancement is promised, however due to poor planning, advancement was not provided and profusely postponed."
good,"Grainger is a great company if not for the leadership. They tend not to learn from their predecessor and make the same mistakes over and over. "
good,"I currently work as a full time customer service representative for Grainger Industrial Supply in the phone channel of their business.  My typical day at work consists of receiving incoming phone calls from Grainger customers all over the country and using the resources  the company has provided me to resolve their issues in the most accurate and efficient manner possible.  I have developed extensive product knowledge on the wide array of products Grainger sells. I  have also developed the ability to work in a fast paced environment that requires a proficiency in multitasking and time management.  As  far as management goes, I have had 4 immediate supervisors in the 3 years I have been in this position and they have all given me the tools and encouragement necessary to succeed.  They have also given me recognition when I have outperformed my expectations and I feel like they have taken a vested interest in myself and my coworkers as well.  I work out of the Grainger branch in Manchester, NH and I have built a good relationship with all my coworkers at the branch.  It has been a friendly environment to work in over the years and I feel like all my coworkers genuinely care about one another and their success within the company.  I also work as a remote agent for a contact center though, which means I work with a team of phone agents whom I have never met because they all work out of other locations.  This has made it difficult to build a relationship with them but, regardless of that, we all still work well as a team.  The most challenging part of this job is managing all the"
good,"A good company to work for.  A typical day at work was good most of the time. There were some stressful days especially at month end."
good,"Nice people to work with, job is limited, good benefits. I enjoyed my time there but I am looking forward to a new challenge."
good,"Call Center so it was extremely stressful and draining, however the pay was good and they were very flexible with my schedule being that at the time I was in school.  Call Center manager showed a lot of favoritism, many people with less experience were moving up while other good employees were given excuses every time they tried to move up.  The last couple of years that I was there most employees did not feel appreciated therefore a lot of employees morale was very low."
good,"Excellent job advancement, wages could always be a little better, management needs some improvement. Generally you come into work, and you are busy all day. Overtime is offered during the productive summer season season. I personally love the people I worked with, and they all assisted me with questions I had."
good,They have the traditional role of a product manager in the digital space broken in half where there is a product manager who works with the sprint teams and is a story monkey.  They then have Product Line Managers and Strategy Managers who do the roadmapping and build the product strategy.  So titles are a bit exaggerated.  The plus side is salaries do appear to match the titles.
good,Granger is a good company with great benefits. I changed jobs because of the shift that I was working. I had a great team that strived in working together as a team.
good,The most enjoyable part of my work was building relationships with my Customers and growing my business. There are a lot of hoops to jump through in order to get any task taken care of. On a good note everyone works together to get those accomplishments.
good,"Very many accounts to manage for small to medium business, job is really fun watching and helping smaller business become large ones. Also really liked solving problems with Grainger's solutions"
good,"En general bien, es buena empresa, creo que tiene mucho que trabajar en cuestiones de Liderazgo, procesos de selección de personal, creo que puede mejorar mucho."
good,"Grainger was a good place to work at, you worked hard but were recognized for it. The people I worked with at Grainger were very nice and very helpful, we were like a great big family there."
good,Es una gran empresa con gran futuro pero sus directivos no so los adecuados
good,"15 years of customer service for Grainger taught me many many things at first.  Especially before they gutted the training department.   Currently they are very focused on getting people to do one simple job over and over all day.  Metrics are of the utmost importance to the leadership in Waterloo and especially Janesville, WI.  Management has become very fluid and changed several times in the last two years, but at least nobody is stealing from the company any more.  It sounds pretty bad, but it seems to be the same everywhere and they do pay well even for entry level positions.  You must work very hard, keep up your education, or kiss a lot of butt if you expect to get a promotion.   And the only way to get real money is to move around within the company."
good,"Grainger overall is a good company to work for however your success in the company is highly dependent on your manager."
good,Going through a period of change.  Good pay but work/life balance skewed.
good,"its very well known company in north America."
good,"The people at Grainger are very friendly!  The management at headquarters, I would consider top notch.  The management in the sourcing department could benefit from additional training on how to motivate and develop people. The most enjoyable part of this job was partnering with the sales team, to gain business and help Grainger's bottom line.  Although, I was not happy in certain areas, I respect Grainger and wanted to help them be successful."
good,"Good place to work, the pay isn't the best it will take you five to seven years to top out which is alittle long.  You may have to work with people that don't have a really good work Ethic.  You do get weekends off which is a plus and if you don't mind getting paid below $20 per hr go to work here."
good,"This is a great company as far as pay, and benefits.  They do defiantly over work you though.  "
good,Overall its a good company to work for. The only downfall was the job advancement and promotion ability. My co-workers were great men and women.
good,R.E.F. has changed the warehouse.... no longer needing maintenance guys....
good,"Opportunity for advancement was not there. Large call center atmosphere made me feel like just a number, not an individual."
good,Not as much opportunity for advancement at the time of employment but overall a great place to work and gain real world job experience.
good,"After training, there is no clear direction on how to work your book of business. A manager actually said that Grainger is a sales job that has nothing to do about selling, it's about dials and minutes. It is a challenging job, but it is like trying to hit a moving target. Not for the faint at heart."
good,"Fast paced environment, great team to work with: give and take helping each other. Policies and procedures changing frequently. Flexibility is a must."
good,"I was very excited to get into Grainger, I had heard many wonderful things about it. My Supervisor/s were great and always ready to help if needed."
good,"They start you off with good pay, good place to work if you don’t mind heavy lifting and can handle fast pace work environment. Physically demanding. No experience or previous job skills necessarily required."
good,"This is a very metrics driven work place, but all tools are not equally available across sales teams As a result compensation is not fair.  Some teams have the ability to provide quotes using tools that help them close sales.  Other teams are not allowed to use these tools. "
good,aprendi a manejar una maquina que se llama.Orden.picken
good,"I worked in a call center environment where each day was the same as the last. There was no incentive to work harder. You could skate by each day doing the bare minimum or be the very best and you still need to wait ""your turn"" to be promoted. A slacker could be promoted before you even though you worked harder than them. The management that i had did not put much into my own development. I tried to own it, but he would not show me the steps that i needed to take to try and advance. I applied for a basic position to get my foot in the door for the company, and previous experience does not matter. It was a very structured position, but with no advancement opportunity, no windows, and no help with management, i did not find much enjoyment going to work each day."
good,"I was always excited to come to work. Great Culture among sales professionals and colleagues. "
good,Grainger was a great place to work.  I would recommend Grainger to anyone that can accept business changes and meet the required demands of how they want their customer service to continue.
good,"The people you work with are amazing!! but the job itself- its a ""rush-rush"" job... its not about how you help them, its how FAST you help them. Your timed from one call to the next, with very little room to stretch--"
good,Good company to work for. Schedule is nice. Team environment. Happy over all experience. would recommend the job to friends family or anyone looking. Nice
good,"- Good work/life balance"
good,Nothing has gone smooth since I got to Grainger.  I there have so many mixed messages.  I am just really stating not to trust the company.
good,I work in a local market so its difficult to find opportunity for advancement. I do like the hours.. Monday through Friday with no nights no weekends but at this time I need more. Its a good company
good,Spent time sourcing products.  Needed to maintain a average of 30 quotes per day.  I was able to exceed this average to 200 quotes a week.
good,Friendly place to work with a variety of cultural mixes that keep the job interesting along with the wide customer base for a constant changing environment. Grainger makes in difficult to move around in the company and have been known on a lower management level to show favoritism to less qualified person allowing them to step around persons getting the job done with more success.
good,I enjoy working there and i get a lot of different experiences but i now want to move to continue learning new skills.
good,"Os colegas te trabalho ajudam bastante, o responsável pela área não ajuda muito quando você tem dúvidas."
good,"Em todas as empresas pela qual trabalhei, e todas aprendi algumas funções diferenciadas, como , por exemplo, gestão de pessoas, a lidar com pressão quando se trata de metas de vendas, Aprendi com os meus gestores poder de negociação e senso analítico."
good,"There is great flexibility in the certain positions and the company as many positions available in the Chicago Corporate office.  The average tenure is approx. 15-20 years, so positions in the field are more challenging to come by for advancing.  There is a large outside sales force.  They have great benefits and salary is competitive, but the challenge is to increase significantly without being in management. The people are amazing; with a deep rooted history and pride, everyone is very teamwork oriented. The company is always looking for the latest technology (laptops, IPads, cell phones, etc)  Also, consciously aware, (Green buildings, safety of employees, condition and location of buildings)"
good,Very hectic lifestyle. long hours. well paid. Salary was commision based.
good,They only care about how many tickets or phone calls you can do.  Quality and seniority don't matter to them.  The people with lower metrics are given the worst shifts which are the later ones.
good,"I heard Grainger was a great place to work.  Lately, it's seemed a little less certain what direction it's headed.  Change is constant everywhere but it's been a roller coaster recently."
good,"Advancement not as bountiful as they project upfront. Not a bad job if you enjoy being on the phone all day. The work does not go home with you, and they try to provide positive work environment."
good,"Is very challenging sometimes, but that's all most every warehouse job. 8 hours of hard work, with a lunch break, and a few other breaks. Will definitely put you in shape if you are not already in shape. The people I work with are great, it is very diversity in the workplace. Benefits and vacation time is great, the pay is alright. working there for 8 years taught me a lot about team work, leadership, training, driving equipment, and more."
good,I was there when the program started and it needed some tweaks. Overall it's a decent place to have a first job and to learn corporate jousting and salesforce's program.
good,"We worked different functions of the company, warehousing, customer facing sales, inventory control.Made good friends that made the job fun and we worked well together to get things accomplished."
good,Very good hours and pay managememt is not very well put together. Lots of heavy lifting and machine work as well. Lots of friendly co workers as well.
good,"I worked in the National Contact Center in Janesville, Wisconsin. Grainger has made a lot of changes, however not all of them are positive. Positions are always changing and/or moving. After some of our jobs went to Panema, the decision was made by the CEO to remove employees from the Regional Contact Centers and downsize. Customers have not been too happy with the changes and this makes for a stressful work environment. For the most part, the managers have not been with the company very long."
good,"We take care of the customer, we go above and beyond to make sure the customer is taken care of in which"" Every Customer, Every Time"" is the motto we strive for every day."
good,This is a solid job if you enjoy outside sales. It is a lot of time spent driving around and having conversations with your clients that I did not necessarily enjoy.
good,"Grainger is a nice place to work. I have learned a lot about working with computers. The people at Grainger are great to work with, have met a lot of nice people there. The hardest part of the job is really that it is mentally draining some days and can be pretty high stress."
good,Lots going on to make the day by quickly. Great retirement program. managers are awesome and helpful. Co-workers provide the fun to not get to stressed out with customers.
good,"This is a good job! you learn a different side of customer service! My work day started in the mornings, i had a morning break, lunch and an afternoon break. we have daily huddles and bi-weekley developments. Everyone is on a certain team and you have about 15 other people on your team with you."
good,"Typical day starts at 6:00am going through emails. Due to the fact we deal with a wide range of clients, every day you run into new situations that when solved become a learning time. Management holds their folks to a very high level of accountability both through behaviors and performance. Hardest part of the job is juggling the work/life balance. Most enjoyable portion of the job is dealing with our customers and partners in the business."
good,Pilot program ended and termination of sales floor. Did not receive the results of estimated pilot program for company. Released 90% of sales floor
good,"When you're a standard phone agent you sit on the phone and take call after call with two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch for the day. It gets very monotonous and they don't give you much leeway once you're clocked in and supposed to be on the phones. It's hard to keep up with the metrics they set for you. The benefits are great and the employees are friendly, but being on the phone and not getting much time off the phone is the hardest part to keep up with."
good,Good Corporate culture. Nice team atmosphere. Good Work/Life balance.
good,The job is easy its just the people you work with that make it difficult. There is a lot of favoritism.Work hours are pretty fair and you are able to get days off if needed.
good,Grainger should compensate more $ to their long term employees  also recognizing them for their hard work consolidation is no joke very hard and stressful job.  I've been working there almost 4 years seems like the raises are getting less & less. Company should take action before they loose hard working employees.
good,"Poor management , uneducated , low pay. Do not appreciate workers and too political to do job. Political aspect too difficult to work . No room for advnacment"
good,"Como corporación mi evaluación es impecable, pero ya que la sucursal en Peru era nueva faltaba que las gerencias de áreas se identificaran con los valores y las políticas del corporativo, por lo que el ambiente laboral no era el mejor; pero toda experiencia nos ayuda y enseña, agradezco la oportunidad que me dieron."
good,"Most enjoyable port of the job was working with people."
good,Expect to be talked down to by customers and internal partners. Call volume is usually quite high so the days tend to fly by. Love the 15 minute breaks twice a day. Most people who are in charge make themselves unavailable to assist which can make you feel like you're completely on your own.
good,"Used to be a flourishing company, but leadership decisions have led to negative impacts.  Still good people but senior leadership has lost its way"
good,"A typical day here was very simple and easy.  The work was not hard but very meticulous in some areas.  I learned about shipping and inventory and how accurate things need to be.  The management team and was helpful in most areas, but not attentive to their employees for improvement purposes.  My co workers were nice and v very helpful.  The hardest part about my job was getting the proper respect I so deserved.  The best thing I like about my job was be challenged to do more than the minimum."
good,I had a blast working for Grainger. The people at the branch level is what makes Grainger special. It was a challenging but rewarding job.
good,Reconcile and clear accounts for cash accounts
good,"This was a over all great company to work for. Benefits were decent, pay could have been better.  however the facility closed in the Fort Wayne location."
good,Long hours with no support from management. High turnover rate on staff. But life long friendships are easy with the residents.
good,The SF Grainger Distribution Center was a really great place to work at. It was unfortunate that i was only there working as a special project. The employees were great and the break area and work out room were a definite bonus.
good,"- busy work day"
good,A typical day was calling on current accounts or prospective accounts. I have learned how to cold call and advance through a quick sales process. My co-workers were good people to work with and great environment.
good,"very competitive work place, lots of people released for not meeting goals."
good,"It's hard to argue the company performance.  Fantastic financials and dividends.  So if you are an investor you will continue to be happy.  Unfortunately, Grainger used to be a very employee-centric organization as well as a financially successful company.  That part of the ""culture"" of Grainger has sadly faded with an in-flux of leadership with very different integrity.  Still probably a great stop in your career journey just don't stay too long."
good,"The Shifts are hard and long hours of intense labor. The Management was friendly and came off as friendly. The Staff itself hated working there. Spending so many mandatory overtime isn't a problem until you add a toxic work environment. Over all great pay and benefits though, especially if you have kids."
good,WW Grainger was a good place to work overall.  The work and life balance could in approve. The communication could defiantly improve between the managers and its employee's.
good,"good work place culture, No overtime , but still expected to perform tasks outside of the normal working hours. It is a Monday -Friday job. They offer a profit sharing program."
good,Great place to work for a younger person with no children the pay is really not that great if you are a working parent and have people to provide for. Easy work
good,"As with all car sales it is a very competitive environment. There is no up system and other sales people will often seek any opportunity to grab your deal or at least a piece. "
good,Overall OK place to work but management and supervisors can be very manipulative. The work culture revolvs around favouritsm and outside work relations. Hardest part of the job would be trying to complete tasks that you have recieved very little information or guidance with. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in sociable enviroments.
good,"The company is very large and stable.  The company doesn't want unions, so the pay is nice for the area.  Work life balance is ok at the bottom.  Leads tend to have an average of 10 hr days, salary employees make their own schedules."
good,"Being a manager can be rewarding and difficult at the same time. Juggling different situations so everyone can come out on top is never an easy task. I've learned to have patients and understanding to people's needs. I'm a very interactive, polite person, and honest person."
good,Grainger is a very helpful and full of opportunities. They have many good benefits. They take care of their customers. It’s a great company to work for.
good,Inventory counting for year end starts with an 8hr work day. Grainger has a very safe and friendly work environment. Matching product you are accounting for; to paper work for a balance count report for that product being accounted for. Wages for inventory accounting was very good at Grainger. The best thing about the job was working with  positive hard working people.
good,"Good place to learn e-commerce"
good,"It’s not about what you did yesterday, but what are doing for me today.  They also keep changing their core values and mission statement which makes it tough to consistently relay the company message to customers."
good,A typical day revolves around you assisting with customer's needs either directly or indirectly. Most roles come with a rigid schedule consisting of two ten minutes breaks and a thirty minute lunch. To advance within the company you must take control of your own development and aggressively seek advancement.
good,when things are good within the company it's great but micromanaging is a big issue. once you make annual achievers it's hard to make it a second time because your goal is raised very high.
good,It is hard to review this as I worked there 25 years ago.  It was a great place to work for 20 years.  Made some good friendships during my working days at Grainger.
good,"The location that I worked at had it's clicks which were impregnable, birthday parties would be held for certain employees not every employee was special enough to have a party honoring their day of birth."
good,"Good place to work for those who can keep up. Hard work that teaches teamwork and self discipline, but workers were mistreated. Due to low number of workers, people were hired that weren't fit  for the job and made it difficult for people that were. Drama was an issue, couldn't stay out of it even if you tried, someone would pull you in"
good,"Typical day involes managing multiple requests for a board range of products.  "
good,Grainger needs a lot of  help with marketing automation but is a family-friendly place to work. A shared marketing tool like Marketo or Eloqua would help eliminate some of the confusion that comes about when producing marketing across channels.
good,Company with strong management that offered generous compensation and benefits with emphasis on personal and professional development. Most enjoyed building new business relationships and providing the best business experience for my customers.
good,Loved working at Grainger but unfortunately they do not provide career development or advancement.  There is a boys club in product management and does not provide proper onboarding.
good,"Poor WorkLife Balance produced stressful culture.  Out-Sourcing diminished company-wide trust of management and damaged sense of job security.  Excessive hours meant inadequate time to develop self and inadequate time for the company to focus on strong long term strategies.  Team attitude was strong and company benefits were great, so still recommend for less stressful position.  Management wanted to give better WorkLife balance, but did not fully succeed"
good,"Updates through daily meetings"
good,I owe Grainger they showed me the different aspects of the Industrial Supply BusinessI started Unloading trucks at a branc and rose to account manager and their top sales award
good,"i worked from 4;30 pm until 2am monday to thursday."
good,"Do not apply for this job if you do not like being alone in a car all day long. If you enjoy an office setting and being able to socialize with co-workers, you are not cut out for this line of work.Also, if you are not personable and shy away from rejection, reconsider your desire to get into sales."
good,"Es una gran empresa con grandes personas en todas sus áreas de trabajo, excelentes dirección de líderes, gran ambiente de trabajo."
good,interesting and varied.some new skills learned and  educational.high skills and performance to work on high class motors
good,"I liked working for Grainger, great profit sharing!"
good,"This company has been around for a long time and seems fairly stable.  However, lately there seems to be a disconnect between what upper management is saying and what is trickling down to the rank and file employees."
good,I have learned many things and I am very thankful with everybody.
good,"Busy very busy, seems to be hectic at times, some co-workers make the day enjoyable"
good,Grainger has a strong benefits program for part time and full time team members. Overall it is a great experience and provides opportunities for career development
good,grainger is a great company and i love putaway i believed in team work and hardwork also to contribute towards the growth of the company it is a great company my job is to pick customer order correctly and put it in the right location so picker can get it to our client.
good,it is a stresssful environment due to management being unfair with there workers and blaming them for things that management should have seen and treating them awfully
good,"It's really a great company, with some really great people, but the culture is a lot about what title you have. Meetings are structured where the only opinions that matter are of the higher ups."
good,Great benefits and great pay  a lot of overtime no weekends. Downfall is you know what time you start but you don't know what time your getting off most of the time
good,"Muy buena empresa, excelentes instalaciones, y cursos de capacitacion demasiado buenos."
good,It's ok but salary and hired for one thing and it turns into something else. Salary not sufficient for work required. Great training.Supervisor are to busy to help.
good,Grainger strides on being sure their employees have a good work life balance. They also hire candidates that are strong willed and are able to work with little to no direction.
good,"It's OK. It is a company. I do not appreciate being required to write a review. Probably better than most companies but at the end of the day it is a job,"
good,Decent company to work for in general. Financially healthy and good employee benefits. Structure changes are frequent and not so much job security unless you form a big internal network. Can be quite bureaucratic depending on which team you work for.
good,Management is sincere and dedicated. Always changing but an always happy. Low turnover. Lots of room for advancement but hard to achieve. Success paths are visited regularly.
good,aqui la experiencia fue mas de un corporativo ya que mis actividades fueron dentro del corporativo por lo que fue gratificante aprender un desarrollo administrativo mas completo
good,"freedom to manage your account and develop your territory, excellent remuneration package and benefits, accessible, to major suppliers and training programs and product knowledge"
good,"Trying to capture soo much of MRO distribution marketplace, have forgotten about the employees who have gotten them to position they are in. Older employees are being let go as they continue to outsource."
good,"I learned a lot of work skills during my years there. I got to work with a lot of great people. "
good,Grainger is a very professional company. It provides opportunity to grow and develop. It strives to promote diversification in the workplace. The benefits are very generous. Thank you Grainger.
good,"I had a very good experience with this company, learned a lot and got ready to move on to the new jobs and positions.the leadership was always ready to push me for more growing and improvement."
good,"The large amount of customers to deal with in a day, on one of the busiest streets in Liverpool city centre, meant that tensions could be high. However, it was a great team and overall a pretty rewarding company to work for."
good,the people were great to work with. but unfortunately everything is moving to online purchasing and shipping from new DC so company is going through a big change. Company did set some unreasonable goals and expectations and communication from the higher ups was very lacking and always changing.
good,"I worked here several years ago as a forklift operator on night shift, good manager, good co-workers, only left due to relocation.  I would go back if they would rehire former employees."
good,They care about their employees and the Product Manager jobs have a lot of variety which makes it interesting and fun. The people are friendly and most are willing to help. The organization has gone through a lot of change over the last 5 years.
good,Low consistency lead to confusing times and loss of business. Would have liked to see company during a more stable time. I believe it would have been the ideal place to work.
good,"Many support teams including system support, product support, logistics support and billing problems support, management support.  Benefits and total compensation excellent."
good,Would like to see management nurture and help improve employee relations.  I felt that something could be done do reduce the turnover rate and others did not seem to care. Very disappointing to see a great company with little care for their employees.
good,"The organization is very employee focused and is currently adapting to the changing marketplace which has created some employee dissatisfaction. However, I like the culture they try to foster.  I enjoy the job.  I enjoy the tools and training they provide to be successful in my role."
good,"Great company, hard to make a ton of money in sales, but really strong group of leaders here."
good,I enjoyed working at Grainger.  The corporate structure was a little much but overall the experience was great.  Liked the people and the support that was offered by the company
good,"Great service, wonderful people, and significant accomplishments.  A fun place to work and enjoy life.  Good work life balance with plenty of opportunities."
good,It was excellent when i started with the company.  But a new manager was hired from outside the industry and had no clue what he was doing.  he didn't last long.
good,"Good company and strong foundation, currently there seems to be a struggle with clear vision for the future. Lots of change with little communication around clear longterm evolution in the market place."
good,"Overall, Grainger is a decent place to work. It's a typical customer service job, but the employees are pretty great. My supervisor is awesome, and there's decent benefits and PTO is available. Sometimes you have to request off a bit in advance. The current shift I'm on (10:30-7) is not great for me personally, but a lot of people do enjoy it."
good,It's not a bad company to work for but the breaks are way to short when people are consistently standing on their feet all day.They also don't promote the right people sometimes.
good,"It is a very place to work but don't expect to make any friend in there because when you start work there is no time to talk. I was a customer service so I answer phone 60 calls per day within 6 hours or so. Be very patient and get ready for those customer cursing with you over the phone because you don't know what they asking for. But if you can't handle that, don't even think about it. Also, if you expect to check FB or text message with friend of the time, this job is not for you."
good,Good fast paced work environment. Takes pride in helping people advance and grow within and out of their current career field. Good work/life balance with quality co-workers.
good,I loved the investigative skills used to the customer contact. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an upset customer but my drive and determination turned them into great customers.
good,"Good place to work, people are treated fairly good but there is zero accountability on the sales side of the business.  The people that you worked with make or break the job there but the culture use to be strong but i'm know going forward it's going downhill."
good,"Great company and well oiled sales machine.  However, it's a bit of a churn mentality towards employees and has closed some of their core branches, so service has diminished.  If they are not careful Fastenal and MSC will eat their lunch."
good,Grainger comes from years past and is loaded with bureaucracy. Decisions are slow and struggle to keep pace with today's industries. Managers have too many direct reports and get bogged down in compliance rather than coaching to success.
good,"Very high paced, high pressure to deliver the products during the day. Little attention is paid to personal commitments, the company comes first. You will get paid very well and the benefits package are second to none. But you are sacrificing any semblance of a home life during the work week. You start at the same time every morning and stay until that day's orders are completed, which means anywhere as early as 5:45PM to 8PM. Just remember the company's business comes first, but you will be compensated very well. If you want to advance to anything other than local middle management, you'll have to go to Corporate in Illinois. The people are mixed, I've met some of my best friends working here, as well as some of the most loathsome folks I've met. You spend so much time together, conflicts are inevitable."
good,"A typical work day goes by fast with the various cross training plan. On the inventory team, every member has been cross trained to perform every job throughout the facility. The workplace culture hasn't improved much due to the turnover rate. The hardest part of my job would be working with a selfish team and the most enjoyable part of my job would have to be various duties instead of one duty."
good,Grainger provided many opportunities for learning.  Great team environment.  Good work/life balance.  Supportive management.    Will miss working there.

good,"Its a great workplace , very productive , also with great benefits."
good,"Room for advancement within the company.  Very fast paced, visit various sites on a day to day basis to provide various industrial and safety products."
good,Wells Fargo was a pretty stressful work environment. Call metrics were hard to meet and it was constant back to back incoming calls. You would take about a 100 calls a day and the pay was not all that great.
good,I have spent over 15 years with Grainger and I love to work for such a great company. If I had to do it all over I would still work for this great company.
good,Great place to learn B2B sales. Never micro-managed and decent pay. A lot of resources to help you succeed. Company car and gas card
good,"what was once a great family oriented company with outstanding benefits is now becoming more of a fortune 500 culture where cost cutting and shareholder value trump job security.  "
good,Good company to work for.  Good work life balance although benefits are getting cut.  Many jobs are being eliminated to cut overhead.
good,"This is one of the greatest companies in the country to work for.  It was ethical and believed in its people. Lately there has been a lot of change, most of it necessary to stay ahead and competitive in today's market.  The only word of caution I have is that the company remembers its roots, the people are who built this to what it is today, help them lead through the change and it will be a stronger company for another 80 years."
good,"Grainger was a good environment, A lot of good training. Typical phone and computer hands on work. Awesome company to grow in."
good,Grainger is a industry leader in the MRO sector.  Sales requires being in the field most of the week with customers.  Challenging to find time to do follow up and administrative tasks.  Pay isnt consistent in sales.  Bebefits are great but profit sharing is going down.
good,"Pros:  Very good benefits"
good,"Great place for a challenging work goals. But a fresher, you should keep working and getting updated with otu rest. And i think thats very good to your own career."
good,"Great benefits"
good,"some managers are willing to help,constant meetings and reports, goal oriented company. Cold calling, Good customer service."
good,"Made may good friends here. Learned about many different "
good,Management is getting better but it has some ways to go in regards to training. The position is new and so it has a steep curve before it will be up to par.
good,A typical day at work is in the field during scared selling time seeing the right customer that will drive sales and maintain a high daily run rate to exceed monthly goal. We have to see a minimum of eight customers per day and also make cold calls to acquire new business. What I learned is that every customer has a need and it is my job to discover what that need is and how I can best position myself and the company to fit that need for a customer. My management taught me to be self sufficient when needing help and advise to reach out to peers and/or our support system. My co-workers and I thrived on team effort. What skill or information might have worked for me or one of my co-workers we shared the best demonstrated practice with each other to increase our knowledge. The hardest part of the job is relying on outside and inside assistance when helping the customer. I hold myself to high standards and in turn I hold business partners both internal and external to those high standards as well when helping and selling to customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the end result of my hard work with the customer happy and also building relationships with these customers.
good,"Great company, with great benefits.  Job/Life balance is great being a Territory Sales Rep because you basically get to make our own schedule (in regards to the work you're doing).  I have been taught many great things that I will be able to take with me around the world.  The people that work for Grainger are all awesome, and they know when it's time to kick-it into gear and get things done.  The hardest part of the job is making critical decisions based off of little information.  The processes are extremely important to learn because their are so many.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being out there face to face with small business owners and making a difference in not only their businesses, but their lives.  To the customer, the thing that separates the MRO companies is mostly price, but when you have a company with so much more experience than it's competitors, you can see that there's something more that you get when you buy from Grainger."
good,"Its a great place to work, love the benefits and having weekends off. Steady, reliable company with some room for growth. Love the management, honest and direct, you know where you stand with them."
good,Days involve making multiple stops at businesses along with reaching out via phone and email. Most days there is a good work life balance but as with any sales position there are days that you will take work home with you.
good,"Fast pace and numbers driven, no micro managing.  Able to make decisions on account with confidence, always driving for the best results."
good,"Learned about how the police departments, fire departments, and EMS services work. The most enjoyable part of this job was knowing that I made a difference to people in need."
good,"Grainger is a good place to work. The people there are good to work with their pretty helpful. I get along with everybody. There really is nothing hard about the job, there's just no room to grow or to learn other things and that to me is a big deal because I like to learn more about the job or company that I work for. But other than that its a company to be at."
good,"Helping customers with the technical aspects of their merchandise selection.  Writing and filling orders,  as well as any other duties in regard to branch operation.  Display set up and even freight unloading could be part of your day.  We were a small well cross trained group."
good,"Nice job and the people  are friendly, Grainger has space for a person to grow. I like it very much. I have learned a lot since I've been working at Grainger. I enjoy going to work everyday lol.."
good,Learned great customer service skills while at Grainger.  The most enjoyable part about working at Grainger were the friends that I made.  Not only co-workers but customers who have helped me in my professional life as well as my personal.  I'm grateful for the time I spent at Grainger.
good,"6:50- 1520"
good,"Working for the bankruptcy court is a valuable experience in learning the workings of the clerk's office, judges, and courtroom."
good,overall great place to work like all places can get a little frustrating not being able to move into the positions you want when your extremely capable. fun place to work and great group of people to work around. The overall management are pretty good people there are a few that seem a bit shady at times. Not a bad place too work but at the same time be ready to be overlooked for positions that you may deserve to someone the manager may favor at the time.
good,"Managed a team of 5 customer service specialists for 7+ years in the categories of customer service, order management, export order management and compliance, process management, continuous improvement, and project management."
good,Overall I think that Grainger is a good company and truly cares about there employees. However your experience will vary based on which department/manager you work for.
good,"Great Company with great benefits got laid off cause of company warehouse relocation to Minooka ,IL"
good,"Great company. "
good,"Inspiring Executive team"
good,The co-workers were great and always there to help when needed. Management was stable and always preached the companies goals so that they were clear. No two days were typical because one you could have customers who called and knew what they wanted or had to connect to technical support. The hardest part of the job was understanding so many products in the catalog or online. I really enjoyed the team work. I learned that when a manager is coaching you it is for your benefit and for the benefit for the company.
good,The company is all about team work. Team members are always willing to help each other because of this I have learned so much about other positions within the department.
good,"I think that it is a wonderful place to work, great co-workers, going through a displacement due to off shore."
good,Not enough opportunity and a need for new thinkers in the organization on a micro level.
good,"Very efficient Company, "
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned how to work fast and smart.
good,"good experience.Doctoral Research and Teaching Assistant, Grainger Power   "
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, but yet organized day. I make 60 out bound calls a day and also take in bound as well. I look for ways to show my customer how consolidating to one company for purchasing can save them time and money. Always need to show them what is in it for them."
good,"The job is very stable, and Grainger is one of the top perfoming companies in their industry.The job gets better the farther up the corporate ladder you make it; low level employees might not enjoy this job as much."
good,"It has been a great journey with Grainger so far. Everyday at work is different from the previous one and that's the most exciting part of the profile I have. Am proud to be working with Grainger, which has been ranked #1 in ""worlds most admired companies to work with"" by Forbes. Having had a very friendly team working with me, I always find my responsibilities interesting and encouraging. I have had the opportunity to learn the aspects of people management, crisis management, etc. at Grainger. Having worked with a highly experienced and efficient management team , I often find myself motivating and keen to take up challenging tasks."
good,The Most Typical day at work would alwaays be during the fans (Industrial Fan) season where we would have limited stock and our dealers had huge orders. There I had to judge to which dealer I could give these material on Advance payment so that Financially I could help the company. This was always a typical work where one has to been a Good judge.
good,Managed an inside staff of 3 and an outside staff of 8. Learned many values with staff and how to manage difficult situations. Very supportive co-workers. Hardest part of the job was ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction due to the tight timelines they required us to complete tasks in. Best part of the job was the fun environment i had created where we were no longer co-workers but a second family.
good,"A typical day at work included updating inventory using scanner technology, and problem solving involving inventory management software."
good,Good company to gain great sales experience. High activity and High performance are key drivers.
good,A typical day starts 30-45 minutes before the rest of the shift and ends about 30 minutes after shift. In my role as team lead I have gained the experience needed to direct a group of twenty plus associates through the completion of our daily activities meeting goals and deadlines. I have also lead several continuous improvement projects that have helped keep the department more organized.
good,"Liked working for Grainger, but after 27 years with them, the credit office moved to Wisconsin, and there were no open positions available locally. I received a nice severance package, but would have rather continued to work their, without moving out of state."
good,"travailler chez Grainger a été une très belle expérience , selon moi si la compagnie étais encore présent sur le marché je serais probablement encore en poste ."
good,"I liked the company, good experience, management was okay. Alot of job transfers within the company. Just had to drive and hour and a half for my job."
good,It’s a contact center. Definitely better than any other call center I’ve seen. MOST of management is wonderful and they are awesome people here. The job isn’t hard but it gets boring. They love to promote from within and there are so many opportunities. Just not the right fit for me.
good,Grainger does a great job of hiring great people. I haven't met anyone from our sales or district that didn't connect. I really enjoy my teammates and customers. That seems to be the same message from all my co-workers.
good,"Typical work is fast pace work through out the day, jumping from lift to lift, loading trailers with orders and handle materials. Management could be more understanding instead of just looking at dollar signs. It was a friendly environment to work with people from all over."
good,"Do what you are asked to do, work in a  timely fashion, be safe, be sure to report all accidents no matter how minor. Very corporate."
good,"I work weekend nights at Grainger, it is quiet and relaxing. You have many tasks and do a P3 scan. The culture is with the other security team is good. I have learned how to fill out reports and check for property damage and how to handle the issues properly. There are no hard parts to this job."
good,"Warehouse work. Lower than expected wages. Little or no internal advancement. 30 minute lunch. Great customers. Huge inventory same day, next day and 2 day. That really helped with customer service. Lots of cheaper local competition."
good,"Pros"
good,I dictate my own schedule. I am engaged with partners and able to attend meetings to learn more about leaders in both regions that I currently support.
good,"Chaotic work culture, but lots of motivated and talented people. Access to cutting edge technology. Willingness to innovate. Great facilities and good work life balance"
good,"I could of use more hands on training with a one on one person at different time to help with my advancement in the company.  Need more team effort at my location in Alsip, seems to be a problem with team work.  The branch manager is about team work and is working on improving this issue."
good,"Great staff, helpful when its needed. management is sharp typically and it's an over all good work environment. Fast pace work and you learn a lot about customer service and products that they sell."
good,...lots of people in one building...emotional at times....forever changing...need good computer skills and must know how to type and multitask...comfortable environment
good,I felt that my time with Grainger was impactful. The company unfortunately restructured routes that cut the teams hours in half. I was let go due to lack of work.
good,this place is probably one of my favorite places to work. job security is great just show up for work. also you have time when you get off work to spend with family.
good,"Called on small and large manufacturing customers."
good,"Strong, committed corporate culture has been impacted by poor management and rapidly changing priorities.  Managers are either paralyzed to make decisions or make them too quickly without any real assessment of the potential impacts or risks.  As a result, teams spend years working on the same challenges without any actual productive resolution."
good,"Finance teams are comprised of very young talent (college interns and rotational analysts). The expectation on some teams is to work a lot in order to shine. culture could be better balanced with diversity and gender awareness, males excel and get more attention from management than females. A lot of young management from internal promotions, and even with focus on management training, they don't develop or mentor the employees."
good,"Grainger was an excellent company to work for, benefits, salary, and retirement was great.  However, management had a way of picking their favorites and making sure that they were taking care of in terms of promotion, and training."
good,"Monday through Friday isn't bad, but when you don't know when you're going to be leaving every night, it gets hard to handle business outside of work."
good,"Grainger is a great company to a part of. Grainger offers excellent pay with benefits and awesome training. "
good,"As the assistant branch manager, I typically ran the day to day operations of the branch. I opened the store in the morning and closed up at night. The vast product knowledge I acquired has helped me in my Industrial Distribution career. The managing of dozens of employees different personalities made me a better listener. The thousands of different customer requirements has taught me to be a problem solver."
good,"lots and lots of meetings, sometimes back to back all day long."
good,Working at Grainger was very interesting. There were very tight goals to hit but overall the culture was great. The people there are very cut throat and determined.
good,"The job was interesting due to many different functions in the warehouse environment. I learned many good skills such as freight, shipping, and receiving, customer will call and equipment."
good,Grainger is a great place to work if you do not mind working a lot of hours.  The DC is always busy and there is never a dull day.  The people are great for the most part and management tries to inspire each team member to work hard with integrity and work as a team.
good,"On a typical work day I use a hand held symbol, sort multiple orders an hour, lifting items up to 50 lbs constantly, twisting/bending/squatting while sorting, working in a fast pace environment, scanning at 16 seconds per scan (goal is 30 seconds), up to 1200 or more scans a day, moving carts once completed to the packers area, etc. "
good,"A typical day at work is exactly that, a typical day, but with a bit of fun thrown in. "
good,It is a great job to have with great training to help any individual become successful. Company Car included and a growth plan can be executed.
good,"AGI is going through lots of change to decrease their reliance on the oil and gas sector.  I had 2 managers during my time and a couple different roles.  AGI can be a good place to work, depending on your department.  They have invested heavily in SAP recently.  Like any large company, you have good people and bad people."
good,"Es una empresa relativamente joven (en México) con un alto grado de presión para continuar creciendo a ritmos acelerados y con enfoque en rentabilidad. Una gran empresa con cambios continuos y crecimiento sostenidos."
good,"the hours are very long, usually 11 hours which leaves no time for family life. Other than that the company is outstanding."
good,a great place for young people to get a start in a retail sales career with good management  teams in place to help get them started is room for advancement at ct
good,"I enjoying interacting with others when their equipment is not operating properly and training others to make the same repairs and diagnosis. The atmosphere at work allows me to take a few minutes to get to know people as well as challenges I can help fix to make their jobs more efficient and safe. "
good,Your results depend on your activity.  You activity should include Demand Generation.  Creating demand for your customers is what selling is.  Grainger has so many products there is demand generating occurring every time you talk to a customer.
good,"A typical day in this position starts with a good work/life balance.  The company make every attempt to make this happen for the employee. (changing starting/ending times to suit the employee).  You are constantly engaging with vendors for pricing and availability for MRO products.  I have learned successful techniques in dealing with Grainger's wide base of vendors and also dealing with our internal and external customers.  The department that I work in has a great team environment, everyone has a unique expertise in some area.  You can rely on the different team members to get any questioned answered.  The hardest part of the job is telling your internal/external customers that you are unable to meet their pricing/availablilty demands.  The best and most enjoyable part of the job is when you work with the customers to get the desired results that they are looking for and then they say thank you.  Makes you feel that you are doing your job and that you feel appreciated."
good,"You are expected to meet metrics without mistakes. Sometimes you can do it, a lot of times you can't. Used to be a great place to work but things have changed. Used to get great benefits but that has slowly changed. Management can get in your way of advancements."
good,"I served as a Customer Service Agent/Mobile Sales Team Support for Grainger in a Northeast Region call center. It started out with superb paid training and full-time hours. However, when sales dropped, so did our hours...right in time for Christmas. They didn't go back to full-time even though we were told it would happen. "
good,Grainger has an outstanding CEO and the individual contributors are excellent. The managers in Human Resources do not treat people with respect nor do they give equal opportunity for growth and development for all their employees. It is based on who they like and not based on performance.
good,I learned a lot at grainger. Its a fast pace environment and very demanding. You have employees there who are hard working and fun. The breaks are very short for the demand of the job .My most enjoyable part is in the early years I was able to learn a lot about the daily operations of the company.
good,I am required to visit and assist at least 10 customers a day. I assist customers in located products and formulating what they need to complete projects. When necessary I act as an intermediate between customers and other Grainger representatives.
good,"Buen balance entre actividades individuales como de equipo, retos diarios y variedad de tareas"
good,"No one day is the same, a fast pace and ever changing environment."
good,"I truly enjoy working with Grainger.  This is the #1 MRO provider in the country, and they do a great job of training and supporting there sales force, with the latest technology.  Very positive place to work and the most enjoyable part for me is the interactions with the customers.  Strong emphasis in customer face time, but extra requirements and admin actually restrict one from maximizing the precious 8-5 hours customers are at their place of business."
good,"A grainger é uma empresa americana muito bem colocada nos estados unidos."
good,"I wake up at 3:30 am to enjoy my coffee and make sure I am awake before heading to work. Get my supplies and equipment I need for the days work. Morning meeting @5:30, then head off the begin my day.  I have learned multiple software programs through the years at Grainger, which has also helped me stay up with technology. I have also gotten very good and coming up with solutions to different issues that may arise. Management takes time to listen to these ideas and if applicable they will implement them, with the employee involvement. I work with a variety of people with has made me learn to be more diversified with my communication skills. The people whom I work with are always willing to work as a  team which really makes the day go smoothly. The hardest part of the job is getting up so early, however I have only been late (5 minutes) twice in twenty six years. Some of the work is extremely heavy to pick and pack. "
good,"I loved the flexibility and customer base I was assigned to, primarily Healthcare and Hospitality for the last 6 months. Prior to that I was also covering HVAC contractors, electrical contractors, paving contractors, and many more business segments.  While working there I was able to expand on my outside sales experience and allowed to leverage the relationships, and corporate contracts I had created. The management in the Anchorage market unfortunately lacked leadership and coaching from the sales side. I however really enjoyed my sales team and the operations team as working with them and my customers was the most fun part o the job and the most challenging part was the sales management and tremendous micromanagement of them on us as the sales team. "
good,"I worked in an all male environment which could be tought at times. My branch manager was great and I really enjoyed working directly with him, but my assistant branch manager really wasn't a people person which made it hard to speak to him if any customer issues ever happened. I was in customer service/inside sales which meant that I was tied to a phone all day"
good,Typical day you are very busy. Picking orders. Learned to drive a stand up fork lift.
good,Great learning experience however salary advancements and title advancements were few and far between
good,Typical day consist of 60- 90 inbound calls from mostly vendors and small business owners looking for industry supplies.
good,I would come in take customers orders or help them place orders online. we had team meetings which i helped lead. co-workers were great they were always willing to lead a helping hand.
good,"A typical date at work was great. Phone calls, placing orders, helping co workers figure out problems, and most importantly serving the customer. I learned a lot of different techniques and methods to help solve a problem in more than one way. Management was great, they were always there if you needed them. My co-workers were great. It was a nice friendly, helpful environment, which felt more like a family than a work place."
good,Benefits are great. Depends on what shift that you work but you get home on time. Management isn't all on the same page but the place itself is amazing.
good,Good place to work and the team members are outstanding. Grainger has excellent manager development programs to help you along with your career path of your choosing.
good,"Almost all the people that I met at Grainger liked working there. The pay was good, compared to similar opportunities in the area. And the benefits were really good too. I just didn’t like the job I had. It wasn’t a good fit for me. But others might love it."
good,"Pros- Decent pay with good benefits and compensation. "
good,For a corporation there is none better. They are concerned with employees and their families. Health care is great. They train employees instead of managing them.
good,"I was reprimanded for leaving my shift. Grainger has an on floor cell phone policy and it is often abused by team members. Getting upset or angry on this may back fire on you, as it did me. Unfairness for some people to be able to do certain jobs and others not to able to."
good,Grainger has become a very fast paced and competitive work place.  They offer competitive salary and benefits.  I would recommend Grainger as a good place to work.
good,"A typical day always started with good conversations with all the branch managers I had over time on a business and personal level. "
good,Grainger management based on yes sir environment.  If you like to be the best and suggest improvements for job quality or address safety concerns you will be black balled for advancement. Once employed your past accomplishments have no further merit.  If you didn't do something at Grainger it doesn't count.
good,"Cool place to work but there wasn't a grab your balls and get things done attitude.  It was more like hey life sucks and then you die so I'm just here for a pay check.  Thanks not a terrible way to live but at the same time I'm not spending 20 years to get fat and die.  The heavy hitters were real frustrated there and kind of stopped caring, so there was some really poor attitude."
good,"Grainger provides awesome opportunities for growth and development. Every team member lives by the mission, vision, and values. Overall, the management is the absolutely best in terms of creating a culture where team members can thrive. I've learned how to excel in my field, how to lead people, how to influence without authority, and be a consultative coach while at Grainger. Work/life balance is a struggle- Grainger demands a lot from team members, especially the hard working, dedicated ones. The organization is 100% focused on customers and team members. Overall, one of the best places to ever work!"
good,I have learned some computer programs that will be helpful and worked in the warehouse on there inventory system. They have too many platforms with there computers that slows down each customer transaction.
good,"A typical day at work would start with a safety meeting led by the supervisor and instruction on what each workers would be doing that night.What i learn from Ackland Grainger  was working alone most of the time which i didn't do much on my previous jobs."
good,"Grainger is an excellent company to work for . The Grainger ISA Call Center is like the ""red headed step child"" of Grainger.  If you enjoy working for a call center and have no issues with micro management, then you will be fine."
good,"I worked there for 14 years. I met a lot of great people, and worked my way from unloading trucks to inventory manager."
good,"Great company in general with good people.  "
good,"I worked for Grainger for over 15 years and overall it was good.  During the past few years, their were several changes made that reduced my job satisfaction and compensation."
good,long hours. lot of heavy lifting. try meeting your quotas and no slacking off. if you do then you will never make it there and be successful. good luck
good,"Very busy and demanding with a high turnover of sales staff. I learned branch operations and inventory management. The managers were fair but often quite stressed as pressure came from 'the top, down'. The culture was fun, yet demanding. There was seldom a time to relax. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the life/work balance as calls from managers were expected to be replied to day and night. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the stability of the job."
good,"buena paga y buenas prestaciones , pero se les olvoda el lado humano"
good,"4-5 customer facing appointments per day."
good,"Great place to work, the benefits are nice very accommodating, and beneficial. Competitive environment, hard driven managers who help you throughout your time with them!"
good,"Decent pay if you stay for a couple years."
good,"I had an excellent manager and she made Grainger a great place to work.  Once the organizational changes stabilize, Grainger will be amazing company to work for."
good,Grainger is a great company with many opportunities.  I was fortunate to learn an in depth sales process with lots of experienced sales professionals.  They give you the tools to succeed.  An area for improvement would be not to micromanage the matrix and allow more advancement from within.
good,"Workplace culture is great! Grainger does not allow for much free thought. Most jobs are very specific and repetitive. I was not able to find much in the way of advancement, as I am not interested in being a people leader."
good,"Management is misleading, There is no longer a culture other than than warehouse type which took all the degenerate losers that cannot pack order to the branches and now expect them to ship correctly directly to customers."
good,"Grainger has a solid customer base, and they have recently and successfully refocused on their mid-market customers (see 2 quarters of solidly matching or beating analyst estimates).  "
good,"Grainger is a great place to work.  Great pay and retirement programs.  The home office is competitive, but also an enjoyable place to be.  Lots of changes recently so we'll see where that takes us.  New leadership is much more forward-thinking than previous."
good,"I had a blast working there."
good,Grainger is a good company overall good pay and benefits but its a job that one bad day you could loose your job your only allowed 9 picking errors a year
good,Days always went by fast but I was in the packing department so we always got off last. Had to wait for the pickers to get done picking before we could even think about clocking out.
good,"sales driven.  go, go, go  "
good,"Left for mostly personal reasons, company culture was a bit hard to become fully acquainted to though.  Very much an organization where outsiders struggle, but once you've been there long enough their internal network begins to be an advantage."
good,"Great job for new grad, pay compensation and career advancement opportunities. Free car, computer, phone and gas. Loved my job. Just had a boss that I hated. Besides that. Dream job."
good,"While working for the company was one of the best job's I've ever had, my experience with the leadership was 50% excellent and 50% poor. While they do have leaders who invest in their team and seek to promote the culture and values, other leaders put into responsibility are unable to effectively manage their team and often take their frustrations out on them. This has occurred not only to me, but other situations I have seen first hand. "
good,Too many directions for sales rather than just focusing on selling. A typical day is logging everything in Salesforce rather than the important pieces of business.
good,"A typical work day at Grainger involved answering 50-80 calls a day in regards to customer support/order entry. The most difficult part is the sheer volume, and being able to stay available to assist the next call. The best part of the job was the few times a day you had to think on the spot to solve a problem rather than just be a data entry employee."
good,"The calls are not that bad. It's mostly business to business. The hours are good and they do work with your schedule. Everyone is nice, smiles as you pass people in the halls. The hardest part of the job is the systems are glichey. As well as the product line. It helps if you have knowledge of industrial products. They don't train you on what the items do. Customers will throw works at you and expect you to know what they are talking about. The training is extensive but it consists of how to handle the calls. They say there is no script but there are key phrases you have to say. They record the calls and listen so they can coach you on best practices. Breaks are two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. 30 minutes is not enough time. They say they are going to extend lunches to 1 hour at some point in the future. The good thing about the job is the hours and for a call center it's close to the top of the list."
good,"You are on your feet all day but the staff that you will work with are a pretty fun  and hard working group. you can pick which events that you would like to work. you can also recommend a friend to work an event with you if qualified. All employees must be neat, polite, clean, have good communication skills, able to follow directions."
good,Grainger asks that you meet numbers that can be extremely difficult to make when you are bounced around to different work stations. And then get on you when you have down time which if you are moved you will have down time getting from one area to another.
good,"fast pace"
good,"Job gets redundant after a while.  I was able to learn a lot about the different categories in Metal working that I never knew about. Management is great and helps our team as much as possible, upper management doesn't communicate too well with them in order to help us out with issues.  Unfortunately the culture there is not too positive because of more veteran employees not wanting to adapt to changes being made. The hardest part for me is having to battle with other team members from other departments to try and help them find what they need for their customers.  The most enjoyable part is when the customer gets exactly what they are looking for and are grateful for our effort."
good,The job gives you ample opportunities for different job experiences while providing everyone with the skills necessary to preform their job efficiently.
good,"Company moving to more automation in sales process and pricing."
good,Grainger has gave me a great platform to be successful and be a leader in my industry Grainger has made many changes in 2016 band 2017 that has led our senior leadership to leave
good,"good place to work, constant training, good working culture, hours of work reasonable, good benefits, vacation days off excellent, fast pace working environment"
good,I was laid off along with many other employees due to lack of company sales but a good overall company to work with. I worked as hard as I could to promote the company and make strategic partnerships.
good,A Fortune 500 company with a solid growth plan. Structural changes were the theme for 2016; remaining relevant to customers of all types is the vision for 2017.
good,"Grainger is a great company to work for and is the leader in the MRO field. However, they are going through some growing pains and re-aligning their go to market. Management is weak and know little to nothing about the market."
good,A good company to work for. Good work/life balance. Advancement opportunities and good starting salary. Great co workers and an overall good place to work.
good,"Grainger is a solid company with its own company culture of success. Top reps are rewarded handsomely with trips and incentive and every rep is treated with company outings and trips. Theyre going through the process of cutting a lot (2016) but if you can secure a job here, its a great place to be. "
good,"Worked independently."
good,"A typical day at work would require me to turn up an hour before the store opens, load up our email system, reply to emails sent from head office, and load in price changes, company stock, deliveries, things of that calibre."
good,"Love this company, just want something closer to home. Fun and challenging workplace. Team is awesome. Ready for a change."
good,I loved working at this job unfortunately times got bad husband got laid off and had to make a move but if the opportunity rised again I would love to work for them again.
good,"La división de Globa Sourcing ofrece la oportunidad de trabajar con gentes de diferentes culturas y backgrounds, proyectos con grupos cross-functionals. Me gustaron los retos de hacer crecer una región más dificil de sourcing y realizando compras en países que nuestros competidores no han identificado apoyando la estrategia de la compañia. Lo que mas me ha gustado fueron los retos y el aprendizaje."
good,"Focus on individual development, competitive, and challenging work environment. Large focus on sales growth, and gaining top talent within centralized locations."
good,"Contaba con una buena administracion, buenos jefes, buen ambiente laboral con los compañeros de trabajo realizaban campeonatos de futbol, realizaban paseos, fiesta fin de año para un a buena integracion como empresa"
good,"Grainger can be a fun and challenging place to work.  The culture can feel very high schoolish in that there are many clicks of people.  You can either gain a very good perception, or a very bad perception very quickly, and if a bad one is made, it can be very difficult to change the perception.  Grainger is a lot of who you know and not actually how well you do your job."
good,I worked counter sales and before that I worked in the DC warehouse as a picker and packer for the stores. I learned to use the SAP system and the RF guns for inventory control. Most of my co-workers where great they knew their jobs and where great help to me with mine. The hardest part of the job was keeping the showroom floor neat and stocked. I enjoyed the helping customers find the right parts and get a great price. Management was a good source of information and help.
good,Worked there for eight years. Benefits are great. Overtime offered a lot but was never mandatory.  Works hours with 2 shifts.
good,Grainger is a large company which lends itself to having multiple opportunities for individuals looking to further their career and learn new skills.
good,"the benefits and pay is better than most, it is a fast pace limited error business, they do take interest in any personal problem or situation that may effect your job performance, overall there is some good and bad as with any company"
good,The Company eliminated all Government Representatives. I left the Company before this took place.
good,"A typical day is processing, or putaway freight as it is unloaded. There is much room for advancement in this company.  The company promotes team work and excellent customer service to our downstream customers."
good,"Had the ability to work with one of the best at what they do in the Maintenance, Repair and Operation (MRO) Channel. Tremendous coaching and feedback was provided that allowed me to become the strong sales professional I am today."

good,"Fast paced environment"
good,It was a privilege to work along side dedicated fellow workers and accomplish all of our goals and be a part of a company that grew in leaps and bonds over the years I served. I cannot think of anything that was hard or not enjoyable about my time other than leaving.
good,"A typical day at work includes visiting 1-3 large customers a day. My accounts include large million dollar corporations selling value not product and provide the best solution to fit the customers needs. "
good,"Grainger has a ''WOW'' factor as a company, strong presence in the market, the experience was fantastic as a part of a growing company. The typical day working was based around the customer interaction, planning and solution solving to help the customer, the management was spotty, turn over and change, leaving gaps in training, communication and direction. working as an account manager the face to face with peers was seldom, however the little time with fellow co-workers was pleasant and encouraging most od the time. Some of the biggest challenges of the job was the disconnect with management and direction, closely related to the constant changes  and turnover. The joy of the job truly came from customer interaction and the ability to have flexible work schedule to help balance work and family."
good,"seguimiento a indicadores de gestion diario, acompañamineto fuerza de ventas,"
good,The work life balance is great at this company. I also have learned about about complnay policy and corporate culture .
good,"Go in a check in freight, put on pallets for OP driver to pick up and put-away. Management in some departments give their 100% to help team accomplish goal, while others tend to be passive. Co-workers are all very easy to work with. Trying to get a lead or manager to assist or provide tools to finish job is a challenge at times. Overall great benefits...and good people to work with...DC not recommended"
good,"It was always an interesting day, you never knew what a customer would call looking for,"
good,"Es una empresa con presencia a nivel internacional y catalogada como una de las 100 mejores empresas para trabajar en México, tienen prestaciones superiores a las de la ley para los colaboradores"
good,Solid performing company with a good work/life balance. Daily job includes account management and sales calls with customer site visits.
good,"enjoyed the almost 27 years I worked at Grainger.  Lots of good people, easy to manage work/life schedule."
good,"Very good company to work for. Good work/life balance, good benefits. I would recommend to this company."
good,I do believe this is a good company but with kids and grand kids I need more of a work life balance. There are a lot of times I am working till 9:00 at night and have no time with my family and looking to find something that will allow me to have more time with them
good,Really positive company that promotes and hires exceptional people.New ideas are welcome and the company is one big think tank of leaders
good,"Grainger is a Fortune 500 company for a reason.  It continues to invest in its future.  It's currently a very healthy company, growing at a rapid pace."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Grainger, it was the perfect job for me at the time. My particular job did not lend itself well to advancement which is why I decided to move on."
good,"Although a very sound organization, lack of local management"
good,Decent job compared to other warehouse jobs. Management did like for people to stay overtime. Coworker were easy to deal with. Hardest part of the job was the relocation to a different location. 
good,"great job but was laid off because of the economy. good company to work for. I handled shipping and receiving. customer service, counter sales, and warehouse duties."
good,"•	Service Agent"
good,"W. W. Grainger, Inc. is a Fortune 500 Industrial supply company. Offerings include motors, lighting, material-handling, fasteners, plumbing, tools, and safety supplies."
good,Training was a bit rushed but the staff were good and i loved the atmosphere
good,"great pay/benefits, relatively easy job except that you get business calls even if you are off the clock or on vacation and be prepared to cover your workload while on vacation instead of somebody else temporarily covering for you."
good,"Grainger is a conservative company that promotes and develops talent from within. There are fantastic opportunities in Supply Chain and Sales. Marketing is a bit more challenging at this organization. There have been great strides in the time that I've been there, but ultimately it does not have strong Marketing Leadership from the top. There are quite a few re-organizations in the Marketing areas which leads to job insecurity and not much opportunity for advancement."
good,"Typical day of work was hitting the essential selling time at 7:30am making sure I had adequate marketing materials and reviewed my call schedule. Made calls on customers selling over 900,000 products and services. My primary focus was the healthcare markets and Regional Advisory Council for emergency preparedness. I mastered the ability to build long lasting relationships that proved beneficial to both me and my customers. Management was very supportive being accessible and offering a broad product base."
good,Salesforce rules your day.  The focus put on the data entry of this tool keeps you from spending time face to face with customers.  Many seasoned account managers left due to the daily demands of Salesforce.  But in all Grainger is a great company to work for and highly respected in the MRO space.  Management is so covered up with reporting to truly be available for their team.
good,"Empresa solida, estable con buen portafolio de productos .Dificutad en la importación de mercancia y cumplimiento al cliente"
good,"Spend all day in front of a computer mainly helping customers place orders for supplies. They always celebrate employee birthdays and major holidays. They also have family celebrations (office trick-or-treating, etc). They are great with diversity and the LGBTQ+ community. Hardest part personally is staying motivated and energetic with the lack of personal interaction. They have great benefits and are willing to work with employees for health situations, etc."
good,Es una empresa socialemente responsable. Con mucha dedicacion y enfoque a satisfacer las necesidades los clientes. Con procesos que ayudan en gran manera a cumplir con la etica y la responsabilidad social.
good,"Visit glassdoor, yelp, and google to read what existing and former employees have to say in regards to working for Grainger. You will find a consistent theme."
good,"Grainger does a very nice job training new employees on processes and customer service basics. Once you get past that initial training period, there is good refresher training etc. Benefits start day 1, which is also a very nice perk."
good,"Great place to work, requires degree to advance. Reorganization happens a lot, great group of people. Competitive salaries and benefits. It can be difficult moving up in the company, having your managers support will go a long way!"
good,It is nice place to work in Grainger. Lot of support from all the team members not only from one department but from all the departments as well. Very supportive staff.
good,"Benefits were the best I've ever had. Customers were the most stressful part of the job as the were very demanding and is some cases extremely rude. Lower and middle management were very good. Upper I never saw or heard from and unfortunately put more emphasis on growing the web site and phone bank business and not the brick and mortar side, even though the brick and mortar side out preformed  the other two sides combined."
good,"The job included the typical customer service duties of answering incoming calls, making outbound calls, answering emails, placing orders, updating customers on order status, and researching any issues and finding resolutions. The hardest part of the job was due to being understaffed, and the most enjoyable aspect came from the relationships with co-workers and customers."
good,"The hours are flexible. Its about your family if you need to take off. The pay is good. Taking vacations is easy to work around. If you mess up, they will backstab you."
good,A typical day in the On-Site Service Representative role at Grainger starts with loading product at the local branch. The rest of the day is consumed with stocking VMI (vendor managed inventory) at all your stops as well as scanning (through an app) for product that needs to be delivered the following week. I learned a lot about planning routes and managing time in this role. Management was supportive and willing to help in any way necessary. The workplace culture was friendly and focused on productivity. The hardest part of the job was managing unexpected problems and still keeping to your daily schedule. Seeing customers happy that you had shown up on time with important products such as PPE (personal protective equipment) gave me the most enjoyment.
good,It was a great company with awesome benefits. I think the management needs more training on how to handle being in charge of people. And the hours needed to be better for those of us with a family who is active outside of the home.
good,This company was a great place to work for. I would recommend this company as a great company if ever asked about it. All the employees were great people and management was fair to all employees
good,The work was good it was Monday to Friday 630 to 5 pm. great wage for a employee of 2 years. i was a warehouse worker to start then worked my way up to in side sales position in just over 1 year. i would still be with the company if it was not for the fact that they closed almost 200 stores in 2 years. my store being 1 of them.
good,"Extremely fast-paced and demanding. Containers were expected to be unloaded between two to six hours. Containers often had boxes weighing anywhere between 7.5 to 150 pounds. Not consistent in which warehouse I would be working, and most of the time working alone."
good,Before Grainger relocate to Patterson from San Jose. Grainger was the greatest place to work. Its so engaged with each other even management team. Our pay raise quarterly. We have one year monetary reward.
good,"Great benefits package.  Profit sharing, 401 K, tuition reimbursement, medical and dental are amazing. I did not need vision so I am unsure of those benefits."
good,My time at Grainger was a very positive experience. I do wish the reorganization that is currently ongoing was handled better from a communication and support perspective.
good,"Pretty good work culture.  They do their best to make it a good work environment.  Pretty relaxed.  Casual all week, work from home one day a week.  It's a good company"
good,"Acklands-Grainger is a good place to work with great people to work with. I have been learning a new database which at times is difficult but getting easier the more I use it. Our management is good and fair with very good communication with the workers. A typical day is picking customer orders, shipping/receiving, loading/unloading trucks, stocking shelves and preparing orders to be taken by the outside sales reps. I would say the hardest part is still learning the new database."
good,"The people are great! The environment is a typical warehouse, hot during the summer and cool during the winter. The warehouse is organized and clean as much as possible. And there are measure in place to make all associates as comfortable as possible in a warehouse environment. However, the biggest disappointment is the ""politics"" of the management team when trying to achieve their goals.  Other than that, the company is a good company to work for, but the managers make it hard to work for the company."
good,This job was a physically demanding job as I was on my feet the whole day but the people were great to work with and the employee pricing benefits were fantastic.
good,"Very fast paced, challenging work environment. They have over a 4000 page catalog + website of products.  You learn something new everyday and have a broad knowledge of multiple products. You have a phone headset on and take one call after another all day."
good,Typical day is answering emails/ incoming calls. Management is mostly virtual.They are always available if any issues arise.  Calls are continuous. Co workers are always willing to assist with questions and any help needed. Taking care of the customers is a top priority and the part that I enjoyed the most. When you get a customer that says thanks for taking the time to help me is the best thing of the job.We sell to the same companies daily and you get the chance to get to know the customer and everyone seems a little like family.
good,"Fast paced and high pressure retail environment. Buying and selling new and used games, consoles, phones and gadgets."
good,the most valuable lesson I learned from my time with WW Grainger .  As long as you are dedicated to your customers they will stick with you.  Price is not always the most important factor in making a sale.  Customer service and be reliable is a value added incentive that most customer appreciate..
good,Good Management. Employees have worked here for decades. Very very structured. Best part of the job are the employees. Learned excellent customer service.
good,You also get pto and medical benefits from day 1 of employment . It can be difficult to work with some individuals but it balances out because you are kind of working on your own as opposed to a team setting.
good,"Grainger is a great company the work i do is very fast paced, and at times can be stressful. but the job itself is ok. keeping rate can be hard sometimes depending on what orders u have to pick."
good,Grainger is a great place to work at i love the culture and the tools they provide you in order to succeed. only thing i would change is that it seems my manager has a bit too much on his plate and i would like to be able to utilize him to help with my success.
good,"A typical day would be to run assigned route to stock customers areas. Scan for replenishment of stock and confer with areas buyer and purchaser. Correct any errors of wrong product, count, location etc. Will require lifting up to 75 lbs."
good,"Enjoyed working for the corporate functions within Supply Chain as well as the IT department.  The people are the best part of Grainger, they really care about each other."
good,"My daily responsibility was to build a relationship with my customer, learn their buying power to be able to assist them efficiently on what their needs are. The managers were promoted from within and once was an Account Manager so they knew what it took for us to be successful in our job. The biggest challenge was earning the customers trust but once you did they were very loyal to you and respected and appreciated the work you did for them. The joy was always being able to help the customer make their jobs easier."
good,"Grainger is a good place to work, it provides good compensation and benefit. The company  and its culture is evolving due to many recent organizational  changes."
good,"Grainger may not be as strong and loyal to its employees as it once was, it is still is a good company to work for. They have lost their focus on the customer in some ways. They are results driven company that provides an environment to develop into an experienced leader of strategic global direct and indirect purchasing, supply chain management, strategic sourcing or private label.  Benefits are very strong - not a good as it once was but still better than most that I have seen."
good,Good environment to work in but lacks career advancement opportunities. They are not as competitive for salary when comparing to other companies. It is an enjoyable place to work.
good,If you are a family person and are looking for low stress and time to be with your family then this is the ideal organization. Grainger does an excellent job of making you feel like you are a Grainger family member.
good,"If you don't mind putting up with a little red tape from management, leadership, and processes then Grainger can be a pretty good place to work.  The people are mostly great aside from a few lame ducks and while I didn't have a bad manager per say, none of them were really strong influences on my career.  The pay was pretty good, but getting things done and build personal goals here was difficult."
good,"Grainger is going through some growing pains and are constantly changing to meet the demands of the customers. This caused a mass movement of employees into different positionsand sometimes let go. If you have little to no ambition in career enhancement, it is a great place to work"
good,"A typical day at work is very customer facing.  Customer service is of top priority."
good,Grainger is a great company to work for. The biggest challenge is  to be competitive with pricing on items. Grainger prides itself on the customer experience and services.
good,Here the opportunities are what you make it. There are unlimited changes to learn and grow. They appreciate outside of the box thinking and allow you to genuinely help you customers.
good,the work enviroment is good    the sala ry is good and so are the benefits     gettng time off is a little frustrating sometimes the calander fills up pretty fast
good,Great place to work with great people. Interact with the public and provide solutions based on customer's needs. All around good job with decent pay.!
good,"The work place started out great but over time I have seen 5 different managers come and go, a good business aspect turn more towards a corporate like walmart.  As many as 38 good co-workers that have been with the company more than 2-15 years leave because of so many corporate like rules and regulations that were being made.  Not the kind of place they make it out to be.  They think since they pay you well they pretty much own you.  I've seen two senior VP's leave there, first one of 28 years they made him retire early, and his replacement from target leave after a year."
good,"If you highly enjoy moving fast and thinking while you are working, this place is for you.  Grainger does do a lot of cross training in order to best utilize all of it's employees with efficiency.  Some of the managers had a better than though attitude towards their employees, but your co-workers will rock and be part of a team."
good,Overall it was a good company to work for. But just like any other corporation things changed often from one day to the other. They would make decisions that were best for the company without thinking about the employees or without letting them know in advance.
good,"I worked there for over four years and really enjoyed my time there, especially the relationships that were established."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits, if you are a sales hunter and like to meet a lot of people, this company is for you."
good,"I've worked for Grainger in two different aspects, customer service, and supply chain. Overall I like the company, it has a lot of room for growth if its allowed."
good,"Awesome management, job security. Love the atmosphere. Advancement is slow moving and they are in the middle of a restructure now. The better you do, the bigger the goals."
good,This is a solid company to work for. A little to heavy in terms of Bureaucracy for my taste but if you don't mind playing the game - there is plenty of room for advancement.
good,"Company is great to work for. They do their best to give employees a health work/life balance. Their benefits are above average."
good,Great people to work with. Management is very supportive and they help you grow within the organization. Well stablished company 100% recommended
good,"Call on and deal with all customers, provide precise product info and best pricing to gain a solid relationship to drive sales. In my current role I look after large accounts;pricing,product info,suggestive selling with buyers to accurate follow up and constant communication to maintain accounts. Must be highly organized and be able to multitask! Focus on the company your dealing with, providing""GREAT"" customer service while ensuring you are placing your companies mission statement first and foremost..."
good,Great company to work for if you are interested in sales. A lot of training and opportunity to grow here. Job culture is very friendly but need to work hard!!!
good,"I had some terrific Managers that taught me a lot about what it takes to form a hardworking, motivated, successful team."
good,Allowed me to work from home. Great Salary and Benefits. If you do a good job they help you progress and promote from within.
good,"Grianger is a great company to work for and great benefits. Great People, competitive, They strive to be the best and provide the best customer service in a very timely manner."
good,"A typical day involves visiting customers, running an inventory management system for them, working on projects with them and up selling them."
good,"A typical day at work assist customers with any issue concerning their account, place orders, investigate orders, tracking packages, data entry, filing, mail distribution, take payments, training."
good,"Developed and implemented annual plans including specific strategies designed to accomplish organizational goals."
good,Great company to work for.  Management is fair and benefits are great.  Full timers never leave.  I've been part time for several years but nothing full time has ever became available. Transfers are rare.
good,"The company is a great place to work, people are friendly, they don't treat you like a number. Micro management does not happen, advancement available but limited."
good,I enjoyed this contract position very much. learned a lot about what I was lacking in terms of customer care and collections knowledge. very knowledgeable management were always willing to step up and show you what you felt you needed to learn and what they observed you needed as well.
good,"Grainger is overall a good place to work and they do pay you more then what a normal warehouse job would pay. Day to day work is very demanding but not overly stressful. I've learned a lot about how a distribution center operates. From Receiving to Shipping I've learned the process and how to monitor the flow, Identifying targeted trailers, Balancing the work load, and product availability. I have also learned the system, how to troubleshoot problems and keep up with daily trailer lists, to what freight needs to be replenished, etc. My co-workers are very friendly and everyone seems to get along. Of course you have those who do not pull their weight but overall my co-workers are great. The hardest part about my job is the demand of meeting your numbers and the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to multitask and get orders fulfilled for the customer and the pay I receive."
good,"we get the night started with a meeting about previous day, goals for the night. Then we take the time to stretch out before work to get body ready for our work night."
good,Great senior leadership with the ability to execute on a strategy.
good,Strong ongoing training support. Opportunity to travel once or twice a year. Compensation at the upper end of the scale.
good,"1) Communicate with Global suppliers  "
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Grainger! My coworkers and managers were the most down to earth people. The only negative I have to say is the unexpected layoffs and turn over rate of new hires. I recommend that upper management have a talk with account managers so they will be more considerate and respectful to call center agents."
good,"Good work-life balance, great people and management.  The best part of the job are my co-workers and directors.  Currently, we have an outstanding team, and it's a fun place to work."
good,good job just did not pay well at all so I left there seeking a job with the railroad
good,"Learn alot about business acumen. "
good,"Great place to work and lots of opportunities to advance.  Co-workers are all professional and outstanding"
good,"Within excellent company whilst working at the North Shields Branch of Grainger Games, every member of staff I met whilst there was just as helpful and friendly as the other. Within a small store working shifts with a lesser amount of co-workers helped boost workplace relationships with those around you. Overall a very nice place of work, like a lot of other known company names it does get busy waves and empty days but it is never anything too stressful to handle or a point where you are left to do nothing."
good,"Over 2 different stints with Grainger I found that it is "
good,One of the worlds largest industrial supply chains in the world. They take pride in making the customer #1. A very productive work environment with good people to work for and around.
good,"My position allowed me to work with all levels of management and peers.  Partner in the business A great teamwork environment.  Provided opportunities to own projects, be self-motivated and work with minimal supervision.  The challenge was to advance from my position."
good,I worked there for a number of years in multiple locations. I really enjoyed learning about what it took to be successful in the Industrial Distribution market. They have a great customer service network and are driven to be successful on every level.
good,"Muy buena empresa"
good,"Typical work day.  10-12 face to face sales call daily.  Each call is well calculated and planned.  I would typically 1-2 hours a day prospecting new customers.  Leverage CRM and pipeline to close business."
good,We work together to deliver the best customer experience.
good,"The company treats their employees well, but would rather hire from the outside than promote from within. HR is ran poorly, but the employees are great!"
good,A typical nine to five call center that asked a lot from its employees.
good,Smart and talented work force.
good,i enjoy the a.m. hours and getting home early. the teamwork and communication between co-workers made it more adaptable
good,"I worked there for 5 years, quit on good terms and then tried to go back. I was denied because the hiring managers did not like me personally. "
good,After working with Grainger for over a year I would have to say that it is a great company to work for! There is plenty of room for growth within. I would highly recommend this company.
good,If you get along with your coworkers you will have a good experience. keeping a good attitude with customers will allow you more success. knowledge of the product is key.
good,Team orientated and like most warehouse cultures. Very big on safety! Management is pretty unhelpful but easy vacation and sick day request. If you stay out of any drama you will be golden.
good,Buenos beneficios y el pago es muy bien.  Los clientes te llegan a conocer y tu a ellos
good,"Grainger is a great company to work for, I love there products and mission.  Management was not the best and very hard to move up in a short period of time."
good,My time with Grainger was outstanding.   I worked remotely for the last 5 of my 11 years with the company.   Great culture.   Very family orientated.  The only challenge was the amount of travel required as a Regional HR Manager.
good,"A lot of experience in the shop with co workers, always worked as a team. It was always a fun and great place to work. Enjoyed my time there very much."
good,"Pros: Benefits from day one, good mix between incoming calls and emails so that you don't get burned out taking non-stop calls, good choice of schedule and no weekends, great benefits package, mellow atmosphere. "
good,"If youre looking for counter work it's the best. The are only open 7-4:30pm, Monday to Friday, so if you need days it's perfect. Pays great for counter associates, which on average is low. Promotions or lateral movement can be either incredibly difficult, and take a very long time."
good,"Grainger provided me with benefits unlike I have had in any other job. Not only a full compliment of insurance and whatnot, but a very generous profit sharing plan, and also the opportunity to work from home (or other remote location), when I found it necessary to do so,"
good,"My typical day at WWG was packed and went quickly, training is excellent."
good,"Unfortunately they downsized and shipped the jobs south, but as an employer they were great and had an amazing culture.  The promoted from within and had a great policy on solving problems, getting teams together to brain storm a solution. Management was supportive."
good,Overall really great culture. They care about employees to a degree. Lots of weight is based on metrics they see as important to drive growth. The people are what make Grainger a great place to work!
good,"Grainger is a great place to work!  The workplace culture has been one where priority is given to work/life balance.  However, to achieve high goals, this balance is hard to obtain for me personally.  Success is usually charged with an even higher ""success tax!""  Customers love Grainger.  And, you will always love who you are sitting in a room with...they do a fantastic job of hiring quality individuals."
good,"Grainger is an excellent company & much more than a supplier. Grainger focuses on helping its customers with process improvements, time savings, total cost savings & allow customers to efficiently run their business"
good,Management easy to work with and for.  Customer service can be stressful at times. You have a variety of tasks to break up the day. Small team so you really need to rely on your co-workers. Teamwork is a must.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of answering phone calls, sending emails and working with employees to resolve errors in the system via phone, chat and email. I learned so much regarding SAP, Communicating to resolve issues and handling third party vendors. Management was amazing and easy to talk with. They also acknowledged and encouraged a job well done and offered promotions to people who deserved them. The hardest part of the job was making sure you have enough time in the day to accomplish all there was to do. There were so many assignments which allowed me to become great at multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people who were wiling to help and cooperate to get assignments done in a timely manner."
good,"Good company to work for but due to slow growth they are constantly looking for ways to cut costs..... what does that mean? It means a lack in career advancement. I was hired as OSA with the intent to be trained and eventually transition into an OSR, but right when that was going to happen, a hiring freeze occurred and I just couldn't afford to hang around as a part timer. Typical day for an OSA is visiting different accounts, collecting data, or performing keep stock (inventory and order support services) functions. You work by yourself making these stops using your own personal vehicle. You are reimbursed mileage accordingly as your movement is tracked with company issued cellular phone.  I cannot speak on workplace culture as you essentially are working by yourself. The hardest part of the job is that Grainger doesn't do a great job of training you, so you have to learn as you go daily often times not in the most ideal or appealing fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you don't have your boss physically there eyeballing your every movement."

good,"Grainger recently has experienced some significant changes at the top--as I write this the CEO has been in charge for about 24 months but he instigated a major reorg about 8 months ago. Morale has, of course, subsequently taken a major hit but it will recover sooner or later."

good,"I worked for Grainger for 20+ years and saw it lose the family-owned culture.  However, that change enabled it to become a $10B+ business.  It may not be the awesome place to work it was years ago, but it's still a great place to work with good leaders, lots of great opportunities, and lots of great people."
good,I would recommend Grainger to anyone looking for a warehouse job. Not a lot of opportunities for advancement into leadership or management rolls. Slow hiring process.
good,"I helped out my Uncle for the Inventory weekend twice so I have only actually worked here for 6 days, therefore I feel I can't actually provide the best input. But from those 6 days everyone was very friendly, lunch was supplied to us, and I felt for a kid who was just working a weekend I got paid fairly well."

good,Quick pace and competitive enviroment. One of the top fortune 500 companiesto be on a sales team. Very successful inside sales team  along with great leadership.
good,"As a part-time employee, flexibility was present with adequate compensation. Management treated employees well. I learned how to operate a forklift, complete orders, utilize software for productivity."
good,Grainger pays its employees well and works hard to keep them around. There is room for advancement but typically you must be willing to transfer to another branch.
good,"Good place but stumbling."
good,There is perfect balance between work and family. The managing staff here is awesome and also you get the felling of one team. Awesome place to work only thing is very less opportunity to become full time
good,"Job descriptions are clear, safety is supported by management, people did their jobs and still were pleasant to be around. OT was needed at times but not at excessive amounts."
good,Email me for information. this is private information  and would rather not share public without prior authorization from the organization. good place
good,"grainger has fantastic people working for this organization.  Highly educated and knowledgeable about the business.  great benefits, solid 401k and profit sharing options."
good,"I liked working for Grainger the company is great to work for. The work itself sucks. Routinely lift 75lbs like the description says but you also will be moving 125lbs +. Motors,  55 gallon drums etc... Everyone is usually too busy to help out. It doesnt really pay to be the fastest or most productive, just means you get more work. Supposed to be scanning at 130 seconds per but people routinely scan at 190-230 and arent disciplined, which means they complete less trailers. So at the end of the day even if your team has completed twice as much as a team that stands around and talks you have to go help them before you can leave. Never really know when youre getting off, managers add trucks to pad the numbers."
good,"Very please to be solution focused when helping customers find legacy parts and equipment.  Enjoy the challenge of creating a n opportunity to upsell, particularly with large $100K orders."
good,"La empresa es muy buena, solo que ya ha perdido el interes por su personal asi como el sentido humano por los mismos"

While on site, I manage my customers inventory and ensure that their needs have been met. I proactively build business and report among all of my customers. I work very closely with my manager, coworkers, and sales team members to assess leads and resolve any problems promptly. I especially enjoy working with my coworkers and sales team members on challenging projects."

Very strict on attendance. Fun, energetic people for the most part. Day will go by fast as long as you do not look that the clock. Very good management. They recognize hard work and your yearly raise will reflect that."
good,"early start ,over time was nice,benefits ok,salary ok,management ok,worked with good people.they were very safety minded"
good,"Grainger is a great company to work for as far as benefits, help with education costs, and competitive pay rates. However, the company has made some changes that have impact a lot of employees, more than a few negatively. Although, it great to work a straight 8 hour shift, most other positions at Grainger are more than 10 hour days and adding in some weekend days, just to keep up with all the work. This makes work and outside work life a bit tricky and difficult. If you don't mind the hours and enjoy having a 401K then Grainger is the place for you!"
good,I was fortunate to work under some great managers. They always encouraged us to do our best and were sensitive to our needs.
good,Grainger is a company with a lot of change that works hard to stay top of its industry while staying focused on our customers needs and solutions.

good,"Great place to work great staff"
good,A contract security outfit took over our former proprietary security force. It was great being a part of Grainger during the 8 1/2 years that I was there. Management was the best. And my team of fellow professional security personnel team members were second to none.

good,"Great job but sales goal were not aligned to territories. Most of District Sales manager were vested in your success.  However, upper management set unrealistic sales goals based on the market."
good,Everyday offers a new learning experience.  Boredom is not a factor. The current direct management team is very supportive.  Co-workers have been more like extended family members which creates a relaxed comfortable work environment. The hardest part of the job is knowing that it is being outsourced to another Country.  I have enjoyed almost every aspect of my position and am sad to lose it.

good,It was a wonderful 25 years of work experience.  The people are great.
good,"I have to give WWGrainger a pretty good review."
good,"Named Sales Account Manager that sold bulk industrial supplies to the entire chain of City of New York universities and colleges.  Everyday presented a different challenge but you had access to over 250,000 products to meet your customers needs which were easy to uncover.

good,Working in the branch is a easy job. Non stimulating for a young ambitious person.
good,"Grainger is a great place to work if you want to learn the MRO industry.  Coming from technical sales (printers/copiers/networking) was challenging, but it certainly demonstrated that sales is sales, it does not matter the product or solution being marketed, it all boils down to knowing your customers/clients and finding solutions to their needs.  The best part of the job were the customer-facing activities; learning about the contacts, what motivates them, what they like and don't like...all this leads to opportunities and sales!  The least favorite part of the job were the after-hours spent on quotes, pricing, reports, etc.  12-14 hour days plus a day during the weekend was getting to be tiresome.  The only other item to note was the lack of upward mobility.  During my tenure there I only saw 3 co-workers promoted up, everyone (8-9 individuals) else was brought in from the outside; this was demoralizing because many great sales reps left as a result of this practice."
good,"The national service center is always changing. The people are great to work with too. This company strives to provide excellent service to customers and provide a fun, energetic, and challenging place to work. The managers are engaged and supportive. One of the best places I worked so far!"
good,"Great company to work for with excellent team that really cares about one another. Great upper management that not only focuses on customer experience, but workplace culture and team member experience as well. Best company I've ever worked for. Only negative is they tend to hire from the outside rather than promote from within."
good,My present job profile is
good,"Everyday I enjoy going to work. My co-workers are fun and motivating people to work with. We are a team, working with Grainger, know that you are apart of a team who encourages you to grow professionally to succeed.

Would assign out special projects to team members or work with new team members to help them prepare for future positions.

good,"The managers here aren’t just role models but they are there to help when anything goes on in life. I my self have personally been able to connect with my managers about personal things in life that haven’t been held against me. They have helped me grow into one of the best reps in my department. Without their help I wouldn’t be where I am at right now. I was truly afraid to take the leap of faith of working at a call center, but I am honestly thankfully blessed for being given the opportunity to work for this company. They have helped me grow into my true self. They care about all of their employees and that’s what made me love this job more then any of the ones I have had in the past. Between the competitive atmosphere and the quick routes to promotion through hard work, this company has pushed me not to just stay competitive in the work atmosphere but live a better life style out side of work as well."
good,Grainger taught me so much and I am grateful for my experiences while I was there.  The culture was changing when I left and I have heard that it is not the same place and the opportunities to grow are limited.
good,Great work environment. Learned various applications. Able to work without supervision. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers.

good,"A very relaxed environment. Easy going workplace.  Site is relatively new, so we are all learning on the fly and trying to adapt to the many changes daily.  Management continues to provides updates through weekly huddle topics. That helps improve as a center and company.  The hardest part of the job would be not knowing all the products and having to explain to our Canadian customers over the phone or through email to better assist with their order or quote."
good,Overall this is a good company to work for.  They offer great training and opportunities to move up.  You can make good money once you exceed your goal.

good,"Great place to qork full time and part time "
good,"*Typical day involves servicing accounts."
good,A day at work is handling walk in customer from your employees who work for large corporations and have accounts with us to the on the go contractor who works for himself. Product knowledge is key in this job as we sell thousands of different items in multiple categories.
good,I enjoy working for GRainger and the only reason why I am leaving is because I'm moving and they do not have a strong presence where I am moving to. I drove to accounts every day and did not report to an office.
good,Was working for a micro manager who didn't know how to get off of the gas pedal when micro managing you like crazy.  Also giving bad reviews when time was there
good,"Pulled inventory from racks either manually or using automated equipment and hand-held devices."
good,Grainger was a great company to worth for. With addition to working with customers on day to day basis there are a lot of details that needed to be performed. The coworkers were great to work with and everyone enjoyed working together.
good,"If you highly enjoy moving fast and thinking while you are working, this place is for you. Grainger does do a lot of cross training in order to best utilize all of it's employees with efficiency. Some of the managers had a better than though attitude towards their employees, but your co-workers will rock and be part of a team."
good,"Good company, great work/life balance and strong vision & strategy deployment from C Suite.  Leadership in place is moving the company into the forefront of e-commerce & digital solutions for customers."

One day we can talk price, the next day inventory management solutions, the next how to keep people and facilities safe.  I enjoy the culture of my immediate team, we share information and best practices.  The hardest part of the job is probably I have had more passion with what I sold in other industries."
good,Me gusta el trabajo y las personas que trabajan ahí pero no hay suficiente para 40 horas
good,WWG was a team environment that encouraged your success and gave you an opportunity to be apart of your success. They had metrics that would allow you to see how you rate and then tools and additional resources to help you be successful.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job were the team members.  Hardest part of the job was change management.  Strong Senior Leadership.  Strong manager training programs.
good,Looking at each day at Grainger will not get you anywhere. You must look down the road at what you want to achieve at that company and grind every day in order to achieve that.
good,This job was very physical and kept me in great shape. I enjoyed the employees and I learned a lot. I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for something very fast paced.
good,"Shifts are set, and are primarily Monday through Friday between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. There are many opportunities for lateral and vertical moves within the company. PTO is very generous at 12 hours/month starting on day 1. Limited on-site amenities such as a cafe and a gym depending on the location."
good,It was a temp job. They were not hiring at the current time for full time employment. Management was helpful and able to ask questions. Great location

good,Wake up early and going to route projected. Take care of customers needs and plan for the accomplishments or barriers needed to take care of the customer for next week
good,Grainger was a good place to work.  You were pushed hard but paid accordingly.  I worked in a DC and there was never a dull moment.  Management did a good job of listening to the employees on improvements.
good,"Grainger can be a good company to work for minus the hours.  You start later in the morning and get off work in the late evening hours making it hard to manage and enjoy life during the week.  The compensation is very competitive however, which is why I chose to stay as long as did."
good,My time at Grainger was very good and regret that I had to leave the company but had to move over to Deland but I am back in Jacksonville looking for new opportunities

good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , se cuenta con el apoyo de las diferentes áreas para lograr una mejor efectividad con el cliente."
good,It was a fantastic experience overall. There were a lot of changes at the end of my time there which is why I left but it can be easy to succeed. Work hard and build the relationships with your customers. Absorb as much information as possible. Big brother is in your car. Management wants every little thing done eventhough it may waste time and reduce effectiveness in the field as well. pay could have been better but benefits were above the rest and experience at a company that many people recognize.
good,"Great place to work. Take calls for internal employees to help with computer systems connections, reset passwords and remote access to diagnose issues. Work culture is casual and professional environment. Great people as well."
good,"The motivation on calls every day were based on our three performance drivers. Make calls to expand contacts, safety conversations, red pass sign ups."
good,"Extremely flexible job servicing about 100 acounts. A lot of driving around but  they provide a gas and car. Work life balance is ideal. Rarely bringing work home, or answering emails after 6:00pm. Managers can be hit or miss, my current manager however is great, pushes me hard and wants me to succeed. Really enjoy the flexible schedule, rare to find. Benefits are great, car, laptop, gas paid, health benefits, etc."
good,"Very friendly people. Lots of pot lucks in the break rooms. Laid back atmosphere. Management is very helpful.  Call center, answering phone calls all day."
good,Productive & fast pace. The company was very secure. They took take of its employees & customers. They had good benefits & is a job you could retire off.
good,"I am a contractor however seems to have great benefits and a strong culture.  People seem to like to work here.  I work remote so I do't have as many interactions with others, which is fine"
good,Great place with great benefits. Benefits start from day one with great insurance plans. Great profit sharing and 401k. Get little rewards here and there like free t shirts or a free lunch.
good,Great training and work environment.  Motivating leadership willing to develop team players.  The company is very forward thinking from the top to the bottom.
good,Management really does it's best to help you thrive for success. Most branches have a great teamwork environment. Great benefits and there are chances to advance.

good,"They are family oriented and put the time in to train you correctly.  The pay is pretty good, but not much room for advancement."
good,everyones pretty much cool and friendly. Work its ok it can get hectic like any other job. The pay is good but you do start of as a part timer which sucks at first.
good,Very happy with my time at Grainger. Grainger is always looking to improve. The work life balance can be a little hard but better than other places I have been. The salary is a little low but great benefits. Management is great.

good,Fun working environment with great people. Was able to advance my career here and learn a great deal. Benefits have changed since I started but still a place worth working at.
good,"Great management"
good,Grainger is what you make of it. Grainger has been a developmental tool as far as the warehouse knowledge acquired. Over 10 years with the company and still learning new concepts. Started as a distribution associate and now tackling management endeavors.People are great and Grainger provides an activities committee which strengthens the culture at Grainger.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Similar to large organizations, Grainger moves pretty slow. This is nice when it comes to work life balance. The downside to this is you can get caught up with heavy politics and processes when trying to do impactful work. The people are generally smart and easy to work with which makes your day-to-day enjoyable. eCommerce is somewhat shielded from the extremely corporate / business professional atmosphere and is more laid back."
good,Grainger is a great company to work for. Ahead of the curve with personal advancements and continuous improvement. Supportive corporate culture.
good,third shift is the best to work have a defined start and stop time and a good place to work if you do your work and don't slack off

As well, individual employee contributions were recognized by upper management.  My manager made it fun to be at work by incorporating activities which promoted good camaraderie among team mates.  This made the daily challenges exciting and at the end day I felt good about my contribution to the company."
good,"Helping Customers by listening to their needs and placing them with the ideal product by using problem solving skills was a great part of my day. The team was collaborative, involved, and more like a family. The amount of learning is never ending. Everyday you are challenged with different products, and issues to resolve for the customer."
good,"Working with customers to troubleshoot problems they are having, asking the right questions to get the customer what they need, building and maintaining relationships with the customers and clients, reaching the core of a problem to build out what the customer or client needs, and working with multiple levels of grainger employees and management."

I learned that the more knowledge of products and over reaching service you give to the customer the higher the reward for all businesses involved. The technical analytical part of finding a solution to meet demands is by far the most challenging but also most enjoyable. The reward comes from Grainger's company profit sharing and human resource appreciation."

My management team was great, my peers were great, always willing to help.  Hardest part of my job was having to load or un-load trucks when needed, but enjoyable nontheless.

good,Grainger is a good work place with good people to work with and can be very enjoyable.  Your experience working in a branch solely rests on management.  The management at the Augusta branch is so bad that its mentally and physically demoralizing.

good,"En la empresa aprendí en que en la Revisión y el Análisis de las cosas que realizas esta el éxito, me costo un poco aprenderlo puesto que esta habilidad (análisis) no se aprende de un día a otro sino con el día a día, entendiendo que las cosas no se hacen por hacer sino que cada cosa que hagas o realices tenga un funcionamiento que ayude a que la empresa cumpla con sus objetivos. "
good,"Grainger is a good place to work, gives you the opportunity to earn some money and have some opportunities to grow, most of them centralized in the Headquarters."
good,Basically you find your grainger box and replenish anything you noticed was low on the last visit.  Very repetative and little room for advancement.  Overall not bad

good,Very fast paced with goal of finishing assigned tasks before leaving work. Co-workers are quiet but very task oriented. Managers and team leaders are a little more vocal but are at the same time devoted to making sure team members getting tasks done by the end of the work day. Hardest part is maintaining the energy and passion knowing that I don't face customers and see their reaction. Enjoyable part of the job is the workout I get and keeping myself in good physical condition.
good,"Management did not understand this type of business and was more equipped to manage a sales only type of business, not a service business."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Grainger. Having been gone for a year, I appreciate my time at Grainger even more. While Grainger is not free from the typical corporate politics, they are more muted than other places. Grainger's work/life balance is exceptional; managers (all the way through the top) truly care about the person behind the employee. Grainger may move a little slower than some organizations but I feel that they take the time to find as best a solution as possible even if all team members do not necessarily feel it is the ""right"" decision."
good,"I loved working there clock into work and clock out. I learned how to work as a team . For most part management was good,never had a problem with any of my bosses when I was working there.Co-workers were all pretty cool. Nothing was hard about that place."
good,It is a pleasure working with everyone at Grainger. I enjoy working with business owners and watching our partnership grow.
good,"8-5 Monday-Friday"
good,"I love working for Grainger, and It has allowed me a chance to gain first hand experience within an extensive supply chain. Grainger has improved my ability to communicate with internal and external customers. This has allowed me to garner profitable relationships with customers.  Management has given me the tools to succeed and helped me further my career in many ways."
good,"We would come in, have a meeting, stating how the day before went.  We would go to our stations and pack orders.  Our managers were caring and considerate of us.  They valued our working.  As most places, co-workers get along, some better than others, but we got along to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing when the day ended.  We knew what time we started, but we worked until we were done.  The most enjoyable part, would have to be part of the team and the relationships developed over the years."
good,"I am a large project account manager looking after a large oil sands producer, and several contractors on site, I have learned a lot about the industry everything from facility maintenance, procurement  to safety tendencies,"
good,"I worked for Grainger for almost 8 years in multiple different positions starting with an administrative assistant and ending working at the corporate offices as a part of sales leadership.

good,"Solid mangement, great training, lots of autonomy to get the job done right the first time."
good,"Love the open 24 hours customer service office, loved their advancement towards a more green environment, loved the fact they gave incentives to BE more green like preferred parking. But sadly was just a temp."
good,I was allowed to perform my job with little interference. The hardest part of the job was quitting because I moved out of state and the best part of the job was my customers.
good,There was plenty of opportunity for learning. Processes were always changing and learning to work with a variety of different groups and teams. The most enjoyable part the job for me was problem solving and accomplishing my tasks for the day. Hardest part of the job for me were the constant change in processes.
good,This company is a big business organization...
good,"La empresa como tal es excelente, el área de oportunidad está en los empleados que contrata."
good,"I had a decent time at this job. The building was new, most of the managers were helpful, and the networking opportunities were great. There was plenty of time to interact with higher-ups and get your name out there, along with opportunities to help with special projects."
good,Faced paced with room to grow. Good pay for this area and the culture is fairly relaxed. Good place to start a career in the warehouse industry. They know their stuff. Oh and no weekends. M-f.

good,Managed a large geographical area from New Haven Cuba and Downtown St Louis Mo. Responsible for customers supplies ordered through Grainger at designated areas assigned.
good,"I really like working at Grainger. I enjoy the people I work with, and the culture. My only concern is that Grainger is somewhat behind some of the tech leads nowadays, and the culture is very slow moving. Also, a lack of proper management is really hurting the company, especially in my team. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Grainger. I just wish they recognize good employees and helped them advance faster in their career rather than holding them back."
good,Our branch had a great atmosphere to work in. Everyone gets along great. We all work together well and it makes it easy for the employees who have kids and need a little flexibility.
good,"Worked front counter and waited on customers as they came thru the door. Also, pulled will call tickets and staged them for customer pick up. Pull tickets and ship out the back"
good,"With constant foot traffic there is a consistent work flow."
good,"I would travel to customer sites and check inventory, make the appropriate order and address any customer service issues.  The resource that is available is second to none.  I can call on team members, manager, and several phone support departments that are readily available."
good,Awesome workplace experience. goal driven results. only negative is they follow a one size fits all model which does not take into consideration local market conditions
good,"It was a great place to work. However when days where busy I felt like not only my energy was high but I definitely was working smarter than most. I felt like when work load was heavy there was too much talking and was either interfering with some not all peoples common sense always catching people doing stuff the long hard way not that it mattered but only mattered when it affected my work area and felt like people saw I was doing things a lot easier and smoother and felt that I was denied to be copied. I think everyone should learn positive things from eachother.  I did not have a ego I feel like some of the people had ego. Just cause one is new does not mean that they cant come up with a ideas or easier work techniques. I feel like when you at a work place you should copy someones work ethics  or atleast try to make your job easier. The way you layout your labels when products come down the belt for example if you know this store is always getting a lot of freight that label should be in a spot on the floor close to the belt to avoid long walking and long labor , so you lay it down close to the belt and with space. There were many things that could of been done to make job easier. Also when you stack your pallet heavy stuff on the bottom label your boxes correctle etc.  I was not taking the roll on with supervisors but did complain and was not being put with like minded etc. I eventually quit for family reasons moved out to California."
good,"Can be a great place to work. Company going through many changes so may be tricky to navigate. However, overall they compensate well, they are serious about growing, and you can find some cool people here."
good,Must be flexible and fast learner. Must be very comfortable with computers and knowledgeable. Answering phones for full shift and processing orders...
good,"Procesar ordenes de compra y enviar cotizaciones a los clientes."
good,"Good Company to work for , good local management.  Corporate visibility is poor and company going through a restructuring phase which makes advancement choices limited.  Overall a fun company with good benefits."
good,"In the location I was working it was huge is just that people are sometimes intimidating because seems that branch office all of them in a professional attire & seems really smart, just saying."
good,"My typical work day started at 7:30 am, jumping right in to receive the order and allocate the work that needed to be done that day.  Around 8, after the entire team was in the building, we would have our daily morning meetings, a chance to discus the previous days work and what needs to be done, usually over coffee that was provided to us for free. Then off to the races! Management was good and never really came to the warehouse to bother us. Co workers were all awesome and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was...keeping cool in the summertime. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment. Close nit team, everyone did they're job and wasn't afraid to ask if I or they needed help with something."
good,Fun work place with a lot of opportunity make more money and change within the job. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with and being able to work as a team and assist our customers.
good,I learned a lot while working at Grainger. I was able to learn every department within are branch. Loved working with my co-workers. The hardest part is the downsizing which hit are branch so there for I got laid off but I can not say I had a bad time while working there.
good,"if the company is not moving I am always would like to work with Acklands Grainger Inc until I am retirement or I can work longer after 65"
good,"In the time I have been at Grainger, I have been able to move myself into the position I now have. My day is busy and stimulating with the opoortunity to make decisions that make both my customer and the company happy. I work with a great group of people who help each other and care about what is going on with you. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything that you want to do done in the day. Taking care of the customer is the first priority and when you receive a call or an email, it needs to be taken care of immediately, which can move you time able around. The best part of the job has been all that I have learned from everyone that I have worked with."
good,"This was a small distribution/customer service branch.  I learned a lot about the commercial sales & distribution.  Our manager was great, he would work on whatever was needed at any time, a true team player.  Co-workers had a great attitude, always willing to help when needed. The hardest part of the job was to perform inventory at the end of the year, but it was a necessary evil and we all work hard and made it enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to deal with customer on a one to one basis."
good,"This is a fast moving environment and very demanding in expectations. But not impossible to be successfull by any means. Never a dull moment or a spare second. I learned far more than even I realize, and the high professionalism of Management will make sure of it. Co-workers are just as serious about there job at Grainger yet keep their positive and secure attitude. An excellent place to work."
good,"Great company, great benefits, a company you can retire from. Only negative is career advancement is very slow."
good,"Excellent Salary, Fast paced environment. "
good,"Muito boa empresa de se trabalhar, ótimo ambiente uma pena que fechou no Brasil."
good,"This is a place that takes the work they do very seriously, but the culture is very respectful of people's time and expertise.  They ask for more than can possibly be done, as is typical, but they do try to provide the materials and support to do the work."
good,"Great company to work for, but with a competitive job market the pay is on the low end. Great working culture that allows you to progress and develop."
good,"Starting to micro manage all sales employees, including Senior Sales Managers.  Profit sharing is almost gone vs. 21% two years ago.  Great team environment."
good,"Duties included: replenishing shelves and rotating stock, assisting customers with their enquiries cash handling and till duties."
good,Loved my boss. Best boss ever. Be prepared for excessive paperwork and reporting requirements. Grainger does really have everything under one roof.  Great value for the customer wanting a one-stop-shop.  Stressful internal environment....but what isn't these days.  I should've stayed!
good,"I worked for Acklands Grainger in the warehouse where i picked orders for delivery to our customers. The team i worked with was great, positive and helpful. The supervisors were nice to talk with and open door policy, which made it comfortable to be able to talk with them if needed. "
good,"A typical day at work was putting a way product. I always had a good lead person who knew their job well and helped with any problems arising during the day. A good job was always rewarded with dinners periodically and with gift cars with monetary value. I did have several process managers most were fired. They came from within the company with 10-15 years experience from small branches applying for a Distribution Center job. They averaged 2 yrs. or less. It is a high volume warehouse. Grainger, if you do not know is an excellent company to work for with customer service definitely the priority. My co-workers were a  high caliber of people. The pay and benefits were above average and it was reflected in the people who worked there and most staying many years employed by Grainger."
good,Management taught me many things on top of the biological and horticultural aspect of the job.
good,"A typical day at Grainger consists of helping genuine, hard working individuals get the parts they need to get their jobs done!  I learned that there are still honest, hardworking people out there trying to make a living and that, in general, Grainger has some of the best employees I have had the pleasure of working with.  The management left a little to be desired, as my Branch Manager stayed in her office 90% of the day and had very little interaction or influence on her team.  The hardest part of the job was learning their out dated computer system.  There are many areas there, where Grainger can improve.  The most enjoyable part of being a member of that team was the team itself.  I loved being around those guys and gals everyday.  The tenure at the branch I worked at was unbelievable.  There were 5 gentlemen on my team and three of them have been with Grainger for more than 25 years!"
good,"We are working with SAP SunOS 5.9. All work from billing, material organizing, right time delivery, payment followup with more than 100 partners."
good,"I enjoyed the one on one interaction which I was able to have with the customers, but disliked that I had to do the same thing each day. The first month was challenging as I had to learn the new computer systems, but after that I settled in and had a good handle on things. I would have greatly enjoyed if commission was made possible to me for the product I sold."
good,Grainger is a great company to work for. They offer great training and have an infinite support system to support you and your clients 24 hours a day. The networking potential within this organization is phenomenal.
good,Grainger was a great place to work good benefits and good pay but they were always telling me one thing and doing another and they were also non union company so they could do what ever they wanted to do with me
good,Very competitive environment. See resume for more details on this job
good,"bueno grainger es una empresa de una categoría muy buena."
good,Amazing company... great benefits and people. One of the top 100 companies to work Forbes.
good,Wonderful company to work for.  The commute was too far for me to drive once they moved to Roanoke from Arlington.  They really care about their employees.
good,"I left due to unreasonable ethics. I enjoyed getting to know the people and the products that I picked. The management how every is to be desired. I think if they can tell employees how to do the job, that they should actually be able to do the jobs themselves."
good,"el Ambiente es agradable, pero ando buscando crecimiento profesional, tanto como laboral."
good,"The pay and benefits for what you are tasked with performing as an hourly worker is incredibly high for the hourly employees. The work is simple, but the expectation for precise work is high and stressful. Normally that would be acceptable, but the training is poor and accountability policies are not consistently implemented. The management, at least at my facility, is weak. They are overburdened and under paid. The supervisor level, the first tier of salaried employees, are expected to put in at least 10 on-site hours per day for a starting salary of $55k, plus the potential for a yearly bonus. The receiving department has 90+ hourly staff, 75% newly hired within the last 2 years, with three supervisors to manage them."
good,"A typical day consists of answering phones back to back and performing tasks such as placing orders, finding invoices, changing billings, and setting up logistics. These calls are all different throughout the day and no one call is the same. Hardest part of the job is the non stop talking and the lack of allowing time between calls to finish up work we need to finish. Penalties for what should be applauded as customer service. Overall bad work environment."
good,"Open to new opportunities, position changes, bringing more opportunity.  Good people, continuous learning.  Team building and development experience.  Good culture."
good,"Great people, great environment, great benefits. Work environment was not fast paced, but consistent. Management staff qorks with you to ensure you get what you need to get your job done."

good,"Nice people to work with and safe environment. "
good,Competitive work environment; great culture - opportunity to improve and learn new skills. Great benefits all around. I would recommend this company to a friend
good,"I really enjoyed being an employee of the company. They were always behind everyone even if they struggled a little bit, with classes, side by sides and any other training materials they had for us. The training was very detailed and really made the day to day job easy to get the hang of. I really enjoyed the management and the atmosphere of the office."
good,"I oversee the day to day operations at the counter, warehouse, and office. I coach and develop my team members to make them leaders in their roles. Ensure that the team adhere to a safe work environment"
good,"Grainger was a great place to work. it was not this way all the time but I worked through it. I enjoyed the people I worked with, we were like family."
good,Customers were very kind when speaking to the employees. Learned how to locate specific items and products for customers. Also learned how to track orders as well.
good,Had a great time working with a great bunch of people. It was too bad that this one had to end the way that it did too. I made a lot of good friends here.
good,"Grainger has great benefits, especially vacation benefits. If employees are willing to learn, they offer great opportunities for personal and career growth."
good,"It was a great company to work with. I worked from 2004 to 2014. "

Basically, the policies state that if you call out more than 3 times in a year (with no other late arrivals) you can be terminated regardless of performance or tenure.  I left on good terms, but had to let several great employees go because of this policy."

good,Grainger does a wonderful job of adapting to the market and changing. Statistics do not accurately depict what happens in the field. Upper management doesn't stress honest feedback from the field as much as they should. Middle management is usually focused on their own career advancement more than the overall most beneficial feedback for senior management.

good,Corporate is TOO FAT and PAID too much and when they need to cut back they take it out of the branches or the fields. They want you to advance and take new jobs. Issue is they create new jobs and new titles and after a year or so they cut the position and you jumped for nothing...now your out of a job.

The management team was pretty much up and down. Never could establish any type of work relationship because they were being moved around so much. Working there with all the employees were fun. In the distribution center is was really easy to do your job but enjoy it as well do to the fact you weren't around customers. Some of the hardest things about the job was the pressure of management. Since they moved around so much, they would be put in departments that they weren't familiar with and would be very uneasy to be around yet still having to listen to their operative plans. Overall I loved my job! the environment was amazing and I couldn't wait to get to work everyday."

good,"As Territory Manager in West and Central Texas with no physical branch to support activities, I found this job required a high level  of energy and broad knowledge of both the large customer base and the extensive product offerings!  Despite the virtual office environment, I had the overwhelming support from every level in this organization and the plethora of key manufacturers identified as strategic to communicate the company's value position. This was an awesome opportunity and the culture at Grainger was fun!  I learned a tremendous amount about motors and tools and MRO products and customer loyalty and everything that is good about manufacturing in the US. I had the opportunity to work extensively with the military on an active bomber base locally and honored to deliver the same customer service to our airmen over seas. There was no ""typical"" day at the office and Grainger is a high quality company worthy of high caliber talent but unfortunately the pay at that time was less than desirable."

I wanted to work from home doing click to chat and was basically told that customer service reps are not important enough to allow to work from home. But if you are a tech no problem they will cater to your every need. I had a buddy who is a tech and worked here just a little bit longer than myself and within a couple of months they had him working remote because he decided he wanted to move across the country.

good,"As a Grainger Customer Service Agent, was responsible for assisting Customers with procuring necessary parts and equipment to assist them with their jobs.  When I took over the job of running the store on the Naval station, was responsible for repairing relationship with the Contractor managing the facility.  Primary responsibilities on a daily basis were to assist our Military personnel in procuring equipment, tools and other items required to perform their Daily duties as well as locating and obtaining scare/obsolete items required by the various Commands.  I also assisted our external Government Sales staff by providing leads, contact information as well as participating in Sales calls to the various Commands.  The people I worked with were good people, helpful and supportive.  My biggest challenge was familiarizing myself with the various Procurement channels surrounding the Military and helping to guide them to the best and most efficient solution.  The position on the Naval Base gave me a newfound respect for what our men and women sacrifice.  I got great satisfaction in knowing that what I was doing made a difference."

good,W.w.grainger is by far the best company I've ever worked for the only reason why I gave work-life and management for stars is only because of my Buffalo location.

good,"I started there 10 years ago and they offered me $14.35, so it was very good pay. At times it was slow, but when it's busy, it's hectic. My department was LTL, so I packaged orders and loaded them onto the truck with a pallet jack or forklift."
good,"I recently faced a cancer diagnosis. My manager and HR partner insured that I was fully aware of my options for short term disability and insurance coverage.

In Customer service we had support from all agents across the United States if our on site Manager was not available at that time.

good,"Just dial, there's frequent breaks, and the job is easy. The one tiny downside is that lunch tends to be clique-y so hope you're good at making friends quickly or you'll be eating alone and it will feel weirdly like high school. If you don't care about that than this might be the perfect job for you!"
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits and vacation. Became well versed in warehouse shipping/receiving/inventory, and customer service.  Work environment was diverse and engaging.  A typical day would find me waiting on customers in the morning and managing inventory/shipping/receiving in the afternoon.

good,una empresa muy comprometida.  con una cultura excelente.
good,"As empresas tem que se ajustar aos movimentos dos clientes e da dinâmica da forma de gestão das pessoas que fazem parte dasequipes internas. O mundo esta mudando muito rápido e o que se fazia não será mais o que será feito, pensando no resultado financeiro, de imagem que se quer chegar. Muitas empresas nãomais existirão se essa demanda não for habilmente trabalhada. O trabalho em si é uma dinâmica entre o que se precisa fazer e o que se poderia fazer. As medições e os fortes contratos por resultados (Bonus) de vez de estimular podem ter efeito contrário. Isso acaba sendo o ponto do sucesso ou insucesso da corporação, e a possível demanda dos colaboradores para outras empresas.A relação amigavel entre os pares e entre todos deve ser gerida e acompanhada através de estímulo e bom senso, prevendo que todos sabem que todos estão no mesmo barco e são importantes, porém com funções diferentes e salários diferentes. Grainger preve e faz questão de colocar isso desde o primeiro dia, sendo assim um boa empresa para se trabalhar."
good,"buena empresa para trabajar"

good,"Grainger was an incredible experience. With Grainger, I learned to go higher, wider, and deeper within an account. I worked with amazing, talented, vibrant people who are still close friends today. The most difficult thing about the position was accepting that I couldnt add new accounts-I had to work within the accounts I was given. I therefore changed my thinking, and each time I found a new 'customer[ within an existing account, I gave myself credit for hunting and finding new business. Grainger made it easy to sell the value baskiet as a whole, because what I was telling my customers I could deliver. Very pleasant!"
good,"A typical day at Grainger would be in the morning unloading the truck with a barcode scanner and dividing them up into the correct locations its says on the barcode scanner. Pick orders for customers and those orders consider orders that are being shipped the same day, orders being picked up that day, and orders that need to be delivered during the week. Also I would align shelves which means I used a barcode scanner to scan the item from one location and move it to a new location. Also helped customers who had a call in orders and deliver them their product. I've learned how to approach customers in a positive way. Loved working with my co workers they helped me to learn alot with what they are here for and gave me good advice on how things should be done. They most enjoyable part of my job was learning new skills that would help me in the future"

Hardest part of the job sitting all day in front of computer screen. Manager promote weekly  incentives for top sales  person. Great work place, but I prefer outside sales. Most enjoyable part of the job was finishing top sales for the week."
good,"Cutting edge company with flexible hours and telecommuting is not a problem. Customer focused with high expectations on quality, so it’s a fast paced environment. Single layer management model was great for myself, meaning that there were not any mid level management and each employee was given the opportunity to lead projects. This promoted an environment of equality among the technical staff. I did see a few unhappy employees, but they expected a paycheck not a job with responsibility. Those employees didn’t last and they probably didn’t belong in the consulting business. Great place to work!"
