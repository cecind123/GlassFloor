rating,review
bad,"Non-Competitive Pay, Poor Benefits, Terrible Outdated Facilities, Constant Meeting Culture, Very Slow Career Progression, Company is constantly changing over leadership resulting in a lot of restructuring, confusion and no job security."
bad,"upload financial files into numerous platform systems"
bad,"Pay is decent. Management is not, same with the E-level. Mission and values posted and not followed. Truth is not valued. Culture of me, not we. Good luck following the org chart. Oh, wait, it changed again."
bad,"Claims Director was self serving and not interested in a positive work environment. She was only interested in advancing those in her ""click""."
bad,Calculating daily inventory for claims department using excel spreadsheets. Special projects using and creating spreadsheets for statistics. Inputting claims demographics and running checks for processing and mass mailing.
bad,"Currently going through layoffs and forecasted financials are dismal  for this year.  Not the company it used to be.  Operating models have changed, and not for the better."
bad,"CUNA is a very ambitious company. They create decent products but lack distribution agreements and company support to distribute them effectively. Too often they have had the opportunity to stand out in the industry but decided to back away from the spotlight.. "
bad,"Can't say much about this place. It was one of the most depressing jobs I've ever had, and I've worked at Walmart."
bad,"Just stay away unless you are entry level and need the experience. One of the few white-collar IT workplaces in the country; e.g. glacial in pace and no sense of urgency. A difficult to get results, backbiting culture with a long-tenured, complacent workforce. If you are applying for a role requiring you to be a change agent (Information Security, Project Management, Quality Assurance) you will especially want to avoid this business and toxic work environment. Small-town politics and high school antics are commonplace."
bad,Very slow call volume and late night schedules.  Was sent home several times due to slow call volume.  Learned how to refer home loans and take applications for all  types of loans.
bad,"The company uses Six Sigma management tools which are not appropriate for the type of work being done. Many of the goals are not obtainable, and managers can subjectively downgrade performance regardless if the metrics are met. Quality Assurance sampling is insufficient and produces false ratios. No advancement possibilities, and transfers to other jobs within the company are very difficult to do."
bad,"I feel the work place culture is not professional enough. Heavy politics and closed minded. Very difficult to start there because most of them have been there for atleast 10+ years and I sense an entitlement mentality when it comes to sharing information."
bad,"Great group of people to work with; unfortunately, leadership lacks direction. Long and short term goals define by business leaders lack vision for staff or supporting teams to follow."
bad,"Benefits are good. Bright building, location is nice. In the center of the DFW area."
bad,"The job itself is easy enough, but the people there aren’t easy to deal with. Managers aren’t a good fit. All the drama, gossip, and backstabbing is ridiculous. The culture gets in the way of doing the job well."
bad,"The particular manager I had at CUNA Mutual Group did not put in the energy to make sure his direct reports were set up for success. I was put on a portfolio (my scope is project, not portfolio management) that was failing. I was given not only zero support from this manager, but he had placed my performance into the hands of an absent, unstable portfolio owner who supported my efforts in the beginning but became quite sour as I began to provide process improvement suggestions and resource augmentation requests."
bad,"In a sad turn of recent events, this once premier company is deteriorating in culture, ethics, and leadership.  It was once a great company to work for.  Lately it is profit hungry and treat employees as commodity items to be used at their expense.  They've lost the art of people leadership."
bad,"It kind of reminds one of Lost, the TV show. The longer you work the there the more you learn but you feel like you are still doing the same thing. It will enhance your knowledge of banks vs credit unions at least."
bad,the company was slow at adjusting to changes in processes and options available from my perspective as a sales rep. 
bad,Good place to work at and the area is good. Easy access to stores and restaurants. Atmosphere was good and always busy. Good hours and available parking.
bad,"aging workforce, difficult to communicate with upper management"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but the company is changing all the time. Most of the supervisors that were over me wasn't very effective when it came to organization. So, most of the time the managers were busy trying to hide their insecurities, instead of actually paying attention to details."
good,"As a mutual company, it is unfortunate how profit driven (annually) the Company is - it detracts from the Company's stated mission.  The Company seems continually to be in expense cutting mode.  But the people are pleasant and the Company is on a path to improve its diversity and inclusion."
good,"I worked in the Fort Worth Office and I this was arguably the best office to work for. The past 2 managers that I had were wonderful, but every other one before were very insecure and shut down ideas or others opinions. The company is top heavy as can be and will let go the actual workers to provide the great service and products our customers want and then complain about the drop off of productivity when new employees have to be trained."
good,Lots of fanfare for the long-term care insurance line during the recruiting and first month on the job. Economy took a hit and the product line fell out of favor. No longer a need for me a little while later and they're out of the product line the next month. Ouch.
good,A typical day at work would be helping customers over the phone all day. Its back to back calls. You are very much micromanaged. Tends to be a lot of drama that managers don't help diffuse. Its ok pay for a call center.
good,Not a bad company to work for. The position is dependent on referrals from VACU tellers and loan officers. No self promotion is allowed without VACU permission.
good,Great people to work with in every team and department. Provides opportunities for great work life balance no matter your lifestyle. Very active in the local community
good,"Employees were well taken care of, and the food was good.   Benefits were very generous."
good,"I respond to cold calls regarding the LOANLINER document product, and the associated compliance (consumer protection laws).  "
good,Developers design and develop which is great.  We also are responsible for unit and integration testing.  Could use a QA group after that which they did not have while I was there.   On-call (mainframe night) was a real drag on your week.  You were often up many time throughout the night and you are still expected to keep up with your assigned tasks for that week.  Many hours.
good,Good people trying to move forward but maintains attitudes and habits that are slow to change to the changing market.  Things are shifting but very slowly.
good,"Company had a great deal of reorgs. When one manager was laid off another picked up his/her team. Senior leadership did not mentor or coach lower managers even when asked for guidance or ideas. "
good,Decent place to work.  Benefits are okay and people are friendly.  There is definitely a corporate atmosphere in relation to the tiered management and how employees interact with each other according to the tiers.  I've always had flexible managers so I cannot complain.
good,"Great people work at CUNA Mutual. Some issues with agility and accountability. Lots of workforce changes in the last year, but these things go in cycles."
good,Go to work and get your job done.  The people that work there are the best.
good,enjoyed contact with clients and co workers were great. systems used there were very user friendly. great training.
good,"Learned a great deal and really enjoyed my job and my first manager, she was the best!"
good,This company focused on providing final expenses to those in need of life insurance for their peace of mind.  The company closed down its Fort Worth Office unfortunately.
good,"This is not a section I want to participate in not sure why it is required.   "
good,"CUNA Mutual continues to undergo extreme, continuous change as the insurance market becomes more and more competitive, and that's the root of the company's continued issues. Management has yet to identify a real working solution to address increasing competition and a shrinking credit union marketplace. I heard that it used to be a fantastic place to work with great employee benefits and loyalty. But employees fear for their jobs, and employee benefits erode as the company responds to market pressures with cost cutting measures and new business strategies every 3-5 years."
good,"Terrible advancement opportunities and contractors being deliberately withheld from certain benefits. For instance, if the office closes, everyone except you gets paid. If your team gets invited to lunch, you're not invited."
good,"Honestly I talked my way into a job I never had the experience or skill base to succeed having never trained people before in my career.  I think the company is fine, wasn't the right fit for me and I knew it fairly soon after I started."
good,"Jobs are dispensable.  Management talks a good line, but lacks the ability to prove it.  The best part of the job was helping customers address needs they had.  The most frustrating parts of the job were (1) not being given the tools necessary to be successful in the role; and (2) being required to meet numerous quality metrics despite their exclusion toward scoring a positive performance review."
good,"My daily tasks were rather mundane and repetitive.  It was a contract position and quite honestly, I don't recall much of the work that I completed.  I believe I would have enjoyed being a full-time employee with room to grow in a permanent position."
good,"at this job i mixed paint for customers, worked the front desk and rang people up, i also worked on paint and stain matches which was actually really fun."
good,My day as Data Entry / Administrator at CUNA Mutual was inputting data into there system from a insurance group that they had merger with.
good,Continued strategy changes and mixed message; business acceleration combined with steep expense cuts.  Upper management seems more interested in their personal agendas than employees.
good,Get to work at 7:30am begin morning meetings. Begin reconciliation of all my daily tasks for my billing department. Review call agent quality assurance calls. Assit Management when needed.
good,A day included enjoyable interaction with clients that built my relationship skills and improved my product application knowledge.
good,"The direction from the Executive level was unclear, and softly adhered to, especially in IT.  Performance is ""forced ranked', leading to negative competition, and those already established  always getting the top ranks.  The leadership never followed up on their vision...it was mostly just talked about."
good,This company was actually taking over while I worked there. Before it was a nice relaxed environment. But when CUNA came in it was a mess. They closed entire departments without career opportunities in other areas. I do believe that they were cleaning up the management which is a very good thing.
good,Very tough to advance within the company   I have had two roles I have been in that have been outsourced.   The actual environment is a great environment once you have a safe job
good,"CUNA Mutual Group provides a great learning platform for students looking for a sophomore year internship to get a feel of a real life work setting. However, things are very slow moving and career progression is minimal."
good,"Overall great company, great people. The atmosphere in the office is outstanding.  There is an onsite cafeteria, starbucks, etc.  Campus is well kept and enjoyable to be on.  Office is kept current."
good,Every single day in this position is very similar. Talk to individuals throughout the country and have an impact on their lives. Advancement in company seems very prominent but NOT with this position. Most enjoyable part of job is vacations and work/life balance. Every quarter it gets harder and harder to make more money.
good,"Manage direct marketing test and rollout kits, from data development to distribution"
good,Working here was a great learning experience. Working here provided me knowledge to grow within the company.  They also provide many resource and course to take to succeed within any job role.
good,The was a nice company to work for. I really enjoyed the work schedule because it was Monday thru Friday. I learned alot about credit unions and how to build my credit score. Also gained knowledge on getting different insurance packages when getting any types of loans. There was not much room for advancement at the company financially.
good,The company was undergoing a transition when I left.  I believe the new leadership will take them in a better direction.  They have streamlined themselves back into their core business of insurance.
good,"My co-workers are wonderful. The company is a great company as a whole. The contact center is not a difficult job it's just a high level of stress when dealing with the number of angry and upset clients. We are the front line contact point for most customers and when you can't see them and can only talk to them, they are more apt to let go with their anger because we are on the other end of the phone, not a ""real"" person. Keeping your composure and smiling helps the day go smoothly."
good,Okay place to have a stable job. Strong company recently; was not severely hurt during recession. Limited growth in Fort Worth. Lot of opportunity in Madison.
good,"I work with really good and knowledgeable people. Management can be poor at times but overall, I have enjoyed working here."
good,I enjoyed working for CUNA Mutual. I got the opportunity to be promoted twice and was fairly compemsated. At that time they created a wonderful work life balance for me.
good,"CUNA is state of the art with their tech equipment. The employees seem to be happy, and it has a friendly work environment with a relaxed atmosphere. There is no punching a time clock. I love that they use the ""Honor System."" You feel like an adult as there is no one ""watching over your shoulders"" all the time. Their training is done in a pleasant, patient, professional manner and the upper management seem to take the time to acknowledge you. I also liked the casual dress code, including the ability to wear jeans. Their cafeteria is large, well stocked and has packaged and fresh food made on the premises so you never have to leave to get a drink or a bite to eat. I was truly upset when they ran out of work for me to perform and I had to leave sooner than expected. I would love to go back. I absolutely would recommend CUNA as a great place to work. I am currently looking for a permanent position and hope one will open up soon at CUNA that suits my qualifications."
good,"Overall good company to work for, but sales goals are somewhat driven for the wrong reasons. Great team environment, advancement is hard.  If I lived closer I would continue to work there,"
good,It has been a good experience. The company has relaxed environment with excellent management. They always strive to look for new opportunities to build and scale the company.
good,"I worked on a temporary project designing and voicing e-learning products. The culture was relaxed but demanding. The project itself was a little understaffed and short on timeline, but not the worst I'd experienced in a corporate environment."
good,"CUNA Mutual is a very large company with a strong culture for rewarding results. I've had many opportunities for growth both within and outside my position. My department really does believe in training, and I've had many, many training opportunities. I've learned a lot about financial services, and overall the people are very motivated and collaborative. I've enjoyed my time there and recommend it to anyone seeking to experience the ""big, corporate"" experience."
good,"Strong family orientation with solid individuals with a ""can do"" attitude. Willing to smartly embrace technology to improve the company."
good,Direct Mail Marketing with a fast pace and tight deadlines. Comfortable working space. I work on a team of five hard-working people. The expectation is excellent and high quality work.
good,"	Conduct independent compliance testing for various banks and credit unions in domestic US. "
good,"This company has gone through a lot of changes for the years, but they continue to develop their vision and execute accordingly.  They are committed to their market place and have passion for the mission."
good,Learned how to read a credit report.  Dealing with upset customers was very hard.  Mixing with different age groups helped me understand and enjoy the younger generation.
good,I have had mixed experienced at CMG.  This has primarily been a result of inconsistent managers.  Work life balance was satisfactory
good,"A typical day involves multitasking to assist customers, both internal and external, with claims and questions. Flexibility and teamwork are a requirement, and the ability to work unsupervised with a high degree of motivation is essential.  The hardest part of the job is a lack of internal support from other departments and superiors.  The most enjoyable part is customer satisfaction."
good,I really enjoyed CUNA Mutual Group. The employees and managers were all good to work with. They support a diverse culture and way of doing business. Good company.
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. No one person or place is perfect but there is plenty of room for growth and development at this company.
good,"CMG is overall a great company to work for with many opportunities to grow your career. Management is supportive while some senior managers are on the completely opposite of that spectrum. Work life balance can be extremely difficult to maintain at times with unreasonable pressures placed on your shoulders. However, given the right opportunity with the right leader and team it can be a rewarding experience."
good,"Good company overall but just went through major consolidation and elimination of positions despite repeated record growth and profits over the past several years. Constant ""Do more with less"" mentality of management has over stressed and worked professional staff, causing talented employees to leave regularly for other companies."
good,In my time there I had 5 different managers.  Change is the norm.
good,"This position used many skills. Such as design skills, customer service skills, educational skills, marketing skills, product and office coordination skills, continuing computer skills, budget and bookkeeping skills. I was an effective employee because of understanding the corporation mission statement and financial goals."
good,"I enjoyed working there until they outsourced my job. If you can get on as a manger do it. Any thing else, may not make it. They offer a pension as well."
good,"This is an organization that thrived on numbers.  The work load was non-stop, so the days went by fast, but we were required to meet certain number guidelines, which proved to be stressful. ."
good,"High school internship was done at Cuna Mutual. During this period i conduct filing, preparing life premium for clients,etc."
good,"I worked at CUNA as a contractor in Operations, where I did electronic-forms development and knowledge management. The pay was not very good, and my workspace was tiny, but I enjoyed the work climate, fellow workers, and felt that my supervisor was positive, fair and open minded."
good,"I loved this environment it was all goo until they had lay-offs, i would happily work for this establishment again if the opportunity presents it's self."
good,Getting into work and stating the day quickly. There was not much time to mingle with co-workers as the deadlines had to be met by end of day.  Reconciling daily accounts for over 15 accounts as you also answer phones to help with customer complaints and/or help with their policy.  Enter payments and reversals by EOD so that when the system updates everything is in on time.
good,This was a great place to learn and grow within the Insurance Industry. Unfortunately there is no representation any longer within Australia following portfolio transfer.
good,"Great work environement, very proessional.  Trips for education and Fun.  They take  care of their employees, and go beyond what an employee might expect."
good,I had great supervisors and coworkers.  Met the goals set for me and training and coaching was great.  Overall great place to work.  Everyone worked hard to reach goals in a team environment.
good,I enjoy the work place immensity.  It is full of kind and very friendly staff who are willing to take the time to answer questions and help in any way possible.
good,"Good benefits, good pay. Supervisors are helpful and understanding.  Friendly place to work and a chance to excel in the company.  Paid time off, sick days, vacation time and maternity leave."
good,"Reviewing claims to determine retention date"
good,"Fast paced.  I learned to negotiate collateral protection insurance and different types of insurance coverage for various states.  The workplace culture was professional.  There was not a hard part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different Credit Unions from various states.  Also, I enjoyed traveling to different states."
good,Not a fun place to work. Everyone was frustrated with the slow approval process. Not many new projects were being initiated to promote the health of the company.
good,"•	Served as a liaison between the company, credit unions, and third parties to develop and maintain more complex billings.  Coordinated and provided technical assistance for setting up different medias and variations to accounts."
good,was a temp at this company didn't work here long enough to feel that i could get a review of this company.   Sorry that this couldn't be more helpful.
good,"To come in, greet customers, work on my duties, answer phone calls. I learned a lot of data entry & office work. The culture was good, Management was nice. My most enjoyable part of my job was all of it."
good,"Overall great company, great people. The atmosphere in the office is outstanding. There is an onsite cafeteria, Starbucks, etc. The campus is well kept and enjoyable to be on. The office is kept current"
good,"Overall good place to work. I had several opportunities and promotions during my time at CUNA. Unfortunately, they have eliminated several positions lately including the position I held."
good,"Traning is great, team concept.  Excellent benefits and incentives.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are allowed to work with little or no supervision as long as preformed up a high standard."
good,I found that CUNA Mutual Group truly displayed a great culture for its interns.  Everyone I met within the company was supportive and willing to help me in any way possible.  I found that I learned many necessary skills for the business world while my time interning at CUNA Mutual Group.
good,This was a very special job and had to get additional training to do it which was a benefit that helped not only myself but also the company.
good,I had a good experience and it helped me to grow in my carrier.
good,"Typical day at CUNA, I started by running all the reports I need to do for the balancing of the vouchers, balancing checks, and WebEFT balancing in the morning. I release the checks once balanced and OFAC is done. I run the outstanding voucher report and contact people about the vouchers.  Working on inputting invoices in the system all day. I also help the WebEFT team by entering in or changing products within the WebEFT system. I help out on the  phone calls all day. I balance the afternoon check run and release checks and I also balance WebEFT and release the file to the bank. When I first started with CUNA I was on the vendor side setting up new vendors, or making changes to current ones. Plus I worked on getting the 1099 ready and printed. I'm currently temping at CUNA and looking for a full time job."
good,Would reccomend to anyone. Benefits and pay are excellent.
good,"Made me feel welcome on the first day. At this particular job I often struggled to keep myself busy. I was contracted to assist with the programs and processes of testing Office 2010 Documents, but not many people came down to test. Decent pay, and would have been willing to stay with the company had a full time position been opened."
good,"Answering phones, correspondence, helping sales reps; shorthand, keyboarding, managing staff and assignments; learned to become efficient and one step ahead of the workload, enjoyed co-workers & helped them as requested and needed; hardest part of the job was, at times, trying to juggle the workload and keep everyone happy by accommodating their needs as efficiently and accurately as possible."
good,Really a quality employer with good people. Know their business well and are effectively working innovation into a bit of a stoic topic. Openning more each day to remote work arrangements.
good,"CUNA is a large institution that serves credit unions. I worked on the 401(k) deposits. The technology at the company was lagging behind. I was hired as a temp as they worked on a contract to update their technology. The people were excellent, welcoming me to the team with a ""treat day"". The job I worked should have been automated years ago, but poor understanding of technology and Union interference had left the company in a tough position."
good,It’s a good company I learned a lot from that client I learned many thing from project manager I thought of continuing with this company  we are unable to do .
good,"Assisted the CU members and employees with insurance products, I was the only employee there but saw CU employees as my co workers. My supervisor was in a different state was has weekly telephone meetings"
good,"Great leadership that balances employee resource with business needs very well.  Viability drives the company's success, but a focus on integrity and transparency."
good,This job was the most impressive when I started there.  As times changed there was many challenges.  I survived 20 plus years and worked very hard to make the transition of my job to others outside the area as smooth as possible.  The company has grown and changed drastically.
good,I would like to work for a company like Quna again. They are professional and take care of their employees.
good,"Overall great company, great people. The atmosphere in the office is outstanding. There is an onsite cafeteria, Starbucks, etc. The campus is well kept and enjoyable to be on. The office is kept current."
good,CUNA Mutual has been a good place to work after I graduated from college.  I have learned quite a bit during my time there and they have treated me very well.
good,It was call center work. took a lot of calls from credit union members across the country concerning life insurance. The company pays for you to become license in all fifty states.

good,Opportunity to become commercial property & casualty underwriter
good,"the first time I set foot on the campus of Cuna Mutual , I was introduced to one of the best experiences of my life. I have gained a lot of experience professional and social.

good,What I enjoyed most about the positions I held was the each day was different in the I never knew what our sales representatives would be asking for.  I really enjoyed working with the sales force because it was fast-paced and challenging.
good,A good company to work for that has strong core values and treats it's employees well. Specializes in providing products to Credit Unions and affiliates.
good,"technicians. Isolate and fix problems in malfunctioning equipment or software"
good,This was a typical customer service job and was very new to the area when I worked here. I was introduced to insurance and different plans here alone with filing claims. I enjoyed this work.
good,"•	Manage, Install patches and other software packages using YUM and RPM."
good,"The small credit unions have a close relationship with their customer base, so referrals from them were very strong.  Working out of the Credit Union League gave addition credence to my presence because the credit unions were closely tied to the credit union league."
good,"Its good to work here. A good team . Co-workers were very helpful."
good,A typical day at work was processing workers compensation Claims and Clerical duties.
good,"Good place to work - if you can get in directly full time you are set for life. As a contractor your options are limited. "

good,"My job hours were Monday through Friday with no weekends or overtime. We were required to work early and late shifts. Shifts were signed up for on a calendar on a first-come basis.

good,Organized planning
good,Everyone there is great to work with. It is a good company to get into especially since they give back to the community they are in. The job was easy to understand too.
good,Use multiple systems to process your daily work. Help support other departments meet their daily service level agreements.  Be flexible and willing to share ideas and process improvements to streamline outdated procedures.
good,I sold life insurance to all over the United States by phone.  Cuna Mutual did all the advertising and I would receive soft leads and incoming calls.  Excellent environment for work and good management.
good,Through CUNA Mutual I was able to work with many different departments to assist in standardizing procedures and reducing rework for employees. Management reviewed and worked well with their employees to improve productivity and the work environment.
good,Overall work culture is very professional with a mix of union and non-union employees.  This mix makes for a somewhat cutthroat environment.  Union contract provide increases no matter what effort is put forth.
good,"CUNA Mutual Group is consistently rated one of the best companies to work for in Madison for a reason.  They tend to choose the right people to hire, and great people make for a great work environment.  They truly offer exceptional work-life balance - an amazing company gym, underground parking, and ample benefits."
good,Best company I every worked for.  Wonderful manager and excellent training.  Best products in the industry.  Had the freedom to set my own schedule and support of manager and staff.

good,"I very much enjoyed my time developing software with the CUNA Mutual digital team. As an intern, I didn't know what to expect, but they quickly and efficiently integrated me into the team and had me working on full parts of their site in no time!"
good,"I loved working for CUNA Mutual until the top new management came in around 2005-2006 and made many changes that affected a lot of individuals.  CUNA Mutual was very generous with bonuses/pay raises.  My individual manager was excellent and I loved my work environment, which was a satellite office, away from the Madison location."
good,"My role as North East Regional Sales Manager required extensive travel to the tune of 2 to 3 days per week. The time was well worth it because I was able to spend valuable face time with both sales reps as well as credit union members. My overall function went beyond the scope of field training and included recruiting, motivation, product and structured sales training...and more."
good,CUNA is one of the very few insurance companies with a true mission. It is dedicated to supporting the credit union system. This focus provides a compass for decision making.
good,"The company was amazing to work for and I was able to thrive and be highly successful in my position.  Even though my job was ultimately eliminated, they treated me fairly and with great respect during the off boarding process."
