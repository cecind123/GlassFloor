rating,review
bad,"Atmos Energy was once a wonderful company to work for ,but throughout the years a lot of things changed. Taking calls and helping customers with their gas bills alwayswas a A+ for me. Just making sure you meet the customers needs and actually listen to the caller made things so much better. For the company they’re not at all family oriented and do not treat employees fair. Plus you have no sick days , so anytime you sis work it counts against you, does not matter the circumstance."
bad,"Not good at all "
bad,"Never again will I work for this company, They want robots not people, the work production requirements were constantly increased to be just out of reach."
bad,"Atmos Energy is a toxic working environment and I would not recommend this company to anyone. The management and workplace culture are not favorable unless you consistently ""kiss-up"" to the supervisors making the workplace unprofessional."
bad,"The company claims to have a positive culture, however the HR group doesn't follow this culture.  They often conduct ""witch hunts"" and actively works to intimidate others within the company in attempts to hold power over them."
bad,"The workplace culture was to ""Live Atmos Sprit"" which no one does. The Corsicana office is, was, and will forever be the worst place I've ever worked.  People are promised positions before they are posted. You don't get a chance when you apply for any postings because of the buddy system that is very strong. They already know who is going to replace the current supervisor before his position was posted. They only go through the motions of interviews to make it legal. You will never get any kind of true man to man appreciation for your work only a blanket appreciation. There is no true help from Construction to help read meters. They complain and slack off while they tell the Supervisor ""they"" got it done. If you try to say anything you are always wrong."
bad,A typical day at work was long and hard.  I learned to run very fast from dogs with big teeth.  I lost 38 pounds from all the running around I did.
bad,"1.Reads residential, commercial and industrial customers gas meters. Records dial readings for billing purposes."
bad,"The corporate culture is awesome and benefits are great.  As with anything, some departments follow the corporate culture and are excellently managed.  Others, not so much.  The income tax department was an awful experience.  Met some wonderful people in some of the other departments during United Way bingo but not worth working all night to meet a deadline without advance warning and the day in-day out stresses inherent with high turnover rates in a small department of a large corporation.  Either upper management is oblivious or they just don't care.  Either way, leaving was the best thing that every happened to me!"
bad,I was very excited to work for this company until I did. Management never has the answers to any questions. You are hired for one job but they make you do another. Job sucks
bad,"I was very miserable here. They do no work with your schedule at all, and they are not family oriented as they claim to be. I almost got fired for missing work due to a very complicated pregnancy and they could care less. You better hope you never get sick, your kids never get sick, you never have life throw you any curveballs, because this company will replace you like you were never even there. The turn over rate is high for a reason here. And the stress rate was even higher."
bad,"Everything they tell you when your 1st hired is an lie. Your just an number, I was pregnant with my daughter and when I went to the emergency room I thought I was going to loose her. They told me that they don't take doctor excuses."
bad,"I had been worked for Atmos Energy since 1993 after Lone Star Gas Co merged to Atmos Energy."
bad,"the company is changing for the worse.  used to be a family, now you are just a number.  if you are in with the right people, you can move up.  if not, no chance for advancement."
bad,"This company is backward-thinking and unwilling to embrace the technology of today. Necessary direction and supervision was lacking. Coworkers were unknowledgeable and insolent. Leadership was unintelligent, reactionary, and blockheaded."
bad,strict company to work for and may not be good for someone that is a single parent with young kids. focus on customers not employee oriented
bad,"Long hours, good money. Management expects you to figure everything out while they sit behind a computer and slack off. Expect no training because they will throw you out to the birds."
bad,"No room to move up, stuck as a meter reader for 3 years. Worked long hours and routes kept growing and when I asked for help they said to simply go faster."
bad,great place to work if have excellent customer service skills and can deal with different levels of personality - only some have good advancement.   does have good benefits -
bad,The department was unstable and management was poor. The leadership team was deceptive and not trust worthy. Bad communication in the department and no structure.
bad,"Not family oriented. Hours can run anywhere from 8-10 a day. Management is unjust and does not listen to employees, some management lack the skills to lead. Lectures are given over leadership but not followed through in the everyday process. Employees are very self oriented. Employee evaluations are not taken seriously. They closer you are to management the more likely you are to succeed. Not employee oriented. Skills needed are not properly taught to trainees."
bad,"This company is the worst place I've ever worked at, seriously. Management sucks, if you speak up for yourself and stand up to supervisors who don't like you because you don't kiss up to them daily, they'll have HR start a paper trail on you for termination."
bad,"This company runs off politics and BS! bottom line, if you don't kiss up or stand your ground when it comes to management you'll be harassed and picked on until you quit or they have enough BS on you to fire you."
bad,"The company was great when I started, but over the years room for advancement has dwindled because they are only promoting engineers and CPA's regardless of their experience."
bad,I was there 17 years and was accused of something that I did not do.  I had been there for 17 years and had only seen the management office once 11 years before and had not had any issues after that.  Atmos is famous for accusing people of doing things they don’t do and firing them the next day.
bad,"training and management are poor, if you are not one of the boys and like what they like then  will not fit in. you work very long hours with little to no appreciation"
bad,"We have had new supervisors start here and they are not great. They do not care if you have a family emergency. Promotions are based on the good ol boy system, if you work as a meter reader or service you are the slave of the company. They put the employees in dangerous situations, they tell you that jumping fences is not company policie but they also say you better get your reads at all cost."
bad,My experience with Atmos was there was not room for error.  The manager was not interested in participating in active on the job training and was not interested in helping me the employee improve.
bad,"I didn't enjoy working at Atmos, it was long hours in all types of weather."
good,"If you're working in the call center the one in Waco in particular you'll most likely have great people on your team.  For the most part all of the customer service reps are good people. HOWEVER that's where it stops. With the exception of a few most likely your supervisor is overbearing, shows favoritism or is only holding on just long enough to retire. If that's not the case your supervisor is really just a very untrustworthy person. Management is out of touch with what's really going. They try to implement changes they feel will help you however they don't do the job so they have no idea of what you actually go through with the customers. The pay is above average and the benefits are pretty good. There are perks like a Christmas bonus and 3 weeks paid time off but at times even that isn't enough to deal with the stress of the job. Then there are the irate customers that will belittle YOU because THEY didn't pay their bill. And all you can do is take it. If you have a high threshold for stress go for it"
good,Not much room to move up without knowing someone. Management tends to leave their people out to dry instead of defending them which is leading to people in our department seeking transfers to other jobs.
good,"Worked in 3 different locations during my time with the company.  Each varied greatly.  The call center could be challenging being tied to the phones.  Great flexibility in other departments.  "
good,"Answer in coming calls from customers concerning billing, new service, outages, moving service, and complaints against the company and technicians"
good,inbound calls on payments service orders very friendly also very strict but overall great place 
good,"No room for advancement. Be prepared to stay where your are placed. Old management will not move on .Very Friendly however. Not receptive to change. Government backed monopoly, they just want to maintain the status as is. "
good,"Worried about what the public thinks versus what the customer actually needs and employees need or benefits, Atmos more worried about Public Image, not more diverse more predominately hired white male/female"
good,There are issues happening inside this company with co workers trying to get rid of other hard working employees just because they are not part of their click or co worker group. Management and HR do nothing to correct this issue.
good,Atmos portrays a good culture but do not really LIVE the culture.  It has its pros and cons and I would recommend but I do not miss working there and the succession planning is not in complete order
good,"Once the change in management occured, it all went down hill. I liked it for the first few years but still seemed to be under paid and over worked compared to others."
good,Get monthly schedule and from their I plan how I am going to get the work done on time.
good,poor training and response repairs to  gas leaks. company would grade gas leaks then repair according to grade some leaks left for over 60 days. all leaks need repair much sooner
good,I enjoyed my  job at atmos energy.  The pay was consistent and the employees that I worked with were team players. Management was knowledgeable  and  we loved the job.
good,Okay to work for being it was a call center in Waco and the people in the call center were pretty ok to work with.  I got along with everybody except my supervisor from time to time cause he rode us too hard.  QA's couldn't stand em.
good,"I think the only down fall to the company is there is not any room for advancement in the Olathe office, Due to the headquarter is in Texas and the mangers really don't try and help people advance"
good,It is a good company to work for with good benefits. A typical workday was a normal 8 hour shift which included overtime at times.  The culture was relaxed at time.
good,This is a great company if you like being connected to a phone and desk all day. They do have the ergonomic desk so you can stand if you would like to. Very strict about calling in or taking unscheduled time
good,"•	Responsible for reading meters on assigned routes, documenting meter readings, reporting any tampering, safety hazards or damage of company property  "
good,a typical day at work consisted of alot of excersize from walking around neighborhood collecting the readings. Great job for someone who loves the outdoors
good,managment doesnt listen to workers and they suffer cause of it and get fired over it to
good,High paced call volume at this call center. It was a 24-hour call center when I worked there. It was high demand on the customer service representatives
good,Its was okay.and culture can be better   Management can be more understand of employee. Everybody culture is different. Job need understand a person and  appreciate a employee to
good,"The company shows great culture to the public, yet lacks clear communication and structure for staff. Long-term staff across the enterprise with a family-type mentality."
good,"Project Management is full of challenges daily. Managing personalities is the most challenging part of the job. However at Atmos Energy there is an implemented culture called ""Atmos Spirit"". The training teaches ways to better communicate mood, proper meeting etiquette, how to inspire trust in others and many other valuable behaviors which are useful at your home and office."
good,inbound call center for natural gas company. assisting customers with paying bill or moving/setting up new service.
good,Reading at least 500 hoses with gas meters five days a week. Hardest part is the dog problem there's always dogs trying to bite you.
good,"As one of the leading natural gas providers in south Louisiana, I was senior service tech for Atmos Energy. Here there is a lot of responsibility that comes with the service tech title. I’ll start off by explaining that being a service tech you are responsible for every underground Natural gas pipeline in our area which covers Houma, Bourg all the way to Belle Rose, La. Also I am a first responder in all emergency situations, which means that I handle all emergencies, must protect life and surroundings from danger and keep the emergency under control. I find and repair gas leaks on major pipelines and residential service lines when needed; therefore I work alongside large equipment at times and effective  with multiple hand tools. Being a service tech I work in all weather conditions while providing great customer service at all times. I attend monthly safety meetings to obtain any new information that might needed where safety is priority."
good,"Atmos is a large and profitable regulated gas utility that has grown through acquisitions over the last 3 decades, but has recently changed it's strategy to internal growth.  The company talks a great deal about it's culture, but personal coaching and feedback seems to be limited in many areas.  While it can be quite slow to progress your career there, Atmos is one of those companies you can work your whole career at and many do.  While the company has achieved dramatic growth and change over the last 20 years, there is still some very subtle and deep pockets of resistance to change."
good,Great culture and great co-workers. There are many company events and volunteer opportunites. Hiring from within could be better and those that are hired from within seem to because someone knew someone.. Many family members & friends hired.
good,"My day started assessing what I needed for meetings for my Upper Level Executives. I also checked all supplies to make sure we were fully stocked for the day/week. I greeted all employees in my area with a ""good morning"" and a smile. I had two desks as I supported two different departments this was the most challenging part of my days. It was difficult to stay organized and to feel as if I was a part of the organization. Otherwise, I truly enjoyed the staff and executives that I supported."
good,"This job is fast and demanding of knowledge and speed and heavy customer service but with practice it's all possible. As far as a working environment it's very calm, and between calls mostly free to do many things but it can be very busy and with minimum breaks."
good,"a typical day is you sit at you're desk and take in calls with you're best customer service some calls good some bad. People have questions , doubts , and need help ."
good,"This company has it good days and bad days but it does pay the bills, it has wonderful benefits and nice co workers. The hardest part of the job is the probably the management , its a little unfairness going on through out the company but long as you stay to yourself it is a good paying job."
good,Atmos energy is a great company with an amazing culture. Problem is not everyone in management should be in management. There are many benefits but one gets tired of not being able to move up.
good,I have feel that Atmos is a good company and offers great benefits. There is a high turn over because a lack of encouragement and appreciation by management. I worked there for 19 years and found that not everyone is given the opportunity for advancement even if they took time to get their degree. There is too much preferential treatment.
good,I had a great time working at Atmos. The only downfall was management was shady. I wouldn't put that against the company though. Bonuses and great opportunities to advance.
good,"Overall, the company is a great company to work for but the department I was working in was not concerned about the work at the end of the day in my opinion."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is being presented with the opportunity to meet new people who I can assist both internally and externally. I just enjoy helping others.
good,Spherion helped me find a job in less than a month. The ladies at the Waco location were great and very helpful. I would use them again if I ever needed help with finding a job
good,"Atmos is a good start company. Most people end up leaving because they don't pay a much as competitors. "
good,The challenge is what I loved most. My work was always changing according to what needed to be done and gave me the opportunity to learn and I always love to learn new things. Great people to work with and very personal environment.
good,"I didn't work here long but I it was a very nice place.  The  work areas were very roomy.  You could move around, stand or sit and still conduct your phone call."
good,At times I had to work 12 hours days but that was fine because it was more money. They paid awesome and were flexible with my days off.
good,"I learned how to provide great customer service to incoming callers. As well as learning how to read utility billing, creating orders for our technicians, and enhancing my data entry skills."
good,• Perform routine maintenance and repair work on gas meters
good,Working for the company is great. It is hard to promote to different positions within the company. You either have to know someone high up or be related to someone. The paid is ok but the location I work at is very busy so the work/life balance is out of the question.
good,"I really enjoyed my 2 years with Atmos Energy. The work of meter reader in Dallas Tx is fun if you enjoy being active. I had great exercise, got to be outside and for the most part left alone as long as I completed my routes. Management was great while I was there you felt as if they cared about you and truly wanted to"
good,The office was close to my home and the surrounding work area.  There are many different positions available and you may or may not be assigned to a specific crew
good,Very great company to work for. The superiors really know how to treat their employees.
good,"It really is a good company overall. Some places are better than others, but that's with any company. You get free uniforms and the personal protective gear is really good. They do strive for safety. Personnel, Public, and personal."
good,I worked there 22 yrs but if you make the wrong boss mad or upset with you your time no matter how much is limited they will find the littlest thing to get rid of you and a lot of times set you up
good,"it was an ok job, some of the managers were nice enough, too many two faced people work there, smile in your face and dont have your back. will let you take the fall"
good,"The hardest part of the job was the customer relationship. They would like you to be empathetic and personalize with the customers, but would be upset if the call lasted a long time."
good,I worked under an awesome customer service manager.  She prepared and had me trained to do my job well.  She was very fair and cared about me as a person and my family.
good,"I held a variety of positions from Customer Service Representative to Mail Room Supervisor  and then to Corporate Records Supervisor and finally Corporate Communications Coordinator. Most of the managers were helpful, cooperative and supportive to employees. I enjoyed with internal and external customers."
good,Atmos was a good place to  get some training and help you to get some money coming in. Definitely was not a place to  stay due to  the low pay. Good managers and working environment
good,Working at Atmos taught me a lot about myself with the training programs that are offered.  I grew individually and became more efficient in my career.
good,"Atmos is a well-led utility company with a strong history of success within its regulated environment.  The workforce is typically long-tenured, and as those people retire, there will be great opportunity for advancement and contribution.  Atmos Energy is very proud of its strong culture, and a person's alignment with the values of the culture is likely to enjoy working with similar like-minded people."
good,I learned how to deal with emergency situations and how to properly handle customers in those situations. I became hands on and was able to lead my co workers and show them the ins and outs of our job with as little stress as possible.
good,"Atmos Energy is a good place to work, great people. It is a flat organization, so moving up can be difficult, but there is a very easy going atmosphere. I would recommend Atmos to anyone who is wanting a great work life balance."
good,A typical day would have been installing gas service lines and repairing leaks.  I have learned a lot at my time with Atmos Energy.  Most of all how to improve my work skills and be a better leader.  Our management could use a little improving.  Mostly the political actions and attitudes.  I enjoyed every co worker that I worked with and have made some life long friends.
good,"Atmos Energy is a great company, with excellent benefits.  They are very involved with the community and reaching out to help others.  Atmos Energy promotes a great culture that can be used in personal and career life."
good,Everyday I got to all over my hometown or in the towns surrounding and learned the area very  well.  I did not really work that much with my management since I was mainly in the field all day.  My co workers were among the best people I have met so far.  I really enjoyed going to work everyday it was a good job only reason I left was to join the fire academy.
good,Treat you like family great for learning about natural energy
good,This is a good place to work. I liked it up to my last two years. I was singled out because of something that i thought was over long ago. I was made to feel like i didnt belong or did not earn the job like every one else. they told me i had the job because i was black and the only one there.
good,Some departments could use improvement in the management/leadership roles. However Atmos is a great company with multiple opportunities for advancement within the company.
good,"Atmos is a great place to work.  They develop thier employees, and many have promoted from entree level. I learned a lot about myself and how to treat others. The coulter was great.  They really do develop employees.  The hardest part of the job were the rotating shifts. the most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with."
good,Productive and challenging.  Experience and work ethic aren't always respected and appreciated.  Great employees and respected company. I would recommend friends to work for Atmos Energy.
good,This company is like a big brother.  Never leaves us hanging.  Always helping us and protecting our positions.  Providing so much knowledge.  Treating all employees for hard work.  Great place to work.
good,"I love Atmos Energy.  The culture and values are amazing.  When you get into a place that has awesome supportive management, I am sure it is great.  It saddens me to leave but I feel that when you work so hard to be the best, you get stuck and the advancement of your career suffers. I want to work for a company that appreciates your hard work and advances you because of it."
good,The culture at the company is very strong. The IT department has a limited number of resources for the amount of work that is processed for the company. Contracting and vendor support are essential for working through large software projects and integrations. The collaborative teams are a joy to work with and their is a sense of stability in the work environment.
good,"Atmos in it self is a great company to work for, although it can be very stress full and you are working in all types of bad working conditions. The pay is good."
good,The most enjoyable part of my day was utilizing all my years of customer service experience to help resolve both external and external customers needs.
good,I absolutely loved working for Atmos. Id recommend it to everyone seeking employment.  The callcenter was very family oriented. I learned a variety of csreer customer service skills and made life long friends whom i adore
good,"During my time with Atmos I was given great autonomy within the project.  Atmos truly believes that the person they hired is qualified and therefore they show that by giving a great amount of trust.  Atmos has everything I was looking for in a company, culture and communication."
good,"This was a call center and we serviced twelve different states for gas service. Also collected payments, set payment arrangements for past due accounts and scheduled new service for residential and commercial accounts."
good,"Provided time to give back to community via time off for FoodBank, Retirement community, Blood Drive, generous time off."
good,"Drive a route and act as a records keeper of the readings on meters "
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with office politics.
good,"The work/life balance is truly exceptional, rarely are schedules over loaded allowing for successful job completion."
good,Atmos was a wondeful place to work but you will get thrown under the bus if your manager is under pressure instead of being held to the standards of being a hard worker and understand that clerical errors happen in call center environment and can be fixed but as long as everything is going great your great but if you make a mistake even if good outweighs the bad you will suffer and feel as if your job is threaten supervisors need more training on teamwork and having the backs of their teammates so the security is there and they feel more appreciated even when things are tuff
good,"Great perks, breakfast, lunches, lots of community service that you get paid to do. People are great and nice. Management has your best interest but moving around in the company may be slow depending on which part you are in."
good,Great company that treats all employees like family. Very understandable and fair company. Pay was low and lack of areas to move up in within the company.
good,I was responsible mainly for reconciling and collecting outstanding accounts. I analyzed market trends and processed gas settlements. Deadlines were tight and accuracy was key.
good,"the work load can vary. Management and co-workers will be like most corporations. but, you can grow with this company. If you have the right attitude and work ethic."
good,"Hours are good and predictable, once you learn the routes it's pretty repetitive each month. Management is okay and the work environment as a whole is friendly. Good hours and job for someone with a family. Have to brave all weather!"
good,"I worked at a desk 8 hours a day, we had to be on the phone especially if we had calls holding. Sometimes it made it difficult to go to the bathroom when needed and then to go to breaks and lunches at the assigned time. If we did not log out right on time for lunch or break when we were supposed to it would count against us. Then when if we had pto hours and we had a doctor appointment or if my child was sick and there was no time available it would be an occurrence even if we have the time available. The hardest part was dealing with upset customers. the most enjoyable thing about the job was free food on occasion and benefit package."
good,"work in AR/AP"
good,"good job but very little salary compensation, "
good,good place to work if your in the right office as far as operations. Job advancement in operations is only good if you work in construction. Your not being shadowed while working.
good,"Great Company!!! Utility company with storage and compression department. With Great benefits, atmosphere, and people."
good,"Awesome company would love to work there permanently one day. The atmosphere is laid back, collaborative and supports a can do attitude."
good,It was great place to work and the people have a great attitude about work. I would recommend this company to anyone. I learned a lot abou GIS standards and procedures.
good,"There was always something going on, fundraisers, lunches, parties.  I loves working for the company and the people were great.  I just had to move on to bigger and better things by returning to school to become and RN."
good,"I had the honor of spending the last 21 years of my career with Atmos Energy and I would not have traded that time for the world.  If my husband and I did not need to come back home to be closer to family, I would remain with the organization until I retired."
good,Atmos Energy was a wonderful to work. I enjoyed going to work and I also enjoyed my coworkers. The company offered flex time which made it convenient.
good,"great place to work for, great employees, but the management could be better. great work ethics but some employees arent up for the team playing."
good,"This company is one of the best out there! They care about the people that work there, offered overtime and paid time off. There was always incentives for working a little longer than you shift. They had company gatherings, and team food days. They promoted good health by having a inside gym. The moral at this company was awesome."
good,great company to work for overall.  Great hours and they care about their employees.
good,My biggest complaint was the hours.  That and the angry callers calling in because their bill was too high.
good,Amos Energy was an ideal internship for me. I am an accounting major who mainly worked in their accounting department. But what I found to be truly helpful was my boss showed me more than just the accounting department. I got to see how different departments needed money and how the cashflows move among the company.
good,This is a great company to work for no issues with the company would recommend it to others.  Good culture and great environment to work and build your skills.
good,"Have not been here very long, but this place quickly felt like family. Coworkers and managers are all exceptionally friendly and courteous and the workflow is not excessive in pace or demand."
good,Great company with a great culture. Cares about the employee and promotes team values. High energy work place with flexible hours. Very good compensation which included annual bonus.
good,"Great culture, great management, open communication, friendly environment, inspire trust, positive attitude, focus on future, make a difference for the community."
good,"Great culture, great management, open communication, friendly environment, positive attitude, inspire trust, focus on future, make a difference for the community"
good,"company open door policy. family oriented, nice people, good management team, co-workers team players, hardest part timely projects, end of day , team help each other out,"
good,I go to work and check my emails and get ready for my assigned daily tasks. I have learned about safety awareness and gas knowledge with a construction background. Management is awesome and always willing to assist you. My co-workers work well together. The hardest part of my job getting use to others work ethics. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I participate on safety slogans I get recognition for a great slogan. I also promote safety within our culture.  
good,"Most of the supervisors were nice and helpful. My co-workers were great.  If you like a fast paced, fairly well paid job and like call centers this is a great place to work.  I understand that in their new facility they have desks that raise and lower so that you don't have to sit through your entire shift."
good,best company ive ever worked for treats you fair and pays ok now with the pay scale change would love to go back to work here
good,"check for gas leaks"
good,"Everyone loved their job, very fun place to work. Almost everyone there always did their work on time and did it the right way"
good,Great Company
good,I loved this company and intended to retire here.  It is a customer/employee focused company and they care greatly for both. My only issues were the work/life balance became a little skewed due to lack of employees and jobs being re-filled in our office.
good,"Overall a good place to work with great benefits."
good,"A typical work day would be providing excellent customer service to customers calling inbound.  I will process payments, setup new service, final service, and transfer service.  I will answer and report gas emergency calls.  For the inbound collection calls I will try to work with the customer to setup installment plans to avoid interruption of service.  I work on outbound calls as well calling customers advising of past due balances."
good,This was a great challenging work experience. I learned alot about custermer service/ customer satisfaction here. Things were always changing for the best and I always tried to stay ahead of the curve. 
good,A typical day at work is gonna be whatever you can make of yourself.
good,Atmos Energy is the largest independent natural gas utility provider in the United States.  I was responsible for governmental and public affairs across the company's eight state service area.
good,Loved working there - Awesome People!  The upper Management are all superb.  It was career heaven for the most part.  Lots of community activities and safety activities to keep everyone aware and alert.
good,"no tolerance  of being late or sick.  if you have the flu you better come in  and spread it around otherwise, it will account against you.  on the phone working with customer, for two hour take a 15 minute break back on the phones, for another 2 hours and lunch, after lunch back on the phone for two hours and break then back on the phone for 2 more hours.   Somedays there is training, team meetings or meetings with out supervisor. No overtime unless it has been approved prior .The  stress of this jobs comes in taking emergency orders,  You can not make a mistake, there are so many ways to make an error handling emergency orders. Lots of people, that have been there a long time get walked out. I am talking 17 to 26 years, how scary.  I was told, the people with this much experience  can't make an error on an emergency.  They  are considered ""Seasoned"". The best part is the customers,  Most are wonderful you get a few that have issues, but if you listen and try to help them most are thankful.  Atmos Energy does allow ways to help those that can not pay their bills."
good,Atmos definitely takes care of and rewards it's employees. Atmos culture and Atmos Spirit are the main focuses at Atmos.
good,"Atmos Energy is an inbound call-center and my job duties were to take calls and answer a variety of questions regarding gas services ranging from billing issues, new construction, and emergencies.  The environment was relaxed, professional, and productive. The hardest part of the job is to explain charges on a bill to an irate customer or explaining why services were interrupted due to a billing issue during the winter time."
good,"Great place to work at, loved the staff and the bonus' that the company offers are excellent! The pay was great, I learned the safety precautions about natural gas. The hardest part of the job was learning the system, and to do your job EXACTLY the way they wanted it! But overall I had a great experience!"
good,Telephone support then I moved to Desktop support fixing hardware ans software issues.

good,"A typical day at work begins with me checking my ""to-do"" calendar for any deadlines needing to be met. After completing my morning tasks of running reconciliation reports for different accounts, I focus on what's left to do for the month before closing. I've learned how to use different programs that were implemented to make the accounting process a bit easier and maneuverable while working with a number of different accounts. Management is excellent in being available for me and the other employees whenever a problem or issue is encountered, and while micro management is not exercised, deadlines are always met, and productivity continues to emerge to the next level. My co-workers are easy to work with, and are very helpful as the company embraces teamwork. The hardest part of my job is fighting the urge to get most of my assignments done for the month in one week! The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that it is not stressful at all."

The management for Atmos Energy was great. Each team had their own supervisor, even with our own the other supervisors still made it a point to make sure they were able to help you even if it didn't deal with their team. Even the managers of the whole call center made it a point to walk around and make sure everyone was happy. There were always events going on at the call center to keep the atmosphere happy and keep everyone smiling. Company picnics, food days, even small games during your lunch just to give you a small break. The managers would even grill for the entire call center. We had our own teams of about 8-14 employees per team. Even though you had your own team you were apart of you still had to do the work yourself per customer as they came to your phone. The co-workers were amazing. They made sure they would help in any way possible to benefit the company and everyone else. The job had its ups and downs. Loved how it was 90% of the time fast paced and there was always something to do. There was never a quiet moment while working for Atmos Energy."
