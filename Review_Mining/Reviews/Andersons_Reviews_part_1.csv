bad,Not a very great place to work. Was a buddy system company. And new favorites everyday. And not good management. Just a very syressful enviriment. Buddy system not fair treatment.
bad,"Claims to be a family orientated company until you have a family emergency, then itâ€™s the best of luck to you, management is a joke they use and abuse the people who actually will work and cater to the ones who stand around and do nothing all day long advancement opportunities are few and far between"
bad,"I used to love working for this company but no longer do after 10 years.  The culture shifted with the hire of a new CFO.  He has a strong type D personality.  Advancement within ""his"" organization is now unlikely as jobs aren't always posted for applicants to apply for, instead he appoints people to positions. Outside of accounting might still be ok."
good,"There isn't much room for advancement in the retail division of this company. It seems like you have to know someone personally to get ahead here. There's also not enough staffing, one person is being required to do the jobs of 4 people all while focusing on the customers needs and putting the customers first and then being reprimanded if they can not complete task in its entirety."
good,"Being laid off next week, closing our facility. Didn't really have much dealings with Andersons Inc. Might update this review once next week comes around."
good,Was a great local retail chain in the Toledo area but had to close down its operation in 2017. Grabbed a lot of business in the meantime but unfortunately displaced a lot of workers that had been with the company for decades.
good,i was responsible for making sure grain barges was clean and grain was acceptable from of bugs and pit area was clean and ran the belts that delieverd the grain out too the barges out on the river
good,A typical day here is you come in look at the cleaning chart and see what needs done that hasn't been done all week. You also have to stock each and every section and make sure its all nice and neat and straight. If someone wants a bed you have to fill out a bunch of paperwork and same goes for any living room furniture.
good,Overall good experience @ Andersons. Retail was the face of the company for many years. Now it is gone. It seems that family business feeling is gone.
good,"I liked the job, but the hours were bad. Only 7-28 hours available per week. Pay was low. Co- workers were awesome. Bosses were good.  The store would get so crowded sometimes and there wasn't much room to move around, but mostly it was good."
good,"The company is a good place to work. At the local level there is a lack of advancement opportunities. At the corporate level, opportunities are available if you are willing to move."
good,"my days were very busy as we did not have enough help. I learned a lot about customer service, bakery production and prep, safety in the workplace, inventory. My manager was awesome and always tried to keep a pleasant work environment despite the hectic pace. Everyone got along well and new their job. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to get everything done with the shortage of help. I enjoyed everyone I worked with  and the customers."
good,Andersons is a good company to work for unless you live in the Maumee and Toledo area of Ohio not much room to advance your career. Overall a good company.
good,"Balanced. Not a bad place to work. This is a commodity business so sometimes it gets a little uneasy, especially after the retail stores closed. Should have something to fall back on"
good,Working at the Andersons pelleted lime and gypsum facility was very fast paced and physically demanding. I enjoyed the work and customer relationships
good,Good company just looking at other opportunities to better my career and family. Great benefits and employees and upper management
good,It was a great place to work.  Very good growth opportunity to employees. Would recommend this firm to anyone and they will enjoy this opportunity. I'm thankful my time with them.
good,Indeed is best website in all job boards .We can search any requirements easily i am getting many requirements from indeed we can get many direct client requirements through indeed .
good,Very good job in the beginning but they have gone through a merge with another company and our hours and pay is all screwed up and I have lost alot of hours!
good,"Typically on a work day, you do not really have a moment to breath. It is a very fast pace place but it is a very fun place to be. I learned how to make ice cream and I also learned how to cook. Management    is very good and easy to work with. They are very excepting of any problems you may have and try and help as much as possible. The hardest part of the job, would be that you never really get a second to breath, but the best part is the laughs you share with your customers!"
good,"Most days I would start out looking at sales numbers.  I would formulate a plan for all of my employees so that the days tasks could be completed.  I would check inventory levels of product and complete an order if necessary.  I would have a quick conversation with the store manager about the department and any needs we may have.  I learned how to lead a department with many people and how to balance the many needs of the worker, the job requirements, and changing of the industry.  The workplace was family oriented.  The employees genuinely cared for one another and made it a unique experience.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the multiple personalities of all the employees under me. It takes patience and experience to create a department with many employees and have it run very smoothly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees.  They were all very good people and fun to work with."
good,"A typical day at the Anderson's is very fast paced.  I learned many different aspects of the job within a short amount of time.  The workplace culture, staff and employees are very respected and respectful."
good,I loved working for The Andersons.  I had planned to work for them until I retired.  It is a growing and successful company.  They truly cared for their employees and the employees cared for their company.  It provided challenges and growth opportunities.
good,"friendly people, atmosphere, good job and good benefits, easy work flexible hours."
good,Very good place to work. Very family oriented and friendly people to work around. Always had various task to do so it made the job not so repetitive for the most part.
good,"i would go in at 5:00 am-1:30pm do fertilizer audits on fertilizer lines till 10:30 am, start doing test proceeders until until 1:00pm take lunch"
good,Worked as a team in a fast past and competitive environment.Learned alot about the company and the products.The team was friendly and very helpful
good,"Great working experience.  The Managing partners were great to work for.   All employees I worked with were friendly, warm, and eager to assist another employee."
