rating,review
bad,Trash is poor they help u a little bit but don't tell anyone nothing when you ask questions about your work or what you suppose to  do they don't want you to be better than them
bad,"Great wages, decent work with tons of overtime. The bosses are terrible and care very little about you as a person. You can make a good amount of money working there but you have no life outside of that place."
bad,"Not a good place to work, no sick days, always forced over time and just not a good working relationship with management."
bad,"The positive reviews on here are a joke. This is a terrible place to work.  Management sucks.  All they do is lie to you.  The business is in the tank.  None of them know what they’re doing.  Top management sits around all day doing nothing.  Your work environment is going to be burning hot or freezing cold, extremely unsafe, and toxic.  Pays pretty well, and ok insurance but expensive."
bad,The management team had no clue how to do there jobs. Upper management just wanted numbers did not care about quality. Employees were just a number.
bad,"Don't do it! Put your application in somewhere else. The management here is a joke, and all they do is lie. They do not care about the employees at all. Overall ridiculous place to work!"
bad,"The new management team is a joke. Winchester is all about putting money in the upper managements pockets! They try to run the whole business from a keyboard. They would rather email than talk to u face to face.. no bonus! I worked in bullets.. very dirty!!! Lots of Lead, Greece, sweat an tears!! If you care about your work this place will stress you out! Run away if you have other options.."
bad,"If you don’t mind busting your hump while others sit in their truck and watch you... that is if they are not sleeping or watching videos on their phone. This is the place for you. However, if you have any self respect Stay away!"
bad,If it wasn't for the poor management i wouldn't be looking for another job. There is constant harassment and not much you can do about it. Other than that its a cool job.
bad,"I have never seen a worse managed workplace. It's getting worse and worse everyday. The management team consists of ""Yes Sir"" people, and former production workers who were injured. If you have a family, you will soon find that you will never see them. Olin could care less. You are their property. You cannot take a vacation day until you have been there for 10yrs. No sick days, or personal leave days. The Union is only good for the pay and benefits. Everything else, forget it. Olin owns them too. If you decide to get a job there, make sure you are single, with no kids or family to support. And, only set your life to 75% of the hourly rate you receive. That way, you don't get stuck. I have been there for 16yrs. I will be leaving there soon. I have already accepted a job offer elsewhere.  Most of the good employees are seeking employment elsewhere as well."
bad,Management is disrespectful. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor. 
bad,All Midland jobs were sent to Missouri. Poor management but great pay and benefits. Low morale. Never know if you'll have a job tomorrow. Alot of favorites by Management.
bad,"Terrible job culture and management. Great pay and benefits. If you need a job that pays, this is the job for you; however, expect to be miserable the moment you walk in the door."
bad,Needs new management.  Needs accountability for management.  Rules need to apply to everyone.  Employees morale tends to be negative and in general down all the time.
bad,"The shift bosses are mostly horrible people, treat a lot of the employees badly. It wouldn’t be a bad place to work if there were better shift bosses. A lot of the jobs are very strenuous and hard on body"
bad,"Olin Corporation upper management did not care about their hourly workers in my opinion. After 100+ years in East Alton,IL. they went and negotiated a deal to move to Oxford,Mississippi then came to us and offered to stay until 2018 if we took a wage freeze with no chance for long=term employment beyond that."
bad,"With the buyout Olin performed, taking a lot of Dow's chlorine production, they guaranteed their spot as a global leader in 4- 5 markets. A company with that current standing however, should back up their title by compensating their employees(the people who are the boots on the ground.) "
bad,"The pay is pretty good, as are the benefits.  Don't expect to get any vacation time.  Forced overtime is far too common.  Management/Forman don't care about employees and are willing to overlook safety issues just to make production numbers."
bad,"forced overtime heavily but are compensated for it good, upper management is in the cut employees mode, they moved a lot of Winchester Ammunition to Oxford Mississippi and much more leaving from East Alton Illinois,"
bad,"Olin compensates its workers pretty well, but work there involves mandatory overtime, with a ""force for eight hour"" policy.  Saturday work can be posted before you leave work on Friday, ruining your weekend.  Vacation days are not available to take for employees less than ten years."
bad,Good compensation but workers earn it. Chance for advancement slim unless you have relations in an important position or are friends with management. Union protocol circumvented on a daily basis to advance company agenda.
bad,"At one time this was the largest employer in the area and it was considered a very good job, but in the last 10 to 15 years lay-offs decimated the work force and the management was bad, slave drivers is the term that was put to me, I'm glad i was laid off from there. I have no problem working my tail off but this place starting going down hill in the late 80's and early 90's, by the time I was hired they were moving departments to different states and shutting down other departments all together. I was temporary help to begin with so I knew I was to be laid-off eventually but wasn't sure how long and they didn't let me know until the day of."
bad,"My job was just ok. As long as I maintained my work ethics I was content. The pay was good, but the managers were not. My coworkers were the best thing about this job. I learned so much from this group of individuals."
bad,this could be a great company to work for if the management in the department I worked in actually cared about the employees instead of numbers and placing blame any where they can other than themselves.
bad,Olin Mcintosh has no diversity in top management positions and job promotions are limited with no regards to education. Only a few hand chosen candidates without degrees are selected over those with degrees. Stressful !!!
bad,"Pros - Good work life management, EH&S is a top priority, balanced culture. "
good,I really enjoyed my time with the company. I  reinjured and old injury and was forced to stop working. I was first given light duty work and then I was told I could only continue to be employed if I got this taken care of
good,"not the best place to have a career. The staff is cut throat, the facility is dangerous and has many safety hazards all in the plant. Management just keeps putting off repairs and keeping the plant at full steam ahead without thinking of safety of the employees."
good,"Most of Co workers were good people you could be in clock out line and they would tell you ,you have to stay for another 8 hr if you refused it was 10 days off no pay weekends for the most part didn't happen for the floor people overtime was massive"
good,company does not care for the people working there. lots of over time. co workers are good people. willing to teach you how to do the job.
good,Horrible place to work if you have a family or a life.The lowest seniority person works all the mandatory overtime.The working conditions are nasty.The hardest part is the mandatory overtime.Working a double every other day takes a toll on the body.The swing shifts makes it even more difficult to cope with because the body does not get to adjust to a routine.There are 3 shifts Morning 8-4  Evenings 4-12 Midnight 12am - 8.The shifts rotate every week
good,"Between the rotating shift work and frequent forced overtime it is imposable to have a family life. Since the company is moving they refuse to make repairs to essential equipment and buildings. To management you are just a body to fill a spot on the floor. They ignore the achievements and progress you have made, but come down hard on you for the mistakes you make. You see lots of favoritism. The co-workers for the most part were okay but you have to watch your back. The hardest part of the job is dealing with trying to have a family life. The only enjoyable part of the job is payday."
good,"People who work there don't care about their job, they care about getting paid. Rarely making quota and always tired and complaining everyday. Supervisors are too friendly with the workers so a lot of work doesn't get done as it should be. People be in the restrooms using their cellphones on breaks.. No one cares...!"
good,Typical factory work envorment with forced overtime. Company moving to Mississippi.
good,"For the work you did, the pay was very good. The flip side to that was you rarely had time to be with your family.Forced overtime ,six days a week made sure of that. From the CEO down to management is was awful. You were treated more like a number than a person."
good,This company does not care about the people who work there. they are laying people off to move down south.
good,"It was a good place to work until global domination set in. Good pay, good benefits.  Not an ideal work shift, but decent time off included in the difficult schedule."
good,This company has potential to be great.  The leadership roles are occupied by employees who are not properly trained or qualified for the roles.  The jobs are appointed and credentials are irrelevant.
good,"The Oxford plant didn't give me a hiring interview with a specialist from my department and offered little knowledge of what was going on. I felt I was picked off the street. The job was a lot different from what I had expected. The workers were in fear of messing up and the coordinator seemed insecure. Everybody (mostly) was nice. They didn't implement well documented training procedures, mostly word of mouth and they didn't seem to like me taking notes. The firing range portals were designed for short people. They are not open for suggestions. Nobody was an expert. Break time was taken when work lumps permitted. Small break room and a picknic table outside. The place will be a circus in full swing.."
good,I enjoyed working with the people. Learning a new job. Upset the company relocated. I would have stayed with the company til retirement if it we're possible.
good,this is a good job if you have no life outside of work. the management are good people but the supply and demand has workers working every weekend. Also the rounds of ammunition going off threw out a shift leave you nervous. the pay in benefits are good though and overtime is forced so money is good.
good,moja praca polegała na obsłudze klientow przyjmowaniu towarow .raczej nie mozna bylo rozwsinac skrzydel w tej firmie.wszystko byloby okgdyby nie kierowniczka ktora nie potrafila docenic prace swoich pracownikow.kolezanki z ktorymi pracowalam na sklepie byly ok nawet z jedna sie zaprzyjaznilam nie byla to ciezka praca jezeli lubi sie kontakt z ludzmi
good,"Olin is getting ready to move to Oxford, MS people are getting laid-off by the dozens. The work load is extreme right now - there are not enough people in each department."
good,"Olin shouldn't be a bad place to work. However, the lack of management and poor communication places unnecessary stress on their employees. I enjoy the people I work with, my actual job is okay, but I wish the company had more structure."
good,"it was an okay job just needs better supervisors, I worked there a long time before I had any problems, they have a bad point system and vacation time policy"
good,start day with turnover on plant conditions take readings pull samples make adjustments per readings and samples prepare equipment LOTO for maint. to work on
good,A fast paced job in a well managed work place it was a simple job but had some dangerous factors. it has a lot of good employees and had great benefits the hardest part was the shift work.
good,"Pay is good, work isn't bad, lots of overtime. They are moving down south so there has been downsizing at this location."
good,"easy work, long days, shift work, dont know how long the company will actually be there."
good,"Building and troubleshooting electrical single phase and three phase circuits. Co-workers make the time past quickly and the help they offer is always welcome. Trying to find parts and prints can be very hard. When you fix the problem that has been a real pain,is very good feeling."
good,"Olin's expansion through acquistion has caused strains on the infrastructure and focus."
good,"Get team effort, great camaraderie.  Corporate perks - hard work is appreciated.  Managers are fair.  Fun work environment  Daily challenged, the days fly by"
good,"Worked there 30 years, and intended on retiring from this company . The CEO and Board of Directors sold off the division I worked for with no advance warning resulting in my job being eliminated."
good,It's a ok place to work if you don't have a family. Cause you will not spend no time with them. They force ovetime on you. The manger talk down to you.
good,olin good place too work is just long hrs somedays u dont get too see your family much because u work so much and u cant plain anything with your familys because of the hrs u work
good,"Meet wonderful people. The job was very demanding.  The company could use help in the HR department. The insurance, vision, dental and pension funds could also be improved."
good,"Shift work, good pay, good insurance. I drove a fork lift and ran a shear machine. Management was ok to work with but sometimes I think their decisions were unfair. I got along with most of my co-workers."
good,This job is great if you don't mind working swing shift and forced overtime.  The pay and benefits are awesome.  The problem is that you work swing shift so you soon become an insomniac after working there.  They also force overtime and if you refuse they walk you out for a 10 day suspension.  Sometimes there will be little if any overtime and sometimes it will be every day.  It is not uncommon to work 24 hours of overtime in a week.  Also you don't get any sick time and only just did they start allowing you to use your vacation time as you need it.  Before the most recent contract you had to use your vacation time to get paid during shut down times in July and November/December.  You don't earn vacation for the first 2 years then in is after 5 years that you have enough to cover both shut down periods.  You will be forced to work 6 days a week.  My department worked a monday thru friday week and had months of working every saturday.  So if you value time with your family it is a very hard job to live with.  Like I said the money is great and the health insurance is pretty good but the trade off is rampant insomnia and burn out!
good,"this is and okay job, it just depends on what shift, building, and position that you work at, but the money and benefits are great"
good,"went to work never knowing if you were going to have to do a double at the last minute.  hard work, factory, inspecting parts and running machines"
good,Swing shift and mandatory overtime and weekend shifts make having time with family extremely difficult.  Swing shift also plays havoc on your sleep habits and health.  The job itself is great and the pay can't be beat.
good,You go in check your job placement. I learned assembly line work.Management is horrible and plays favorites extremely bad. Co workers are grouchy and very gossipy. It was hot and dirty. Best part of the day was leaving.
good,Enjoyed working here and learning new things about the old school machines. Was able to get alone with all co-workers. The hardest things was the drive 6 days a week.
good,Union environment with a lot of departments. The insurance and benefits package was very good.
good,fast paced . co-workers are good to work with . hardest part of the day is getting forced over
good,I learned how to work at a fast pace at Olin. I also learned that team work is a very important thing to get the job done at times. Most enjoyable part has to be that I had amazing hours and made very good money.
good,"My issue with Winchester is more the management. Less experienced or nonproductive employees are allowed to make the job much harder on the hard working staff. It's more about who you know than what you know. "
good,Enjoyed seeing my co-workers everyday. I enjoyed doing my job until I was being told they were moving and I could go in any day and lose my job was scary.
good,"A very demanding job, being that orders have to be filled for the government in a timely manner and also it can be dangerous being that I work with explosives so I have to be careful and pay attention to detail"
good,Nice place to work looking for something in St.louis Mo Olin is in the process of relocating
good,A good company to work for but could do some things to make improvements. Some policies are not very well defined and can change at any point in time. Upper management doesn’t seem to put a lot of thought or care into lower ranked employees.
good,"Set up and maintain strict tolerances of various production machines. Learned from the best, pushed myself to be the best and exceed production goals. Did not let others poor work ethic effect my personal beliefs or goals. The worst part of the job was the weekly rotating shifts and limited advancement based on performance."
good,This was a decent company to work and had a lot of overtime. Good management and benefits and a good pension. It was a laid back atmosphere and stress free.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers on a daily basis to acheive their goals.
good,I use to love to come to work and do my job but it’s got to where it’s too stressful and the management is poor. Working swing shift takes a role on you after a while.
good,Good place to work. I would have stayed if they were not closing the plant. There were great benefits. Equipment could have been updated but since they are moving the plant to Oxford Mississippi they were not interested in doing that.
good,I liked the job it was fast paced and kept me busy all day I like to move and make production the faster I did my work and made sure quality was great the closer I got to home.
good,"I really did like most of my jobs with Olin. I am seeking new employment because they are moving to Mississippi."
good,Hardest part of the job was dealing with the shift work and forced overtime at a moments notice. This did not leave much time for planning any type of family activities.
good,Olin is overall a good company to work for with good pay and retirement. Health benefits are over priced and not good quality. Supervision is lacking in raising morale and keeping employees happy.
good,Worked the for 8 months and was laid off due to company moving my department out of state. Fun physically demanding work that can't be done by all that attempt.
good,"I began as a operator filling the plates with the primer cups send it to the charger(the position I now hold) for the charger to put the gun powder in side the cups to send to the foilers to seal the powder to be sent around to be closed up by an anvil and lacquer to be sent to the inspectors in which I have also done. to inspect and re-inspect the product for non-conformances. to be packed and shipped to military, police, and other customers for use. The hardest part of the job is that its really hard and demanding on your body, the constant fast pace eventually takes a toll on you. I am also allergic to some of the gun powder mixes. So its also hard on my health as well. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction with my co-workers while on line."
good,Compensation made up for the long hours and over worked environment. learned not to have a life. Some time you may have to work 16 hour days due to absent of senior employees.
good,"Very physical job, lots of hours, good benefits, was glad to be a part of their team. Learned a lot of trades in which I had no prior knowledge in. Was a great learning experience."
good,"For the most part there was no typical day at Olin. Some days I might smelt different alloys but all in all it was the same. I di learn a lot during my time at Olin such as Forklift operation, Crane operation, machine operation, machine adjustment, D.C. Casting of different alloys, and so on. The hardest part of the job wasn't really hard for me, and that was the constant overtime. I like overtime."
good,Safety is Olin's number one priority.  Quality of product was a close second.  Olin employees work long hours with good pay.
good,"I get to my work station 15 min early to check with other employee about any problems they may have had with operation of loader. Learn the function of shotgun shells, and how to adjust different station on the loader. Foreman work close with us. Co-worker, we help each other if needed. Hardest thing was the rotating shifts. One week days, the next midnights, then evenings. I enjoyed it most when I got the highest production than any other on the same loader."
good,"Swing shift job.  Overtime was not uncommon, but made for good paychecks.  Learned a lot about factory and production work.  Qualified on forklifts, electric pallet jacks, and over head cranes"
good,Worked with explosives and small materials to assemble primers  for a bullet.
good,A typical day would be fighting the problems of day to day manufacturing.  I have learned a great deal about metallic operations.  
good,"Safe work environment"
good,A typical day at work would be answering help desk calls and assisting coworkers with issues.
good,"At this job, I would be responsible for ensuring that materials were delivered to the department that needed it.  My co-workers were helpful at times.  The hardest part of the job was the rotating schedule.  It is not easy to switch shift each week.  But the pay and benefits were good."
good,"A typical day would be working on machines all day to asure that production was met. I learned alot working at Olin, I worked swing, and rotating shift so I had to learn time management. That I would say was also one of the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part about the job for me would have to be the pay and benefits."
good,The job was great. The people in there was the hardest part about the job. The work was consistent yet easy. I left because I had some young children that needed me at home at night and I couldn't get a daytime position there.
good,It was a fun place to work at. I learned a lot and was happy working there. I did production and quality work there. I worked a lot of overtime which I didn't mind doing.
good,good company to work for. good pay and benefits. long hours and could be stressful. typical factory work environment. High quality was always demanded due to the product.
good,"Great place to work if you have no kids or family, you can work all the hours you want at this company is personally think we should have personal days also"
good,"Olin Corporation has been a good place to work for the past 3 years.  I have enjoyed the opportunities I have had with them and would continue with them until I retire however with a pending lay off status, I am being forced to look for another job."
good,Great pay and a hard day. Work is very dependent on who you work behind and experience. You learn to fix the mistakes caused by careless of the individual who worked before you.
good,I like the company. GREAT PAY. Union shop. The company had pros an cons but on a hole not a bad place to work. There is room for advancement. They let you bid on others jobs you might be interested in knowing.
good,"fast pace work, forced overtime , work was inside, good union, the job is very safety awareness.everyone is instructed on good ethics. need too show up every day because point system."
good,Pay is low for area and benefits have gotten worse. The company doesn't like to spend money on its employees and could work better with the union on issues.
good,"Olin Corp is a well known company that produces ammunition in the Winchester division.  It offers great benefits and in my case, I was able to retire with a pension of 32 years."
good,"Très formateur à l'export , très bonne organisation et et très bonne expertise commerciale."
good,"I worked for Olin following Olin acquisition of Dow business assets, within which I was integrated. The transition was a large undertaking but Olin tried to make it as smooth as possible. They have helped me to continue to develop my engineering skills in an M&E environment with a fair amount of high level support. In my particular area there were few places to advance so I sought job roles elsewhere, however it wasn't because Olin was not a good place to work. In my experience my department went through several leadership changes in only a couple years and that led to a sense of instability but I don't know how common that is. The benefits package was great with 401k and pension plus full health coverage, so for that I have no complaints. I would have liked more of a focus on employee development, though. If that was more emphasized in my time there I think I would have stayed and had the opportunity to move into areas where I could be most valuable."
good,I enjoyed my time while working here.  Everyone worked together and was easy to get along with.  I am glad I had the opportunity to be a part of their team.  I would have accepted a full time position if I was offered one.
good,The hardest thing was balancing work and raising a family. You spend more time at work. Shift work was not for me. But benefits and pay were excellent.
good,Fast paced. Great pay. Forced overtime. Point system is very tight. Shift work. Overall not a bad company to work for. This is a union job. They do lay off from time to time.
good,I can only speak for my block. Though we are olin we were formerly employees of Dow Chemical. So our culture has been predominately Dow Chemical. Which is good. Olin has started to implement their type of culture gradually. I will say at the moment as a group we feel the managment could be better and more understanding of how we do things here.
good,"Frankly I enjoyed the ability to try on several different jobs and be challenged by each one. I learned Microsoft Office, SAP and how to dispatch maintenance. I was able to shoot a great majority of guns for the testing of ammunition for quality, velocity and accuracy and as a layperson would never have been able to experience that."
good,"Decent work environment.  Benefits overall fairly decent, and pay is excellent.  Not a sweatshop environment, fortunately, although long hours can be put in when needed.  I think they could greatly improve their opportunities for the advancement of women into management and higher positions, especially in the IT Department and a few other departments.  The latter has been under a very ""traditional"" management philosophy for a very long time, and could use some shaking up a little. This would also include more opportunities for flexible work hours and telecommuting when feasible.  "
good,"I am a very friendly, eager, and hard working Man. I like to take my time to make sure that myself and those around me will complete the job safely. I am also a clean person that leaves the jobsite cleaner than it was before."
good,"Good people, good safety, always helpful, great management , medical on site, listen to suggestions, care about family time, coworkers always helpful,"
good,Great teaching and learning environment.  Travel as needed.  Management supports new ideas.  Growing group of new CSR's currently moved to Houston area.
good,"Company has relocated and no longer offers positions held some 20+ years ago.  Not sure of current standing, so cannot comment on culture and job positions."
good,"Fast paced, professional atmosphere. Union job with excellent pay and benefits. Most jobs require you to work a 4 group rotating schedule. Which means you work most weekends."
good,"OLIN has a very good design environment, all the people are very helpful with all kinds of questions."
good,A typical work day would be checking material with spec's. to ensure a high Quality Product.
good,I like doing different jobs and learning new skills. The management was fare. I  got alone with my co-workers. The hardest part was when the machine would get stuck. the most enjoyable part was when the job ran smoothly.
good,employees were very friendly and management was easy to get along with. 
good,i was a co-worker at olin corporation in the mailroom delivering mail to over 3000 employees on 120 long ridge rd. stamford great company benefit wise it was sad that the company fell off. worked there for over 9yrs it was a great experience to me from 1986 to 1994. the people were great the atmosphere was wonderful an the medical was a nice touch......i miss that
good,"Olin is strongly committed to excellence in protecting the environment, health, safety and security of their employees and those that live and work around their plants. Olin operations worldwide comply with all local requirements and implement other standards as required to protect the environment, health, safety and security of our operations. This includes a commitment to REACH in the EU and following the principles of Responsible Care around the globe. Collaborative team oriented work environment with good compensation and benefits."
good,I only worked here as a temp employee and it's not a very stressful job compared to some I've had. You will have 4 plus weeks of training. Management tries to help and does go to bat for their team. I'm not sure the pay when you get hired on but I've heard I may have more as a temp. Limited OT but there is a floating on-call schedule. Coworkers are great. There isn't a lot of room for growth in CS but the company is expanding.
good,Good place to work for a person who takes their job with seriousness. Jobs are relevantly easy but can be stressful. Overtime is a must in most departments. Overall good place to work.
good,A good income along with satisfactory benefits. Gained experience in mechanical knowledge of machinery in regards to ammunition manufacturing. Became adept at operating forklifts along with the learning of good safety practices applying to such. I found working with the management fair and reasonable and the co-workers willing to be helpful and offer good advice pertaining to the tasks of working effectively and safely. The hardest part of the job was often the load of unwanted overtime when vacancies occurred but many times effort was made to make this particular facet of the job less burdensome. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction of fellow employees who worked closely with me as we all shared duties and common goals.
good,Olin Winches is a great place to work with great work environment. I have learned the process of putting together bullets. I respect the handling of bullets.
good,Awesome experience for interns/co-ops as well as engineers starting their careers. The work days are kind of long but for most you get every other Friday off.
good,This company was well managed and the co-workers were very open and willing to help with daily tasks.
good,Pay is good.  I've been waiting to be moved up but still haven't got any luck yet.  The management are great. They strictly implement the roles and regulations.
good,"Worked for a plant manager not much older than myself.  This individual mentored me to develop the role of Plant Engineer in support of a specialty chemical process, transport of chemical in a shipping fleet, and a line of equipment that would dispense the chemicals at a customers plant."
good,"Good place to work.  Management seemed to be OK except for my supervisor who all that worked for him, despised him.  Management was made aware of his deficiencies by many, but shoes to take no actions.  Almost all his direct reports transferred or quit.  He did not pay me in accordance with our original agreements."
good,i learned a lot those past 25 years. always challenging. constant variety of tasks to preform. there was always an emphasis on safety training.
good,very easy but stressful job I hate the rotating shifts and vacation process and no sick or personal days. the job is very easy
good,I learned to get along with others not matter what the circumstance was. Learned to work under stress well and complete any task management required me to complete. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers and working close with management.
good,machinist who went the extra distance to complete orders and did about 32 to 40 hrs overtime a week(VOLUNTARILY)
good,"I was responsible for the day to day operation, manufacture, distribution and security of a large, hazardous chemical plant. We worked 12 hour rotating shifts with a lot of overtime."
good,"I liked working for Turner at Olin, until the change of management. Then everything changed. The new supervisor was cocky, self centered and a snake in the grass."
good,"A job that provided the pay and healthcare needed to provide for my family. I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to have a job.      I would still be there had the job not moved. Immediate supervisors were alright most of the time. It was great to sometimes work with coworkers with same ethics, not so good when they (coworker) expected you to do half of their work."
good,"Working with people with all kinds of different attitude, must be able to get along with you co worker. Working close to co workers. Poor communication between employee and management"
good,"Great place to work, flexible schedules. Smaller business feel, allows for you as an employee to feel valued. Training courses offered to expand your knowledge within your role. Team lunches/meetings often provided and planned, allows for more unity through out the office environment."
good,I would work there again being that there have been changes in management lately. They have a very flexible point system and work environment.  They also gave good overtime hours.
good,"300 ton per day Chlor alkali plant with a mountain of experience and resources.  Although antiquated, working for this organization was second to none.  they genuinely took safety seriously and we were empowered as operators to run our process autonomously."
good,"I went to work for Olin Corporation in June 2010 on contract."
good,"I enjoyed working here I loved the people I worked with. The hours I worked were not always the best, shift work can be really hard on a family with little kids so I have to say that was probably the biggest problem for me and my family was the shift work and 16 hour days, other than that I loved my job I loved the people I worked with.

As time went on I decided I wanted to learn something else in the company so I chose to be and adjustor because I would sit and watch my adjustor fix my machine and ask Questions on how and what he did to fix the problem just by watching I would fix my machine myself and no longer would need the adjustor unless the problem was out of the adjustors hand if I needed an electrician or a pipefitter. I caught on very fast with the process of adjusting on robotic machines. I worked very well with all of my co-workers.
