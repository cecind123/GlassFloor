rating,review
bad,"It started off as a great corporate entity with incredible upsides and competent leadership, but it suddenly  denigrated to a very highly unstable company...If you value balanced leadership and stability, don’t work here...(WC seems fine, but def not liability claims)"
bad,Workload is awful. Managers who don’t know what they are doing and play favorites. This is for the Liability Managers in Concord CA. Don’t waste your time or career here.
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone. There is no structure at all, people get away with everything there. Promises were broken, no recognition for their employees. It all is about who you know."
bad,Listen to the honest reviews. The company looks at their employees as a number. You will never be more than that. They are cutting costs by eliminating bonuses and giving terrible raises except for upper management and if you’re a favorite. They are laying people off so why even bother. There’s better companies to work for.
bad,Everyone comes to this job to find a better job. If you are not liked by management you will know it. you wont last. policies changed all the time and no notices are given. basically to set you up for failure.
bad,"Yearly increase average 1%. Per management that will never change."
bad,Unless you are related to someone you won't move up.  Management care about themselves more than the company and pay will always fluctuate.  The job is short term at best.
bad,Management and fellow employees are miserable and don't have any pride in their jobs.  Managers are lazy and unprofessional.  I remember being on a conference call and my manager spent the whole time drawing pictures.
bad,"Short and sweet - it's the good old boy network, people promoted well beyond their ability.  Typical lead/manager/director/VP was a poor developer so was promoted to leadership, but do not recognize they're behind the times and should work on interpersonal skills not advising developers how to code."
bad,"Most of the work consists of fixing poor design, when not working a ticket you're forced to do data entry.  Company selling off units left and right making you wonder who you'll work for tomorrow."
bad,"Don't work here - or if you do, stay for only a year for the experience. Communication isn't great across teams, and management is poor in reprimanding people or giving information needed."
bad,"This place is tough. All the managers are middle aged white women. There is no room for advancement, they treat you unfairly, and work you to death. The computer system is HORRIBLE and creates a ton of extra work. They will hire people off the streets before they promote from within. I could go on and on and on and on but overall this place is the pitts!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,The company pays well. Manager in the Legal and Compliance is awful. She is immature and be little's her staff. I have never worked in a dept so short staffed. My opinion is for people to stay away from this department.
bad,"Worst place ever!! Every call is a bad one! Supervisors TRADE agents if they feel that you have gotten unproductive or bug them. Has a new director every 6 months. Training department is good but they don't train you for what the calls are really like. Call center floor is dis-organized. HR will not cooperate with any claims except if it has to do with the termination of an agent. Other departments which you have to communicate with in order to do your job will either push you off the phone even if you need important info to get off your call, or tell you that it is not their job to train you. Tier 1 department is worst of all of this. Suervisors will tell you to lie to get clients off the phone because they are worried about handle time. Handle time is too low for calls that are taken. Supervosors will also set their own standards for the team even if it goes against call center metrics. No chance of promotion. They prefer to hire outside sources. Most of management has not taken a call nor knows how to handle call escalations. They have their leads do all the work for them. Required all departments and required everyone to interview for their jobs again. Hold times to reach the info line which happened several times a day even for the most tenured of agents due to agents only on a need to know basis. Was written up my 3rd week there for asking a question to the info line. She proceeded to tell me I shouldn't argue with her when I simply was asking the reason for why she was instructing me to handle the call a cetain way. I had asked for her name and position to report her"
bad,"Worked as a tester and there is negative management that is occurring. There is no positive reinforcement, ability to work from home more frequently. Does not promote from within with the appropriate salary and responsibilities. Doesn't offer the opportunity for additional education with tuition reimbursement."
bad,"This company is horrible. Stay away!!! Management is the worst. They let go of a great manager and brought in somebody who barely speaks to anybody in the office, except the white people. This company is racist, moral is super low. Once they changes managers this company went down hill."
bad,"Micro-managing, brow-beating  ""mean girls""  work atmosphere.  No training and no reward system. Database riddled with technical issues that interfere with work productivity and stats. Ridiculous expectation to submit handwritten stats of daily tasks. No comraderie. Management used spyware on phone system and PC; ankle monitor was up next I'm sure. "
bad,"Doesn't the title explain it all? All that glitters ain't gold, as they say and even though this company is in a high rise and has leather clad chairs in their executive boardroom, which features a fantastic view of the ocean...well, lets just say this company is akin to putting a gold ring on a pig's snout. A pig is a pig. I am referring to the exorbitant amount of work management continues to pile on the work comp adjusters and underwriters, to only continue to insult their intelligence with disproportionate pay. They do not hold their supervisors, or managers for that matter, accountable to how they treat the above mentioned workers, which ranges from inferiorly to condescending. The supervisors micro-manage and also take turns 'making the rounds' to make sure people are at their desks with our proverbial WWIII helmets on. Did I mention that they underpay you and don't seem embarrassed about it either? There is NO open door policy and they groom particular people for success and heap unrealistic demands on the people they have set up for failure. Interestingly, they don't think anyone is wise enough to see their ploy, but its glaring; just like the sun streaking through the boardroom windows as you're sitting in yet another meeting daydreaming of the helicopter that is soon to swoop by and rescue you out of there!"
bad,"Let me start off by saying any review of this company that has more than 3 stars is from the company themselves!  This place is understaffed, the workers are underpaid, and they lack customer service!  I worked in the call center and I noticed that every call that I took was because the insured had not received thier bill.  Amtrust would not send out bills just so they can charge the customers a $25 late fee!  This company does not care about the people who work there.  My manger at the time told me he did not believe in rewarding employees because the paycheck was the reward!  There was so much favortism and BS that went on.  Managment gave themselves special privileges such as leaving early every Friday.  It got so bad that everybody in the call center had to get permission to leave thier desks!  We had to ask permisison to use the bathroom!  And if someone asked before you did you had to wait until they went before you could leave your desk.  If you wanted to get a drink of water you had to get permission.  God forbid you speak up to HR.  They all look out for each other.  If your're not a manager then they dont care about you.  I know at least 2 former employees who have filled a lawsutie against this company for wrongful termination and harrassment.  This company wont be around much longer!  Save yourself the trouble and apply at Mcdonalds before you apply here"
bad,"No cubicles, file reviews need to be completed every 28 days, no structure. Poor management. Coding is EXTREME, the company is more interested in coding than working your files. Expectations are high, no incentives. "
bad,"I gave that place 3 months. First off, training was supposed to last 6 weeks. Our training was cut down to 2 weeks. I was on the floor shadowing someone else. After one day of shadowing, I was on my own taking calls. I had no idea what I was doing. I hardly got any help, but then of course when you do things wrong they'll place the blame on you. I noticed how unorganized the company is. They weren't always mailing out invoices on time so people would be charged late fees for not paying on time. People policies were being cancelled without any knowledge. Management was awful. All they would do is sit on their butts gossiping. Half of the people who were in management didn't deserve it because they didn't know what they were doing. Just an awful experience all around."
bad,Amtrust has grown too fast.  I hope it will someday catch up.  Management has no experience and they have entirely too many layers. I've never seen so many AVP's in my life.
bad,"beware of working for this company.  There are other insurance companies that might treat their employees better.  If you are targeted by other employees, your job is in jeopardy."
bad,I do not have anything nice to say about this place. There are a few minute details that I can say were a nice advantage of working there but other than that they shouldn't even be in business!
bad,"Micromanagement central. People literally look over your shoulder to snoop on what you're working on. IMing is forbidden with a write-up. Emailing someone in the same building is equally a write-up. You're expected to go to someone and bug them."
bad,No honesty or integrity in dealing with employees. Think twice about taking a job here. 700 layoffs this year. Working environment is stressful and non-collaborative in nature.
bad,"I have an extensive insurance background and was hired on for a new role. Little did I know my training consisted of a a manager with no people skills and watching a couple of people work at their desk that were not certified to train anyone. Ok, now I should be an expert on everything I was haphazardly introduced to right? Well my manager thinks so....  I cant ask legitimate questions without a condescending tone from management. Completely unapproachable. Should have stayed at my former company!"
bad,"Pay is  awful, benefits are ho-hum at best.  Management is not great. Lot's of politics and micromanaging.  Generally, just a very unhappy place.  Definitely would not recommend. Some places understand there is a give and take in a employee / employer relationship. This is one of the places where they only take.  Only upside, you get a lot of PTO. You will need it for mental recovery."
bad,"AmTrust is a good place for people right out of college to start a career or to take a job while looking for another one.  There is almost no opportunity for growth.  They laid off 20% of IT in Cleveland in January 2018.  The management is terrible and some jobs require you to work both days and nights (with no scheduled time compensation or overtime)."
bad,"Ugh, it's the worst. Don't do it.  The product we were selling was basically a rip-off and spent most of our time giving people refunds so they wouldn't report us to the BBB."
bad,The management is poor with almost no leadership. There is almost no communication between teams and even within teams. There is no advancement as this company prefers to hire from outside.
bad,"Work demand is high, very face paced and if you don't play the politics correctly you wont advance or you'll find yourself on the outs quickly. Not a very diverse workplace."
bad,"Culture too relaxed in my area; management does not know how to manage; company too preoccupied with making money and not correct business processes; departments do not know how to communicate with each other effectively; unless you are experienced in insurance, there is no opportunity for advancement or even lateral moves."
bad,Management doesn't work with employees and will not advance employees. Pay does not reflect the job that you do.  Very little positives when working at this company.
bad,"I worked in the NJ office for a few days before management realized that I didn't fit into the ""clique"" and advised the placement company not to have me come back."
bad,I worked at Amtrust for more than 4 years and never learned anything from them.   All they did was take my ideas and run with them.  They do not promote talent from within.   If you know someone hirer up you got promoted.
bad,"I spent less than a year at AmTrust in their marketing department as a Vice President, until I left. The poor morale, negative back-talking, incompetent leadership, and lack of focus within the marketing department and at the company was highly unprofessional."
bad,"Harassment of employees"
bad,I have absolutely no words to describe this place. Just be ready to be harrassed by male management if you’re a female and call center manager is the main culprit.
bad,terrible management poor culture basically no real structure.   you are expected to know what management wants when they tell you the exact opposite a day sooner.
bad,Inbound sales call center. Relatively incompetent management implements the plan of the day while trying to stay off the radar screen of the corporate parent.
bad,"The job itself wasn't that complicated unless you received a call that you are not trained in, such as claims, auditing, etc. "
bad,"The one good thing is this is definitely one of a kind work place. It doesn't matter how hard working you are, or how good you are at your job.... It's all about who you know."
bad,"I am currently employed with Amtrust, it’s a job!  Communication is poor we can rules do not apply to everyone as far as shifts. Very cut throat......"
bad,"Management made this job out to be stress free and that you had authority to settle claims. You have no authority and management has no authority. It is all handled by upper management in Florida. The supervisor that you will report to is a micromanager. You have to send your reserves to them to be approved before sending them to their manager, before they send it to upper management. But it will be sent back to you 15 times because no one will agree or have the nerve to send them to upper management. "
bad,"No advancements unless you are liked by management or know someone. They keep only the people they like, not the work they perform. You are considered lucky to get a 1% annual raise. Bonus was given to supplement the low annual 1% raise. To much work for not reward. Never complemented on doing a good job by management."
bad,"At first everything is great until you are no longer with the “in group” if the manager doesn’t like you the emails do not ever stop. I received one thank you my entire job (several years) and every mistake I made was broadcasted to a group email. While I loved my job, the benefits, & all the other perks - the pay does not come close to compensating general sanity needed to work in my position. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy."
bad,"The only thing going for the company is that they pay well and provide good benefits. They do not have a strong management, culture is different based on who is your boss. They are not collaborative and it is a top down approach, Evaluations are of no value, something to get it done. No goal setting or career tracks or promotions from within. There is a very high turnover and layoffs done in secret. The only way the company attracts talent is by paying well but then they cannot keep the talent because they treat them so unfairly, do not communicate vision, plan work or have a positive team culture."
bad,My whole team was fired because there poor training. My manager was only there for a month after that the next manager left a week later. They give you  paid time off but you cant use it if you call out you fired.
bad,"The management in particular at this job was very unfair, had their ""pick"" and did not supervise at all. Nothing was kept in confidence and did not have an open door to work related issues. As far as the work, it was consistent and plentiful."
bad,They expect you to learn their Line of Business since day one. They have high expectations of you and was a terrible on boarding process to start career from.
bad,This company made us work overtime without pay.  They get away with this by classifying their underwriters as exempt employees this is a mis classification.
bad,"Very poor management skills for front line Supervisors.  "
bad,"I was fortunate to get my foot in the door here. I've learned a lot but there's very little room for advancement, if any at all. Either you'll be underpaid or laid off."
bad,"The employees are nice. If you are looking for a progressive, employee oriented company, keep looking.  Amtrust is archaic in its culture, computer claims system, processes and office building."
bad,"This company is a shining example of nepotism and cronyism at it's worst. Upper management consist of relatives, college buddies, and childhood friends. If you are not apart of the inner circle you will likely leave there as you came in."
bad,Management is HORRIFIC. Pay is very low. Communication is non existent. Absolutely no training materials. No formal training. Management style is bullying.
bad,"This is NOT a place to grow roots as there is no room for advancement.  Corporate restructuring resulted in many exceptional people being let go, right in the beginning of the year,. without warning.  They have a tendency to lose a lot of exceptional people because they aren't willing to pay a fair wage to people that deserve it."
bad,"not a great place to work.  the entire operation is held back by lack of vision and strategic leadership.  "
bad,"There is never any allowances for working from home even through the company has the tech-knowledge to do so.  Management will not bend for any reason.  I was a very good employee never called off or missed work in the dead of winter, our management would rather we drive 1 hour and some to the office then let us work from home in really bad weather."
bad,"Typical day consists of pulling reports, reviewing account openings, completing teller transactions and working platform as needed. "
bad,"People are promoted to management based on years of service, not skill set.  Hostile work environment in the South Seattle office.  No work / life balance, expected to work overtime without pay, managers mock, belittle and ridicule employees."
bad,I have worked for Amtrust for over 3 years. They recently just laid hundreds of people off nationwide (goggle it). The job security here is clearly not good and they do not post many jobs so being able to get promoted is very hard. I would try to apply for a more stable company that has competitive pay because Amtrust does not. The yearly raises are cents on the dollar literally and it took me 3 years to recieve a bonus which was not even much! The only good thing and i mean the only good thing is pto. You recieve holidays off to spend with family. That pto is why people stay for a little while but when u realize your to broke to do anything on your off days youll level up and move on to a company who pays there employees what they deserve. Dont waste your time.
bad,My opinion at this time is that I do not wish to disclose a review of this company. I've learned a great deal.  I have noting more to say about this company.
bad,"Nice starting out job, they hire you in a specific role and pay you for that than turn around and have you do 10 other things that is not related to what you were hired for without attempting to give a decent raise. You’ll only get 30 cent no matter how hard you work. You have to tell them why you need time off, which is a violation of ones privacy. It’s so micro managed, the morale is extremely low. If you ask me they don’t care too much about their employees. They give appreciation dinner once a year. There are no incentives or bonuses to keep you motivated. If you bring something to management, you’ll get a story told to you rather than a solution. It’s a very boring environment, very dry. The building located in Williamsville is freezing cold all year around, regular employees act like managers. There is no room for growth,  they need to hire more people but is too cheap to do so.  They don’t care much about your stress level, never attempt to make sure everyone is doing okay during times they know is very stressful.  They will implement new things, train you partially and expect you to know everything. It’s a real fake it until you make it type of company. You’ll buss your behind all year, coming to work everyday, they have heart attacks if your 5 minutes late, at the end of the year please don’t expect and bonuses. This company is awful when it comes to how they treat their employees. They ask you to refer people, they never even consider the people. Turn right around again and promote this referral bonus🤔🤔. I will never refer anyone of you never considered the first"
bad,This is a great place to start your IT career. The management at this company seem to always know nothing. Multiple times I am asked questions which were clearly send via email. Super frustrating when I know more than my supervisors.
bad,"the company offers competitive priced warranty products."
bad,"Entry level position can be hard to move up from this position within the company. There is not enough work and to many employees in one department. Claims clerk consists of 4 different departments."
bad,"After 6 months of working and realizing there was no opportunity to advance I gave my notice.  My position as a Claims Clerk was good in the sense that I got out of the office everyday to go to the bank and post office.  Easy assignments and would be a great job for someone happy to stay in one spot."
bad,"I have been working here over 3 years, the first year was great. Good pay, lots of vacation/holidays, fun and friendly coworkers. Then my immediate supervisor decided to hire her best friend whom was basically given a free pass, to a of free PTO, others have to do her work, etc. Voicing any type of concern lead to immediate and ongoing retaliation, with several responses of “you’re annoying me” and “if you are unhappy there’s the door.”  Extremely poor management and corruption, stay away u less you are willing to be a teacher’s pet or suffer."
bad,No room for advancement due to management hiring friends and families who are less qualified for positions. This company is a sinking ship! Look elsewhere!
bad,"Strongly not recommended. The lay of the land changes frequently, several times a year, and always for the worse. The environment has gotten less and less friendly over time, employees have lost more individual rights and held to much stronger scrutiny. All the talented people are strongly urged through callous disregard to seek greener pastures so their work can be cheaply outsourced."
bad,Company is still on shaky financial footing. Caseloads are too high. Professional colleagues and work from home flexibility make the situation tolerable..
bad,Too many people in charge that do not know how to do their job.  Way to much of the buddy system and not enough qualified people in positions of leadership.  Each department is run like it is it's own fiefdom instead of working together for the greater good of the company.
bad,Not sure I would return.  Great people but huge shift in culture and benefits when they acquired my company.  Little advancement and very poor compensation/merit increases.
bad,"I got a lot out of the job and have a lot of experience from this position. Didn't get the respect i deserved. I loved my job when i first started, but after a couple years people left and we moved to the downtown location. "
bad,"They worked you as hard as possible, but the pay was good for higher positions."
bad,This could have been a better work experience. A great place to start off and get your foot in the door. This place has a very slim chance for advancement. When advancements due occur it is not based of productivity or excellent work it is based on being friends with the right people. Many of things were very unorganized.
bad,"If your looking for stability, this is not the place to find it. Some coworkers are very unprofessional and are very racist and it is not something that is corrected by management or by HR.  Everyday was a very uncomfortable day."
bad,"No structure is in place whatsoever. The executives, managers, and supervisors form their own cult and only worry about themselves. Provide no direction or advancement opportunities. Culture makes you feel insignificant and undervalued."
bad,"Not an enjoyable work environment. mindless, sedentary. lack of career development. Staying motivated is the hardest part of the job. Fellow employees are the best part of the job."
bad,"I cannot in all good conscience recommend working at this company.  The software is proprietary and substandard.  They are replacing veritable enterprise software with cheap, third party vendors and expect the same results."
bad,The job roles and responsibilities seemed to change from week to week.  The work atmosphere has become really toxic. The most enjoyable part of working here is working is the people you get to work with.
bad,"My time at AmTrust was good. They created a career path for me and supported my volunteer opportunities outside of the organization. The work-life balanced culture they created was good, and I was grateful for the flexibility to work remotely during inclement weather conditions."
bad,It is a very stressful daily. The computer system used is not sufficient enough to adequately handle the workflow. The company is not up to date with technology.
bad,"I will keep my comment to myself. The work depends on the manager. People work for more hours and difficult to get time off.  The staffs are good, but the managerment"
bad,"I would have to say that the best part about AmTrust Financial is the PTO that is offered.  Typically, a new employee is give 18 days of PTO for the year.  After 5 years with the company, you get 23 days per year."
bad,"Take inbound calls from customers in need or service on their appliances."
bad,AmTrust is truly a one of a kind workplace. AmTrust values hard working empolyees.
bad,Manager was very hostile and micromanaging. Coworker in the group was very rude and refused to help or teach. Manager always applauded the work of the other team member .
bad,The company gave me a very challenging environment in which to apply my 20 years of IT experience.  I’m the end though the leadership team seemed disinterested in fixing the issues plaguing the infrastructure which led to my departure.
bad,"Very stressful place to return to each day."
bad,"Amtrust is a fine company for someone maybe without a degree or for someone young looking for your first 9-5 job.  Management is full of the older (65+) employees who openly admit to wanting to coast to retirement.  This results in a lack of care in the employees, their fulfillment, and their growth.  I felt like I had to take my career in my own hands and move it elsewhere, Amtrust was not a place that would promote regularly or often."
bad,"Management supervisors and leads lack knowledge for their job lead. People are usually placed in lead or supervisory positions just for having tolerated all the BS long enough and not have quit or gotten fired, but they know nothing about business management or business ethics or being diplomatic in leading a person they know nothing about offering constructive criticism. You can ask two different supervisors the same question and you will get two totally different answers. How does one learn and grow and be productive in their positions when the resources that are in place to assist you don't even have the correct answer, they don't care about finding out the correct answer, and they say anything off the top of their head and will tell you to get the customer off the phone and move on to the next customer that you are expected to race off the phone. I don't handle my calls this way I have longer calls because I try for a one-call resolution and offering quality customer service but I'll probably be fired sooner or later for that fact."
bad,Working with outdated technology. Slow to change and compensation is horrible. Underpaid. No recognition for doing great work. Also hires employees with no programming experience so constantly updating poorly written code.
bad,A typical day of work consist of calling people all day to solicit warranties for their items
bad,"Horibble company. Looked for a professional, team playing, positive work environment and this wasn't it.  Employees complain daily. Management needs training to learn to treat their workers different than they are.  Was happy to leave. Discourage anyone from going to this SAD place."
bad,Management would change direction of philosophy based on incorrect reactions.
bad,Very little focus on software. Management in general were not knowledgeable software engineers. Everyone in management came up with the company from the beginning; don't seem to like new blood at higher positions. They do not value strong software engineers and because of that they do not retain skilled developers. Much of their software is poorly designed and uses antiquated technologies.
bad,Software Quality Analyst: 
bad,"Fun place to work with a fitness center in the building.  Lots of ice cream socials and food trucks coming to get the business. The company also help with your parking and you can get discount on public transportation.  However, the chances of moving ahead comes down to who you know. Nepotism is wide spread.   If you are not in the in crowd you will remain dormant in your position. You will be lucky if you get a raise. A lot of the rewards go to people who have been in the company for many years even when they have done nothing to earn them.  People get rewards for telling on others while they are the ones who walk around not working at least 4 hours out of the day.  The hardest part of the job was that other people can give their opinion about you and it is taken to heart."
bad,"Working environment is so-so. The problem with this company is the lack of communication. The CIO seems to call all the shots when he has no clue how the other departments function. Someone makes a change to the system and doesn't tell anyone the changes have been made. After the change is made, it has a negative domino effect because he doesn't realize it effected everything else. Not female friendly. I grew tired of all the CIO favoritism."
bad,When I first started it was a great place to work.  Over the past two years there has been restructuring and the whole atmosphere changed.  It was very stressful.
bad,Not a very fun place to work anymore. The culture has changed and it is not the same company as before.  The management doesn't listen to employees at all.
bad,They have performed 100's of layoffs and are in a transitional period. The company needs time to reorganize and settle.  Mostly good people and decent benefits.  I would rank them higher if there was job security.  Lack of certainty and forthcoming are added stress.
bad,"It won't take long working at AmTrust to realize that a fair portion of its upper management made it to their role by simply waiting it out, and not by superior performance. Manic change occurs with every small hiccup to the point of over-correction, causing larger and more farther reaching issues in other aspects. The technology is outdated, inefficient, and (per their own words) ""not designed for workers' compensation claims."" So far, only big promises of improvement or change in software application have taken place. The inefficiency doesn't stop there. Because upper management operates in the realm of deer in headlights, middle management is often inadequately qualified and grasps at straws to appease their constant over-steer/counter-steer approach to regulating final product. Growth from the clerical level only occurs if your lips are in the right place, with no regard to your actual performance."
bad,"working for this company is a challenge.  a typical day consists of constantly trying to make the required number of job functions per day, .this only holds true for some employees."
bad,"it was ok.  The mangers there do not care about you as a person.  When you ask them a question, they look at you like why are you asking me a question, i am busy."
bad,I liked the pay and that's about it. Working in the customer service department was ok but I don't like lying to people and at this job we had to lie to customers and tell them their issues were being handled but they weren't. We would just tell them to call back within one to two business days and nobody would ever call so they call back and cuss out US the agents. There are hardly ever any managers available to talk to these customers. I really feel bad for them cause they pay for warranties and they don't get anything fixed or resolved and they just throw you on the phones. When first starting you're only allowed 8 hours to miss within an 8 hour period anything over that you're automatically terminated.  But the pay is good
good,"amtrust financial has unrealistic goals for production and want 100% accuracy but if you don't meet 280 releases a day you may be fired, they dont value their people they value production thats why people leave."
good,the human resource department makes up their own policies does not follow protocol and they give you way more work than what you applied for and does not increase your salary
good,The working environment gave mixed management styles. There was too much work and in many areas there was a lack of effort from other analyst.
good,This was a summer seasonal position that was supposed to turn permanent.
good,"I had four Managers. It was poor communication and poor Managerial skills on all four parties. Also, the location wasn't convenient for me anymore. I was micromanaged from co-workers."
good,"Pros:"
good,"The work environment could definitely be a lot better than it currently is. The management likes to micro-manage you, which tends to stifle you. Don't really seem to have room for you to grow with company. If you need a job, it's a good place to get a start, but if you want to build a future it's best to move on."
good,"Typical work day was to work and make set goals..Learned not much, that was controlled by Supervisor. Holding us back from our potential, not challenging therefore unable to apply for positions within company. Poor Management. I would say no hard part of job but more fustrated. Most enjoyable part? ...Cause it was such an easy job"
good,This company is good f you are trying to get in the Workers Compensation Insurance. but management is pretty much a joke and the politics are just crazy. Most people that work there are family or friends of family.
good,"Mgmt has revamped, restructured, and cleaned- house. Amtrust will likely become more efficient as a result.  Mgmt is rather cold, and provides the mentality that everyone is replaceable."
good,Work family balance good. Job was ok for a time; but change over time. There wasn't any structure nor hard and fast requirements of what was expected of you in writing. Different managers managed differently making it difficult to know what the company wanted.
good,"When I first started this was a good place to work. Somewhere within a short amount of time it became more and more difficult. Employees are not valued for their skill set and performance. In other words, don't bother doing more than the bare minimum because it's not worth it. Management is only interested in doing what's right for the company, not their employees and definitely not their customers."
good,AmTrust would be the perfect place of business if there weren't so many conflict of interest situations. The managers I've had have both had their outside friends working alongside them in the departments. These friends are their favorites. They're treated much better than the rest of the staff and they think they're entitled. The friends basically run the departments and it's not fair. The friends are the ones who receive the bonus checks and the career advancements and this issue is extremely common at AmTrust.
good,Negative vibe from management which carries on to the employees. Too much he say she say. brown nosing to get no where. HR is worthless. Management uses their position to keep you from getting promoted if you speak out or disagree with them. They will black ball you and tell lies to other departments to keep them from hiring you. Then they pick at everything you do.
good,The people are great to work with and we try and help one another but there are no consistence and it takes days to complete the simplest task and very poor management.
good,"AmTrust is full of micromanagers and overworked employees.  The workplace environment is a somber mood, wouldnt use the word ""fun"".  Instead of feeling like a valued employee, you felt more like you were being watched and ""babysat""  99% of the time."
good,"It's a good place to work, but management needs to focus on reducing adjuster workloads so that the company can live up to its claims of work/life balance."
good,"Friendly work environment, comfortable, somewhat too laid back, management level advancements are slim in addition to compensation."
good,Amtrust is a very laid back company which can be great at times but also lead to management not even noticing those who go over and beyond to learn and move up in the company
good,"This company used to be a fun place to work at, but now the morale is so low and it's your stereotypical sweatshop. They took away our cubes and privacy and no more on-site CE classes. The staff there has a lot of great, senior level people that are so helpful. I hope they don't lose these great people"
good,"Manage the project and the processes that the team are supposed to follow in the new agile methodology and during their daily activities."
good,"Company has great vacation time,  but that is where the positivity ends. No training or career advancement.  A lot of young people with little to no people skills.  Our benefits package isn't very good. Overall a decent starter job but for seasoned and experienced job seekers wouldn't recommend."
good,"While there are amazing people in the company, upper management is inflexible and resistant to change. Its numbers first, people second. The pay is adequate depending on department, but the bureaucracy is draconian and extremely top down."
good,"When I worked there, it was a manual testing environment and they hired many individuals without any testing background.  It wasn't bad, but management wasn't exactly sure what to do either.  This one factor has led to a variety of not so good things."
good,"Poor Management, don't care about employees. Stressful environment. Communication with employees can be better. Great place to meet new people, and gain experience"
good,"as a a bi lingual employee  should be payed more to much responsibilty and less pay, call volumn as a bilingual is very high should get payed more ..."
good,"The company needs to vet their managers more. Some managers abuse their positions and use them as a way to isolate certain groups for ""slack work"" that will never led to professional growth in the company or in the role. While they make certain to make sure their lunch buddies have every resource available to advance their careers. It's almost equivalent to a start up company."
good,"I worked as an Underwriting Assistant at the Concord, Ca office. I absolutely loved my job, but management really sucks! Lack of communication, training, I quit my position because management woyld make prejudice comments to me as if it was normal. They thought that they were above you."
good,"Bottom line rules the culture. They have grown quickly by acquisition of other troubled carriers. Good return on investment for stockholders, but culture is characterized by overstressed managers trying to avoid criticism. Management by fear rather than by long term planning and goal setting with reporting staff. Recently have been cutting senior staff and replacing with lower cost, less experienced talent. Advancement is available, but many jobs are not set up with clear expectations. If you want accountability and reward for hard work, do not apply here."
good,I work there for 11 years. Friendly people and busy which made the day go by fast. Learned at lot about different lines of business. The hardest was the super changing constatntly
good,"It was a very nice place to work.  However, there was no job security unless you knew someone.  Unreasonable goals were set making it a little stressful in trying to meet your monthly percentage rate."
good,"I worked for the company for a couple of years.  I was able to watch all of the changes that were made as management changed. Not all of the changes were good. Due to many of those changes, the company lost a lot of employees, especially in the Chicago office. The benefits were not all that great. You pay a lot for insurance (PPO & HMO... I had both during my time there). They expect a lot from you with very little reward. In the beginning, we had great staff morale and activities. Over the years it declined as they took away the few perks we had."
good,"work load very heavy, constant file transfers, certain operating philosophies not defined or constantly changing.  Culture was laid back.  Work hours very hard."
good,A typical work day can be very challenging. writing business across several demographics and geographic. Enjoyed my time there and the people I worked with.
good,"Working at Amtrust Financial Services Inc. has been ok. I had a lot of autonomy.  I liked my supervisor.  I liked helping my fellow employees, insureds and agents."
good,"Ok starting place, but promotions and raises are rare and far between. Pay is less than standard for geographical area. Stepping stone. There is a lot of turnover and upper management doesn't seem to value their hardest workers."
good,"Strong casualty company specializing in workers comp.  I was a regional sales rep whose job was to build the SC market which I did.  Unfortunately, the company shut down writing business in my state as well as others."
good,"Overall not a horrible place to work, has decent benefits, but don't expect to be paid well or paid any attention. Can not advance unless you are part of the 'cool group.' But if you need to get your feet wet or a good start, good place to go."
good,I came on board and was offered little to no training. This has been a major hindrance in my performance. I am working on creative ways to ensure that this role is better prepared for the next person to take on this job.
good,Constantly changing environment. Several layoffs. I was laid off when IT was outsourced. 30 minute lunches. Jewish holidays observed as well as National and Christian.
good,I enjoyed my time at AmTrust and would not mind being an employee in the future. However as far as their communication with their employees is via email and I wish it was more verbal.
good,"The title says it all!"
good,I'm not sure how this pertains to my current search for work. I am writing stuff now just to fill in this box that won't let me proceed otherwise. I don't work for Amtrust anymore
good,Start up work environment even though the company has more than 3k employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the result of your work right after implementation.
good,"It started off as an awesome place to work!  However, based off recent changes in management at Amtrust it is no longer a happy place.  Very micromanaged in some departments. Almost like being in a daycare with pay.  It's all about who you know, not your actual work performance."
good,The job itself was great with nice pay and benefits/incentives.
good,"Lot of employees with years of experience in Insurance"
good,"They don't pay very well, and when you get hired there is a realistic chance you won't get the position you interviewed for."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the fellow employees.  They are friendly and helpful.  They go out of their way to make sure you are doing ok.  They are like a second family.
good,"As with any organization, your job is a good as your management.  I work in a small office and can say our local management is great.  They are collaborative and they look to resolve issues favorably for all parties when possible.  There have been a lot of changes in the company over the past couple of years having transitioned from a Stock corporation to privately held company.  With these changes came a lot of transition regarding reporting.  Some of the changes were needed and have been very good.  Others remain to be seen."
good,Amtrust is not a terrible place to work. The company does not value its employees. It is a flexible place to work and the comradery is good. I've worked here for a long time now and I would love to see changes soon.
good,"Okay. Okay work environment. Good insurance, dental, vision, and health. Regular duties. Different activities for holidays. Team meetings. Data entry."
good,This company supports its workers and sets them up for success because  it goes the extra to ensure that an employee can focus on work while personal things are taken care of.
good,The company has found itself purchasing sand acquiring other companies... which has led to many of Amtrust's current employees losing employment due to consolidation. This has also caused job freezes and very little lack of advancement opportunity in most cases
good,Big insurance company with offices all over the country. Decent salary but little room to advance. Fairly relaxed workplace although sometimes extra tasks get thrown at you when things get busy.
good,Good opportunity for insurance professionals at all levels.  National opportunities;  good support from Cleveland Support center; Doing good things for employees.
good,I enjoyed my short time with Amtrust. I wish they would have had a telecommuting option. There were too many layers to try and get any sort of authority and the reserve levels were low.
good,A lot  required. Face paced but not a lot of resources. Have no words for management. A lot of good people to work with. A lot of tension put on workers.
good,I would enjoy working here if the service centers they are contracted with were reliable and took care of customers problem quickly. The most complaints you receive is regarding service centers. There is not really much you can do regarding these complaints except submit a complaint via template to back office who will contact service center but no resolution on phone call
good,"Monday starts off with working tickets in the queue that accumulate from the weekend. Take calls from internal employees, agents, insureds assisting with lockouts, password resets, issues with the Amtrust Online site, working instant chats all while receiving tickets real time that need to be processed promptly. Urgent e mails are sent to support teams and management when there is an outage or if someone is down. There were times when calls would be slower and you had a chance to get caught up."
good,Good place to start off your career there are a lot of young people and people looking to gain experience at Amtrust Financial. So people fresh out of college would like it.
good,"The company is ok to work at but need something closer to where I live, the people there are nice but I would have liked earlier hours since I work from 1130-8pm"
good,"As a Consultant, I was responsible for the Run-Off Administration of the Rochdale Book of Business. I handled all aspect of the Run-off management. "
good,"Basic work environment "
good,"They are a little chaotic now.  A lot of development is going on due to quick and sustained growth.  Employees work hard and do good work."
good,This is a good company in general. It is showing signs of struggling in the market and being competitive.  The long term outlook for Amtrust Financial Services is good.
good,"As a Manager a typical day at Amtrust usually involves going over issues and deadlines and very little chance to actually code. During my first year at amtrust, as a SQL Dev, I learned a lot and grew. Now that I no longer write code I miss the focus on my core skill set."
good,"Take the job if you have no other option. Core Competencies "
good,"It was a fast paced, and unorganized IT department.  Too many problems arising daily based on poor IT management.  Company had too many people working without guidance and management was more concerned about trying to get hourly task into Service Now than actually working to solve solutions."
good,"It is a great place to work. The job is easy and it is never a problem if you have other important things to do outside of work. You don't have to worry about losing your job. However, the being able to grow within the company is pretty slow. I work my butt off everyday and take on more responsibility as I should and have not been considered to move up in the company or get a raise as of yet. I really love working here but I am in hopes to get paid what I am worth as this company."
good,"The company is a growing company, fast paced, productive, and modern. They have various offices across the country, and many positions available to qualified applicants."
good,"My coworkers were amazing, management not so much.  I am grateful for the experience, I certainly learned a great deal.  its a great entry level company, you can learn a lot. the average person stays maybe 6-12 months."
good,If you enjoy an unstructured environment.  There is a lack of leadership and dissemination of knowledge needed to do your job.
good,"Commercial Insurance Company specializing in multi commercial coverage that provides policy holders more than one product. "
good,"Daily account management, policy changes, speaking to customer or agents. A lot of typing and online retrieval computer work."
good,The is not much room for advancement. Nice  co-workers for the most part. Needs better better medical benefit package. Has the normal red tap and office politics.
good,Very busy CEO at a financial firm.  This is a very busy role that demands impeccable attention to detail and strong communication skills.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my current job is interacting with  the underwriters to produce a quality product for our customers.  It's a fast paced job, makes the day go by fast.  I work with some great people and have a good work relationship."
good,The company has been making a great deal of changes. There were a great deal inconsistent changes with the policies without formal warning or update.
good,Very quick to donate to charity for the tax write-off but slow to give back to employees directly.  Employees don't feel they have a connection to the decisions being made.
good,Good place to learn and hone skills. But it is very difficult to move up in the company regardless of skill level. A typical day is filled with new challenges.
good,Ability to grow and develop a new division.  Authority to make decisions on new opportunities and work with many consultants to grow division.  Good work atmosphere.
good,This is a fast moving company with a very flat management structure that is focused on growth. They offer competitive pricing and commissions for their agency partners.
good,"Can not maintain work life balance. I have a good manager but his inability to slow down the inflow of work that comes in and maintain the one we have has taken me over the edge. Also, the inability of justifying more resources has strained the team."
good,Started at this company fresh out of college. A great place to learn how to apply my college skills to real world work situations. Company could handle complaints and issues better.
good,There are some great managers but advancement is more based on longevity than actual ability. Great to get a foot into a corporate environment and all that comes with that.
good,"I worked in the Compliance Department of Amtrust. For the most part you are learning something new every single day. I enjoyed the casual culture and the flexibility in hours. Overall, the team I worked with was extremely helpful and always willing to help other departments too. The hardest part and least enjoyable was the training in my department and the lack of structure within the organization. The most frustrating things for me was some of the team members had a different way to complete the same task and thought their way was best. Moreover, there was no organizational performance standards or Key Performance Indicators to measure success."
good,"I do like working for AmTrust,  work life balance is a big plus. My direct supervisor is fantastic. I work from home most of the week. The work is challenging and diverse.  My pending is appropriate. I am respected."
good,"I liked working here, very relaxed environment with solid benefits and time off. They do underpay you and  bad case of favoritism and nepotism here. Thanks"
good,"Managers don't have enough technical knowledge."
good,"A typical day at Amtrust I pay diaries several times a day, make copies, schedule appointments for IME's, MRI's, print files and mail them to attorneys and doctors. I also type bureau forms and mail them to WCAIS bureau and to the employee and employer.  I also fax documents when needed.  I call employees and make sure they are aware of appointments that have been made.  Call employers and see if they can accommodate the employee if they are on modified duty. I confirm with employer any missing information needed on the claim.  I communicate with the adjusters medical notes as I receive them."
good,Great place to work! I've learned everything about workers compensation in the past 10 years working here. The atmosphere is relaxed and management promotes a balance between work and family.
good,"Great pay for a first job out of college. Really friendly environment, and willing to teach if you are willing to learn. Pretty much told ""Here are the problems"" and fixed them at your own pace."
good,Challenging and fasted paced company that lacks personnel to support its growth. High pay per industry average and room for advancement.
good,"Rewarding experience and have learned a lot.  The pay is fantastic and we're constantly growing.  Unfortunately, they hire people seemingly just to fill seats with warm bodies instead of people with actual abilities which makes things a struggle."
good,"I really enjoy my team and the people I work with.  Advancement to other departments is rare.  ""Hard Workers"" aren't always recognized or compensated, and because of this, people aren't driven to over produce.  They do just enough to keep their jobs.  I understand that asking people to over achieve and help drive company numbers is a little outrageous, but don't complain about things if you're not attempting to improve your situation."
good,The company has excellent benefits for employees. Some supervisors and managers provider more professional development then others. Overall good work life balance.
good,"On a day to day basis, it's really not a bad place to work. I was on two different teams within the company. The employees are friendly and I managed to form strong bonds with the people on my teams. "
good,"Quiet and laid back office atmosphere. Not many perks, but casual culture. Decent pay and flexible hours. Doesn't appear to be much room for advancement."
good,"AmTrust is a nice company to work for. I have had the opportunity to network and meet some really awesome individuals since I've been there. The job itself isn't difficult and  typical workday can be busy but laid back at the same time. Depending on the department and who you know within the company, there is room for advancement but it seems as if sometimes they have the tendency to hold their employees back when they're trying to advance within the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely the people and being able to work in the heart of Downtown Cleveland."
good,Working in a call center has taught me to learn more customer service skills. Most of the coworkers are friendly and welcoming.
good,I enjoy my time at Amtrust.  The managers helped with me with my professional growth.  Unfortunately the uncertainty within the last 24 months on job stability did create some undue stress but greatly enjoyed my co-workers and the work/job that I was doing.
good,"Its a great job depending on the department your shooting for. By the way, Job advancement is not guaranteed. Expect new Hires to get paid more than you as well."
good,"Great organization with a good work-life balance. Employee salaries can be better if Management decides to pay the market rates usually seen in other companies, the only issue is the low salary compared to competitors."
good,"On a daily basis, i worked with the agents on my team (14+) to assist them with their sales goals. I would use one on one coaching, call reviews, both live and previous, and point out best practices to be used.  I started as a CSR in April 2012 and with the support and training of management, i was promoted to a Call Center Supervisor within 3 years. We worked hard, but we also had fun with daily, weekly and monthly sales incentives.  We would plan team and inter-team potlucks on a monthly basis with festive themes.  I really enjoyed working with my team. If i could help them build their sales ongoing and help them make more money, as well as the company, it gave me a certain satisfaction that i was able to help make someone professionally better and proficient."
good,this is a very good company.  They give you all the tools you need to be successful.  The benefits they offer are great.  They allow you to still have a personal life while working with the company
good,"Amtrust was a very aggressive company, and the people were very skilled and at times overworked.  Management team was not very focused on their people only the financial bottom line.  Caused many to jump ship to other companies."
good,Learned how to manage multiple responsibilities with little training. Overall was a good growth experience. Company went private and started cutting jobs.
good,"One manager under the same area will allow things that another will not, should held to the same across the entire company. Lots of favoritism in units with nothing special from performance of the favorites."
good,"Amtrust was a great place to start a career at, but as many people have already stated, there isn't much growth or stability. Communication with management is not optimal."
good,"It is a production based job that works with the mail. The mail comes in and it is given for you to work on. Once you get the hang of this job, you realize that it only consists of stacking paper. You either run a scanner that stacks paper or stack paper to be scanned. The job is incredibly monotonous and mind numbing."
good,"Was once a fast paced company, constantly changing through acquisitions but now they have changed management, shifted core focus and now outsourcing IT and now favoring 3rd party vendor software."
good,I began My career at Amtrust. I learned a lot and met a lot of new interesting people. They made you feel comfortable and made things flow easy as a first job.
good,"I worked for AmTrust for approximately three weeks shy of five years."
good,"The project I worked on had an intelligent and friendly team. The manager was great, very chill and more than reasonable about any requests I made. Unfortunately the job paid well below market rate, and I haven't received a raise yet."
good,"Processing endorsements, quotes and BOLs at a fast pace. Constantly learning something new in regards to the insurance industry. Management is helpful. Great co-workers."
good,"Very busy, multi-tasking but very friendly peopel to work with."
good,"a very business oriented atmosphere.  A very professional company."
good,"Great place overall as far as benefits and location, but get ready to be stressed out and work long hours depending on department. It helps if you have a laptop to work from home."
good,"Great place to get experience and great benefits along with pay."
good,Multiple work assignments weekly sometimes daily. A place where  multi-tasking is a must utilizing business experience and knowledge to the fullest extent.  Working with very little direction and having to figure things out on your own with limited time &/or deadlines is the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new skills to get the job done on such limited time frame.
good,"young staff. Top mgmt does not seem in touch with employees. Some people worked the typical 8 hours but to excel you should work at least 9-10 hours a day,"
good,"Benefits:"
good,"Many changes, a rapidly changing business, however management cares about it loyal employees. I wish the company much success in it's future endeavors."
good,"I came over from the Tower Renewal Right transaction.  This allowed my initial role to be one of transitioning Tower business onto Amtrust paper.  While this took some time but once this was completed it took a little time to get me more in a corporate role rather then just focused on old existing Tower Business.  I finally did get more of a Corporate role, but by the time I left there was a reduction in force coming which I was glad not to be a part of it."
good,"When I first started it was perfect.  Large corporation with a small company feel.  Over the years, the company went private and they started cutting costs and outsourcing"
good,"Working at AmTrust is what I expect from a good corporate job. The atmosphere is professional, but free, and the compensation is decent."
good,"Amtrust is a good place to work  .  "
good,"very fast paced day, answering phone calls and adjusting workers compensation claims.  Comfortable office environment, casual dress code and good location for walks during lunch."
good,"Initially this was a great place to work for me, a family oriented company and I felt they had the employees best interest at heart.  Things changed when new management was hired; the atmosphere changed completely and it became unbearable for me.  This is of course only my opinion; however I will not allow that to cloud my opinion of the good times I experienced at AmTrust and dissuade others from attempting to see if they may be able to find a place within this company as I know my time is over."
good,"Good pay for someone fresh out of college, but everything else is questionable. From management all the way down to favoritism, and it's quite disturbing."
good,"I have never worked with Test Runner prior to joining AM Trust. It was exciting learning how to rate Insurance Policies using Test Data's and policy premiums. Executing complex SQL Queries to find different rules and rates. "
good,AmTrust is pretty good about making sure you are comfortable while you're there.  Coffee and donuts... Tea and coffee cakes.  Vending machines and the like.  They are results driven and goal oriented
good,I love my job and I love my current location. I have an amazing manager and co-workers but the compensation is not worth what I am doing.
good,"Management does not communicate among each other to create a more uniform format or protocol for getting things done. "
good,Worked there as a claims assistant. Job is tedious but not very difficult. Not much micro managing as long you do what you are told. Atmosphere is relatively friendly but there can be some drama at times. A good place to work at for someone coming out of college.
good,"The call center is what you think it is; users will call in asking for basic assistance ranging from unlocking an account and setting up a printer, to annoying things like asking to setup their home wifi (Which you dont have to do)"
good,This was a great place to work. It has an extremely friendly work environment. Only issue was they were moving downtown Cleveland and they would not give me a raise to compensate my increased expense.
good,"It's great. if your able to work there do it. Great vendors. Workload is fine, if your not lazy. Hour lunches are awesome."
good,Amtrust offers great pay and time off. But depending on what department you work in there isn’t much growth opportunities. I would say the biggest upside to this company is the work/life balance.
good,It was disheartening when you it comes to the annual increases & you come to work every day and someone else calls out a few times a week and you both get the same thing for a raise
good,The most enjoyable part of my job at Amtrust is my team and peers.  Everybody is always willing to jump in and help when needed which has built an excellent workplace culture in our environment.  We recently went from public to private which brought layoffs and attrition in the environment which has shaken a lot of great people but we are doing everything possible to retain good talent.
good,"The workload was way too much for me at the beginning at Amtrust, due to there was only 2 Renewal Underwriters.  The workload did go down when the company started to hired additional Renewal Underwriters.  The work culture was pretty much relaxed."
good,my supervisor was excellent.  the work was busy and a lot of red tape.  too many people to check with.  Working from home allowed me to save on gas.   Management was open to new ideas and managed to do extra to maintain the office moral. The assistants worked hard to help the adjusters.  Their attitudes were I can and will.  No judgement environment.  Everyone up to the task to be team players.   Not a lot of socializing but an overall comfortable atmosphere.  Was a pleasure to work for this company.
good,"Since I left so much has changed, however, while I was there I felt like I was part of a family. The only reason I left was for an advancement. I will say this to all, the grass is green where you water it."
good,I enjoyed most people I came into contact with. It was a pleasant working environment. I did not leave by choice. I was part of a reductionl in workforce after the Christmas Holiday. We had no idea we were being let go until the day it happened. The entire company was dismissed early so that we could not say good bye to our co-workers. They offered a fair compensation package.
good,Good opportunity for Jr. SQL DBA position.supportive and goal oriented management.Sometimes little challenging to handle multiple tasks in rush hours.
good,"Good place to work, lots of changes through acquisitions, employee benefits are always improving as the company becomes more stable and successful, a lot of opportunities for mid-level professional advancement."
good,You get out what you put in. I get excellent support from my manager. It's best if you just stick to the handbook when supervising people who are not used to being held accountable for their actions.
good,"Amtrust is a good place to learn the basics of IT but, advancement becomes stunted due to slow processes and limited job diversity. If you are looking to jump start your IT career, I would recommend Amtrust."
good,"Spending all day staring at a screen is not for everyone, but I don't mind it at all. My favorite part of this job is working in teams and being able to communicate with people about many different things, whether it's to gain a better understanding of something or to help solve a problem. Sometimes I have to deal with some difficult people on the phone, but I am a person who is able to keep calm and assist well. I am good at diffusing tense situations and leaving the claimant or whoever is calling us feeling relieved of their issue or concern without causing any more problems."
good,"learned a lot of management styles and ideas, how to approach project management and some of the finer points of the insurance industry"
good,"Worked at the call center at the Cleveland Ohio office. Meet a lot of good people, job was stressful but my co-workers made it tolerable. The call center is no longer at that location so I can't speak for the rest."
good,My typical day at work was selling and underwriting files. The workplace culture was very good and the hardest part of my job was to go fast and still be accurate
good,great managers who value individual contributions to the company. very flexible working around family issues and reward hard work and loyalty. expectations are clear and very manageable
good,Great company to work for. Friendly people to work with and has very good benefits. Given employees a great opportunity to learn new things. It is very relaxing working environment
good,I love the fact that my work family were  team players and Management would also step in at anytime with directions if needed.  I thought it was nice  that the Company had Job work /life balance for those who had small children.   Flex time was also nice to have.
good,"Great management, great pay and benefits. Got to work remotely full time, lots of room for growth and advancement. Lots of offices across the country."
good,"A good place to work, but for me there was a lack of upward mobility.  Therefore, I decided to look for a role that will allow me to use my legal background and business experience in order to work in a more challenging role."
good,"This is a good company, but due to lots of issues with management and even adjuster, the job becomes way more difficult. It is a great opportunity to learn insurance and pays the bills, but that is about it."
good,people team and management very good to work with. internal promotion opportunities and open and friendly environment. assistant sitting next to you helped to work together as a team
good,There is not a lot of micro management as long as you complete the required work. There's not a high incoming call volume which allows you to get more done in the day.
good,"-typical day was busy but manageable "
good,A large cooperation with unlimited ability to maneuver to different areas in the company. Management will work with schedules. The most difficult part is disgruntled customer
good,"The INF/IT floor was a relaxed and fun environment to be in. Everyone was approachable including the Managers and directors. It was the wild west with not much structure, and some of the managers didnt attend to their team members as they should have."
good,"Great place to really dig in and accomplish a lot, good pay and lots of very smart people to work with.  I would recommend working here if you are looking to make and impact, work hard and learn a lot."
good,Great company to work for fast paced work style must be very detailed oriented to progress.  People skills are a must and problem solving along with being able to deal with upset clients.
good,A good place to work if you are just starting out in the work force. decent potential for advancement and great job security. down side is you're working with mostly people fresh out of college so mistakes in code are commonplace.
good,"culture vary base on team. Typical 9 - 5 workday. Lots of new project. Not much on board training but lots of opportunities! overall, not a bad place to work for, especially you are hard worker and looking for quick advancement."
good,This is a great job to have. It definitely teaches you things you might have never known about the insurance world. I've been here 14+ years.
good,Learn to make work more efficient to my co-worker and myself. Learn from management to better train co-workers/new employees.
good,"This company is a great company to work for. this company is growing and expanding ever year. this company gives great work experience but pays a little low. Ive learned alot about using automation tools like QTP, and ive learned a lot about SQl"
good,During my time at AmTrust we had launched and changed many products and systems so adaptability was a must.   I had to learn and approach new problems and figure out answers using a system that was not able to produce the information we needed.  I was always successful in my results and was there to assist our brokers and policy holders directly.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you want to advance, but you have to do your part and work hard to get there. The people and atmosphere is great, someone is always willing to help. We received several extra days off through the year and if you are salary you will have the option to either work from home 3 days a week or do the 10/4 schedule."
good,Originally started off great but there’s a lot of company changes are happening as it relates to their updated business goal and business model. Because of the model a lot of people were laid off nationally. Like hundreds. If you can adapt well to change this job may be the one for you.
good,Amtrust is a fun and enjoyable place to work in. However it is fast paced and are constantly on the phone trying to obtain information from employers and/or doctors to properly provide benefits to the injured employee. Coming from a TPA which only handled City and then County files I believe I grew more as an examiner as I was exposed to working with all types of employees with different types of positions. This gave me the opportunity to understand the broad spectrum that is Work Comp.
good,"The company was a fun workplace. Its a shame they cut off a lot of 'resources', but I guess that was the business strategy that made most sense. What I learned from my time working at this company was that, everyone between top management and lower entry level has an opinion worth listening to. A successful company is one that operates with people that work collectively to obtain a common goal (keeping a company on its legs). This means there is a certain level of pressure on ALL employees to find ways to maximize profits and reduce costs (closing more sales to drive up profit, sharing cost effectively strategies etc.). Labor as well and minds/ideas should be efficiently utilized in all aspects of a corporation. Slackers or departments that are underutilized are an expense to a company, but have the power/choice to change to become an asset. Taking Initiative is what I learned."
good,"I have gained so much experience at this job in the short time I have been here, which is one year. I was able to advance way before my 90 days were up, Went from Title release rep to Title service rep and expect to advance further."

good,"I have enjoyed working for AmTrust and I love the people I work with.  As with anywhere, though, a few bad apples can spoil the barrel.  When my immediate supervisor's boss resigned from his position to accept another role out of state, the management of our department began to take a nose dive.  More and more is now expected from each employee, even to the point where it takes considerable time away from our families.  We are being asked to work holidays and weekends regularly now with no monetary incentive.  While I am certainly willing to work harder and occasionally give up some of my personal time, I cannot sacrifice my family for my job."

This plan involved spending greater than 50% of my time in meetings or workshops where I gathered information or seeked agreement on the contents of the project artifacts that I produced.  the rest of the time, was actual analysis, crunching through spreadsheets of data and traceability matrices, reviewing or writing documentation or working out the optimum way to define a specific need, requirement or process."
