rating,review
bad,"L’ambiance est horrible dans tous les services, on sent un mal être général et du coup les gens sont agressifs , je n’avais qu’une envie le matin en arrivant  c’était de repartir, de m’enfuir en courant."
bad,"Poor management and work environment. Vindictive security director that didn't know what security is all about, but would ask staff to do stuff that have not been thoroughly planned out!"
bad,"ilead is fast paced and busy workplace, everyone is expected to work hard and work lean. The first 3 years that i was there I was moved to 3 different bosses, 3 reorganization and 1 layoff. It's consistently changing and you need to be able to keep up. It gets really stressful when FDA is there which is true for other company that goes to the same process. As far as my department is concern, I like that even the lower level person can speak with higher management and they listen as they are open to ideas. You learn a lot and you can advance if you are eager and willing to follow the company culture, can play politics and go above and beyond your role, there is no balance in your work/life. When I wake up I find email sent late at night, way early in the morning, weekends and sometimes text messages even while on vacation asking me about work which can be communicated in work hours or when I get back, sometimes be given task with very little time to work on or late in the afternoon expected to be done on that day given no option but to stay late, when again this can wait until the next work day. If you are ready for this kind of work process then this place is for you."
bad,"The most discouraging place I ever worked, A company chock full of individuals that are not collaborating, and encourage a trickle down system of information."
bad,I have applied numerous times for positions within Gilead never to receive even a phone interview. I suspect discrimination.
bad,"Be prepared to be a yes person. If you do not agree with them, they will throw you under the bus at first chance to make themselves look good. I don't believe in making yourself look good by making someone else look lousy contractor or FTE. Your work will speak for itself. Quid Pro Quo is the key  (contractor) pays for a manager to fly to an event in India all expenses paid by the contractor which is still at present, working at Gilead working on the same projects and very close with the said manager (Hiking, hanging out, etc.). Then you have family working in the same department, maybe not with the same ""manager"" but under the same department umbrella. From what I understand, Gilead just revamped their compliance department. HR may want to take a look at this as it does upset the work environment, which puts a damper on the department. Employees are not able to be themselves or vent with one another for fear of relative, letting the other know who works for an executive in the same department; therefore, they could lose their job.  We are required to take a course from day one speaking about receiving gifts from both internal and external parties (including contractors) does this only apply to individual employees and contractors?  As for inclusiveness, it is a joke; it is all for show if you don't believe me pull the data on ethnicity, and you will see what for yourself. Managers do not work with you to help you achieve your goals to advance up the ladder, as stated in your one on one reviews. I can't say to work for them or not. But, if you have integrity, you may want to"
bad,"Engagé comme Responsable Transparence au sein du service juridique, j'ai été accueilli d'une manière déplorable par l'ensemble du service dont la manager. "
bad,"This company hires sales managers with no experience.  Some of them don’t even last a year or two.  Goals are unattainable "
bad,Good compensation and benefits but horrible culture and management. They don't care about the well-being of the employees. Nothing matters except that the work gets done - and fast. No flexible working or working from home policy. Very stressful place. Lots of burnout.
bad,"a bunch of bullies, liars, cheaters, thieves.  Very poor quality of people work here from the top to the bottom.  The mgmt is not willing to listen to employees. Do not support their staff."
bad,"The pay is decent here, however, there is a reason most people know someone who worked there. The culture is cut throat, hostile, and resistant to any change. The company has grown significantly over the last few years, but still operates as a small company, with little of the necessary technical infrastructure and minimal cross-departmental cooperation. "
bad,"The managers don't do anything so they expect the entry level workers to work 14-18 hour shifts, money is good but they abuse your hours forsure. Very overwhelming place to work."
bad,Gilead is run by the old timers and it has an horrible reputation and culture. They like to manage by fear and fire people as quickly as they hire them. Thank God the CEO changed recently and will hopefully change the culture by starting to remove the old timers who have no business running a billion dollar business.
bad,"- CYA culture and other atrocious behaviors by Senior and Executive Gilead IT personnel."
bad,Hostile negative workplace. For a company that does so much good it was difficult to reconcile the number of angry bitter employee's I encountered. That's usually a sign of poor leadership.
bad,"Bad Culture, not much support from management. "
bad,"No work life balance.  In my area management is not focused on Quality, just the ability to finish assigned task without looking to see if it is a quality product.  No customer focused, but focused on their checklist"
bad,"This was the best paid job I have had, but the worst working conditions I have ever experienced."
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. Borderline abusive work culture. No room to grow. "
bad,"Gilead is run like a POW camp with leaders who have no respect for the rank and file. Unreasonable demands to cut corners and sharp, abusive treatment is in store for those who question management's orders."
bad,"I would not recommend working there. I found that my work environment was very toxic.  My direct manager would have happy hour in his office daily.  If you did not drink alcohol, you were not part of the 'circle of trust'."
bad,"The first week I worked at Gilead, one of the senior leadership team members, who was on stage at an all-employee event, described working at Gilead as being like climbing Mount Everest without an oxygen mask.  "
bad,"Gilead is an excellent place to make good money and feel good about your product - helping patients with life-threatening illnesses. However, all else (the culture) is toxic beyond what I can explain in the number of characters allotted here. Go in with eyes wide open and have an exit strategy in place from day 1. Don't plan to stay longer than 1-2 years."
bad,Management can never seem to get consensus and consistently changes directions.  They can never stick to the same decision.  With regards to systems people new consistently re-invent the wheel and projects that have been progressing changes again.  This often creates double the work with shorten timelines.
bad,I cannot recommend this company based on its culture and management team.
bad,"Full of politics, nepotism and back stabbing. They talk about culture and all but in reality nothing is followed. One cannot survive unless you have a godfather or godmother or play along with the management. You will have to be a part of a particular ""group"" to be successful. The top leadership is absolutely worthless and quality of people hired and promoted are below par. Hard work is never recognized or rewarded. Good people are leaving and more will follow unless they cleanse the top management."
bad,"+ Good salary and benefits"
bad,"Gilead Sciences does not encourage career mobility, if you stay in one division, you have little chance to move to other division, no matter you are good or not, no matter your skills fit in other division or not."
bad,"Gilead is a great company with great products. It is easy to be proud of what I do here. The working environment, however, is lacking. The pace is relentless. I check email first thing when I wake up and throughout the evening when I get home. My boss often emails me at 10-11 pm at night. There are so many meetings during the day that sometimes you have to work in the evening just to get things done. When problems arise, I do not feel I have the support of my management. I agree with the review that it is a toxic environment. I have been here 3 years and will not be here much longer."
bad,"GSI has a very noble objective; but worst management; "
bad,"Facilities were very old, process equipment was not up to date in terms of functionality or technology."
bad,Culture promotes competition among internal groups. There is lot of internal politics. Management favoritism is common. They prefer hiring externally than promoting employees. They treat their vendors as servants and ridicule them publicly.
bad,"I took this role as an inbetween with not much desire to stay on long term just because of my unique individual set up, but I learned a lot in the role while I was there.  Management was just less than ideal."
bad,"Very dog eat dog. Little to no mentorship is provided or encouraged.  Management has no time for you and pushes any items you may have off on your contract company when they should work with you to be aware of in depth project status."
bad,"Easy to get in and very easy to get fired. Management are not following the cGMP requirements and expecting you to follow it."
bad,"They just don't get it in terms of searching outside of company for fresh talent/skills.  NEPOTISM all the time, all they way!"
bad,Especially those with high skill sets such as myself. They are not going to hire me full time. So what is the use of wasting time on them.  They have long hours and it is a get it done yesterday type of culture.
bad,Contractors get used to do work most of the permanent associates don't want to do. Management doesn't step in to make sure work is balanced or contractors are treated professionally.
bad,Like working with some of the guys but management is cut throat and if your not on there team your job is on the line.  You start off at a certain rate and expect to stay there.
bad,"The company fosters managing up and squishing the workers.  Great products and scientists, but the management is terrible.  If you are not in the right clique, you are toast.  The work/life balance is not good as you are expected to be on 24hr call."
bad,"Very clicky environment, although each dept. and “team” has to work symbiotically with each other a clear line is drawn between departments and worse in the manager/employee dynamic."
bad,"The pay at this company is high but the requirement demanded of the number of hours is unacceptable. They expect you to be available on the phone for 24 hours and to show up whenever they need you to. The management system is terrible as well since they ""play politics"" with each other, and by that I mean that they favor people in a higher position above them. Yet, with regular co-workers, they are treated as if they have not been working alongside them for as long as they can remember. In this company, what they hire you for is what they need you for. No other knowledge is obtained from working at this company. Overall, the working environment is stressful and if you are looking for a friendly, peaceful, and optimistic workplace, this is not the company for you. However, if earning money is the goal, then go for it."
bad,"no mistakes,work like a robot"
bad,Depending on the division your in makes a difference in the job culture you are subjected to.  IHD is the red headed step child of the organization and is treated poorly.  Minimal support for Managed Care Contracting.
bad,"The company is stable with excellent products. Good benefits and  "
bad,"If you are a golden child you will climb quick and love working here- the good ole boys club is alive and well. However, if you aren't it will be like cycling through mud while towing a yack."
bad,"It's been six yrs since I worked there, however at the time the facilities department had the highest turnover rate than any other group.  I understand there has been a house cleaning since then."
bad,Employees watch each other. Will try to undermine each other. Do not feel managers are up to par for the job. Enjoyed some interactions but as a whole the experience was not very pleasant.
bad,"total lack of management. no communication. no roles and responsibilities. in a continuous improvement world, they rule with fear, and will not accept free thinkers. great place for a robot to work."
bad,The people and policies reflect a culture that is toxic to professionals. Asking questions is prohibited and career advancement is at the expense of personal dignity
bad,"Stable work environment, but the job scope diversity is not good. If you stay at Gilead for years, you will be adept at a scoped skill which only translates to working for another large pharma corporation. Moving to a smaller company, you may find that the narrow scope of skills learned at Gilead will have you ill prepared for working in an environment requiring a diversity of skills."
bad,"I have to assume it is because of the growth of the company that the Gilead has become disassociated with its employees and no longer takes care of them like they used too.  The culture has changed and many good people , with much experience, have left the company because of this.. management has also been up and down, in my many years of working at Gilead I have experienced very bad management who focuses more on your whereabouts than your work ethics and production.  It is truly sad to see what Gilead has become at least in my department, Gilead is a very big company.   So many people would excel in this company if they focused on merit rather than micromanaging other aspects of life not related to work."
bad,"All work, all the time. Ridiculous goals. No support resources to accomplish any of this. If you leave work at 7 at night and get back in at 5 the next morning, but didn't check your email while you were gone, be prepared to be berated because some VP needed some metric in the middle of the night (literally) and you didn't get it to him fast enough."
bad,Not a place to go to develop in a role. You are on your own. There is a very negative company culture that applauds over working until the point of burn out.
bad,"Gilead is so fast paced they are always chasing their tail. They are so lean to the point where it is hurting the business and the people keeping it afloat. At that point I say it is no longer lean but rather anorexic. Gilead will need to start investing inward if they want to turn the corner and become a more stable and well-balanced company. Until then there will continue to be burnout, high turnover, and complacency with ""good enough""."
bad,"Ok to work there if you just mind your own business.  But if you don't have a good manager on your side, you're going to be working your butt off for nothing."
bad,"Great products, great pipeline, too much hard driving toward the goals.  There needs to be a more grown-up approach to drug development because the scale of a start-up can't apply to a mature company."
bad,"Worked at the company for almost 8 years, and didn't how horrible the culture was until I left and started at a normal company. Upper management encourages lying to staff, promotions with in are rare and when it happens is not based on merits but being liked by a small group of upper management. Good people are fired or pushed out on weekly basis. Once you leave, Gilead is known to contact your new employer and bad mouth you."
bad,"I appreciated working at Gilead because it taught me of the company culture that I do not want to work for.  I was there several months when I had the epiphany that this place was not a fit for my well being.  I noticed that pockets throughout the entire organization had management issues.  It was not unique to my group.  Knowing I had choice in the matter, I decided to leave after a year.  It may be a great place to work for someone."
bad,Great company but workplace culture is not great in IT. very hierarchical and managers do not  want to provide visibility. The most enjoyable is the office located close to the coast which is beautiful.
bad,high cost of living in area and company compensation does not keep pace with other pharaoh companies in the area.   Upper management review of all decisions.  Small company organization even though company is growing.  Management does not want to hear about new ideas.
bad,"Gilead is fast paced and busy workplace, everyone is expected to work hard and work lean. The first 3 years that i was there I was moved to 3 different bosses, 3 reorganization and 1 layoff. It's consistently changing and you need to be able to keep up. It gets really stressful when FDA is there which is true for other company that goes to the same process. As far as my department is concern, I like that even the lower level person can speak with higher management and they listen as they are open to ideas. You learn a lot and you can advance if you are eager and willing to follow the company culture, can play politics and go above and beyond your role, there is no balance in your work/life.

If you are ready for this kind of work process then this place is for you."
bad,"Learn team work, management. Different people from the different background and cultures. very big team, so learning from different perspectives. very busy workplace"
bad,I only took the job do to I needed to work they did no training and no expelantion  of anything  and they don't let you know if you are doing a good job or not you come home and the agency calls you and says don;t come back  if you forget anything  personal too bad
bad,"Still using windows 7 and Java 6"
bad,The rating is specifically to my experience and department but there was little to no organization. Organization charts and binders for board meetings were put together sometimes the morning of which meant for high stress. It could have been prevented if most supplies were prepared in advance then last minute changes would be accounted for. Little things like reserving conference rooms were done with paper sign up sheets instead of electronically.
bad,"Gilead is a great place to develop in your career and learn really fast. Depends on who your manager is, it can be a really great place to work (work hard) and learn. There is a very slow promotion process. Even if you ace your annual review every year, that could probably get you promoted in 4-5 years. The respect is a big issue at Gilead, although the culture is changing in the right direction."
good,"still operates as a typical old school firm. no wfh opportunity, a lot of red and resistance to change. no free meals only subsidized. no gym reimbursements."
good,"Fast paced but does not provide rewards, does not allow for advancements in career, held back, blame is put on person rather than advancing process, management have poor managing skills, consistently told you are expendable"
good,"The benefits and stock options here are great but the company culture and work life balance are pretty bad. Most employees are doing the work of 3 people and it is impossible to work just a normal 8 hours day. The workload is not only heavy but very demanding as alot of the work is very urgent. "
good,"data migration project . used sql and excel.  Gilead is working on migrating the sources of different formats like flat files, word, excel ( Gvault) to one Oracle database (GPLM)"
good,"Productive place, I learned a lot in the past 2 1/2 years. A very fast paced environment than most companies I have worked for. The management is fair."
good,Its the regular manufacturing grind. Follow your SOPs and you'll make it home knowing mistakes made were by the person writing the instructions an not you
good,"Start up mentality in a larger company.  Having growing pains, but doing well in the market.  It's an exciting place to be, but they definitely need a stronger middle management layer to come in to take them to the next level."
good,"I had a horrible experience with my line manager who was a newly minted Assoc Director. She was difficult, vindictive and unfair. "
good,"Conservative, slow moving and very corporate. High employee turn around. Tense work environment full of redundancies and management tight grip. Carrot and stick, high school culture."
good,"great - just very top heavy. Credibility on the basis of title. behind on technology and new ways of doing things. not open with all information."
good,Fast pace environment. Lack of leadership and decision making. No opportunities for growing. Difficult to get into their kingdom. Old culture lead the company
good,Most of my career was working in a start-ups environment so when I started working at Gilead I thought working for large organization would be less stressful but that wasn't the case. The corporate structure was very isolating and interaction with your co-workers was not encouraged.
good,"Gilead is leading the world in designing the drugs to help cure some of the worst diseases in the world but needs a lot of help on internal organization.  Company is still run like it has on 2000 employees.  Not a lot of cross-functioning between departments, each department works their own pace and no one is on the same page."
good,"Gilead could be very exciting place to work but since all BIO Tech firms has to follow strict guidelines of the FDA can make it very not so fun place to work."
good,Company in great location and has amazing products.  When you first begin employment you have a passion for the company but as time goes on you realize there is more work/life balance for some then others.
good,"In order to succeed you must have a Godfather or Godmother in the company.  They speak about inclusion but if you are not part of the ""click"" you are not noticed or promoted.  To many layers of upper management and not enough lowe-tier employees to perform the work expected."
good,"Gilead is a great company,  and does amazing things to help patients with many diseases live longer.  The work culture is one of working non stop.  The demand the most out of there employees being a lean company.  The perks at Gilead are great. Lunch cafeteria in multiple buildings, a gym, benefits are 2nd to none."
good,"The work environment is very lean, there are always things to do and most associates perform like entry level PHd's.Overall good place to work the people there are top notch and very talented."
good,Politics has played a big role in hiring unqualified personnel resulting in numerous delays and production mishaps. It is still a good place to work if you come in referred by someone from the inside.
good,"A typical day at work is a mixed bag of  lulls and a deluge of challenging tasks."
good,"One of the positive attributes about this company is the stock performance.  The stock has been going up for a while and the company is solid financially.  As far as career advancement, you have limited options.  The company rarely hires/promotes from within and tends to hire external people.  Once you are in, you have to leave to advance your career.  A lot of people leave Gilead after 3-4 years, they feel stuck.  The culture is harsh - swim or sink.  That said, most people are friendly, polite and easy to work with."
good,"Working remotely largely depends on which department you work in even though Gilead has a policy that allows working remotely and flexible work hours.  The culture is extremely different across the company.  It depends on the manager that has been there 10+ years.  The mentality is if it worked for us when we were 300 employees of course it will work with 8k employees so why change.  The good thing is the new CEO, he is making several changes and I believe this will strengthen the company tremendously."
good,Working at Gilead helped me improve me gain more knowledge about project management and GDPR. I was able to interact with colleagues from different countries and learn about local differences.
good,"The senior level management are very strong, However, mid level management didn't work out well. Low level managers and analysts suffer. Overall, workplace culture wasn't favorable, and analyst works were not appreciated."
good,"Fun really depends on your department.  Some can be fun, but some are dreadfully boring.  The benefits are very good.  I'm talking amazing 401k match, stock options, and other perks here and there.  But the culture does not allow for work/life balance.  Gilead tends to run lean, and people are more often than not, overworked.  Management plays the entire suck up game and some management don't know what they are doing."
good,"Great products and technology. Management sometimes are aggressive due to lack of skills and experience, but not all of them. The culture within the management is to yell at you, no respect. Paycheck is Ok, no life."
good,productive work environment with great coworkers and poor leadership. The organization is struggling to find its way from an organization that has been hyper focused on an HIV commercial and scientific model
good,"Generally speaking, this company's compensation policy is low for full-time as well as contractors.  They hire a lot of contractors to do work from all levels.  The campus is nice but after having worked there for a little while, not an inducement due to low compensation.  General corporate culture is nice (nice people, decent managers), but because they hire a lot of contractors, can add or lose workforce at will.  Interview process was fast.  I was given offer in less than two weeks and started work within three weeks."
good,"I learnt a lot while at Gilead Sciences, though my tenure was short. The  PMO office has excellent guidelines and it is easy for a new person coming on board to navigate and come up to speed. It is a  hard core waterfall SDLC company. I does not allow any remote work though."
good,"There is job security for full time employees, yet contractors are left undervalued and there is a clear distinction between full time and contractors in terms of treatment and opportunity."
good,"fast paced environment, high expectations, not enough work life balance, no WFH policy, different rules for different folks, not enough focus on employee development from managers due to pace of organization (managers themselves are swamped, and don't always know or have patience to understand employee's needs),  not always objective, emphasis  how one's image is portrayed to the team rather than collaborative approach of working together towards common goal, significant turn-over within organization"
good,It is always a wonderful time working with this organization. The staff are welcoming & energetic. Facilitators are knowledgeable of information presented.
good,enjoyed the role and the people. great career progression. lots of policies to learn and great london location . friendly co-workers and great team building exercises
good,Too many chiefs and indians are not led well due to redundant management positions. The company grew really fast and direction of IT was lost in the process.
good,"The workplace is okay and some of the managers are not goal oriented. "
good,"micromanaged  company, no direction, fear driving factor and poor upper management.  Learn as you go as there is no communication between internal staff"
good,"Excellent group to learn CMO management and API manufacturing"
good,"I have learning attitude to learn new thing always.Productive ata work and good time management skills to complete the work on time. "
good,Good place to work. Very fast paced. No Work From Home culture. Sometimes gets pretty stressful. Management does not trust employees. Pay scale is low as well
good,"Work-life balance is manageable, learn a lot of big company dynamics at Gilead. Happy hours every Friday, which includes free food, desert and drinks."
good,"Gilead was a good place, wish I could've worked past my year, but they were admant about keeping you for only a year."
good,You don't get enough support to make your job easy.  You have to be very active to obtain information that you need for your job.  There is no adequate training that will make you successful.
good,"It's good working environment with all the collegue shares their thoughts and try to resolve if thee is any issue , so that delivery can be done schedule."
good,The place where i used to work is so nice and the colleagues were very good.They are very supportive and i really enjoyed working with them.
good,Fast growing company with small company mentality.  Constantly feeling understaffed.  Many employees have to take on multiple roles all the time.  Too many directors / managers who only directs.
good,"Wednesday bagel days is the best!  This is a very busy place, but the co-workers are amazing."
good,"Good company when one comes on as a new-hire, and will be considered ""one of us""."
good,"Good company, great benefits, but not focused on people."
good,"Company runs very lean and IT management is not mature to operate under lean workload. No employee reward, management is disconnected with individual contributors."
good,"Overall, I love working at Gilead.  I love the people. I love the products. I love the work they do in emerging markets and indigent domestic markets."
good,"Gilead's culture is visible throughout the company globally.  It is highly outsourced, limited in resources, and tons of work.  Great for A type personalities."
good,Summer internship is a fun period. Lot of events and meet ups. But have to build a project and present a poster at the end of the internship. So be prepared
good,"Working here was good at first but after a few months it started to get pretty tedious. Work/life balance was not good at all, you practically live there."
good,"I enjoyed the fist 11 years at Gilead. The management team at time was excellent. I have a great deal of respect for my mentors during those 11 years."
good,Compensation was good however they had a lot of management changes when I worked there. The competition for roles got ugly and the expectation for performance was really off balance. Some people were treated really well and others were treated very poorly.
good,This is a so so place to work. There are a lot of vendors companies in Gilead. Vendor companies make the resources work like crazy. The client is good to work
good,"Timelines can be too tight and too much work is expected for a given time period.  Gilead wants their products to be the first on the market and you suffer a little because of that strong desire. However, they have great products and a great pipeline"
good,"Gilead is a competitive company. A mostly young workforce with a demanding schedule. My job demanded lots of travelling whether NY to SF or by car through the NYC area. Computer skills a must. As it was said in my organic chemistry class ""if you can't cut the mustard you can't cut the cake"". The benefits and education are spectacular. So if you're ready and able to dig in your heels it will be a great experience."
good,"Great company, great pay, great benefits. It is also a very fufilling knowing you are part of the ""bigger picture"" and contribute to improving patients’ lives."
good,"Working on site as a contractor is not ideal."
good,"45 miles door to door under the worst traffic conditions. Sometimes 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours."
good,"- Built a great team who were effective despite restrictive management. "
good,"Depending on the department you contract with, you could have either erratic 80 hour workweeks or just a straight 40 hours."
good,"Gilead is an incredibly successful company due to the products that is created for medical diagnosis that have been unmet. However they had historically staffed"
good,The work done was very important cause it was for the well being of patients who where sick. Had to always be on top of what we did and make sure that we did it right
good,"Gilead is a machine for getting drugs through the development pipeline.  There are always multiple drugs in the pipeline and the work is geared very much toward pushing the drug forward, or stopping the program."
good,"Gilead does a good job letting you work on many different projects, but there is no company culture that promotes a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment at work."
good,"In the pharmaceutical industry, each day is different. This helps you to develop your abilty to make a plan and have an alternate course of action. I have been a part of management and my greatest strenght is to focus on the company goals rather than personal goals. Co-workers make the team. You should try to learn from them and work as a cohesive TEAM. The hardest part of the job is reacting to mechanical failures. The most enjoyable part of the job in the pharmaceutical industry is helping people using therapeutic processes"
good,"Good place to work.  Fair compensation, flexible timetables, productive work environment, friendly people, great company culture and overall work environment."
good,The people are wonderful. They pay well and I love the mission of the company.Great fast paced environment with a performance based reward culture. workbalance
good,"Lean by design is a phrase heard often at Gilead and it is true. Individual in Finance needs to manage up, support C-level executives with their strategies and objectives, and be able to work details and system, budget load and accrual. It is a demanding working environment."
good,"It is a great company to work for with lots of opportunities to learn and multitask. Although management may need to improve, overall it is a good company."
good,"It is good company for working. Good environment. QC environment is very good, lab instrumentation is very good. This lab is good for learning new things in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company."
good,Cannot disclose details of my position. Position was at a new location. Work ethic is good but people that work there don't really have a personality.
good,"Worked as an intern and enjoyed the people, atmosphere, and campus. I did not feel that it was an overly stressful environment and found my coworkers happy to help."
good,"Gilead is a biopharmaceutical company based in Northern California with over 10,000 employees with a large percentage of the workforce is temporary or long-term contract. If you plan on working for Gilead as a permanent employee I would tell you not to apply through one of the contracting agencies as a contractor. It is rare for Gilead to convert contract workers into full-time employees at Gilead. Even though you will be told that from time to time contractors are converted to full-time employees at Gilead it is a rare event and in most cases, they will just continue renewing your contract for years without  end in sight"
good,Great experience.  I learned a lot as a supply chain analyst intern and  my supervisors were great mentors and support.  Interesting time working at San Dimas site when acquisition and commercialization of Hep C franchise began.
good,Gilead is a great company to work for. It has very compassionate and positive people working there. The folks I supported were top notch and treated others with respect and understanding.

good,Gilead wanted to expand their portfolio beyond antivirals--unfortunately they underestimated how much money and or time it takes chronic indications like cardiovascular medicines to be run through trials and quickly lost interest --or at least just wanted their ROI and pull out of CO

good,One of the best experiences working with Gilead Sciences. I appreciate the job culture here. Great people to work with. I'll defiantly recommend Gilead Sciences for work.
good,Good pay but required burnout.  People were good to work with.  Housing was expensive.  Weather was good.  Silicon valley is good to put on resume.
good,"Big company, very silo'd, not a great work/life balance, but depends on your team."
good,"Gilead is the market leader in the HIV space-and has always done well by the community from which they benefit.  In recent years, with the focus on other Tasks (HCV, Onc) the company has grown and potentially gotten to far away from those they serve.  They talk about being patient centric-which is the true trend in rare diseases-but oftentimes fall short of the mark.  Of interest, HIV continues to be their main income generator but resources seems to go elsewhere.  This works in the short term while the market leader-but may come back to hurt them in the next 31-5 years."
good,The company is expanding and building new offices and remodeling many buildings. They have good cafeterias and many options for all. They usually have happy hour on Fridays.

good,In charge of stocking of areas with needed tools and supplies. Performed technician duties as transffering solutions to controlled environment. I learned team work is important in a productive environment. My co workers at this location was one of the best experiences I had everyone in my shift got along and helped each other whenever we needed help to finish the process quicker and and most importantly do the process correctly. Hardest part of my job was to get into a non sterile suit usually that took about ten to fifteen minutes to get into because of the slow process you had to go through to not have a high level of bacteria sent into the sterile room we had to work in. Management communicated the facility performance very well in month end meetings which included a buffet for all employees to feast on. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I worked with co workers that taught me alot and helped me out alot to know how to trouble shoot in certain departments or machines.

good,"My group was new when I joined Gilead. My group lacked direction and leadership. Our Director was a lame duck that liked to search the internet for Giants tickets. I really liked the company but I felt the lack of leadership in my dept. would end with my job disolving. So I found another job outside of Gilead."
good,"go to safety meetings, complete walk thrus for the whole QC department, control the enviorment on a saftey note"

I learned and honed my quality assurance skills such as coordinating with contract manufacturers on deviations, CAPAs, and change controls.

The most difficult part of the job was managing and prioritizing all of the urgent requests."

good,"- It is a good company"
good,"Gilead was fast paced and the work voluminous, but I thrive on being busy and challenged so it was fine. The lean working style meant you got to expand your role further than you might in other companies, but the down side of that was there was sometimes a lot of deadlines much in a short space of time. So long as you worked with your manager, it was often doable. "
good,"I was originally brought on as a Front-End Developer, however after working with management and assessing user needs based on UX analysis methods it was clearly evident that the current UI wasn't addressing the complex user needs.

good,Overall a great place to work.  Salary/benefits are good and the people are great.  Promotion process is sometimes more political than merit based.
