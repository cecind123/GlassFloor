good,"I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom. It was a fun relaxed place to work during the non-sale months, and during the sale months it was hectic and kind of fun to try and keep up with a never ending line of customers. I enjoyed the managers there who always kept work fun and found ways to keep people busy. The hardest part was when there was nothing to do right after the sales. The most enjoyable part was how well everyone got a long in the department."
good,Nordstrom is a really great place to work. Management is awesome and the overall atmosphere is energetic and positive. Loved working there. You get a discount on clothes which is a plus.

good,"You have a series of tasks that need to be done by the end of the day. They treated you like an adult and as long as the task was completed correctly, you were free to work in your own way, without you getting in anyone's way. You can only advance up the ranks within the company, and there are plenty of opportunities given to you. The management was very fair and helped their employees be the best they could be. There was a lot of heavy lifting, which could be quite tiring by the end of the day, but it was still a great place to work"

good,"We would open seven days a week to provide a relaxed and cozy environment for busy shoppers and foodies, providing lush cocktails and American comfort food to soothe the weary soul. "
good,"It's fast paced, competitive, always changing. The culture is what makes this company and is enjoyable. The down side is the hours needed to be successful, work/life balance, and for some roles extensive travel."
good,I also opened the store it was fun being around my managers they would listen if I needed to talk we were like family I loved my customers they would always come back
good,"typical day at work selling clothes I learned great customer service there, management some of them is lazy, workplace is good, hardest part is returns, and enjoyable part of work is people shopping, great pay."

good,"The Grill at Nordstrom trained me as a cook from the ground, up. I left with several merit raises and there is definitely room to move up after proving your worth, While rushes could be stressful and it was often busy, the kitchen staff were all very team oriented and did their jobs well ( a rarity in many kitchens)."

good,"I worked on a commission based salary which I really loved because it really allows me to make my own paycheck by wardrobing clients and maintaining close relationships with my experience. Nordstrom created a very welcoming environment for the employees as well as the customers by allowing us to be ourselves, dress freely, and bond with customers."
good,"Lovely place to work, the culture is fun.  Only area of opportunity is the commission structure with returns. With shoppers doing more online shopping it effects your pay"
good,"It was a fabulous work environment, I loved being a part of the staff there and getting the opportunity to get to know hundreds of new people in the staff there, as well as customers and their interests, personal stories, upcoming events in their lives, etc. The competitive nature of the sales environment was not acidic, the workplace was friendly all around and it was a remarkable experience for myself. I throughly enjoyed working there and am grateful for the opportunity, it was was great deal of information to have in merchandising, sales, fashion & design, light tailoring, loss prevention, and customer service."
good,The customer always comes first at Nordstrom.  They train employees that the customer is always right.  And at Nordstrom the employee is trained to make their own decisions regarding customers.  This is a very comfortable way to work.  The management trusts that their employees know what they are doing.  It is rewarding for the employees.
good,I worked for Nordstrom for a little under 10 years in both full and the rack devision. Great place for advancement and opportunities to better your skills. The open door policy allows you to learn from more people than just your manager.
good,"It is a very competitive and challenging ambiance but once you have proven your skills and abilities opportunity for growth is abundant."
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a company that takes care of the employees and rewards them as such. A very rewarding job.  Starting your day off making sure it's ""store ready"". Most enjoyable part is meeting and helping customers needs. Hardest part is an 8 hour shift existing of nothing but the ""go backs"" and unable to help or do anything else. Management is superb. They are hand picked and I see why. Very personable people."
good,"One of my favorite company ever. Management is really awesome , respectful , friendly.  I really enjoy working in this company. A lot of private sales, promotion, bonus for employee"
good,had to anticipate customer high sales on a daily basis to be sure to meet quota. Moving from department to department created an exciting challenge each day.
good,"It was good job for some in good shape and energetic. If you want loose weight its  a great job for that, and its extremely fast pace. There is opportunity to move up this job is about numbers and attendance. So your willing to work that fast then its the job for you.. The younger you are the better."
good,Excellent place to work with great support for individual success. Opportunities at the company are limitless and management is always on your side. Nordstrom empowers its employees to deliver the best results through service and salesmanship. Environment is inherently competitive and volume of specific location varies the degree of pressure to follow high standards of service.
good,This is a good job to build your skills. I loved working here.  There is a lot of room to move around and for growth.  The overtime is mandatory and there is a lot of  it.
good,"- good management"
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work! The culture was fantastic! Management cared for it employees and the open door policy was comforting. They were always willing and helpful in moving you up with in the company.
good,"My first week working at Nordstrom's Rack was very stressful, not only did I not have a ton of experience in a face-paced retail environment, the manager was not present the first week. However the other managers were encouraging, and helped me out a lot. A few polices were never explained to me, and did not present their policy book to me until after I had made mistakes. Fortunately they did not take out this mistake on me, for the lack of guidance was on their part. In other words they realized it was their mistake not mine. I found the staff to be courteous, and not demeaning to the ""lower status"" workers (myself). Overall I enjoyed working there, and would recommend it as a first time job, it was not easy, but it was fulfilling at the end of the day.  It was on the job training, and was a crash course in the retail world. I left Nordstrom's Rack due to conflicts with my schooling, and the distance from my school/ home, otherwise I would have tried to stay with this company."
good,"open & close, building up clientele, assist customer with there shopping needs.. what i learned Good Customer service.. management team togetherness, notting is hard about this job..working with the crew i have, we work as one big happy family.. work place culture, one of the best company to work for.You have Job Security, You have Job advancement if wanting to Pursue in Management, They promote within& also you can change from different Departments... They Value on Good Customer Service"
good,"Great environment, enjoyed working with all the amazing customers and co workers. Fun vibes all around the store, and try to make everyone feel as welcomed as possible."
good,"A workplace where you must take the initiative. Everyday there, you will be receiving your own individual sale goals and the department sale goals.There are given tactics on how to sell to a customer, but if you have your own ways in being persuasive then try it. It's a place that shows great customer service. You'll be meeting a lot of new people from around the world who are traveling or just stay in the area. Amazing coworkers , in your department everyone's a team, but still a commission based job. So you must strive for the top and try to make as much sales as you can get in a day. You will love selling because once a customer is pleased then you are pleased. It's like very big accomplishment and you will be recognized for your hard work. Give or take I'll give the job a 9.5/10."
good,"-Meet sales goals"
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom  , great customer service "
good,It was great!  Enjoyed working at Nordstrom very much.  I knew it was temporary and so did my supervisor.    Left when I was able to move away.  It was a fabulous year!
good,It was a really competitive but fun environment.  Everyone is motivated to get their commission so they work hard and provide great service to the customers.  Great opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"Great work environment, meeting with new and interesting people on a daily, build lasting relationships with customers is the highlight. "
good,"Nordstrom is a fantastic company to work for, anyone can tell you that they put associates first and sales second. We're all one big family, the manager get to know you on a personal level rather than just someone that happens to work there. Your voice is heard, the progress of the company relies on what associates think what will work. The associates know their store, they know what works and what doesn't. The higher ups rely on what we have to say to know how to make the company work like a well oiled machine. Customer service is everything, you get so invested in your customers (their needs as well as their lives) that those customers will seek you out because they know the level of customer service you provide."
good,"The company is very competitive with sales goal and is a perfect fit for any one who isn't afraid to do well and achieve set goals. Management was excellent, understanding and was able to work with my full time school schedule."
good,"This is one of the best companies you can ever work for. The work life balance can be a tad hectic but, to a degree, it comes with the retail territory. The room for growth is huge and management wants nothing more than to see their employees succeed."
good,"A typical day working at Nordstrom Rack is fun and busy at the same time, everyday you meet a different kind of customer than you met the previous day and its mostly always a great experience being able to help give them whatever they are need of. I learned working there that you can't treat every customer the same because their all different you should always be pleasant no matter how they may come off because the customer is always right."
good,GREAT PLACE TO WORK IF YOU'RE INTO FASHION! You'll make good connections and experience different kinds of people. Pay is above average for retail and benefits. Uplifting work environment. Family-oriented.
good,"There is never a typical day at work. Nordstrom is not just your ordinary retail store. The services and products that they sell are of the highest quality. Management is present and promotes the ""Open Door Policy"". The hardest part of the job is working on holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships you build with customers and the life-long friendships you create with fellow employees-including management."
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom, the team work and management was great and they were very passionate about customer service. My skills in communication and customer service grew tremendously with this company."

good,"Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for and I have truly enjoyed the years I have spent there. They were really flexible with my ever changing class schedule which was very important to me as I had to work and go to school. This company takes great care of all it's employees from the ground up, even matching your retirement funds. Nordstrom as a whole should be a role model for all other department stores on how to treat your customers. Their customer service is impeccable and part of the Nordstrom Culture."
good,It's great working at home and the job is pretty easy. They are really flexible with your schedule and if you do well they offer and monday through friday shift with weekends off. Pay is good considering the job is pretty simple.
good,"The company itself is really great to work for and requires great customer service experience. A typical day at work consists of learning product knowledge, creating lasting relationships with the customers and selling. There is so much that can be learned working for this company and I would recommend anyone interested in the fashion industry to start here."
good,"Nordstrom rack is a fun, and great place to work for. Great opportunity for advancement. Management is great. All in all my experience at nordstrom rack is great."
good,Love meeting new people and making it easier for them to find what they need. Co workers are helpful and friendly. Positive environment; store manager and department manager keeps up with the people they hire and make sure they feel welcomed and learn all required procedures for work.
good,"It was something new and challenging for me. The only problem was that it was a lite bit far for me. The environment was perfect, nice people and everyone work as a team supporting each other. I really recommend this job to everyone. This is a really good place to work, and a really big and new company in Toronto, so your changes to grow up inside the company are really big."
good,"they do allot of their employee, and people there just so friendly and caring, miss them all. if my husband didn,t get posted I would of stayed there for ever"
good,"long, professional, friendly environment while competitive, terrible or great management. great high energy, highly motivated, very welcoming sales team"
good,"A typical day at work will start off with learning about our goals and what was viewed in our morning valley. As a sales associate, our focus at Nordstrom is to give great customer service. We work to please every single customer who shop with us and we live by our product. We have to make it our duty that all of our customers are served in a well mannered time period, with a great experience to share with others. Our customers are our priority and we have to make sure that they are completely happy. Working on commission can be very challengeable at times, especially when it is slow because everyone wants to help the same customer. The good thing about working at Nordstrom on commission, is that we create relationships and bonds with our customers. It is great to connect with them to see what their interests are and learn about they like. These relationships create future memorable friendships, that will keep the connection strong. I love making customers happy and when I receive recognition for my hard work and dedication, it warms my heart. I am there every day because of my customers."
good,"Pretty easy job I worked in the women's fitting room, helping women to their fitting rooms.I learned skills to deal with upset customers and work under a very busy environment. I liked this job so much because I loved the store."
good,I stay very busy at work an love it. I have great coworkers which help make work fun. I have learned so many things and met some amazing people while there.
good,"Everyone has the same job even though the titles are different, its all about the customers. Make sure they are well taken care of. Know the products, understand the daily, weekly, and monthly goals set. Be excited about your job."
good,"provided excellent customer service, ensured schematics and organize the stock room. Merchandised the sale's floor and opened Nordstrom credits card."
good,"A typical day at work would be some light back stock work, talking to and greeting customers. Management there is awesome and I still keep in touch with both my old supervisor and manager. I learned so much about the fashion industry and the upcoming lines. It was always fun being surrounded by it and people who enjoy Fashion as much as I do. My co workers and I got along great (of course not everyday was great) but at the end of the day we all supported each other on our goals. The hardest part about this job would have to be completing a certain goal on a very slow day (since we are all commission) but nothing was ever impossible."
good,"Great company, strong core value's. As a sales professional with Nordstrom I've have had the ability to transfer from  the Cleveland full line store to Tampa working in the same department as before. Based on my Merits I have achieved the Pacesetters and Star Awards."
good,"Best company that I have had the privilege of working for. The compensation is generous for the work that we are expected to give. The company really wants the employees to grow and provide several avenues to climb down the ladder depending on where you'd like to go. Commission based salary can get competitive, but the business is healthy so it's not difficult to make good money."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for almost 5 years, it was the best company that i've ever worked for. the managers are amazing the owners are involved and it basically feels more like a family than a company. The take care of their employees and they make sure that you are recognized if you deserve to be. They will keep an employee before a manager if the manager is a ""bad egg"" this company will weed out the bad in order to only have goood."
good,Great work place overall! Everyone makes sure you are comfortable and ready for work. Typical day is very smooth with few to little incidents. The company as a whole is like family I speak with almost everyone. Best part of work is seeing my team and working on us.
good,"The work day was something I looked forward to having. Job was seen as being fun. Typical day at work went by quickly and was enjoyable. I learned how to interact with customers and to put the client first; to restock sales racks; and place orders from the store. The managers of the department I was a part of where very positive to everyone, from co-workers to the clients."
good,"A typical day at work is re-merchandising the sales floor , placing new products and setting department goals for the day. I learned to have a success you have to coach and delegate in order to have control and  be successful. Management is a big responsibility because your running a business of your own with other employees under you. Word of advice is to use your best judgement and always put your customers first. Also make sure your taking of your employees as well. Remember your team reflects you.My co-workers are very productive and their great to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of the customer and merchandising to their likability to drive sales."
good,"-typical work day consists of a lot of moving and customer interaction"

Most enjoyable, meeting and helping different people with cosmetics/ skincare."
good,"I really enjoyed to work in Nordstrom and team helped each other.  I learned how to discuss with many customer at store and they ordered online. I was responsibility to bring all materials to give co-worker who take of care . Also, I got instruction from my manager that they wanted me to things.  That all managers feel satiated."
good,"Love working here, they make it so easy for you to move up and move forward in this company.  They also make sure to reward you for all the little things that are done in a daily task.

good,"I always felt very taken care of by upper management and HR. I adored my department A typical day would consist of me evaluating my progress for the week/month and chack my e-mails to determine my tasks for the day. Aside from being able to make your own schedule, it was very open to allow you to decide how you wanted to make your business. Although we were a team we worked as individuals as well to gain the highest amount of revenue we could for our company."
good,"As far as retail companies go, this is an exceptional company. The room for growth is uncapped, as long as you are willing to relocate with the company. The culture of the company is the biggest draw- employee health and happiness is definitely important to the company! I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a job in retail."

good,"I go in and get to work grab my radio and start unloading my truck, the people are very helpful and kind managment will help you and are easy to work with."
good,Great company. Everyone is friendly but not overwhelmingly in your face. They give you all the information you need to know to succeed and every manager from the department manager to the regional manager has an open door policy to be available for you at any time. Commission sales means you should be at least somewhat of a people person motivated to make money but if that isn't your style you probably aren't looking to work in retail anyway.
good,"This company was wonderful. Very pleasant to work for. The enviroment was always peaceful. The management was very open and honest, but also very helpful. They did look out for their co-workers as well as their employees. The hardest part about this job was the high demand for the ever changing fashion, and keeping everything updated to the lastest fashion. Like I said, this was an amazing company to work for!!"
good,i love the company! The associates at the store works as a team to provide the best experience for any customer.

good,"A typical day as a Customer Service Manager for Nordstrom involves scheduling, organizing, time management, communicating with your department for completion of daily task, cleaning, creative thinking, coaching, problem solving, greeting customers, over all offering exceptional customer service. Management always has an open door. They are supportive desire the best for the company, their store, and their team. Co-workers offer excellent team work and look to support each other for the betterment of the store and company. The hardest part of the job is the work/life balance.

I learned that in order to provide customers with a friendly shopping experience, everyone needs to work as a team, and my co-workers and myself do exactly that. The hardest part of the job would be opening Norstrom Reward accounts, especially since the Target incident. However, it brings joy to my face whenever customers find more than they originally planned because that just means that we kept a stoppable and welcoming environment for them."
good,"I have worked here for two different periods of time, once was just over  year and the other was for about 8 months.

My manager is a good guy and was easy to work with. I plan on working with Nordstrom again in the future."
good,"A typical day at work would be seeing how many online orders we received going to go pick on the sales floor for a few hours, go back to the web room and quality check all garments."
good,I loved working here but the commute became too expensive. It was very enjoyable.
good,Fast paced and an exciting place to be. Within my first month I was number three in the southeast region. Friendly co-workers and managers. The most difficult part was the beginning of sales where we would have to stay to prepare until one am and come back to work at twelve pm. The most enjoyable part of being at Nordstrom was helping the customers.
good,"Overall excellent place to work. Lots of opportunity for making a successful career. Company had provide great tools to help you achieve your success. 100% commission which often made for difficult relationships with unmotivated staff.

good,"From when a customer walks onto the floor to when they leave, i would provide outstanding customer service to make the sure the customer has an amazing overall experience. Hardest part of my job was relying on commission for pay checks. I loved the people who worked there and it was an amazing company."
good,"Working for Nordstrom has enabled me to take part in numerous training programs within the retail community. While working in Kids Wear, I interacted with families and was able to build relationships with them that led to future sales opportunities. I was nominated for and completed the manager training program at Nordstrom, and took on the position of Asst. Manager in Kids Wear for a few months before I decided I wanted to further my education and make a career change. Nordstrom is known nation-wide for exceptional customer service, and it is always a pleasure to work for a company that provides the most assistance and enjoyment for the customer. I feel as though I have had some of the best training around, and it has prepared me for social and professional situations where leadership is needed. My favorite part of the job was getting to know the families who shopped with me, and watching their kids grow up. I loved being a positive, though small, part of their lives."

So when the opportunity came about that I would be able to work and intern for the retail giant I was over the moon! Being able to provide the award-winning customer service I was accustomed to while learning the ins and outs of Nordstrom was one of the best experiences of my life. "
good,"Nordstrom, widely known for it's amazing customer service, has been a wonderful place to work for these last 15 years.  My co-workers have been as close as family and my managers have been some of the best I have worked for.  They see my sales talent and ability to build long lasting relationships and they step back and allow me the freedom and space to do what I do best.  The most challenging part of the job is the fact that it's commission only so I always have to be on my game to maximize my income.  Great company overall.  Nordstrom is also very good at recognizing their employees when certain milestones, goals, or achievements are met."
good,We worked off of commission. Excellent customer service made our check. It was all about the customer. I learned many things from different fabrics and styles of clothing for different types of people. To better service the customer. I learned about all of the high end designers. My co-workers were all very friendly yet extremely competitive. I enjoyed that kind of atmosphere because it made me work even harder to become better. This job wasn't exactly hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was after working with a customer seeing how satisfied they were and bringing joy to their faces. I loved that part of my job. It always was

good,"A typical day at work would be as follows. We would come in in the morning check reciepts and do a floor move. New Merchandise would move to the front and older would either be marked down or placed further back. Once the store opened we were responsible for customer service, SPH, IPT,and meeting a sales goal for the day."
good,"Working on a comission base is very challenging, just as well you make comission off yor sales, when a return is being made that 10% of comission goes aginst your pay-check. I obtained personal customers by giving outstanding customer service and creating a personal book with their likes, dislikes, sizes, and personal information. During sale time I serviced about 5 customers at a time sometimes more. Matained assigned section within the departments stockroom learned about the departments product, bocoming kid-shoe and women shoe certified. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people/customers building a strong relationship with them, product knowledge, learning the business side of retail."

good,I love working at Nordstrom. There are great people to work with and very encouraging. Its a great place to advance and grow.
good,Nordstrom does a great job of encouraging their employees to develop themselves daily gently pushing them towards bigger and better things. Within the first 3 months of my employment I was introduced to multiple department heads to get to know the lay of the company and experience different parts in case I wanted to move departments and find a great fit elsewhere in the company. Everyone is very personable and committed to your success.
good,"Nordstrom was a wonderful retail company to have been apart of. With my past experience in retail I was familiar with the demands of customer service, cashier duties, stock, markdown, gift wrapping, and whatever entities presented themselves in a retail environment. I was very efficient in multitasking. The willingness they have to ensure quality customer service is a rare commodity. I gained insight on what it would be like if I were to run my own business. I enjoyed the various customers I came across and looked forward to being their ""go to"" whenever they came back to shop at the store."

good,"Taking care of stock and preparing floor before store opens. Making sure all the items we want out is on the tables for display. Greet and help many parents that are in need of shoes for their children. Offer great customer service skills and show multiple pairs of shoes. Learned how to approach a customer and fit the needs of the type of shoes they are looking for. Customer service became a lot better as i received and built my clientele. Management is fair and co-workers are really easy to get along with. Learned to work as team to achieve sale goals as well as individually. The hardest part is stay focus and maintain work as it can get tiring physically, but learned to stay on path to refocus and take necessary breaks when it comes. Being able to fit kids in shoes and being around people all day long has been enjoyable."

good,"The Nordstrom family became my own in the duration of my time with them. I learned the in depth importance of guest and workplace happiness. My management was consistently supportive, and up lifting. I worked in Santa's Lane during three winter seasons and then Kids-wear from winter into summer. If there is a position you dream to be in, the only person keeping that from happening is you. There are so many equal opportunities. The culture is the best I have ever had the pleasure working in. The most difficult part of my sales position, was the sales itself. If I were to go back into the company, I would most likely enter into guest relations because, my strong suit is making someone feel valued in moments of stress.

good,"This was an amazing job to have as a cook/chef. Nordstrom has very high standards and that does not change in regard to food service. The range of hours were 6am-10pm based on your position. The restaurant was primarily busy for lunch, but did also have a dinner rush. For someone with children, the hours were ideal. They generally wanted to work the younger single people in the evenings. It is rare to find a restaurant where holiday pay, health insurance, 401k, and PTO are offered, let alone having the ability to cash in PTO around the holiday season for money even if you didn't take the time off. Extra cash in your pocket when you need it. It was like having an extra savings account. Did I mention that you get raises for every 500 hours worked until you cap out in your position? Compensation is above and beyond. I would be glad to work for them again. I just got bored after a few years."

The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing what takes place behind the scenes. You get to see when markdowns are down and you even take part in marking down items. From the managers to the staff in the various departments everyone works well together and puts customer service first.

If you are a people person and enjoy meeting/helping/interacting with others then this job is for you."

good,i loved this job very much and still miss it to this day . it was one of the best jobs i have ever had .i love the people i loved everything about working there
good,I love thate marketing that was incorporated and suppkrt that i had. Both companies were easy to move up in matched with my skilled work ethic. I would recommend these companies.
good,"The company is strict but fair, with great management and many opportunities for growth within the company. It's very fast-paced but the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming."
good,Great place to work. They treat all employees with respect and there is always room to grow in the company if willing to put in the work. Its unlike working for any other retail company you truly feel like a professional stylist.
good,"Retail and sales for the ambitious and productive really pays off. Managers notice this and encourage one to grow within the company. A great place for college students as their hours are flexible. There is a program where a couple employees are recognized and chosen from their store and sent to a program where you learn more about moving up the career ladder. After completing the program, you are sent to the Nordstrom department store (if coming from Nordstrom Rack) to get more into sales, or if you are already working at the Nordstrom department store, you are sent to Nordstrom Rack in an assistant department manager position. Their philosophy is to hire from within the company, so everyone starts off at the bottom and works their way up."
good,Wonderful place and I wish I had never left. Bad relationship and moved. I was never in trouble and they treated me like gold. They loved me there. On my first sale lloyd Center was Number one the first day in the country.

good,"Exelent company, they care a lot for employees and the team hr team works great whith whenever your situation is. In Nordstrom GreennHills they need to pay more attention on people's skills and education soy times they will see an opportunity for a great leader and  let him pass by in Nordstrom Puerto Rico. Other wise. The cooworkers and managers in others departments help me in my personal situation.  That's an A+."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for at any age. They work extremely close with their customers making sure they are delivering the best customer service. Nordstrom puts customer service first which really makes this retail company stand out compared to others.
good,I would clock in go to what department I was assigned to started working.I mainly worked in the clothing department.I learn new arrive of the merchandise.
good,"The only negative is the lack of quick advancement, especially for those that have experience outside the walls of Nordstom.  They expect you to ""put in your time"" which can be 2 to 5 years before any real advancement.  Nordstrom is a great place to get a career started."
good,Nordstrom has many career options for employees throughout the company. You can start off in the shoe department and decide that you want to begin a career in visual merchandising and Nordstrom will give you the tools to support your career path within the company. A lot of employees including myself are very satisfied with the work environment.
good,"The work environment was rather fast paced. There was no time for breaks, because I had to keep my production levels high to appease my managers and supervisors. The hardest part of the job is carrying 60 lbs boxes for 100 meters."

good,"-worked as a stock clerk, scanning inventory"
good,Working at Nordstrom gave me a great insight to what great customer service was. I grew tremendously when it came to working with other people and giving great service. This was my favorite retail job and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun work environment.
good,Working at one of the premier retail malls in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area kept us on the high end of he fashion and makeup trends.  Was always a very enjoyable experience to build relationships with customers and provide them with excellent customer service.  Great co workers.
good,"Always a fun place to work! Pay structure and amount needs a little help but other than that, I loved it! Staff and customers were friendly. If the pay increased, they would hold many people."

This reflects onto the staff that make it a great place to work and our customers notice that. It is quite easy to find someone who can help you get to any goals you may have career-wise. Although it is a big company it is small at the same time because of how close-knit of a community it is."

good,"You feel like you're surrounded by friends. Learning is inevitable and most enjoyable, helping you stay sharp and feel competent.

High acuity may contribute to a higher difficulty, but the every-day pleasure of working in a great team makes everything worthwhile."

good,"I worked in logistics for a few years. I loved it."
good,Work and life balance was great. very relaxed. Company was there to help their staff get better and be trained on product  knowledge.  Hardest part of the job is being responsible for your team sales goal.
good,"*Customer focused"
good,"Very good job, learn a lot of skills that you can take with you through life. You own your decisions, its definitely what you make out of it. Their policy is to always make the best judgement. Who knew retail could actually provide you with positions that make you want to indulge a career in it!"
good,"In general Nordstrom is a great company because not only is everyone accessible to you for anything as an employee (for example the HR department) but if you prove to be a team player and show commitment and passion Nordstrom as a company will move mountains for you, give you growth opportunities based on your needs and wants for success."
good,"I did not like this job as much  too crowded with lots of customer.  Too loud and noisy. Too many customers returning items. I did not like this, too many items to reticket."
good,"The Nordstrom Rack that I worked for had a outstanding commitment to customer service. Also for its employees it was a nice way to earn money. During your shift you would help tidy up the place, check some people out at the register, and maybe eyeball some clothe you might want to buy. It was a learning experience for sure."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work for someone with is in school or even after graduating. The starting pay is awesome for every position and not to mention how friendly the sales associate are. Once you start at Nordstrom you wouldn’t want to leave. I’ve been working at Nordstrom for over a year now.. Absolutely no regrets. The best supervisor I’ve ever had (I’ve had some great supervisors in the past) and it’s the best place to work.
good,A typical day at work would be coming in early making sure that our department was clean and well organized also had to engage with the costumers and make sure to always have everything in stock and keep every detail well organized.
good,"long days = money. management just okay, nothing too great. a lot of people think because they work at Nordstrom theyre all that but you work at Nordstrom. overall great place"
good,Modeled a database for tracking sales on line and in stores. It was to provide forecasting of future sales and in demand items and a history of past sales. We maintained information for the past 10 years.
good,"I enjoy helping the customers; getting to know them is a long term professional relationship. Sales can be very competitive with other employees but teamwork is advised. "
good,"Improved method for price reduction, shipping, receiving, stock room merchandise standards. Superb visual display, customer service and sales support."

good,I loved working at Nordstom's cosmetic department  I made all my goals and pacesetter on a part time schedule. I loved the freedom to take care of the customer so they left happy.
good,typical day at Nordstrom starts with a team rally where every sales associate from their respected department meets up and have a team rally with the store manager. here we discus sales of the day ETC.
good,"Nordstrom is whatever you want it to be. If you want part-time because your a student, they support that. If you want full-time because you're a parent, or you want to work full-time, they support that too. They are an amazing company, very flexible with work hours, and times and days. Many employees are parents so they allow them to have morning schedules to spend time with their families, or even to spend the weekends with their families, no matter what position you have, commission, cashier, logistics. They have regular schedules, meaning, you'll have a regular 9-5pm everyday, or 1-closing, everyday, if thats your choosing. The managers, to date, are the best I've had. Very personable, and approachable, like real people, not company robots present to uphold company rules and regulations. Nordstrom works hard to hire regular, normal everyday people, as their management. Besides that, they have Dental, Vision, and Health insurance available to full-time employees, they even have Unemployment Insurance available, if you qualify of course. They also have great Maternity and Paternity leave, even disability, for you, or to take care of family members. Their Maternity leave is six months, and the Paternity leave is three months. The only really busy times are during sales, and the weekends, besides that its pretty steady the rest of the year, even boring sometimes. Not very much of the job is hard, just stressful, maybe when customers feel they are being under serviced. The most enjoyable part, is having the knowledge, and ability to be able to help the customer with their needs."

good,"I prepped food for the Expresso bar, sliced meats using slicers, cut vegetables, and prepared many different recipes. I quickly learned many new recipes and skills. The management was great and had very effective communication while keeping a positive upbeat vibe. Everyone was very positive, friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was finding extra hours for work and the most enjoyable part of my job was learning and completing new tasks everyday."
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom, the power of taking ownership was the goal daily.this is what was given to each employee from the beginning.the opportunity of promotion was always a plus."
good,"Great place to work, nice environment and fun staff. Fast paced work environment, be ready to work hard throughout your entire shift. Tips sometimes pay off other times they dont"
good,Nordstrom in my opinion is a great company. In general they are very helpful with someone's school schedule. They are a expanding company with a lot of new stores openings. The company has a lot of opportunity for one to grow. What I enjoy most about it is the management part of it they are very welcoming.
good,I loved working for this company.  Once you prove yourself to be valuable Nordstrom will call you back over and over to work Sales and seasonal while I attended Collage.

good,Over all I enjoyed working in this company it was always something to do thru out the work day. Most of the days I work was a good scheduled shift for me because I am a single mother; I was allowed the time I needed to take care of my child. Nordstrom Rack is a great company and my experience there was memorable.

good,Nordstrom is a very fun place to work and the benefits of the company are really good. The business cares about its employees and customer service which keeps the company in good standing.
good,we would stock our merchandiser from the stock room and onto the rack in the front of the store. Sign out our mobile devices waiting for customer to come inside and get their order plus ask if they were charging their Nordstrom card and if they didn't have one would ask if they wanted to open a Nordstrom credit card.

I have also improved my customer service skills by communicating with clients in the interests of clients. Overall, this is a great place to work, the environment and people make the experience enjoyable."
good,"Nordstrom is such a great company to work for. The management there is excellent, and is willing to give you flexible hours, and a set schedule. You work on commission every shift, and selling is pretty easy at the job. Commission varied depending on how much you sold, and you can make pretty decent paychecks along the way. They also have a base pay, so if you don't make commission, you'll still get your base pay (depending on what you do, most associates get paid  11.50 per hour or more.) Fast paced, super fun to work at, training was super fun and easy, and if you're not good at selling, they'll help you find ways to be a better sales person. Easy to get promoted as well. Def recommend this place to work for people who wants to career in fashion!"

Between their incomparable costumer service policies and their high expectations for genuine, efficient costumer experiences, it is easy to argue that Nordstrom is one of the best companies to work for. The hardest part about the job was the drive because I live 45 minutes away from the Thousand Oaks mall. The most enjoyable part about the job was staying updated on all the trends and building relationships with people from a shared love for clothes."

Selling and networking with clients became second nature and is quite useful as this was learned while working here. The work environment itself is very competitive as you must perform well otherwise you'd be terminated if you don't reach your sales goals. Specifically terminated if you fail to reach the sales goal 3 times. As that has never happened to myself and doesn't usually happen to any of the employees there, it's a fast pace work area where you must be sharp to engage customers in order to land a sale."

Inviting customers back is also the key to their success. Nordstrom doesn't rely on foot traffic so customer relations is a top priority for all sales associates.

In Petites I took out the new merchandise off the racks and boxes to put on the display. Set up the merchandise in a creative manner that looked chic and appealing to the customer. In the mornings is when I got to speak with the vendors about the incoming and outgoing products.I also had to look through all my customers in the computer to see who I needed to follow up and give them a call and see how everything was going with their new merchandise and their lives.

The people I work with have become family to me and I will carry that with every job I have in the future.

good,Working at Nordstrom was a great experience and I enjoyed working there very much. I met some wonderful people and I learned a lot about the business.
good,It was a pleasure working for Nordstrom. I learned a lot about fashion helping me with more knowledge. I enjoy working with my co-workers and the management team. The fantastic part was when the Nordstrom's family came to welcome us in the store in Puerto Rico.
good,"On a daily my task was to pick orders for selected customers in a precise and fast manner. I performed this task using an RF scanner. I was later on cross-trained to sort, pack and consolidate merchandise. Also trained to do additional research for lost items or incorrect bar-codes attached to merchandise. Working for this company was always intriguing the management and co-workers were always friendly. Overall its an excellent company to work for were your able to perform at your full potential and receive recognition."

good,Amazing place that inspires and motivates anyone to be more then what they are.  I love each and everyday within this environment that is based on a culture that ensures a credo company wide. Nothing like the experience of family like ONE NORDSTROM.
good,"I started out as a warehouse associate and was promoted to the Account Supervisor for Staff Management (Nordstrom Distribution Center at the time had a contract with Staff Management). As the Account Supervisor I was responsible for 50-55 associates daily and 75-80 during Nordstrom's' ramp up period. The challenging part at times was trying to manage 50 different personalities and problems. It was in this situation my well honed ""people person"" skills from past employment opportunities was extremely beneficial. I conducted all interviews and in most cases also did the hiring. I always informed new hires for Nordstrom that you don't just reflect Staff Management and yourself, you also reflect me. I also trained new hires on the warehouse floor and maintained a great professional relationship with all my employees. My favorite part of the day was the scheduling meeting with all the department heads when I would be informed as to how many associates would be required for each department. All the department managers were also aware that on top of my Account Supervisor duties I was also performing the majority of the Account Managers duties, and was often commended on both."
good,"I really enjoyed my time there. No problems whatsoever. It is pretty classy of a place, so if you are interested in working their, make sure you accommodate that fact."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed this company and would be working there still if not for a bad ankle.  Their benefits are great and the atmosphere is wonderful.  It is really Disneyland for the fashionista(o)s.  If taken seriously this job can be really rewarding.  Nordstrom employees never sit down because they never want to.
good,Great entry level position where the opportunity to grow is real and almost promised if you work hard and meet sales goals.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of me providing great customer service, fulfilling all duties as necessary, sometimes managing others while floor manager was away.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping others because i love to be able to be the one who made someone else smile.  The hardest part i would say would be restocking the floor, it was very tedious.  My co workers all in all were very pleasant to work with and they welcomed me with opening arms."
good,"excellent company to work, good hours and high quality management, I work as a part time an I have time for family and school, great place to work"
good,"I start at 5:00am balancing all the registers from the previous business day and the safe; later on will prepare the fund bags for the following day.

good,"There is truly nothing bad I can say about my time working in Women's Shoes at Nordstrom. The staff worked incredibly hard to make sure that the customers were comfortable and were having the best experience possible. I believe that to be the most enjoyable part of the job - but also the hardest. There are always going to be some customers that are more difficult to work with than others. However, Nordstrom brought out the best of the communication skills that I already had, and taught me how to use them in the most productive way when speaking with a customer. Once I quickly learned about the company and the products we carried, I flourished in sales. I believe the key to my success was what I learned about the customer. My people skills were able to grow in the environment; The success I have while working with the customer directly is a big part of what puts me ahead of the rest of the employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstrom. This company is really great all around! The customers are very fun, the training program is top notch and they really push an entrepreneur spirit. Good company to grow and advancement. They promote form within."
good,"This job, I started with a seasonal job lasting only a month, Seasonal Inventory Processor, June-July. Then I had a seasonal Salesperson job in Kid's Shoes from July-Sept, when I wasn't needed there anymore I was full time in women's shoes in another location. I worked there from Sept-June. I learned so much. In all my positions, I gained so much experience, learned so much about the wonderful company. There are so many possibilities, to meet people, coworkers & customers, learn about the merchandise, learn about suggestive selling, human resources, management, talk to other stores in the country, ordering items for customers. Learning about customers' wants and needs and doing everything I can to help them. The hardest part of the job sometimes was fashion, I never really cared about fashion but being there with people who do was very informative and inspring. The most enjoyable part was seeing everyone so happy to be shopping and laughing and being social and connecting with others. Shopping isn't just always spending money and getting something new you need or want, it's about the connection everyone makes with each other. Salesperson to customer connection. It's a beautiful and fun thing."

good,I have worked at Nordstrom a few times over the years once in cosmetics and the rest of the time spent was serving in their cafe. I would handle most opening and closing shifts I learned P.O.S. and lots of details about how to sell retail and create positive customer relationships. Customer service is top priority there and I found that as the most enjoyable part of the job. The least enjoyable part would be working inside of a mall.

We break the pallets down and remove the boxes that are inside. The boxes inside the pallets contain items that people bought online at Nordstrom.com and are returning for various reasons. We separate the clothing from the shoes, jewelry, and household items put them in totes and send them off with the correct paperwork. What I enjoyed about this job is that it was something new not to challenging but not to easy and that there was always room for advancement."

The Kids' department was an interesting place to work because I worked with the full spectrum of Nordstrom shoppers - from baby shower goers, to expectant mothers and fathers, to kids themselves, to new grandparents. It was fun to hear the stories and the excitement. My manager was great-she was so much fun and a great coach. It was my first experience in retail and she taught me more than meeting sales goals, but how to represent and believe in a brand.  The hardest part of my job was the amount of hours working on my feet - I am an active person and thrive in an energetic environment, don't get me wrong, but it was 9 hours in heels, hosting customers is a long time. I enjoyed it, but it is a tiring role and I now have a new appreciation for retail personnel."

good,"Working at Nordstrom brought out the competitive spirit in me and also my love for fashion. I felt like an underdog first starting because I was young and had no customer service experience. I quickly learned that it never mattered. I was honest, knowledgeable of all products, and made sure I always offered 'the look for less'. My strategy was to show customers all options. Just because people have the money doesn't necessarily want to spend it. I had so many repeat customers and built a contact book to be proud about. Also, I've always loved fashion so I got to style lots of people for events like weddings, anniversaries, parties, work meetings, etc. I learned each department like the back of my hand and could walk customers around the whole store to shop. It was so fun and the money came easy. I was ranked top seller in the store over 12 times and won lots of free jewelry. My only issue was some sneakiness like some coworkers will take a sell you worked all day for just because they weren't doing well in sales. That comes with the territory though. I loved Nordstrom as a company. They had lots of inservice, on the floor training, contests to make selling fun, stood behind employees,and offered growth within the company."

good,"I like Nordstroms because there was always room for growth, it was a constant learning position which i enjoy very much."
good,"A typical day for me at work consists of multiple tasks. First, our most important priority is to take care of our customers making them completely happy with their experience whether they are looking for a special item, trying to order something, or bringing in a return as well as an exchange. I really love working with customers as well as my coworkers. The people I get to meet daily keep life interesting. Alot of women open up to me and I really get to know them well on not only a professional level but also a personal level. I prefer to stay in contact with my customers to let them know about new merchandise we receive and to see how their new items have worked for them; outreach is another top priority. My coworkers make my day go by even faster; we are way more than just coworkers. They are my friends and we work even better together as a team. Second, throughout the day when it is less busy I tidy up our department straightening the shoes, complete DTC orders (direct to customer), organize inventory, and clear off the cash wrap and work bench. I really enjoy seeing the new merchandise we receive and learning about the designer, the brand, and the styles and fit of the shoes. For me, working at Nordstrom has boosted my confidence level to a new extreme. It has made me able to say hello to just about anyone outside of work, that it is almost second nature."

good,"Typical day consisted of an awesome morning rally. crazy motivation for all of the sale allocates. Great moral. No judgement. Everyone was lovely. Management was more then fair in all aspects, they listened, they learned from us as we learned from them. I am a visual stylist, and I know that it is a different beast. Being in the other departments the reviews might be a little different, but overall. Nordstorm, was my All Time favorite. I felt the love for the short time I was there. Maybe It was the management. but, who knows. Nordsrtom has a hand book that is a ""post card"" that's all that needs to be said.  Thank you."
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking my individual as well as department goal for the day, making a plan to get there weather it be calling customers in my personal book, writing thank you notes, showing off whats new and in style, adding on to the sale, and providing the best customer service. Cleaning and putting out merchandise, opening reward cards and always keeping a positive attitude was required for every shift."
good,"Working for Nordstrom was a great experience for me.

good,"Always meet and greeting customers, engaging having one on one and eye contact with each customer. Getting to know them and telling them about me so I can provide that great customer service that Nordstrom has taught me. Once I knew what the customers would want I would give them my best knowledge on the shoes they're asking for then I would add on our special select items which is called the item of the day which had to for our sales goals. We had to ring up our customers at the cash rap. I added my customers to my client book through the computer we had. I sent thank you cards and called customers to asking them how's the items they had purchased. The most enjoyable part of my job was keeping up with all my customers and made me feel very connected to them. The management was amazing they was very involved with the employees we had meetings through out the week to help keep us focus on our goals.

Some days you may get the governor from Mexico, other days you may get a man who lost a bet and needs size 14 high heels.  Number one priority is to take care of the customer.  We as employees do not define good customer service, the customer does.  Every interaction may be a little different from the next."
good,"I assisted customers picking out outfits"
good,"Great place to work fair treatment by managers, good compensation, room for advancement, friendly coworkers"

Your success with this company is based on your own drive and motivation to succeed. I learned aspects of team work, personal selling, ways to succeed, and visuals.

good,"Great company, excellent opportunities for growth. Promotes from within. Great opportunity for advancement. Excellent, fun culture."
good,"Emptying the trash bins at each department, cleaning the employee lounge, and the customers restrooms. I learned how to work hard and quickly, and how to spot shoplifters. The management team was the best, and I enjoyed being able to speak with them comfortably when needed. The make-up girls were always cheerful even when having a bad day. The hardest part was trying to clean the women's restrooms and keep them stocked. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting complimented by a gentleman for how well the men's bathroom was maintained."
good,"Provide above and beyond customer service in a high volume espresso bar. I learned managerial skills on the job and courses offered by the company. I learned by management that if the employees are well taken care of, employees will leap above and beyond to service our customers."

Cleaning, sizing, putting out new merchandise and giving a great customer service is what we do everyday. Knowing what you sell is very important in this type of field. You must acknowledge each and every customer in order for you to succeed your main goal everyday at work. It is always fun working at the store even in a typical busy day."
good,"When I did work at Nordstrom Rack I felt that the people there appreciated my work. The times I did make a mistake i was calmly taught the correct way to go about said job. The store is a good example of how a customer service company should operate. The benefits were always great, as long as you stayed at the store long enough to let them build up. Your incentives gave you a great sense that the company you worked for cared and gave you a chance to improve your standing in the workplace."
good,colleagues made my job enjoyably. Learned to use different software and working at fast paced environment.
good,"Overall Nordstrom is a wonderful place to work. The opportunity to be promoted is easy and attainable. The environment is fun and safe to work in. The most enjoyable part was making sales, being that its all commission sky was the limit."

good,Nordstroms is a great company to kick of your retail career with. Great commission positions.
good,I started at Nordstrom thinking I would work through the Holidays in 1995 and didn't leave until 2010. I think that speaks volumes for the Company! You go to work and you are with your work Family all day where the time flies and it is time to go home to your real Family with a smile on your face!!

good,Great place to work:
good,"I absolutely LOVED working at Nordstrom! I worked at Nordstrom Rack so it is a bit different from the Full Line store, but the Rack was awesome! A typical day at work is busy, busy, busy which is just the way I liked it. It is a tad redundant though so if that isn't your thing please don't apply. There is also a lot of walking and running around so if you aren't able to move constantly for 8+ hours a day then this isn't the job for you. Customers are #1 for this company and so most of your day will consist of working with them in any way they need. You have to know a lot about fashion and be able to suggestively sell products. There are times where you work exclusively with customers for hours and sometimes you WILL work with customers that are not the most friendly. Nordstrom tailors everything to the customers needs so if you aren't willing or able to accomodate to the customers EVERY need than this probably isn't the job for you. I am a very patient person and sometimes it would even take everything I have to stay sane working with these people but just remember they are essentially the ones paying your pay check!! and the gratification of ensuring their complete satisfaction was so nice :) That was probably the most enjoyable part of the job for me, when customers would come in and ask for you specifically by name because you were able to help them out! LOVE THIS JOB!!"
good,"A typical day would be to start out at a rally and get pumped up for the day. Decide what was most popular in the store, and they gave recognition to the employees when they deserved it."
good,"Inventory when placing product on the shelves, to keep track of how many boxes were added to the shelving area. maintained work place."
good,"In the year that I worked for Nordstrom I advanced quickly. I found the perfect environment for my background, including my Business Degree. I had four managers directly above me and they offered me the chance to join them. They were the best team of women I have ever worked with."
good,Mainly sales and customer interaction . Very nice co workers.
good,"Throughly enjoyed working for Nordstrom as a Sales Associate. My day consisted of Selling product, working with the Dept. Manager giving details of sales for the day. Most difficult and most rewarding, when an unhappy customer is satisfied at the end of the sale. Would end the day by balancing cash. This job taught me how to treat customers, as well as co-workers with the same excellent service, I would want."
good,"in this company i learn to cook, prep, cashier, server, and the coffee shop. this is the place i learn how to cook and learn so many things with the restaurant. my co workers r the best thing because thas were i found my best friends. i loved working there a lot the company was good and with good benefits"
good,I like this place alot it pays good and you get alot of hours. The managers are nice and easy to work with when you want days off. It is really easy to transfer within the company.
good,"Being a leader by example is a big responsibility. At Nordstrom, Ive learned how to play the part in being a leader, communitcating with Regional Managers, Buyers and vendor reps. With that knowledge, Ive grown fast with the Nordstrom and hosted many rallies and product knowledge classes. I assist managing two departments; womens shoes and men designer apperal. My co-workers are very helpful and supportive. We all work together as one unit. The hardest part about my job is leaving on time. Im always assiting customers or coaching a new hirer. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I love it."
good,"great discounts, and a fun loving place to work. I loved working here."
good,"good environment, good upper management, easy to work with and helpful"
good,"typical day at work would be me entering work look and see how much of the truck i have left to process and see if we have space in the stock shelves, after i reticket shoes and go to the floor and help maintain the sales floor. ive learned how to deal with customers and how to stay organized, take aniciative at work, all my co workers are very out going and energetic and managment is great, they compromise with you and fit needs to your schedule. and the most enjoyable part of working at nordstrom is actually working for the company , i show up happy to work every day"
good,Could have been more open and sun light in the office but the team was great. I learned alot about corporate recruiting. The hardest part of the job was that the cube walls were high and I had no sun light. I loved working around people that love fashion. The company really believes in customer service and community work.
good,Come in with great energy. Communicate with great customers and employees.
good,A typical day at work at Nordstrom starts with greeting customers . You report to your manager in the morning for a brief meeting before you head to the sales floor. Once you are on the sales floor each salesmen has their area to sale in. You then begin selling and greeting each customer. What have I learned? Nordstrom is the first company that really taught me what customer service really was. From greeting the customer to taking the customers bags to their cars. I truly learned customer service 101 at Nordstrom.
good,"I received over 100 calls per day and answered many questions regarding sensitive credit information. I loved my managers as they were always available and extremely patient. My co-workers were fine, a little negative at times, but bearable. It was hard to explain to customers who didn't understand payment options, apr fees, and some of their purchase history. I enjoyed talking to customers and answering their questions."
good,"My morning would begin at 8 am reciving in merchandise and setting my floor. Review daily reports, write my schedule set daily goals for my team."

good,Everyone was very friendly from employees to HR.. I learned how to ship out the customers orders using a computer.
good,"A typical day was going in on lunch time and start working right away. It was a fast-pace environment and had great teamwork. The management staff was always available. Creating friendships with the co-workers was a plus, they were always willing to help if needed, The hardest part of the job would be we were limited on space, especially when it was crowded with customers trying to find a seat. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the whole day. Great co-workers made for a fun environment, the satifaction of having your customers leaving happy, and being in a fast-pace environment requires no standing around which is nice."
good,"I learned so much from working here, my employer definitely encouraged learning about the business inside and out."
good,"I couldn't wait to come to work...every day was an adventure and being adept at diversity is a must. Never a dull moment. I strived to always be a blessing to the public, my fellow team mates, and of course upper management. I always encouraged my team mates to cross sell at my counter...this not only made them feel safe there, because they were never stepping on my toes, and this attitude made my counter extremely successful. The most difficult part of the job for some was late night closing, however, for me it was just a part of being a good manager...The most enjoyable part of my job was making new relationships with our clients...loving to please."
good,A typical day at Nordstroms was filled with meeting all kinds of people from all types of lifestyles. The envirnment was filled with nice customers with even nicer co workes.
good,Nordstrom really laid the foundation for excellence in customer service and challenged you to reach that goal daily. As a manager I very much enjoyed managing my own department. Competing with other sales departments in the region was probably the most enjoyable thing about working there.

good,Work really hard to make christmas happen for everyone. i learned how to work smarter not harder.
good,"a working day is always busy, no rush, but productive enough to make your self feel proud and the company, since there is always a competition between stores in sales, service, etc. and at the end rewards."
good,"Nordstrom is definitely considered one of the best jobs I've had. There's a great level of team work involved wonderful employees, and always room for advancement. The best part of the job im in a position where there room to learn everyday and very flexiable"
good,"This was my third job in a Retail setting & I really enjoyed everything! Some work days were a challenge due to the high volume of website orders that came in, yet there was always additional help. The days without high volume orders weren't as much of a challenge because finding work assignments other than website fulfillment was simple. I was certified in web fulfill & learned how navigate the Customer/WEB Request System. This was due to the excellent training from my direct Inventory Manager. ALL of my coworkers were supportive and pulled their own weight. Not being able to locate the ONLY item in the store was difficult for me because after 3 searches at staggered time, if the item could still not be found it would have to be rejected. This lowered the stores average. But leaving at the end of the day was enjoyable because I knew that I had did my best & met store's required minimum of items found!"
good,"This place hired me for a summer job as a part time fill in, and I eventually got myself a sales job there. I was making pretty good money as a furnishings salesman and I would recommend this employer to anyone needing a job."
good,"A typical day includes interacting with customers, sizing and colorizing clothes. It also included watching the fitting room and putting away stock. I learned that I love to interact with other people. Management was fantastic, very organized and understanding of the fact that we have lives outside of the workplace. My co workers were fantastic, and I enjoyed working with them everyday. The hardest part was during the holidays when they stores were so packed you could barely move around to get your work done. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around clothes, shoes and accessories."
good,We helped cutomers with great customer service skills handed down to us by management. The hardest part of the job was opening credit accounts with the economy so bad. The easy part was helping customers. My co workers and managemet were great.
good,Every day started out with me checking into my department and assisting customers with merchandise. I would sometimes help the tailor measure out hem lines when needed. I learned plenty of skills like measuring a mens suit and mens tailoring.My co-workers were great and helpful almost like a family. Tha hardest part was the varied hours and managing my life around them. The best part was the management which was very professional very helpful and understanding to your needs. I really loved this place.

good,Nordstrom makes sure that customer service is the number one goal in any of there stores. In order to achieve delivering such exceptional customer service they train the employees very well. They only make sure individuals with positive attitudes and an eagerness to succeed work with the company. They also promote from with in. If they see that you are doing the job that you are supposed to and have a desire to move up in the company they will promote you. They recognize employees who go above and beyond on a daily basis. Management will not ask you to do anything they would not do themselves. Management also works daily with you on the sales-floor.

Companies respect the Nordstrom brand, and I've utilized the customer services skills I've learned here that have really helped in my career."
