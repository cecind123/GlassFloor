rating,review
bad,"no jobs just a fishing expedition because their recruiters have no job assigmnets availble and have nothing better to do than waste everyones time you have been warned, skip the farce because they have no work to offer anyone. Was told there is one night shift assigment for $8 but there are 25 people waiting for it , its disgusting"
bad,Cette intérim est horrible voir incompétente tu postule pour une boîte nn il feront passez ceux qui veulent avant toi c est à la tête du client l’es femme derrière sont payer à quoi à rien en branle rien te parle comme elle veulent tu veut rentrer à pasteur nn pas possible mais part contre leur famille eux possible ou amis bravo bande d incapable
bad,"No pude continuar mi proceso de contratación con izzi ya que uno de sus incompetentes ""ejecutivos"" capturó mal mi correo con número de empleado y no pude obtener mi constancia laboral, su callcenter no funcionaba en esas fechas y en correo te tardaban 48 hrs en responder solo para decir indicaciones de cómo ingresar a su portal, x lo cual nunca pude porque capturaron malcmiemail"
bad,"Company hires way too many people with criminal histories & they ruin the assignment that you are sent to with these people without records & ruin it for those with education & a solid work history, & make workplace very uncomfortable, & undesirable to remain. Recruiters are only concerned about filling openings, so they can get a financial override from your efforts. Your Rights in the workplace are taken from you, & they do as they please & do not truly care. Beware."
bad,"Le management reste à revoir. La formation pas ou peu existente. La com interne si vous n'avez pas un min. d'expérience et d'indépendance vous ramez ! Pas de cohésion d'équipe, au niveau gestion de temps zéro. Le cadre de travail stressant. Pas d'estime des collaborateurs et en + l'admin n'est pas respecté (C4 etc.). Très Déçue ! Aucun lien avec leurs valeurs qu'ils prônent."
bad,"He trabajado como consultora en varias oficinas de Manpower durante más de 7 años. "
bad,"They lied about my pay twice at two different jobs I even have the texts. They said 18 dollars an hour when I showed up it ended up being 13 dollars. They claimed they pay you on time and never do, they screwed me over and a lot of other people it’s annoying oh and they’re definitely racist at trident never have I been called a stupid white boy so many times and I was even made fun of and manpower ignored it"
bad,Will lay you off say they put you on a list for other openings and then never contact you again. Would not reccomend for a place to obtaim a steady job.
bad,They don’t pay employees and don’t keep track of what time you work or when took a month for me to get a check and they acted as if I didn’t work when I signed in and clocked it the entire week
bad,Manpower does nothing to bring anything meaningful into the world. They are the used car salesmen of the job recruiters... lol No offense to any used car salesmen. It's better to pan handle than deal with the stress of these faux professionals... What a joke.
bad,"Davon gibt es zuviele"
bad,"When you have a job assmt. You are stuck beacause manpower works with company. And if company needs you. You will not be offered any new assmt. They telk you they have no new assmt. But they do. And offer them to other sources. So,very deceptive recruters. Waist your time on the lowest pay! And there not on your side they are on the comoany favor. To decieve"
bad,This employer lied to me about many things when I agreed to accept the job.  Was told it was 12.00 per hour actually 11 per hour.  Told me I could work on first shift and then tried to force me to work 3rd shift.
bad,the place I worked was a temp position  I was given disgusting areas to clean the people didn't have any respect which added more stress to job management didn't have the guts to tell me job was endind they led me to believe there would be a job at end of it but did not keep there word
bad,"Just like all temp services, they get paid up front and have to provide so many bodies. You get an assignment you go you work and get paid, not what it's worth put if you have bills you do what must be done. Assignments and pay vary, some assignments require drug test but it's work. Only good thing us a weekly check"
bad,"this is a joke of a company. Do not waste your time or energy going there, the recruiters suck and so does the company .............................................."
bad,"I liked Man Power 25 years ago, but now the worst place to try to get a job.   "
bad,"- Poor salary + No wage rise in 2 years (and i mean just standard of living increase). Not just confined to myself, I was tol by management that colleagues hadn't had in an increase in 5+ years"
bad,The young lady recruiter was rude and disrespectful. Don’t bother applying for this agency if that’s how they’re gonna treat their applicants. I hope they hire somebody who is more friendly and make you feel well-accomodated.
bad,"Manpower lead me down a rabbit hole with a promise of full time employment at the other end.  Not only didn't that materialize, but I was told after one week the the company I was working for had ""decided to go in another direction.""  If I had know that up front, I wouldn't have wasted my time taking the assignment."
bad,Manpower just placed me to fill a contract so the company can leave out of state so i quit and gave notice manpower will not let you back if you quit.
bad,Unpacking boxes and stocking. 2 15 breaks and one 30 minute lunch break. No real communication  Nothing professional just ordinary people working only to get a check.
bad,"Ils te contactent quand ils ont besoin de toi. Aucun suivi après l'entretien. J'ai du appeler 3 fois, a chaque fois le même commentaire: on va revenir vers vous. Mais jamais. A fuir à vie. Cabinet en bois."
bad,Management blocked me from going to permanent positions within the company we worked for. Management was not ever around when I worked and made me work a 7 day schedule without overtime.
bad,"I was treated better as a contract staff than as a permanent staff."
bad,La peor experiencia...inestabilidad la primero  .Te llama a trabajar con dos horas antes de empezar el servicios.te manda para cojer ropa de trabajo a una tienda lejana pero ellos tiene ropa allí...te lo pone dificil
bad,Manpower in Landsberg am Lech ist weiträumig zu vermeiden! Die Mitarbeiter sind arrogant und feindlich eingestellt - man erhält keine Unterstützung und wird bei jeder Gelegenheit auf den Arm genommen. Zum Schluss kriegt man von heute auf morgen Kündigung und wenn man anruft um nach Gründen zu fragen wird der Hörer geschmissen ! Eine traumatische Erfahrung :(
bad,I used to work for manpower for 9 months. That was the worst nine months of my life. They kept changing supervisors. They let people bring guns in the warehouse. It’s so ghetto over there and the leads they go by if they like you or not. If they don’t like you you’re not going to work. Than they send you home so that’s you losing money. But of course they don’t care. The payroll lady messes up your check so sometimes people would have to wait two weeks just to get their check because she messed up.
bad,"Doesnt matter how hard you work, how many extra hours you work, how many new clients you help bring on while working as a Recruiter. It does not matter that you FILL positions fast and 100% for clients in peak season.   If your new Manager dont like you , you'll be let go! And right before your raise and right after you filled your clients peak season openings! Stay away"
bad,"manpower convinces business they can manage staff better, they can't in my experience. they grab low-hanging (people) fruit and put them in impossible situations."
bad,"Paga regular, te exigen mucho y arriesgas mucho tu vida andado siempre en la calle con equipo de computo costoso comunicaciones entre tus jefes extremadamente pésima y todo es tu culpa si sale algo mal aunque sea externo, te mandan de viaje a otros estados con horas de anticipación poca capacitaciones todo lo aprendes ala mala y en el momento, no hay ninguna prestación solo seguro y tu sueldo"
bad,"they expect you to work 50+ hours a week seldom did you get a day off that you were not asked to come in and if they couldn't fill the schedule on your day off they would threaten to fire you if you refused to come in "
bad,"Firma dużo obiecuje co do wynagrodzenia"
bad,"They will surely get you a job but they fail to mention they are being paid 2.5 times what they pay you. They lie about it to refuse paying shift differentials, they will put you in assignments that take years before you can be hired on, basically anything they can to milk the workers for money. When questioned about it they terminate your position for no cause and then ghost you like you were nothing to them. "
bad,"- do not care about well being"
bad,"Applied for a job with an advertised salary of £18,900 with an increase after a qualifying period. One week into my training. They tell us that the advert which I used to apply for a job is mid July. Was withdrawn on July 1st. Which was a total lie. Then the condescending coordinator tells me it's only £41 per week difference and I should accept it."
bad,"This company does not care about the employees who work for them."
bad,"A experiência foi muito boa. Numa equipa de formação vai de 1 a 1 fora, dão aquela de que as pessoas vão embora onde são eles que mandam. Se tiver de faltar por questões de saúde devidamente justificadas, são mandados embora."
bad,"Produzieren weder Autoreifen noch Matratzen, keine Tabletten und keine Tiernahrung. Und doch steckt in diesen Endprodukten Evonik – so wie in vielen weiteren auch."
bad,if you have life events this is not the place work they don't take doctors note and will write you up for missing days there are no excused absents they don't care if you have kids or a life outside work
bad,"В избытки присутствую весь негатив, с которым возможно столкнуться в корпоративной культуре: мобинг, дедовщина со стороны «опытных» сотрудников, всячески поощряемые и провоцируемые со стороны руководства интриги в коллективе. Низкий уровень оплаты, непонятно на чем основывается мотивация сотрудников, несоблюдение условий договорных обязательств, зачастую заведомый обман персонала."
bad,"Slecht communicatie , geen luisterend oor , administratie niet op orde , uitbetalingen minder dan verdient."
bad,"Worked to the bone on a pittance salary. The office bred a shocking, negative workplace culture where bullying and other issues were brushed under the carpet. High staff turnover, self-serving management lthat lack necessary skills. Manpower does nothing to deal with staff issues. Don't listen - dont care."
bad,I truly wish to not comment on this job at all.i have worked here with this company before however I myself wasn't so happy and neither was my husband. They messed up on our paychecks and don't have your backs about nothing .
bad,They are very bad at telling people that there are no jobs available when they have job openings outside their office and online. they do not get the job description right and the customer service is very poor.
bad,"they took 158.00 from my check for insurance that I didnt request, and never gave me an insurance card and refused to pay me back....they are nothing but thiefs!!"
bad,"Favoritisme, manque de respect et intimidation. Je déconseille vivement cet boite d'intérim."
bad,A place to work and make money..... A lot of different places to work so it is a different job every time... Different pay at the jobs. No benefits...
bad,Les missions peuvent être intéressante mais le salaire ne suit pas.
bad,"the management are bullies and get fun out of ridiculing their temporary employees - i would definitely NOT work for this company again"
bad,"Después de haber trabajado con esta ETT y otras, decir que Manpower Ferrol no es nada recomendable, empezando por el trato a los trabajadores (de los que ellos viven, por cierto),  siguiendo por el hecho de que las condiciones que te ofertan no se asemejan a lo que luego te encuentras y finalizando por el hecho de que cuando te pones en contacto con ellos ""siempre están reunidos"", y ya puedes esperar sentado a que te devuelvan la llamada como prometen. Mal."
bad,"Hallo,"
bad,it horrible temp service they double booked all the jobs. will pull you form the job with no explanation and skim your paycheck and would miss place your file. the people that would put you in the job were hard to talk to and they treated you like you were trash
bad,"This was one of the hardest jobs I've ever had. The work was very strenuous and long. 12 hour shifts and the nature of work was dangerous. working with various chemicals. It was a great experience and I'm very grateful  I was able to experience it. But no, I would not return."
bad,"I had a terrible experience their, co-workers were very deceptive and they put my health in jeopardy.  Their is no loyalty or commitment to correctly teaching the perspective employee due to fear of them doing a better job then them.  Would not recommend this job to my friends, family nor anyone asking about this place.  The Cafeteria has great food though."
bad,"Man wird in falsche Lohngruppen gesteckt das man weniger verdient. Wenn man sich deshalb beschwert wird man gekündigt. Man wird von den Leuten angeschrien wenn sie im unrecht sind."
bad,The people at this Manpower location is unprofessional and REALLY does not care about their employees. They don't always answer the phones or emails. Use another staffing agency.
bad,"They're the worst agency I've ever worked for ,they're customers are companies that maximum profits off of minimum wage workers and to keep unions out of the way they hire expendable unskilled workers sometimes with fake documents to do it .Most companies will never hire an agency employee directly even after years at there facilities."
bad,"Ne travailler ni avec eux ni pour eux "
bad,"Worked at Clariant in belen. This was the first time I worked as a machine operator. They didn't train me very well & instead of letting me know something was going wrong, they would just wait for it to go wrong and watch me clean up the mess it made."
bad,If you are not extremely close to team leaders and managers you will stay at the bottom. I loved my job the management is why I left. Most of my days I ran my two lines and I also completed the team leads paperwork while she sat in the office under the air conditioner.  I also had to wake her up in the bathroom sitting on the toilet.
bad,This job offers no way to advance no incentives no pay increase no benefits they just work u to death the leadership does not consider employees feeling
bad,By far the most racist company I’ve ever dealt with. If you’re black you’ll get paid great. If you’re white you would do better at McDonald’s. Steer clear of you don’t want them targeting you.
bad,They stand behind their customer and hang you out to dry. They do nothing for you even though they make $5 an hour on you. I had to fight for a raise from their customer. Manpower never gave me a raise in 5 1/2 years. They don’t find you work.
bad,"Disgusting place to work."
bad,"Nothing good to say!  "
bad,"empresa seria comprometida con sus clientes, se basan en la confianza en su personal"
bad,"é uma empresa de trabalho temporário, é difícil prever uma mudança no trabalho"
bad,"Emailed this company about trying to find job or work. Barely anyone able to perform the simplistic part of contacting back via email. Absolutely no confidence in how this company operates as it shows very poor management,  they cannot even get the communication portion correctly. This is the 2nd Manpower to ghost off on basic email inquiries. Do not recommend."
bad,This was no doubt the worst temp agency I ever worked for they could not find full time work for people applying for work with them jobs were mostly for 2 or 3 days at a time and they wouldnt call you for weeks afterwards for work !
bad,This job is no good I would not recommend it to anybody. No chance for advancement no chance for benefits no chance for anything that you might want in a job. They'll work you to death for very little pay. Employees will take advantage of you because you're not a full-time employee with the company. The managers will take advantage of you for working at a temp agency.
bad,The culture was not supportive of team work. Peers put my initials on inspection documents when the system had quality issues. I was called on quality issues. No one was reprimanded. During training everyone had a different opinion on how I was as supposed to do my job. I followed the IBM trainer's instruction. The workstation I used would frequently be sabatoged. I had to search for item and install to be able to start work.
bad,"i have not talk to anybody from that office since November, had to call to get my logins for the time sheet log in and that took them almost a full week."
bad,Llaman el mismo día para trabajar y si te niegas no te vuelven a llamar.
bad,I have worked for them before and I went to them to get a job the said I qualify for nothing even though I have had a lot of experience at many different things factory wise.
bad,Most of the placement managers look down on the people who come in for work.  If you show even the slightest hint of displeasure with the job assignment they give they black list you for 6 months or more.
bad,all ways sent to a temporary jobs and a distance away from home base. after a year of employment never found me a permanent job. I had to travel more ten 40 min. to a job or more.
bad,Only care about their money not the employees. Fails to communicate properly with employees. Don't call back.  Close the office early if it suits them.
bad,I was discrimated against  for my hair and my temp agency did not stand up for me. I was told that the assignment was over after I told manpower 1st how I was disrespected
bad,It didn't mine working with them but didn't know where they were sending me to.  It could be a job that is more slave labor than a job.  Would use them when there were no openings.
bad,"I only signed up with this temp service when I learned that a position opened up at the same company my husband was working at.  I completed necessary paperwork and was hired, after the necessary 1 year minimum, I was rolled over as a permanent employee at the company I was working at."
bad,At this time. companing just want temp workers and manpower is the best for that. THey can get yuou into a quiick job to barly pay your bills tthey found jobs at the very last moment and wanted you to be so ungodly quick with your response times
bad,No room for advancement and they didnt treat me with respect. Wasnt enough support and lack of breaks.I didnt appreciate the lack of support from Manpower in general
bad,"If I could leave no stars I would. Promise you a perm contract at end of 6 months and same wage and rights as everyone else. Lot of nonsense. Weekly paid, holidays are shocking how they work them out. Trust me take a better job with another agency. The place you are put is high demand, understaffed and under supported."
bad,"If you have no where else to turn, great employment (when they have jobs available on their list). If none are available, you are without hope for weeks or months at a time. They have 90 day contracts where if you go over the 90 days, you fully work for the company they put you at. I've NEVER seen that happen, usually a few days before they will pull you away from the job and that's it. Also why most companies quit hiring through them. Good for a short time paycheck but not for a long term career"
bad,Typical day was busy.  Entered PMs all day.  Learned a lot of new things through coworkers.  Safety meeting with Manpower were useless and a waste of time away from the work that was piling up.  Culture was relaxed. In shop with FLS/SLS.  Learned much about Electric/Instrumentation & Analyzers from the men.  Learned much about reading P&IDs.
bad,"They take your money($3 to $5 an hour of your paycheck), no real benefits, and you are a temp-hire(the company treats you like a temp too). Don't fall for their gimmick. It is not that hard to find work on your own. Why take a Temp job with Manpower that pays $10.50 an hour when you can be a permanent hire with benefits at $15.00 an hour by going straight to the Company. I guess if you don't have time to look, no skills, or just a lazy butt then use Manpower. THEY TAKE YOUR PAY FOR NO REAL SERVICE.   SMH..."
bad,When the job I was working offered me extra hours manpower c add lled me and told me I was no longer needed which I look earned was a lie they just did not want to pay me the extra
bad,very boring had to space out unloading trucks so i could work 8 hours a day and keep my 40 hours a week. wasnt allowed to leave are lift until break even if you needed to the bathroom
bad,"Had teams of guys working away for manpower. The guys here are absolutely clueless in the construction and utility industry. 2 weeks of work no pay blaming their client paid money owed to my company to another person. Absolute criminals. "
bad,"Good paying job, just a bad environment. A lot of unprofessional supervisors & HR's. I had to deal with a lot of negativity. Was never trained , I had to learn everything on my own. I wouldn't recommend working at Treehouse."
bad,"Diese Firma Mannpower empfähle ich niemandem sind Katastrophen, Sie nutzen nur aus, die in Baden sind am schlimmsten sehr unfreundlich. Sie spionieren gerne bei RAV.."
bad,I worked at the ada mi location for amway. Here i was told that they are hiring lots of people into the actual company. No they dont 18.months of work is your temp tims here. Cobra benefits. No pto even though u work full time.
bad,"They deleted my first bad review that I had given them."
bad,"Worst temp place I ever worked for.Dont even get me started on the low pay,no vacation time,even thou I worked for them for 10 months at 58-65 hours every week."
bad,HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT TEAM: I suffered sever discrimination and a continuance of retaliation while working for Manpower Group. My good name was slandered and my work history was tarnished as an act of malicious and unethical business practices
bad,"The entire experience was terrible and I do not recommend anyone working for or with this organization. It was a very toxic working environment, one of the best decisions that I ever made was  leaving this company."
bad,They just woke you and have no intention in helping you. There are only a few TL that actually take their job serious and professional.  They have you until you may of may not get to transition to wm.
bad,"My contract was at Sanofi Pasteur as a production technician in the harvest department. The Sanofi managers and leads are rude and talk down to manpower associates. They rush you to use the restroom, yell at you, tell you that you cannot itch your forehead and embarrass you in front of co-workers for a mistake made during first week in training. Manpower doesn’t have any benefits, useless managers and compensation way below what it should be for what is being done. I could go on and on but it’s just a terrible place to work and manpower is garbage."
bad,Manpower doesn’t do what they can to help you get employed. Even if you call they take their time to help you find a place of employment. You have to keep up with your own time and pay log.
bad,Manpower was actually a temporary agency I was hired through. They are a good company. The company I was working for through them is what I based my answers on.
bad,If you receive a paper check from it gets to you when ever it gets there. You almost have to beg for a day off.The coordinators have no idea how to help you.
bad,"Terrible people work here, they dont care about you. And they dont seem to understand simple things like i need mornings, all they send u is afternoons. And god forbid if you get hired by the company they place u at, and u get a temp layoff- they'll deny your unemployment claim."
bad,"Management at Manpower is terrible, which is probably why senior management positions in the company completely overturned 2x in my tenure with Manpower."
bad,"Intérimaire sur quimper avec Manpower,, une seule chose a dire je ne souhaite plus travaillée avec cette agence."
bad,Good job and pay  nice people who work there but very busy inside the warehouse other than that the office never pics uo the phone and don't help you out at all
bad,Worst job in the world. Married supervisor having affair with another employee with cause the work environment to be a bit stressful since the supervisor wife would sit outside of building waiting for girlfriend to come outside. Crazy situation. Lazy coworker. Supervisor pretended he was not aware of the coworker not pulling her weight. The hours were horrible and the pay wasn't worth the stress. Hated the job.
bad,"I didn't like the pace of wirk, very stressful, I was sexually harassed by several people , its mindless work and not worth the pay. I defintaly didn't last long."
bad,"Drove an hour to the interview site. Filled out paperwork. Did very well on skills assessment math test. But then the vile Bank of America refused to accept my six pieces of ID, including photo ID from the Federal government, which is accepted to get on a plane. Had drivers license, social, medicare card, birth certificate, VA health access, and VA employee cards.Total waste of my time and deprived me of a job for no good reason. The VA and the USPS both took my id for recent temp jobs, but not the vile BOC/Manpower in Windsor, CT. NOT a good way to treat veterans."
bad,"I was placed at Walmart distribution and had 2 days to learn the job with a poor trainer and then expected to be an expert at the job. Anything and everything will get you fired there and after the 90 days through manpower they told me sorry were not hiring you. They expect you to put in 12 hour shifts a day when they are busy, but if it slows down your lucky if you get a 20 hour check. Don't recommend working here for anybody. All the hired on employees are rude and try to get you fired constantly. Management only favors the hired on employees. Even hired on employees will be fired like a temp worker at any time."
bad,"A lot of discussion goes into the mission and core values statements, but when the going gets tough, upper management doesn't support its people and would as likely toss them aside in order to justify a profit, especially at the VP level."
bad,"As stated in my summary Manpower Experis doesn't or didn't care about it's employees. The company moved to another state even so it could pay employees less."
bad,"Very unorganized, this description of the job is false, With all that standing and work they make you do the money is just not that good. When you come in as a packer in PADC the training is horrible, no good English speaking person is any help. I wouldn’t recommend this job for 11.00 per hour once you get your first pay was carfare because taxes eat it right up. The work they have you doing is not worth it for that little amount of money. False advertising on this job description because it says you work your own days but that’s NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!!"
bad,"Plat hrozný :) Pořad mění směny jednou ranni/odpolední potom jenom na jednu směnu a vyhažou polovinu firmy i ty co před tydnem nebo dvěma nabraly kvuli snižovaní stavu :D no uplně na víte co ;) Přistup take hrozný. Nedoporučuju, Agentury by opravdu měly zrušit všechny a nechat jen nějake malé pro cizince jinak nejsou třeba:)"
bad,Was just a way of providing for myself. Never really got to know anyone as I worked several job sites at various time. Manpower kept me up-to-date with jobs that are available to me in my qualification.
bad,"The staffing agents at Manpower recycled the same couple people for positions and never used new clients. They would get new resumes, point out mistakes, laugh and throw them away. It was my job to interview the people they selected to bring in but those people never got hired."
bad,I had a great team. I enjoyed my clients. I was able to bring in new clients and development strong relationships. I also was able to mentor and train 2 recruiters and turned their careers around.
bad,I don't think it was right that they disqualified me from work. They send you to work and then they send you home early. I didn't like the attitude of the staff. No one got ahold of me and they number they gave me no one would call me.
bad,It was a place I ran a loader seasonal for 3 years. No chance for growth or finding a full time job. It was close to home and I worked 18 hours a day for 5 months strait.
bad,O clima organizacional não é interessante pois gera estresse.
bad,Don't work for a temp service. Wait for a direct hire position. Temp services are meeting their quota. Not searching for your best interest. Don't do it!
bad,"Pas à l'écoute des intérimaires,"
bad,"Ich bin damals nach der Ausbildung zu Manpower gekommen, weil mein Ausbildungsbetrieb die ausgelernten Azubis nicht übernimmt. Es hat mir geholfen erste Erfahrungen im Berufsleben zu sammeln - positiv und negativ."
bad,The Elgin Manpower is the worst temp agency I ever been to I told them that I had a background I was completely honest and they told me they had no jobs for me and yet to call me to put me to work even though my felony is six and a half years old I've been doing really good in life but this place sucks totally discouraging made me feel like I can never find a job
bad,"I was a hard worker there...that's all I have to say "
bad,"They make you write a anonymous review and after they don’t like you for telling the truth, they delete it off their website.. I hate this place, I was promised a full time position after my probation but that’s not the case.. communication is horrible, they don’t care about paying you.. I guess the way agency works is that they make a deal with these job companies so you can stay with the agency as long as they want so both company can make money and fire tu whenever"
bad,The place is productive but the pay was not really great and also there were no benefits being offered. Also they do not let you know when your assignment is ending.
bad,"Acerca da forma de agir da Manpower em relação às rescisões do contrato de trabalho por parte do trabalhador."
bad,"I used to be a chippy and had to think on the job "
bad,"Agenzia Che nonostante invii il CV per una offerta di lavoro in cui ti riconosci perché hai parecchia esperienza,ti ritengono il CV "" non idoneo""...ridicoli"
bad,"This was a horrible experience. Man power is the reason I went back to school, because I refuse to work hard for little pay. To arches on, but I’m would never work there again."
bad,"I have around 3 years working with this agency "
bad,Maintains diesel equipment operation by completing inspections and preventive maintenance requirements; correcting vehicle deficiencies; making adjustments and alignments; keeping records.
bad,"Nice place to work                                                                    "
bad,Never get to comfortable with the job because the assignment might end quick. An then they will tell you that they don’t have any jobs at the moment but continue to call the hotline
bad,"Empresa nao valoriza os funcionarios, nao existe progressão de carreira. Ordenados baixos nao correspondente as funcoes assimiladas pelos funcionarios"
bad,"Hello, I worked at Hermes for Menpower Birmingham, I'm very dissatisfied, I worked the  induction day 9 hours and then heard nothing from Menpower and I did not get my money. bad service no callback on my demand. Looks like they do not care .."
bad,Das übliche was man von Zeitarbeitsfirmen erwartet
bad,"They were unfair to me. They allow a man to pull my wig off or told another worker to pull my wig off, they let me go and he is still there to this very day.  I was so hard working under those conditions."
bad,really enjoyed working indoors for a change then working outdoors for most part my work experience. sure will miss the place but it is what it is. nice people.
bad,"Hier word je gebruik, roster word dagelijk gemacht. veel beloofd met heel weinig resultaten."
bad,"My office is the only experience i have with the organization, not sure if its a company wide situation but management mistreat employees, do not offers a good compensation package, there is no commissions per placement, very behind in technology, poor customer service to candidates AND clients,"
bad,I would never work for them again. I haven't heard from them for any other jobs in my area. I think it is a poor company to work for. I used to work for them before had same issues with them then.
bad,Would not recommend to anyone. Phone calls are rarely returned and job assignments are rarely reliable. Difficult to get a decent job assignment if they ever call you back.
bad,"I was hired to do staffing, which I am very good at.  towards the end they had us doing cold calls and going out door knocking to get new business.  This was not commissioned or optional."
bad,Gefällt mir überhaupt nicht Gut  man soll sich von denen die Fingern lassen.
bad,"Working environment customer service. My position productive, rules changing daily,  know advancement in  opportunity to grow Know recall as far as position ending"
bad,temp service nothing new here it is a band aid to a quick financial fix the pay is very low and no chance of advancement as i stated nothing new been this way sine the 1940's
bad,Where do I begin. They don't clock out when leaving to go off siet. They talk about other people behind their backs. They only take care of their own and their own kind. They like to use your words against you.
bad,its a job. excel at minionship. If you can be a mindless minion this may work for you. To be a good minion takes years of practice. Companies that make money from minions wages are bottom feeders.
bad,"Manpower vindt het blijkbaar niet nodig om salarissen uit te betalen. Dit na zo veel mails en belletjes. Iedere keer wordt er van alles beloofd maar niks na gekomen en word je van et kastje naar de muur gestuurd. Ook hoorde ik van meerdere collega’s die het zelfde uitbetalingsprobleem hebben. Het lijkt dus structureel te zijn. Zelf kan ik niet begrijpen dat je als uitzendbureau zo dom kan zijn dat ze niet begrijpen dat uitzendkrachten stoppen met werken voor Manpower als je hun salris niet betaald. Dit heb ik dus gedaan. Zonder uitzendkrachten is het inkomen van Manpower toch echt €0,0.-,"
bad,I was placed multiple times with little to no warning. I was hurt and they didn't want OSHA to get involved so they never wanted to work with me again.
bad,Simply wouldn’t recommend this staffing agency unless you want to be overworked and underpaid and never recognized for anything unless it’s negative!!
bad,"They Treat their employees like meat. Promising this and that, and eventually canning you before you can go full time at the given position. I do not enjoy the way my father, and I were let go"
bad,"This company seemed more interested in me as a statistic. Also, they did not represent me, when needed. This company seemed disconnected with me, and their job locations were few."
bad,"Man power needs better managements and team leaders. Team Leaders are always on their phone, see some team members sleeping and won't say anything. Their hours is unacceptable was told to make 37.50 hrs and only make no more than 25hrs a wk."
bad,"A really bad place to work. My advice, do not apply for jobs with manpower. Management are unprofessional, if you arent part of a clique then they will find any reason to fire you."
bad,"Manpower geht gar nicht"
bad,"Στα leroy merlin ,που έχει σύμβαση είναι ότι χειρότερο όποιος πάει εκεί με τις ευχές της manpower το μετανιώνει απλά..... προοπτικές εξέλιξης καμία....εργασία σκλαβιάς"
bad,"After working at the contract and submitting my hours they overloojed something and was not paid. That is not the problem,  when confronted with the problem, they turned around and blamed me for them not paying me and then the runaround over a week with has ended up with me with no job and still waiting to be paid for my work.  I highly recommend staying away from this placement agency as they are completely unprofessional about their mistakes and wil terminate you the second that you rock the boat.  If I could give less than one star I would.  They truly rate about negative 5."

bad,"Worked at E-Trade for this company Manpower.  E-Trade was a good place to work, learned banking while working there. Verified accounts to be in accordance to the Patriot Act.  Worked with fun people.  It is deadline driven, fast pace, you got to listen to your music while you worked."
bad,"Empresa que presta serviços e paga metade do salario normal, sem contar que paga atrasado e faltando,"
bad,"Hat probleme beim lohnvergütungen von mitarbeitern zu Zahlen. Angeblich wegen systemumstellung aus kg zu gmbh zu machen verzögert sich die lohnfortzahlung seit 4 Monaten 3/18 bis dato."
bad,Great clients but management is unprofessional and lives by the buddy system. You work hard and is promised promotion when it’s time to promote an excuse is made why it can’t happen. Sad that such a reputable company would allo foolish behavior.
bad,"The branch that I used sucked. Unprofessional conduct, no management skills, didn't care about their employees, no conflict resolution skills, absolutely horrible, rude, unprofessional conduct!"
bad,"In dienst van Manpower heb ik maanden voor PostNL gewerkt, echter is dit zeer slecht bevallen, Bij PostNL ben ik goed behandeld, maar ditzelfde kan ik niet zeggen over Manpower. De communicatie is slecht en vrijwel niet bestaand, op mails worden niet gereageerd en pas na verscheidende telefonische pogingen krijg je iemand aan de lijn. Ik zou een toegangspas ontvangen die ik nodig had voor mijn werkzaamheden deze kreeg ik echter pas na 4 maanden. Het meest schandaligst was de loonbetaling, pas na 3 maanden en heel veel telefoontjes ontving ik mijn eerste loonbetaling. En nu bijna 5 maanden later is de loonbetaling van de eerste maand(en) nog steeds niet rond. Wanneer iemand op vakantie of ziek is lijkt het hele bedrijf stil te vallen, waardoor (loon)problemen niet opgelost worden."
bad,The companies I was sent to treated you like you no more than a warm body to fill a job.  They never seem to have anything constructive to say.  Always a miserable day.
bad,"Do not work here. My experience was horrible. I was assigned somewhere to work and was told I would be painting. Little did I know, I showed up only to move and grind steel beams with other workers that hardly ever showed up. I was promised 14.00/hr and ended u making only 9.50/hour. They lied and were very deceitful the entire time."
bad,"Pessimi, non rispettano niente, i diritti non sanno neanche cosa siano. Mai più starei a contatto con persone del genere."
bad,"Manpower para mi es una empresa poco comprometida, ya han sido dos ocasiones en que me postuló con ellos a entrevista me mandan a llamar pero de ahí no hay otro paso aún yo cumpliendo con el requisito de la vacante, cuestionan con preguntas absurdas como para que vas a trabajar, porque, porque quieres trabajar, se me hace una tontería que te pregunte para que quieres quieres trabajas, no dan más paso sólo se queda en hay te llamamos y luego paso unos 15 o 20 días y te vuelven a llamar para volver ir a entrevista para la misma vacante que ya fuiste. Deberían de poner más atención en su personal cuando uno llega a las oficinas todos platicando te ateniense de mala gana y de igula forma los que te entrevistan te atienden de mala gana."
bad,"mala comunicacion empleado trabajador, poca estabilidad laboral y cosas contraproducentes en el contrato de trabajo"
bad,Saknade förtroende för företaget då de inte tog tillvara på bra personal
bad,If you make arrangements for a vacation months before you get hired and let them know the dates of said vacation upon being hired on they forget about it and fire you for taking said vacation.
bad,"the manager at manpower wasn't nice to employees that she put on a contract job and the manager at better foods was not nice either."
bad,"The site i worked at was ok. But the CEO of manpower was never around and the company lacked in every department, Not a big company and was only getting smaller."
bad,"à la chaine, travail peu intéressant à long terme."
bad,Agency don't have a clue what they are doing. Full of fake promises and sack anyone at any opportunity then walk you out the building like you've committed a crime when in fact you've only had a couple days of ill. Terrible human beings that run there London office anyway!!
bad,If you like job hopping and bad pay no holiday pay vactions and ect call manpower they hire and work anyone here local and will bounce you from job to job. Never allowing to be hire on full time at one location no holiday pay or paid vactions
bad,unless you receive a position to hire they are not reliable for long term employment. I wouldn't recommend them to my friends and family. Not a great company.
bad,Not enough characters to describe all the problems with this company. The first thing is they leadership is not properly trained and the head supervisor never in the office. So that's being said its a job where if you work hard nobody will even recognize your efforts.
bad,"Pésima experiencia, no lo recomiendo en absoluto. Trato deficiente, trabajo sin formación."
bad,"Comme toute les boîtes d'intérim, on vous prend et on jette aux oubliettes jusqu'au prochain coup de bourre. J'ai fait une mission en de ça de mes compétences et mon cursus. Lorsque j'ai eu un entretien avec une certaine Océane à la fin de la mission,  à propos d'un poste de chargée de clientèle bilingue pour recrutement en CDI. "
bad,"Manpower lies to its temps about the opportunities provided on a regular basis. They operate under the principle that a temp who has been hired is no longer of any use to them, and so do all in their power to keep temps from being hired. They are continually late with their paychecks and utterly dismissive of any complaints, answering all concerns with the certainty that all temps are expendable."
bad,Had to go to Mississauga from Scarborough using transit just for scanning which could have done in Scarborough branch. Wasted months of waiting for this woman who barely replies back. Didn't get an offer in Scarborough for machinist OMLC program and I graduated in a CNC program. Waste of time.
bad,"If it comes down to working for Manpower or starving, I would have to think about it."
bad,There were too many things that happened with Manpower that was handled poorly when it came to me. My direct deposit wasn't in my account when it was supposed to be. And the following pay the manager said she wasn't sure if I would be getting it. There was no follow up on their part.
bad,"well pay was ten eleven dollars hour but the first few weeks I wasn't getting my hours in to pay my bills. also they only gave two breaks for what was suppose to be a ten hour shift, which were a fifteen minute an a thirty minute lunch."
bad,"manpower is not a good place with because they lay off you in couple of months . they lacking on work assignments, and dont pay good and no benefits.."
bad,"The only reason I took a temp job through Manpower was to get into Perrigo.  They had nothing to offer me and routinely would tell me to come in the office, even though they knew I lived very far away."
bad,The assignment was a great experience I worked on a team of four people who helped in explaining what their expectations were. They respected me. This was a great assignment.
bad,I have no hope and desire work with this company because they did not try to help me gain a full time employment especially I earned an American degree in Finance and I had a prior work experience in this field.
bad,Manpower offers Contract positions - the pay sucks at that.  There may be some positions that were temp-to-perm but they weren't for the work I was interested in doing.  They simply don't have a lot to offer aside from a temp job to last you until something good actually comes through.
bad,"It is a great company to work and to learn new skills.  I have worked for such companies as HP, and various other tech giants.  It is a great place to hone good work habits"
bad,"Lots of promises, never followed thru. Some of the higher ups with secure jobs have attitudes with people who try and speak up when they felt they were being mistreated or lied to."
bad,pay not good not a normal work hours. last second change in the hours.a person may work 6 hours or work 12 hours with no notice untill you get to p&g which was the work site.
bad,this was a zero hour contract so was called in as and when when manpower contacted me not enough work  available  the management were not helpful enough
bad,"Consequentes erros no processamento de ordenandos;"
bad,They lost the contrat with the job I was place on and never called me or anything to try to get me to stay on with them. I just went to aerotek to keep my job
bad,"They do not prepare you for the environment you are about to be in. You don’t know what to expect. Management is terrible. They don’t show you anything. They drop you off at the job expecting you to know what your doing. They are not on your side. THEY ARE THERE STRICTLY TO FILL BODIES AT THAT JOB. If they don’t fill positions they don’t get paid or possibly lose their job. "
bad,"Selling of memberships for legal services through their program."
bad,Why is it required to enter stuff about a company that is not relevant?  No one seems to know why were are where we came from or where we are going.  Space is only a concept.
bad,Takiego złodziejstwa nie widziałem. Okradają pracownika na każdym kroku. Jak się poszło do biuraa żeby wyjaśnić sprawę z wypłatą czy dietą bo zawsze się coś nie zgadzało to u nich było zawsze idealnie a to my się czepialiśmy. Mamy początek kwietnia i do dziś nie dostaliśmy rozliczeń za rok 2017. dzwoniłem bo biura to mi powiedziano że zostały wysłane w styczniu. ODRADZAM PRACY U TYCH ZŁ....EJI.
bad,Bad training. Bad understanding of jobs. Bad placement of people. Do not seem to care about the people they deal with. Answer questions with out looking at you.
bad,"I got bullied by a member off staff on my assignment & they did nothing. They are useless, never go with them. Very unproffesional company. They did nothing to help me even though i was being bullied every day. Im now.on anti depressants & they didn't care"
bad,I do not have a long review of this company because I was only there for a short amount of time. We worked outside for the short time picking up trash
bad,working for a temporary agency isn't the best of choices because you are making less than the full time people but carrying the same work load.  I also couldnt afford the medical insurance
bad,Bad place to work and to start. Always waiting for a phone call to see where your next assignment will be. Office compensation always is more than what you are actually making. Benefits are not sufficient enough
bad,"Unfair treatment of longstanding staff employees. There was favoritism,and nepotism.This caused team conflicts. No career development opportunities,unless you’re favored by management or party with them, or you’re a family member of upper management. Worse place to work after staying over a decade."
bad,This is an excellent company.  I enjoyed working at Manpower.  The supervisors are friendly and informative.  I would like to work there soon.  I appreciate the opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Man kann nur soviel sagen. Man Bewirbt sich auf eine Anspruchsvolle stelle und wird im Lager eingesetzt ,Kartons von LKW auf Paletten abladen. Freundlichkeit nur beim Bewerbungsgespräch danach ist man nichts mehr Wert."

bad,"Przestrzega przed pracą w Niemczech przez tą agęcje manpower oszukują na kasie grupach podatkowych a i zdarza się im nie wypłacać wynagrodzeń utrudniony kontakt z pracownikami manpowera nie odbierają telefonów a jak już to zawsze ta sama śpiewka ja śię tym nie zajmuje to tamten a tamten jest akurat na zwolnieniu albo urlopie , czasami komputery żle działaja i wypłaty lub brakuj i tak by można pisać bez końca totalne dno stanowczo odradzam"
bad,"Manpower is a ""temp"" agency. This was the first and last time I will work for one. There were earned wage issues, safety management response issues, mishandling my social security number and last but not least, their HR dept. is almost nonexistent. I am glad it is over."
bad,Es wird einem vieles versprochen und nichts gehalten. Ich hatte einen Arbeitsunfall und während des Krankenscheins kam dann die Kündigung. Man wird ständig unter Druck gesetzt für extra Schichten. Nie wieder eine Zeitfirma. Kein Wunder das Zeitfirmen alle einen schlechten Ruf haben. Ich kann nur abraten.
bad,"Pushed lifted and carried warehouse crates weighing 50 to 100 pounds."
bad,negative work environment. Could hardly get any hours. Never knew how long I would be working in a day. Would often not get break relief. no benefits were offered.
bad,"Muy mala, no tienen ni idea. "
bad,"Very little jobs available with my qualifications, took what they had.  When asked to relocate assignment, they refused and dragged their feet.  Messed up on pay too."
bad,they are unorganized and unprofessional. no room for advancement. the leader ship is week and lack the ability to lead a group of individuals.raises do not exist.
bad,"Använder sin personal som förbrukningsvara vid bemanning hos andra företag."
bad,Got Behind 3Weeks of Checks (wasn't in beginning)                              Would never even think about working for them again......I mean never....NEVER
bad,"ayant travaillé chez eux, je trouve leurs méthodes peu recommandables"
bad,"Working at Manpower was one of the most horrible experiences of my professional career. I worked at Target and I thought it was a negative cut throat environment. Manpower makes it look like an amazing company to work for in comparison. Management is awful, training is nonexistent and there are no benefits or security whatsoever. I just hope potential candidates read through enough of these reviews and educate themselves prior to accepting a job with this extremely unethical company."
bad,The plant that they send you to is big. It has 2 different buildings and depending on where they place you and what the weather is like. Overrall it is a good plant.
bad,What you work is all you get.  No vacation. I was forced to go to this company as the other temp. agency lost the contract.  I had problems getting my pay stubs from them.
bad,"Horrible culture, pay, outsourcing, poor leadership. This company does not live up to it's promises and is now feeling the effects of jumping into outsourcing too quickly."
bad,"They messed up my schedule, told me i was scheduled but would send me home after.driving 30 mins to get to where they located me at. They send me home every day for two works because of ""schedule errors"" then told a large amount of the temps they no longer had a job."
bad,"They do not look for employment for you unless you are constantly asking about any new openings. Much easier to apply directly with the company the girls in this office are lazy, unorganized individuals."
bad,They made you feel temporary too. I would never go back management is a merry go round. I took this because at the time there was no jobs at all in michigan very hard time that year.
bad,I found the career path i am on thru ManPower. They are cool. I was really unsure about working thru a temp agency but they found me a great gig to work at and I fell in love with the job. Here I am and I work for that current job.
bad,If you get sick or need to call off they do not care. They will make sure you do not work for awhile for them. Its not like having a real job at all you're just a person if you can't make they will not call you again or let you right back to work.
bad,"Hands down the worst morale I have ever seen. Issues ignored. Sent quarterly 'surveys"" that were not anonymous. If an issue was mentioned in survey, taken into conference room and ""talked to."" Zero support from Manpower rep. Laid off and manpower rep told us we were on our own to find new jobs. No raises. No benefits."
bad,".Pay sucks and you work nonstop with barely any breaks. I worked for almost 3 mons no missed days, miss 2 for being sick and let go for bad attendance."
bad,mette des missions pour occupé les gens sans les prendre au sérieux
bad,temp work never steady pay or work get laid off all the time good if u really need a job but nothing to give u   a  career to retire from but ok for what it is
bad,"no opinion/ temp position treated like one, I am not happy camper I must find a full time position immediately. no one really knows whats going on and we are typically misinformed or the staff at manpower is misinformed or just does not have a clue whats really going on."
bad,"As a temporary placement agency, Manpower cares very little about your personal life/needs, only that you make their company look good while you're representing them."
bad,It was an ok place daehan solution in my opinion was not very professional and they need to work on keeping their employees there is alot of things that place needs to work on.
bad,The two reps I delt with ever though I emailed them every day would only place me in the job for two day. No good with a family of five. The rep's where from Visalia.
bad,Manpower is a temp service for employers. There is no insurance or vacation benefits available.if your job assignment is closed due to holiday you do not get paid for it.
bad,"This company was not a good fit for me. Poor management.  The office manager Connie lied to me when I was trying to resolve a issue with my paycheck.  Also, they don't take responsibility for their mistakes."
bad,this is a place for a student to start working with out any experience and get a feel for what they really are looking to do. the work load is not that heavy.
bad,I did not have a chance to excel in this position. At this point IBM was looking to relocate. There was not much incentive to do well. The workplace environment was tense.
bad,"After I was placed at Manpower, if was good.  i was glad to have a job."
bad,"Do not work for manpower because they lie about the job description. They get you in the office, and tell you about the postion you will be doing, when you start work your doing something totally different."
bad,it was stressfull they would call with changes at the last minute pay was usually delayed i just dont care for them at all no my kind of work envioment
bad,The manager I had to work for was not very nice.  She had her favorites and I wasn't one of them.  Made minimum wage and treated horrible.  I never want to work for man power again.
bad,Iam a 28 year old men that’s employed threw manpower I have two kids to feed there not paying me while iam hurt because they said I owe them for being overpaid for two years while on workers comp
bad,"Kurz  vor Ablauf der Probezeit gekündigt von Manpower. Ich war jeden Tag pünktlich da, auch Samstags, ohne kranken Tag, die Ingenieure waren mit mir sehr zufrieden sowie Supervisors und der Rest von der Firma Roush in Flörsheim. Manpower hat schon eine Rutine d.h. kurz  vor Ablauf der Probezeit man wird gekündigt und einen neuen Miterbeiter wird angestellt, weil Manpower dafür eine schöne Provision kriegt. Sobald das Zeitkonto voll ist, fängt man oft und oft zu Hause zu bleiben (am meistens 2 Wochen am Stück) bis Zeitkonto fast leer ist. Wenn noch circa 30 Stunden auf dem Konto übrig sind, kriegt man von Manpower per Post die Kündigung. Warum sind die letzte 30 Stunden so ""wichtig""? Die Kündigungsfrist ist max 14 Tage...davon 7 Tage unbenutzte Urlaubstage und der Rest ist vom Zeitkonto genommen. Typische Sklaverei"
bad,I do not have any good reviews for this company. I was not impressed. If you get hired on with a company and then try to return to Manpower later in years they will not even talk to you.
bad,worked at customer account of Manpower. There was no follow up on progress of the job and Manpower was not helpful to resolve situations. No follow up on assignments
bad,"They treat you so poorly over the phone/in person, speaking down to you and contradicting what you say. Absolutely disgusting. Will never go through them again."
bad,This is exactly what is wrong with the local job market... Places like this. Places like this should be required by law to pay the people working for the money the wage they are actually robbing from people.
bad,"Leider muß man auf Bewerbungen die man abgegeben hat ewig auf Antwort warten , aber wenn die jemand brauchen sei es auch nur für Tage dann ist man der richtige , man hätte eine Zukunft nach einer Woche wird man aus Gründen die keine sind abserviert und wieder gekündigt , danach hört man nie wieder was die Bezahlung ist sehr schlecht ,"
bad,"Manpower will aid in finding jobs.  They have medical, dental, vision, and life insurance for their employees.  The company is good to work for in the short term, especially if you have been recently laid off."
bad,"The dress code was very strict however the manpower team leads did not follow it. All you had to do for a TL position was kiss butt. There was a support line for when customers wanted a supervisor, however you could be looking at a team lead, calling support line, or even get up and tell them that you needed a takeover and you would have to wait 30 minutes - 1 hour. Aka non of the TLs did their job. Manpower also falsely advertised the job as every other weekend off plus a $100 sign on bonus, which nobody got either. There were a lot of people that didn't get paid for 3+ weeks when you are supposed to get paid weekly. Manpower is a poorly ran company around here anyways."
bad,"My manager was not honest about anything with the job I was assigned to, my pay checks were always incorrect without my overtime included, the time to start and stop the job did not manifest with what she had me sign up for.  The time clock was installed and was not accurate nor was it ever fixed."
bad,The company has many jobs to offer but they are very hard on people who has an diabilites. I have RA so it is hard for me to do factory work and when its heavy it is not good on my body.
bad,"C'est un travail assez complexe et polyvalent on ne s'ennuie pas dans une agence manpower. Il y a toujours un truc à faire. Cependant le salaire reste faible comparé a la charges de travail. C'est une belle expérience, une excellente école très formatrice. Même si j'aspire à d'autres rêves Manpower m'a  beaucoup apporté."
bad,Agence Manpower il faut faire toujours comme eux il veulent sinon il vous colle une mauvaise étiquette sur votre dos 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
bad,"Sinceramente a minha experiencia com a Manpower foi bastante negativa. Os contratos de formacao sao bastante ""duvidosos"" alem disso tentam dar a impressao que se preocupam bastante com o bem estar dos funcionarios mas na pratica os mesmos sao vistos apenas como numeros,logo descartaveis."
bad,never knew what kind of attitude you had to work with or if you where gonna get sent on a job or not even if they had openings or not     if the high up manage was there her 1 day a week  the day went like it should have but othere than that i would not recommend to anyone
bad,"I was with Manpower Group. They closed their office in my area.  I never got enough assignments to stay with them. I liked working at the temporary assignment. Unfortunately, the assignment did not become permanent."
bad,"Après avoir travaillé plusieurs années avec eux, je ne les recommanderai pas. Les employés de ce service et particulièrement la conseillère m'étant attribuée ne se sent absolument pas concernée par le cas des personnes qu'elle embauche afin d'effectué ces missions. Impossible de la contacter en fin de mission, ne tient pas compte des espérances du travailleur, ne prend pas note des informations lui étant communiquées."
bad,"I was placed at a warehouse called CDW. For the most part the job was pretty straight forward, some days were 8 or 9 hrs some were 6 or 5. The latter part of the year we were not allowed to wear anything but company insignia clothing especially during winter season. Some weeks they didn't disburse payment. I do not recommend them as a staffing agency."
bad,"MANPOWER really allows the companies to disrespect and mistreat employees.  They don't work well with flexibility and are unorganized especially in Durham, NC."
bad,Easy temp to work with. No advancement. Jobs pay next to nothing but if you need one you can find one. Not a ton of opportunity but if you need a job you can get one.
bad,Management was very poor . Workers were given little to no benefits for doing jobs that others that were not temps were doing . Management expected employees to come in on their days off even if they weren't scheduled and work if not be terminated .
bad,"At the ScJ plant... Pay is only good if you can work your life away. Policies change at the drop of a hat. Jobs are fairly easy, but poor chance of actually being ""trained"" correctly. Extremely poor management."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of getting the residents out of bed, grooming and bathing them or assisting with bathing and ADL's. I would then encourage them to participate in activities with other individuals. Helping them eat, drink, read, and maintain self independence. When not helping physically helping a client, I would tidy up their living space, hang clothing, and wash clothing."
bad,Do not ask any question of Manpower about the Job you are on. Make sure to find a friendly manager at the Job site and ask them the questions. The folks at Manpower do not help at all and if you are hired by the company you work for they try to take all the credit for it.
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated from an assignment while working in Seguin "
bad,Management has no experience on their field. They take priority on family members working for them. They do not provide training - worst work experience ever.
bad,benefits no promotions & they gave it to people behind u even if u Been there longer. I left after 3 years no rase no nothing. I would treat the people that actually stay and do there job a little better not so mush as if there arcreplabe
bad,"actual work is not what was described in job posting, zero benefits, no vacation, no holidays, mandatory overtime, when calling the office, often get referred to some other number to call."
bad,It was a temp agency. I worked for Sony. I thought I was going to get a permanent position until it closed but it did and laid off hundreds of peoples.
bad,"Original manager was good,  They re orged the teams and the new manager was a loof.  No longer enjoyed working there so I looked for a new job.  Was not getting paid enough so the move was easy,"
bad,"No communication, no chance for Advancement in career, do not follow safety standards, ......States directly in employee handbook provided to me there is no chance for hire to company- I was assigned to a jobplace called exact packaging and I was forced to do 3 peoples job functions for pay of $9 hr, the workplace was unsafe with constant injuries, machines breaking down and catching on fire and lots of drug use on job site. I was fired when I informed supervisor of unsatisfactory conditions"
bad,Helps people get jobs for an undisclosed percentage of your wages negotiated between the company doing the hiring and Manpower.  Help you get your foot in the door to companies.  Sometimes the only way into a company.
bad,"Very temporary job, paid minimum wage, the hours were always different, some days they would call and tell you not to come in, no room for advancement."
bad,"Mindestlohn, keine Fahrtkostenerstattungen, billige Arbeitskleidung welche auf Dauer nicht zufriedenstellend ist. "
bad,Happy I moved on from working the temp jobs offered through Manpower. Honestly feel like its just a way for big company's to get some cheaper labor with out having to actually hire you on.
bad,"No benefits, gave you jobs that did not go with your resume, did not work with you when it came to concerns or requests, the jobs they gave you often did not give you the chance to be hired on or grow."
bad,"I didn't like this job because I had one supervisor telling to go to defects and a different one telling me to go to raw materials. On my second day, I had a really bad panic attack and they fired me on the spot."
bad,"They can get you a job quick, but dealing with the people that hire you is something else. They are rude and unprofessional. How they have managed to keep their jobs for how many years is a surprise."
bad,Placed in a position where Staffing Agency was aware my hours would be cut.  Manpower does not always give information as to whether the job is full/part time or seasonal.
bad,their demands were very high but their pay is way too low. we would have to work the seven days a week. supervisors would be over your shoulder and didnt feel right
bad,"No ofrecen una estabilidad laboral, solo se centran en ofrecer extras, sin posibilidad de estabilidad laboral en ningún negocio."
bad,"Very hard to get in contact with anyone for another assignment."
bad,"They didn't know where training was, when it was, or what company I was even going to be working for. They ended my assignment first day of training because they accidentally hired too many people for the job."
bad,Der Berater Carlos boshard. Passen sie auf mit ihm. Arrogant und rassist.
bad,"A equipe que trabalhei é otima, pessoas comprometidas que queriam mesmo trabalhar e davam o melhor de si, a supervisora eleita era o oposto tratava os funcionarios, e os cliente super mal."
bad,The jobs that they provide are jobs that don't meet my skillset. They always have wait jobs and never any office jobs for paraprofessionals or college degree holders.
bad,I didn't get many hours.  I was sent to multiple job sites and still didn't get many hours after asking for full time.  I wasn't doing job I was sent there to do.
bad,"Hired on for Title Services for $17.00 hourly to start...3 weeks into working, I received first paycheck...$15.00 hourly and they denied the initial disclosure of $17.00 hourly.  After researching, found that they've done this to many people throughout the United States."
bad,By far the worst place I ever worked for they have rude managers and rude employees who will try and leave for anything and their not structured what so ever
bad,They get you a job work you for however long then let you go even when it is not your fault you never get ahead working for manpower your left fighting and struggling to get by week to week.
bad,Its a temp company...what do you expect. They are legal pimps. They make money off of every hour you work. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that wants to make a living.
bad,I was told this job would last a few months and then 2 weeks later i find out the job is over. These guys pay very very low no matter if you have almost 20 yrs experiance
bad,you are on your feet 7 days a week for 12 hour shift. yes the pay is good but when the job is done they let you go. they really don't care if you have a family or bills to pay.
bad,"If temp agency are going to send people out somewhere that could potentially become full time employment for individual, they should do some checking.  I went thru very intense training and worked 93 days doing customer service that I really enjoyed.  I was ecstatic when asked to be part of the team full time.  However I had to pass a company background check, which turned into being a problem.  I haven't had anything on record since 2011 and completely changed my life.  Yet I was walked out of company like I was a horrible criminal."
bad,"Das schlimmste war Manpower!!!"
bad,"they help you get a job so they can skim off the top, as you work for them they skim what your actually getting paid buy at least a dollar or more per hour!"
bad,Sofort eingestellt worden und direkt nach 2 Tagen ohne Grund mit einem Kollegen der zeitgleich mit mir anfing gekündigt mit der selben lächerlichen Begründung. Bei Nachfragen widerspricht sich jeder jedem in dieser Firma. Niemandem zu empfehlen!
bad,"Staff and management are really rude! I was sent to a material processor job but when I got there they have me doing maintenance work, I went to Manpower to let them know but was greated rudely Buy employees. They sent me to interview for Chrysler and a week later told me they could not work with me because of the way I had left my last job which I did not leave any bad way I went directly to Manpower to let them know I was not trying to work in maintenance. Brought my mother in  with me so she could see I was not lying to her and she also noticed how rude they were and how they are not understandable at all period will never go there again do not recommend to nobody it's the worst place to go to. I recommend Furst Staffing and never had any problems with them they are good and we'll find you a job fast unlike Manpower which they take their time to look for a job obviously if you're staffing agency it's to get a job fast enough for you to sit on your but  all day navigate to you computer not doing nothing. Furst Staffing is the place to go at."
bad,"postes évolutifs possibles,"
bad,"A typical day would be very unorganized, no one knows what to do.. I learned how to ignore a lot of negativity that's going on. The management wasn't to good. No one was really there. The hardest part being there was working around a lot of grown childish people. The most enjoyable part was getting off and going home to my kids."
bad,Staff didnt want to help relocate me to new job placement after my contract expire at my first placement. I called the office multiply times and no response from anyone.
bad,"Lors de mon embauche la Dame me dit c'est du temps plein 40 heures. Lors de mon premier quart après 4 heures de travail seulement le superviseur vient me voir et me dit qu'il doit envoyer des employés chez eux car il n'y a pas assez de travail.  Une vrai farce. Le superviseur me dit qu'il n'as même pas assez d'heures pour lui... Bref, à éviter!"
bad,"didn't care about you at all, told you not to go in some days, payed minimum wage for over night shifts, all in all a horrible experience. don't advise ever working there unless you have to"
bad,"dåliga på att hålla kontakt och fixa uppdrag , såvida du inte är från Norden. svårt att ge en åsikt då du inte får några uppdrag . Troligen lättare om du bor hemma hos mamma och pappa.."
bad,Poor working environment. Complete disrespect for the employees that are there for the production of goods for the company. No communication between supervisors and employees.
bad,Manpower is not a company where you can grow. Pay is low and if you choose to enroll in Insurance you will be working to pay for benefits. Company has no direction.
bad,this was a temporary job and the pay was very little only did this job for a little bit since I was seeking permanent employment. this company was very unorganized so everyone was always scattered around not knowing what they were to do the day they went in to work and the schedule was never set weekly it was on a daily basis as well as working over the time the schedule was set for you to be released
bad,"Gdy zaczynałem prace wszystko było czytelne i jasne,teraz jest coraz gorzej,czasami nawet pracownicy mówią co innego a robią co innego, jest to bardzo dziwne i daje dużo do myślenia, wszystko zmienia się błyskawicznie.Oby nie wynikła z tego jakaś tragedia..."
bad,"Empresa sem profissionalismo "
bad,"Management non compétent, revue salarial inexistante, pas de plan informatique à moyen et long terme"
bad,"Wenn man selber bei Manpower kündigt, werden einem nur Steine in den Weg gelegt. Z.B. wurde die Arbeitsbescheinigung nur ausgestellt, als das Arbeitsamt es mit Druck angefordert hatte. Ich wurde immer nur vertröstet. Außerdem sollte ich für einige Tage Krankengeld bekommen. Trotz bisher 4-maliger Aufforderung der Krankenkasse die Daten zur Berechnung des Krankengeldes zu schicken, verweigert dies Manpower bis heute. Unglaublich. Ein richtiger Drecksladen ist das."
bad,I only worked for this temp agency for a brief time.  I got hurt on the job and sued them for negligence.  I would not work for this company ever again.
bad,"Manpower did not present me good at all, and left me to fend for myself without paying me when I refused to continue. I directly stated I only wanted permanent positions and was in a temporary contract for 9 months. Wasted time."
bad,les responsable toujours derrière vous jamais content pas de pose
bad,À mon avis il faut boycotter toutes ces boîtes intérimaires il vous jette comme un vieux sac poubelle aucune reconnaissance et tout cet argent ne reste pas en Suisse vu que ce sont des boîtes étrangères......
bad,Working with a temp service going from job to job is not for me i wish for a more stable employment. will not go through another temp service.
bad,Great if you looking to work temp. Easy way to find work but never stay working great management though I have to say you can always call and they will do their best to get you working
bad,my application on line for a 3rd shift light assembly job and they called  to have  come in and when i did they told me that all they have is job that r for 35 to 75 lb. And work 75 to 80 hours a week !!!!!
bad,"Had so much trouble from day one with this company!"
bad,my first opportunity to enter on work environment. not organized. not good environment to work. handle with difficult persons and partners
bad,"Overall a very poor experience. Management Absolutely dreadful. Training us poor, manager often bullied staff, a fear culture and always treading on egg shells, salary compared with industry standard very low level. Would be very wary."
bad,the staff are rude and don't want to do there job they also forget about you for months on end and forget that if your running late and still have a go at you after 2 months of no work at all
bad,"Ich habe mich vor einigen Monaten mal beworben. Sogar auf zwei verschiedene Stellen zu zwei verschiedene Zeiten. Manpower hat sich nie gemeldet, so habe ich mind. 5x im Monat angerufen um zu fragen ob es was gibt. Die ersten 2x musste ich meine Bewerbung nochmal schicken, weil es hiess, dass sie es nicht finden. Jedesmal bekam ich die Antwort: Ah.. Ja, gibt nichts neues. "
bad,"Not reliable at all I got one offer for an 8 hours shift at a factory and that's it only 1 job offer in 6 months. That's ridiculous the hardest part about working with manpower was getting a hold of them to ask if they had any opening it was always the same thing, leave a message, 4 days later they call you back just to say that they didn't have anything."
bad,This company would pull me from assignments and are in the process trying to have my unemployment check revoked because I was not able to work a 2 day gig for them in 2015. Not to mention they had discharged me also.  smh.
bad,They did not give me all the details about a job that they sent me to and the job let me go now I'm jobless and manpower is not working with me at all they just left me hanging.
bad,"The hours are to long and the pay is not enough . After your 90 days is the only pay raise you get. You don't have room for growth ,  I feel for the hours we be there we should get paid more."
bad,Always see ads in paper everytime I call they say no work. Then I would have a friend call in and they would tell that person there is work. need more chance for work or to take on less clients so the can out people to work
bad,"Oversaw the on-site staffing management system at client location. Roughly responsible for 150 temporary associates(warehouse). "
bad,"They will not hire you again its just a one time project thing. Easy and great pay for a one time project week or weeks then your done. You have to track your hours, they will short you."
bad,"Cleaning"
bad,"Falsche Abrechnungen, Geld passte so gut wie nie, wurde teilweise mit Absicht unterschlagen.Unfreundlich, inkompetent, unfähig.Man wird vor dem Kunden schlecht hingestellt.Manpower hält sich nicht an den Vertrag.Urlaubsscheine verschwinden, unverschuldete fristlose Kündigungen mit zusätzlicher Sperre ! VORSICHT ⚠ !  Lieber eine andere Zeitarbeitsfirma suchen.Sowas habe ich noch nie erlebt.Unverschämt,selbst die Beschwerdestelle.Nicht mal mehr als letzter Ausweg.Teilweise vier Schichten für'n Appel und'n Ei"
bad,"A typical day under Manpower's employment was confusing. Field agents never showed to job sites unless there was a major problem. However, I did learn how to update loans. My co workers were generally into mischief because management wasn't around. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of the job was pay day and occasional adventures."
bad,"I got hurt and it took 2 years for their insurance to agree to pay for the surgery, when they knew within the first week I needed to have the surgery."
bad,Pay is a stressful and not on time had to wait two weeks for my money to be put on my ADP card and I know for a fact manpower is no good for me good luck to whoever applying.
bad,Barely any work and when you do have work its for 60+ hours only to be laid off and the next job is a drastic pay cut and some of the office people are rude and unprofesional.
bad,They were no help whatsoever they constantly gave me a back and forth run around. no one wanted to help find work . Management was constantly referring me to others who couldn't help me.
bad,"I found work through manpower in BT (as their client) in Dundee"
bad,They don't have many jobs to offer in my area. When you call the office no one ever answer the phones. It's very hard to get in touch with any one.
bad,This is the same question that I answered regarding Manpower. I don't understand why it's asking for me to review it again. I will not return to Manpower due to the fact that they just put you anywhere without worrying if you fit the job or not.
bad,"manpower would you send to only three factories and only one of them was decent to work at. the other two, chiyoda and heartland, would continuously make you do overtime and you would have to work on very little sleep."
bad,"Manpower, es una tecercera y se queda con todos los beneficios utilidades, dias feriados, hasta con la canasta de navidad"
bad,"So I started this warehouse job in Leicester all was going well when i was doing everything by the book then I had a few days off on the sick as I was not very well, I got this snotty text saying that the company did not want me back as they said I have not really showed any interest in the job they did not even have the cursity to ring me or even try and keep my job they don't care about you as an employee they are only bothered about there contracts and the handbook they give ain't worth sh** they have not even been in touch to offer me any work this is the manpower branch in Leicester they think that they are above you as they are providing you with work when all they do all day is drink coffee and pen push I really hope agency's will be a think of the past in future STAY CLEAR!!!!"
bad,the same experience as unilever because manpower hires temps for them. The money was good for a temp service but its the same drama. The clicks and gossipers
bad,"fob you off with a couple days work promises of more work but then every time i went it i was told nothing available and within a couple of days after company had moved not heard from them since."
bad,I worked flex shift. 2 weeks on 1st and 2 weeks on 2nd. I loved it there. my co-workers was fun and enjoyable. I never had an argument with any of the co workers.
bad,"Do not work here all of their timeclocks are wrong and they refuse to set them right also they play favorites and If they dont like you u will recieve a swift kick up your bum. One of the supervisor actually sexually harrassed at least 2 girls if not more."
bad,"Working for Manpower was very disappointing for me.  I have worked with many temporary agencies in my 25+ career and I can honestly the management team in the Tannersville Manpower office is the worse. They were very unprofessional when you walked into the office.  They were not friendly at all.  The worst part of working for Manpower was working for TMG Health Systems. Please do not work for this company. The worse customer service ever.  They wanted us to show exceptional customer service to members and providers who call in, but we didn't show it to each other.  The Supervisors who have worked their over 10-20 years are so unhappy! They don't smile when they come into work or say hello.  They yell across the floor...""Get back in queue!"" That's all they care about. You may have a member that needs urgent medication and for some reason the insurance company has made a mistake and it's no longer covered.  If we get out of queue and go to project to help the member, the supervisors are upset because you are not taking phone calls.  Wow! We are helping a member for heaven's sake!! "
bad,I worked for Manpower and the employer decided they did not like the way I looked.  Came to me and told me I was being replaced by someone younger.  Manpower done absolutely nothing.  I am presently out of work now. I call Manpower every morning and report I am available for work and they have not supplied me with anything.  They never even acknowledged that I worked on the assignment  for 5 years straight with only 3 days off. Today it has been 3 months off work.  I apply online to a Manpower and other companies.  One of the other comments said they  will call when you are on your way out  the door and tell you that you are no longer needed is so true.
bad,"Niet leuk, te weinig opdrachten voor een stagiaire. Niks geleerd"
bad,I can't even give this company one star rating they are disgusting the way staff are treated and they can't even sort your tax out and end up with nearly no wages at all. One day I had to leave the work place early  to go to the eye infirmity because of the poor air conditioning system in the contact centre I was sacked sounds pathetic I know never trust this company they cannot manage the fuxxing business.Another thing the job I was supposed to do was unavailable so was out into a horrible campaign to do with elections I was bored out of my skull
bad,"Manpower is a temp agency, but they have no plans to hire anyone on permanently. Management were always criticizing instead of uplifting and telling you what you were doing well at. The job was boring, which is just a personal opinion. Manpower were laying off employees, and ended up laying off the wrong employees. When the employee went to Manpower about the issue, they wrote it off and told HR the employee resigned, hurting their opportunity for unemployment. There was limited opportunities for advancement and pay raises."
bad,"Typically we would interview and find new people to fill jobs. I was not trained properly and was expected just to know everything. Which is fine, I can manage on my own. The real problem is with management and co-workers! They are a complete joke, play favorites, and do nothing to make sure that everyone is following the same policy. The particular co-worker I had the most unpleasant time being with was a pathological liar and did whatever she wanted without getting in trouble... ever!! I made the mistake of listening to my branch manager at the time and doing what I was told. The co-worker then made sure to point it out to the DM and then of course my branch manager lied about it. The most enjoyable part of that job was the day that I left. I would never recommend Manpower to anyone, it is more like jr high with all the games. If you work for them, watch your back."
bad,"manpower is a joke."
bad,"Poor communication with recruiters. Ive called in for 4 months, available, one call back. Said I HAD to have Excel experience for most of their office jobs. It's been 4 years since I've utilized excel in its full capacity and the majority of employers don't use excel, In my experience. "
bad,"Got let go for missing my one day, wich a family member passed and yes i did call in early. There answer was the company is a at will employer."
bad,"When the assignment is terminated, they do not share or give explanation as to why the assignment ended, and they notify employees hours after getting off work in the evening. Even worse, they do not follow up to see what other positions may fit you or assist in making sure potential employees take advantage of other available positions."
bad,"I applied for a ""lab"" position for Manpower at a well known factory in Cape Girardeau, but instead was made to do hard manufacturing work.  Manpower lied everyday about something else.  Even when asking direct questions, it is difficult if not impossible to get a direct honest answer.  The ad for the job on indeed said it paid $10/hr, but when I signed paperwork at manpower it said 7.65 for orientation and 9/hr after that.  They said I would be working manufacturing until the lab opened on the 24th, but actually they just wanted to train for the factory first so you can be utilized there also.  I figured I would be given a relatively easy job, but instead I was made to walk the entire length of the site for 10 hours, and push and pull carts and stack boxes.  This is not a ""lab"" position."
bad,Very poor pay and taken advantage of employee's work hours. There was no advancement for better jobs. Poor record keeping. This company is only good for working a month or until you find a better job quickly. I would recommend looking for a company with integrity and who respects there hard working employees.
bad,Horrible place to work for. They took over a month just to pay me my first check. Also the people in the office were very rude and unprofessional. Also never work for publishers if you can help it unorganized and the first day I started they told me I would never advance in the company and the highest I would ever make is 12 an hour this was told to me by someone that's been there 20 plus years good for quick money but not a career
bad,cumplimiento con los pagos y tratan de ubicarlo de acuerdo al sector donde vive el  empleado
bad,"I was registered with Manpower for 4 years, got put on RBS (The Royal bank of Scotland) contract and worked there for three and a half years, they always stick up for them over you because too scared to lose contract as office is walking distance, always come and have a word with you when make one error or when staff complain about you, always get you to sign forms so your word against theirs, I got unfairly dismissed from RBS due to a machine error that wasn't my fault, no training given. They release you no matter how long you worked for them, they didn't support me when I was sacked unfairly. They promised would get me another job, never happened, rang, emailed and heard nothing back. Useless agency. Unprofessional. Go elsewhere."
bad,"Eerste contact person was erg goed ze is menselijk ... maar meet mijn salaris ik krijgt  altijd problem... Contact met Manpower ook niet so makelijker ."
bad,"My typical day at Recaro was very challenging, Because the President and Building manager never seemed to be satisfied with all the hard work that my co-workers and myself were putting out on a daily basis. The hardest part was when the building manager would come out on the floor every hour and complain about our numbers which were right where they supposed to be however everyday he would raise the numbers and would tell our line leader to inform us every hour on the hour that if we did not hit those numbers by the end of the day he would start terminating people. We were building child safety seats and we could not rush that process because jf one of those seats malfunctions in the commission of an accident and the child was injured or worse we would be held responsible we worked 7 days a week on Sunday we did not receive any double time but we all still showed up to work everyday and as a result this company is back on it's feet and growing only from our hard work the production worker's not the line leader not quality and certainly not management. Myself along with many other of my co-workers had worked their for over four years with know raises or appreciation and when the finally hired us in we still did not receive a raise, we all gave it 100% each day we came to work and management knows this as a fact, and I can prove it, I guess the most enjoyable time or part of the job was punching out and going home. Over all the credit should go to all of my co-workers and myself for bringing this company to where it is today, in closing my opinions about management at this company"
bad,"es una empresa que no da la opurtunidad de crecimiento,carece de muchos derechos laborales."
bad,"fun energetic work environment, great co-workers and staff, I learned the importance of being a team player. the hardest part is being and working in confined spaces"
bad,One of my worst job experiences ever!!! This was a totally degrading experience!! Never ever ever ever ever ever again!!!!!
bad,They do not care about personal need or and thing that need fixed they blow you off as if your nothing. asked for several help but yet was left to be by my self and figure things out. but hey that made me such a stronger person thanks Manpower for sucking at your job.
bad,"muy buena, la verdad siempre están al pendiente y dan capacitación constante, mantienen una buena relación con los empleados"
bad,"When I was hired to be a production operator I was injured on the job. Struggled so much with the work comp being I was unclear what to do never having to need work comp before. Asked for a little guidance, It seemed like it was a bother for them."
bad,Worked with me to get me placed at the company I wanted to work at. Very helpful staff and always willing to answer any questions.
bad,"Everything about manpower is horrible, i was let go from many different jobs, for being early, showing up on time, and getting along with people."
bad,Lack of communication between line leads and employees. I was promised a machine operator position only to find out that the position was eliminated and they don't make $18 an hour
bad,"Spent more time ""trusting"" they would find work, but the efforts were futile. Called everyday,and got a lame excuse (usually the same excuse)"
bad,They are very dishonest people. They tried to forge my name on a document so I could not get unemploymen benifits. I told them to get me another job and I would not get unemployment. Instead of getting me another job they fired me form their temp service.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. They pay you nothing, make you work harder then your pay grade, no job security, no help from office. Would not recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,"This was a temp position with another position ready after that. However there was horrible communication because none of us had jobs at the end of the assignment. Also while working you would get 5-8 calls a day asking you why you were not at work even if you were at work and or was scheduled off. "
bad,I would love the opportunity to learn so much more. Didn't really get the opportunity to grow as I wanted. But still excited to have the opportunity for more growth just want to add my experience to a growing company.
bad,J'ai opéré ces dernières années sur tous les foires et expositions de paris et régions.
bad,"Having worked at Manpower, I found that my ethics did not align. Additionally, it seemed as though they were far behind the curve when it came to efficiency, fairness, and being the leader in the marketplace. I was less than impressed with the office environment, leadership, and team interactions. I felt more like I was a Social Worker, if anything."
bad,Making boxes. Making boxes. Mananement was poor. My co workers were ok. The hardest part of my job was meeeting quota. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking with other people.
bad,So much work responsibility and extremely under compensated.  Although I did acquire many skills that have made me more valuable as an employee.
bad,not at this time. later. not a good place to work. all conditions are bad. they don't how to run a business.  need new management. new hr department. have to many bosses. working conditions. they don't care at all.
bad,Fast pace work. Not too far from home. Basic Cleanroom environment. Nice people in work place. Fast pace work.  Standing or sitting positions.
bad,Allow disrespectful agents to continue in job post.  The company that I was sent to was a great company. The company provided good training.  The company was an enjoyable place to work.  This job was not temp to hire.  Manpower staff went unchecked and had a revolving door of workers.
bad,they called me up on my 7 off that the mine had no more use for me and laid me off then made up some story that is not true so i could not do the job i really wanted and was qualified for
bad,when looking for a job its really good but pay could come up a lot. they put me right to work really handy when used them right.
bad,"it just is bad, they take three weeks to find you a job and then its a horrible fit and over and over and over untill you eventually get fed up with it and then quit. and end up back there because no where is hriing."
bad,"This company is very unprofessional and do not care about the assignments they place you on.  The company treats you like a child and does not respect you as an adult. I now have a paycheck that is 17 days late since the company does not want to pay me and the customer service continues to send the check to the wrong address."
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever worked in. I can find nothing good to say except some great work colleagues. Managers are unprofessional and bullies, would not get a job anywhere else but they have been there for years. The training is rubbish and any mistake is jumped upon. High turnover of staff and lots of backstabbing which seems to be encouraged by one manager in particular. There are loads of better jobs out there. Pay is a joke £6.50 for loads of responsibility. Have moved to a new company now and I am loving it. Glad I am out of there and wouldn't advise any one to take up a zero hour nightmare of a job here."
bad,"They set you up for failure. terrable non benifets. Basically they profit from finding employees(like thats hard). They also make it harder to work as in house buy forcing the contractee to buy out of the contract. They also purposely put you on temporary hiatus when the contractee  is legally obligated to hire you after so many hours. But they will try to sell you on the lie that its a priority to place you in a perminant position. As an employee of manpower, your permanently a temp. They intentionally hold you back in life. Their ""benifets"" may as well be non existant. Healthcare is too expensive and useless, they make the paid vacation almost impossible to get by having very strict rules on how you qualify. No raises or premotions for good quality work or seniority, they instead just fire you for bad quality. Your just a number at manpower!  The recruiter will lie and tell you whatever you want to hear! In my job, everybody who was hired at the plant I worked at was fired from manpower first.its a company that is desperate for new employees..... For a REASON!!!"
bad,"On call for conventions and events. Bad hours, bad supervisors. Good co workers and fun jobs. Good environment to be around ."
bad,"The work itself isn't too difficult, but the pay is very very poor and there is little security with zero hour contracts in place.  The office itself is poorly maintained, with unclean toilet and kitchen facilities and only a couple of parking spaces for managers."
bad,"I will not use manpower ever again! The office support is rude, if there is a problem with your contracted company they do not get involved! Every time I have had a question I left the local office frustrated and calling the main office to get the help and answers to my questions.  Manpower is not competitive with other employment services with their benefits."
bad,"They provide you with work every so often but that work usually ends after a certain period of time, You have to constantly call for work, they treat their employees with no professional regard, Their management thinks you are only looking for excuses, they don't give ANY benefits."
bad,I worked for manpower and got my assignment discontinued because i had court and couldnt rescedule so had to take the day off then later that same day got a phone call from local manpower office informing me that i was not to report for work the next that that my assignment was terminated
bad,"One Word ..... Shocking"
bad,This is one of the worst places I have worked. The supervisors dont care about their employees and rarely ever come around to check on how you are doing at your job. Unless that is they are going to write you up for something. You get no benefits while working temp service and normally you have to work three times longer than required to become permanent.
bad,". At the beginning everything seem fine.. but after worker there a couple months it went sour. Poor communication between manpower company,employment place, and manpower workers."
bad,"signer des conventions avec de nouveaux clients ou des clients récurrents."
bad,Management are normally nowhere to be found; had to call for a CSM numerous times on numerous occasions causing customers to be frustrated.
bad,"I have to say, working at BT as a manpower agency worker was one of the worst things I've done. The calls you get through are ridiculously hard to save, and BT themselves don't give you much help or support. You're always seen as part of Manpower, and not BT, so the managers don't truly manage you. Oh yeah, and a BT employee will earn alot more than you for the same job. Did I mention the 'lucrative' BT contracts come out once a year, and unless you're ridiculously good (or a suckup), you've got no chance. Progression there is non existent. You may get to be a floorwalker in about 3 years, and that is sadly no joke."
bad,"They are a good company. They help provide a foot into good companies. They are professional."
bad,"My former branch manager there dragged my name through the mud for no good reason.  As it turned out, one of his own employees reported him to the company and they demoted him because of it."
bad,"Not recommend if you want advance opportunities and growth within the company.  No training, must learn on your own.  Management had no standard of operation manual.  They had no clue what the position's duties entailed."
bad,"I received a promotion after working for the company for one month."
bad,"not good jobs, they use you so much, they say that the jobs are temp to hire but they are not. low paying jobs. not good jobs at all. waste of time."
bad,Working here was alright when there was work available. Its hard to to be busy when you ask for work and management doesn't give you anything to do but gets mad because you aren't do anything.
bad,"They need to not lie on employees, pay more, not take the words of staff within the company before letting people, let employees advance within the company itself."
bad,"Gestión rápida de contrato, Seguimiento y control y soporte muy correcto."
bad,"I worked as a retention advisor in belfast"
bad,this company only cares about the money they make from you working they care very little for the employees just that there is a warm body there.
bad,"Agency work can be a horrifying experience they treat you like cattle and like their not making money off of you working through a third party anyways, but with things being so screwed up for some including me, its the only way companies will even take notice of your resume."
bad,A lot of standing for 10 hours and pay not that great. I didn't like it there only because I'm not a factory type person and it wasn't for me. The people were helpful though.
bad,"I worked for Manpower as a BT retentions advisor for 3 months"
bad,Working three or more people. Depending one what jobs were needed.
bad,worked at Pittsburg Lumber.  Unloaded trucks and worked with truck drivers  I was laid off and closed doors shortly there after
bad,"Remember.. before you go to work for an agency your basically employed to do all the jobs no one else wants to do and the wages  are bad.. if they put an add on with a wage from say £9.00 - £13.00 per hour.. well don't expect more than the lowest, it's got even worse now due to changes in staff as you get treated as a second rate citizen from a stuck up woman at manpower.. no point in complaining as you end up not getting any work for a week or two,  managed to get full time employment and intend to keep it as I don't want to resort to that soul destroying agency ever again."
bad,"They hired about three people and myself at the same time saying that they were looking far and wide for people to fill the ""many"" open positions they had. Though to my dismay they laid off most of all their employees at the warehouse I had only just started working at. They had me employed for less then a month before they let me go after making seem like they were going to have work for me for quite a while. Not to mention when the day that they had been laying off people they didn't even bother to let me know so I had shown up to work only to be told to leave by security and when I called the Manpower office they also told me they had no inattention of laying me off and told me to just keep going to work, just to be told the following monday I was supposed to be laid off the week before. So I would only recommend working for Manpower if you want to only have a job for  month before you're back to looking for a job again."
bad,was not satisfies with this job. There wasnt enough work. All assignments were very short and unskilled positions for low wage
bad,"Trabalho sem reconhecimento profissional , não visa oportunidade de carreira."
bad,"If you are in full time employment and looking for extra cash manpower is for you, The team have no consideration what so ever for you as a person. Example if you need to no something your adviser is never around the minute they need something you have to be on all fours ready to pounce. I was promised full time work to come out of benefits and support my family with man power keeping me busy, They done so for 6-8 weeks now nothing. I have had to leave to find other work as I am now struggling to support my family. Thanks man power great service skills."
bad,i worked for manpower at a place called amerigas at the front desk. the lady i was suppose to help was not training me and made things very difficult. manpower didnt care
bad,"Travail 8 h 00 a 12 h 00 .13 H 00 a 17 h 00 ."
bad,Not very professional or organized.  Was not paid when expected. They pay you via money gram.  No communication what so ever from anyone.
bad,they will tell you how much you will get payed if you get hired into the company but you never get hired to any company you work for they just take advantage of you i worked with them for a year and half and all i got was nothing except benefits but when you get your benefits your pretty much fired because there not making money off you. so its your choice this goes for all temp services or staff agencies
bad,"Working for RBS on behalf of Manpower, I started in January, had great fun really enjoyed the place then after 2 or 3 months it went downhill. People got baught in with a higher pay, was always promised a payrise that never happened. You work your hardest to make yourself look good then one accident or somethong you miss and make a slight error you are out. Absolutely horrible and bang out of order."
bad,a typical day at conaagra is like u in the sun alld day no ac just straight heat blowing in your face till u take u a break
bad,"gross practices by management, lack of support no check and balances"
bad,very busy time goes by and fun place to work very nice supervisors
bad,I really did not like this job because they did not allow you for any advancement to grow. Management always made promises they could not keep and the type of people they hired really showed how expendable the rest of the employees are. Manpower did not appreciate their employees.
bad,"Bad business model"
bad,12 hr shift for the boss to treat you like dirt and you don't make more then 8 50 a hr and the company don't even treat you as if you are part of a team
bad,Got hurt on the job and while on workman's comp they got rid of me. Now when I call to see if they have work they always say they have nothing but its jobs all over indeed. Not a good company to work for
bad,"Not able to apply in the office, only offered me 1 job and when I told them I couldn't do that shift never called me for anything else.  Worked for other staffing firms in town and would go back to them before I'd come back here."
bad,"Its only a temporary job services, I would only use this service if i really need a job for the time being."
bad,They are very rude and disrespectful to their employees. There is little to no room for advancement and they mess over great workers.
bad,the temp. job I had was great experience but the lady I worked for was pushy and thought I was her gofer.
bad,"unrealistic, unorganized, lack of communication, lack of proper management, too much office drama, too much socialization among management and no proper training."
bad,WHAT A HORRIBLE TEMP AGENCY.  THE WORLD ONE I'VE EVER SIGN UP FOR.  THE HACKENSACK OFFICE IS JOKE. NO JOBS..CONDESENDING like they're doing you a favor. .no thanks what a waste of time
bad,"This job was a blessing, hours were great, and coworkers helped make it enjoyable!"
bad,"seriously, its a temp agency. there was a new job assignment every day."
bad,Only part time temp jobs. no job security. no benefits. Very little jobs available.
bad,"I applied for an ""IT Helpdesk Support"" position and they put me in a non IT environment where it's not IT at all."
bad,"El ambiente en motorola era bueno solo que los empleados contratados por manpower para motorola era distinto menos salario, bonos, y asi tuvieras un año no habia vacaciones porque  no tenias antiguedad solo contratos 28 dias no era bueno"
bad,Everyone was so nice and helpful. It was a great atmosphere to work in and I enjoyed going to work everyday.
bad,"None of their jobs are temp to hire, and they didn't have many jobs that were available. The mangers didn't know what they were doing, I would never go back to them."
bad,One of my first jobs through a temp service. I was a machine operator and a packer I was figuring out what I wanted to do in life.
bad,This company will mislead and may be discriminating against people. Or is this company so poorly run it may find it self being investigated.
bad,"Bons conhecimentos de faturação, processamento salarial"
bad,"I assembled parts for cars, the job was tedious and time consuming, you work like a slave and they offer little time for breaks, even to the bathroom, the management was terrible and not all on the same track one would tell you one way and then another would be like no do it this way."
bad,"Horrendous management, their ""Oil&Gas"" division is a complete JOKE. Starting from the CEO to mid level management this place is so disorganized and will never be taken seriously due to the incompetent management team that does not know how to lead a group."
bad,"I worked for this company back in 2003. temporary work."
bad,Contractor for this company and worked for them and did not care about their staff. Horrible experience
bad,a typical day with man power is alright if you can stand the inconsistent hours or really short temporary jobs. management cuts their ties with you if there is any possibility of conflict whether vocal or physical. the co workers are probably the best part they were social and willing to help
bad,"Interviewing Breast cancer family members.  Early Breast Cancer prevention. Management was poor, co-workers were upset all the time.  The hardest part of the job was just being there.  There was nothing that I really liked about this job,"
bad,A great temp agency if your looking for temp work. I enjoyed my time with manpower.
bad,"Manpower was a great asset as they had kept me busy and constantly employed, for aproximately 1.5 yrs in the oil/gas industry."
bad,The work is unpredicatable as you can be assigned to any type of work at anytime.  Mangament is willing to work with all associates. Be careful while working because your co-workers may not be paying attention to detail.  The hardest part of the job is the unpredictable nature of your scheduling and the 12 hour shifts. The best part of the job was the Free Tea but you can only drink the tea at the job.
bad,Unsatisfactory !!! never at the same place always different job I like becoming accustomed to one location !!!
bad,Worked temp for 2 years after moving back home to look after my Mother.  Was awarded the Tiffany Award as Temp Worker of the year.
bad,You never know when your going to work or where you are going to work. And you never know how long you will be there for. Half the time you sat there and wait to be called for work. you had to check in every monday to see if you had any work for that week or that day. If not you let them know that you are ready to work .
bad,"Por ser uma empresa de terceirização de serviços, não tinha garantia de estabilidade. Poucos benefícios e difícil contato com os superiores. Já o serviço era interessante, por conhecer novos clientes e prospecta-los."
bad,To be a dedicated employee and do my job at the best of my ability.
bad,"Depuis 3 moins d inscription  chez  eux pas de mission !!  "
bad,"Work was hit or miss, even tho your promised to always have a job."
bad,Never jump to conclusions with people.  They are allowed to change their mind.  Mis communications are the detriment to friendships.
bad,"Deptos., Fidelizacion / cobros / reclamaciones / at., Cliente"
bad,"Typical customer service for Walmart.com.  I enjoyed it to some degree, but there are just some people you will never be able to please.  In addition, all I heard was complaints and was never told the ratio of satified to unsatisfied customers, which would have gone along way towards feeling like I accomplished something."
bad,"uma empresa terceirizada que te manda pra um depósito que eles não sabem onde é, e você só sabe o q esperar quando chega ao local."
bad,I didn't really enjoy working here because it was communicating over the phone and telling customers to pay their bills or their BT line would get cut off
bad,"I learn about working on office equipment, the job was not really productive"
bad,they suck they suck!!!!! you in a job and never return a phone call or an email.
bad,It seemed as if they had a hard time finding work for me. I didn't like working under them.
bad,A good place to develop your customer service skills. Not much room for growth or promotion.
bad,No real job possibilities. just rotated from job to job through the system.
bad,its a temp company that I would not work for again got me a job than after 5months of working there they let me go for no reason
bad,Send people to jobs where they get treated low. I will not want to work with them again
bad,I was a hard worker for 18 years at alloyd co in dekalb il and about every 6 months i would get a rais
bad,They are not fair. Do not listen to workers. 000000000000000
bad,"Manpower of Las Vegas, NV is a very bad temporary employment agency to work for.  I went to work one day to find out that tomorrow is my last day on a job (when I still have another 3 months to complete my temporary assignment), because the company(MANPOWER'S CLIENT, UNILEVER) posted new work schedule for the next week's work days for their regular employees thus an indication that all temporary employees are laid off."
bad,The people who work here are great.  They are very friendly and helpful.  Everyone works as a team.
bad,"Drive threw the community and pick-up donations, see management in the morning. See co-workers in the field."
bad,"Worked recently as a pre screen consultant, training is horrendous, and all the people you interview get paid more than yourself.  STAY CLEAR OF THIS ROLE. The management are also horrendous !"
bad,Nothing specail boring repetitive job managers are no good
bad,"I registered with Manpower Calgary in their office division.  The only thing they offered me was 4 hours standing outside at the zoo giving out leaflets for $12.00/hour.  "
bad,This was a very fulfilling position.  Our office downsized and eventually closed due to economic situation.
bad,Manpower is a great agency that help you find work with different company and also teaching you how to do the job before you get there.
bad,"Insane application process, criminal coworkers (one guy would brag about how he escaped from prison), and always left with a mountain of catch up work from the day shift."
bad,stressful and horrible environment to work in hostile working envioronment and management was awful
bad,"If you're a Native American; forget about seeking a job through this company.  The company recruiters admit their clients prefer young, white gofers who will work for as little as possible."
bad,this company was not reliable for constant work and poor attitudes towards others
bad,"this was never a guarantee of permanent positions, pay was never the greatest and sometimes when your services were no longer needed to were discarded, they did have lots of positions to fill at several different companies but never solid"
bad,"Manpower operates as it did in the 60's, poorly managed, lack of training, it is all about who your friends with- not about how well you do your job."
bad,I enjoy working at the Nalco site.  I have learned how to use different software that I had no experience with prior to this position. Management is fair and professional. My team members are hardworking and always willing to help each other. The most difficult part of the job is the commute and lack of benefits.
bad,I would never again work for manpower uk I would rather eat from a bin and if they had their own way all of their employees would have to. The royal mail client company did treat us well its a pity that manpower uk didnt.
bad,"I was promised the world off this company. The recruiter said he got NHS jobs in all the time and I would get lots of offers of work. The recruiter lost my reference off my last employer and for 4 weeks blamed my employer.  I was never offered any work even though I have NHS experience, never got even a courtesy call off them.  Really terrible company do not deal with them."
bad,"Rubbish. Got work with them. Worked for two days and didn't hear back for three weeks. I left voicemails and phone messages and still never heard back, plus £6.30ph wage when the company down the road had the same job at £7.50ph wage. Safe to say I would AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"
bad,"working a 8 hour day"
bad,would not recommend working for this company. never paid on time problem after problem!!!!
bad,N/A Not a good company to work for there is a high turn around of supervisors/managers
bad,"making boats, pulling them from molds, gluing parts together, operating pull crane"
bad,"Manpower called me in for an interview. I was told to do the initial orientation online before coming in for interview. Came in...It was only two ladies working in office...they couldn't even give me a full job description of what I was going to be doing!!!...once I started my day of work for the company I was assigned to....I knew I had made a mistake. Poor management, unprofessional, not clean, unsafe, oh and 7 days a week!!!!8 to 12 hrs...then after a week they let me go for no reason what so ever!"
bad,"Force you to work 12 hr shifts 7days a week. Then let you go without an excuse. Manpower in Spartanburg, SC is the worst company I ever worked for. They told me the company I worked for endedmy assignment than that night my supervisor called me asking where I was. He said he didn't end my assignment and was calling cause he thought I was trying to lay out that night. I called Manpower back and she said that was still fired an if I came in they wouldn't pay me. I'll never work for that sorry company again. I hope they lose all there clients."
bad,Worked in a confined space where it was very dusty. Co- workers in my area were very nice.
bad,"hard work,low pay,no benefit, alot of over timequicklay off"
bad,never had a long lasting job from them always wanting to put you in short term jobs cared more about their bussiness than the employees they sent out for work.
bad,"Typical duties varied depending on assignment. Manpower care little or nothing for their contracted workers. I enjoyed no part of working under them, save that it temporarily provided me a paycheck."
bad,"Assembly, loved my co-workers for there very friendly. having to leave at the end of the shift due to co-workers was the hard part of the job."
bad,a day at work we strecth before starting.
bad,Would never refer anyone to this agency. Information regarding my temporary position was not accurate.
bad,"I worked for manpower assigned to a local cheese production plant. I worked here for over a year. i was told it was full time when i recieved the job and only reached 40 hours 3 times in that year. I was released from the assignment because i injured my neck off the job and had a 3 month work restriction. i was still able to work but unable to work on the assembly line which was not my job description to begin with. i was told employees get hired onto the assigned company after 6 months. not one person was hired on while i worked there and some employees where there for over 3 years without even the notion of being hired on. Often times they would lie about rules and change policys to the immediate circumstances. on numerous occations i had to retrieve a rule book and point out the error in there way, and this often ended with myself recieving a warning for insubordination."
bad,"Manpower have lots of ads for hgv drivers , guaranteed 45 hour week, full time contract! However they dont mention that if you work a 55hour week they dont pay you for it!!!! I am owed over 40 hours overtime from this company ! They are miss selling the job and being paid by the companys for your overtime but are stalealing this off ppl and promoting this full time 45 hrs a week contract !!! However if you work 43 hours they will dock your pay ! I advise all hgv class 1,2 adr , hiaab drivers to tread carefully for what the agents tell u when promoting this job as its advertised and sold to ppl as a pack of lies!!!!"
bad,Horaire d'agence inacceptable & personnels non pertinentes
bad,"Typical day at work, was always boring"
bad,Was never any fun working there and many times were lied to about projects
bad,I do not have anything to say about this company. I would not want to work for this company again.
bad,"Where to start? I was registered at the Traverse City location, I was assigned to a company making hunting gear. When I told the supervisor at this company that I didn't think I was the best fit for the position they told me to exit the property. When I called Manpower and told them what happened Manpower said that I would be reassigned. # months have gone by without a single email or phone call from Manpower. Since temp agencies have evolved in the early 90's, the ability to directly apply to has become virtually impossible. Temp agencies are a form of employment PIMP'S. They charge the client 1.5 times(or more) what the pay the employee."
bad,Pays employees by receiving and verifying expense reports and requests for advances; preparing checks
bad,"The manpower managers were rude and disrespectful most of the time, the other times they weren't ever there. Found ways not to pay us but would work us over the shift times. Overall would just not work for them again"
bad,"I had been applying everywhere with no avail and then Manpower called me. I want to mention that I have my AA and have had a steady career as an admin asst in the Hort industry. The job I got called for was for a Vitamin Company in Scotts Valley. The hours are awful, the pay is awful and the supervisor, as well as permanent staff, treat you like garbage. It was hard to swallow my pride and make $8 a day simply twisting on caps. When I explained to Manpower that while I respected they found me a job for some temporary income, this was not my forte. They SAID they would look for something else, but I later overheard, that this particular company was their ONLY client. So, all hope was lost and I have left Manpower. Their staff is also very unfriendly."
bad,"Not the job I expected nor got hired for, horrible pay with no raise vacation days or time off, no advancement, and can never get a hold of the representative."
bad,"The jobs are sketchy, they don't match you to jobs by skill but by whats needed. Today you may be washing dishes, tomorrow working in a warehouse and the next day flagging traffic. Work and repeat tickets are not guaranteed you may work all week, only once or twice or not at all. pay is always very low even for skilled positions"
bad,"Working for man power at a local defense company was a waste of my time. The man power in Johnstown, Pa is staffed by one person and this lady doesnt know her you know what from a hole in the ground. $8/hr to drive 1hr and work for 10hrs. The man power lady was not helpful at all. I would not reccommend working for man power"
bad,"The staff is incompetent, They make several mistakes regarding banking and private information. They make a terrible job of communicating with others. Lastly they are very unreliable."
bad,Long days you learned how to work fast. Coworkers all had to get along with each other. Paydays were the best days
bad,dependeing on the assignment i would do a variety of work. hardest part of the job was wondering if i was going to be made permenent
bad,"Not enough work, and low wages. I definitely did not get called enough. Got injured at Guardian Fiberglass doing cold end operating, I was treated like I was faking my injury even though I had a note from a VA doctor saying I had very bad tendonitis in both wrist. I did do some furniture moving too."
bad,Zero réponse. Personne n'y est responsable. on se demande si il y a vraiement des postes a pourvoir ou seulement des effets d'annonce pour occuper l'espace
bad,goor pay in summer low pay in winter poor management good co workers
bad,The Manpower branch failed to communicate their drug screen policy in relation to a job I had already accepted. The client was told I had failed when in fact this was not the case and it cost me my job.
bad,you have to work 12 hour shifts. Do the same thing over and over again. on Break you have to listen to people talk about their sex life and partying. I am not into the party scene do felt alone all the time.
bad,did everything i was asked and was still removed from their assignment. Story that was given was fabricated then was told it was none of my business !
bad,The most unorganized job I have ever worked at.Terrible coworkers and rude staff.
bad,I have not started with manpower yet. I have an inter view tomorrow at 675 Sycmore Dr milpitas ca 95035. At 9:30am With mike or jasmine.
bad,"i worked all over the valley while i worked here. u never knew were u would be working from one day to the next, or if u would work. it wasd hard to work full time because the work was only temp. work. Often I did hard labored jobs that other employees didn't want to do for 1/2 the pay."
bad,"je suis une candidate intérimaire très déçue de Manpower : vous téléphonez pour une offre , et bien on oublié de vous rappeller ... Par contre quand ils ont besoin de vous c'est du harcélement quasiment , au point de vous laisser vous débrouiller avec l'employeur au téléphone sans vous prévenir !! Surtout quand ils savent que vous n'êtes pas dispo en plus ! J'ai supprimé mon compte : je dénonce l'agence d'aix notamment ... À fuir ."
bad,le pondria del 1 al 10 un 5 no tiene ningun tipo de prestaciones lo unico bueno es el conocimiento que adquiri ahi y los compañeros que conoci fue lo mejor del empleo
bad,"If you like being sold a load of bull during recruiting, and then having everything you are promised changed to be less advantageous to you, then this is the job for you!"
bad,"A typical day at work was always something. We talked to people all over the world, and there would always be something interesting good or bad. I had great co-workers we well worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the sitting down for long hours, some conference calls were 4 hours long, that means you can't always go to the bathroom when needed. What I enjoyed most about my job is the relationships I build whether it be personal or professional."
bad,"Overall the company is a complete joke. Incompetent managers are left to run an organization that sets unrealistic goals in order to make themselves more money. COMPLETELY profit driven with little to no guidance or support. Ask any former employee of Manpower and see what their experience was like, I can bet it will all be the same."
bad,"I couldn't get the hours I wanted, nor the type of work I wanted."
bad,They don't care about their employees. They only care about not getting in trouble. They refuse to give out the 1-800 number to their employees and then when you go turn someone in for doing something wrong you get fired.
bad,All the recruiters are great if you go into the office but trying to do anything over the phone is impossible. They will all tell you one thing but what they say usually never happens
bad,Very low compensation.
bad,"I was brought up to believe ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all""."
bad,is a horrible place to work at don't come here this place will put you in the worst locations not even that but they also got fired from there own customers
bad,They never have jobs for you and you can never get in touch they no one in the office when you need to.
bad,"Go to work and try to do your best but with the plant manager that they had, it was never good enough."
bad,Earned a little more than unemployment. Not a long term employer.
bad,"Went into Manpower for an interview in April 2012 for a data entry position. Passed tests with flying colors, only to be told a week later that ""the client never called back"" for this particular job. About a month after that, was called by one of their agents for a ""great job"" paying $13/hr. The client never called back for this one either. About a week later, I received yet another call from this same agent, asking if I would be interested in a position doing data entry at a bank, where I would get off work at 2:30 in the morning and be paid a mere $10./hr. Riding a subway at that time of night is suicidal...however, the client did call back for this ridiculous job! Manpower is terrible!!!!!"
bad,"If in Albuquerque, stay away from the Professional branch. Pay mishaps, having to pay for own items, hotels, fuel with a reimbursement period that lasted longer than employment!"
bad,Don't go here unless you're scraping the bottom of the barrel. This temp agency does not give you any information about the type of jobs they are sending you on. What they do tell you is either partially or entirely wrong.
bad,"Never again, no matter how desperate I am for a job. I got a position at the local phone company through Manpower because I was unemployed and desperate for a job. It was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. I started with a group of 14 people, and I know that half or more of us called Manpower to complain about the working conditions and the way we were treated like indentured servants. Manpower pretty much said there was nothing they could do because they signed a contract and we could quit but they wouldn't give us anything else. I tell everyone I know to avoid this place."
bad,They take your money and save companies from having to pay you benefits. They will re-assign you before you get the chance to be hired in by a company.
bad,bom
bad,never get a job at the end of work keeps you going for 3 year and still no full time work
bad,"This Job was factory work and only seasonal, I did not like it."
bad,"This company as a whole is very unstable. No one seems to have information when you need it...then when you finish an assignment you may or may not receive unemployment...depending on if they can find you another job.another job which may or may not be on your pay grade, but if you say no, they are able to cut your benefits...its a no win situation..."
bad,"I was hoping to have a steady work enviroment. Instead, there isn't anything they have for me. I would work a assignment for like two week and I would be done. i need steady work. And it is frond upon if u were to be ill and had a doctor excused. I just had a bad expericence with the company overall together."
bad,"worked temporarily there. It was a way in to get hired as a full time IBM employee. The agency was nice and friendly, but not a long term career."
bad,Did not like to work for Manpower. Called me at 4:00 in the afternoon to be at work at Zipac at 7:00 pm to work 12 hours then I was up for 25 to 26 hours. Work 2 days and nothing for 2 weeks. Overall a bad experience.
bad,manpower dont sick up for there works when they get lot go for nothing. the manpower manger didnot care to help. i will not use manpower again.
bad,One of the worst temp agencies in pickering. Finds jobs in durham region but dont pass info on do to not current status.
bad,At the beginning U think they r really their to assist. If you are someone a staff knows personally or kin to you have a good chance getting hired with a co with a future if u have no connections within be prepared for dead temp with no future.
bad,Worked at Cei thru manpower as a forklift operator about 6years and was certified to drive a stand up forklift as well as a sit down lift to pull items needed to go to manufacturing as well as return items to the warehouse to be re stocked
bad,"They are sluggish and favortise plentful. It is unfair to most people especially me. I am use to working and staying busy. I been working since 14 years old, I do not plan to stop now. I am extemely incensed with manpower."
bad,"They lie about almost every aspect of your assignment. Do not apply with Manpower. You have been warned. They are so worried about the client, but could less about the employee. NOT LGBTQ friendly."
bad,Lazy unprofessional people in charge who lie and take no accountability for what they do. They allow drug addicts and alcoholics and convicts in the workplace. Security is bad and allows people back even though they are not allowed back. You have to work 6 days a week.
bad,They honestly don’t really care about the employees they fired me at my 90 day mark and didn’t give me any reason as to why or another job at the time so I was unemployed
bad,"Manpower is a temporary service job and that's just what you get from them temporary services. Honestly, they could use some job etiquette themselves in the fact that they know nothing about the advancement opportunity. However, when hiring employees just for future reference don't just screen people background and drug abuse try some mental health screening for you better prepared"
bad,"Office personal was very rude, refused to give me proof of employment, after working for over a week. Even tho it would cause me major problems & then she called me rude! When I 1st started they said with my resume I would be a very good assets to any company, & was offered 2 jobs 2 choose from but when the job I chose ended, they would not set up something with the other job that already offered me a position to begin with."
bad,"Man bekommt da kündigung von heute auf morgen, die Schiken nur email dass du  von übermorgen abgemeldet bist! Und die klauen immer par Stunden von Gehalt, mann muss wirklich  aufpassen"
bad,"When I started at Manpower I was looking for a great job, great pay and something to really motivate me after University. "
bad,They supervisors were kinda cool and sometime tried to help but sometimes they have the most robotic answers in the book. No advancement here due to favoritism. You were sent home on slow days for VTO. No option to get out of that. Pay was terrible.
bad,"Pay rate good after  the 12 week period. Uncertainty will be your best friend while working with Man Power. Two days a week and they keep taking new drivers as they are paying them less on the start. Can't organize your life with them as o e day you work from 6 am,the other day from 4pm.Just avoid"
bad,sans avis déçu du comportement de cette  boite ...
bad,"A company who's put in place to provide a great service to clients and give opportunities to the unemployed and a new opportunity to those who need the next step, should be the best place to work as you are creating joy and connections on all levels."
bad,"Do not work for this company.  It's just a paycheck to them.  They do NOT care about their contractors/employees.  They offer no benefits, not a place for a career."
bad,Managers and supervisors don’t know what they’re doing. You’re mostly standing still for 10 hours because you’re waiting for product to come. No one is trained properly and everyone just half as**s everything. They show a lot of favoritism as well...
bad,"Only sent me on a few assignments.The job itself wasn't that bad,however once your assignment is over,they don't try to keep you working.It may be weeks or months before they contact you."
bad,It's a joke they are readvertising and there is not enough work to go around IV been on standby all week there is no loyalty you are just a number trust me don't do it
bad,"no places other than factories. was a struggle because of anxiety, they are poorly managed. only good to gain experience . hated my experience with them"
bad,I was a packer at General mills. The staff there were great. But the hours were few. I had truble getting direct deposit done on time. My last week I  worked for them i still have not got paid as of yet. The main office lied to me about watlow . I believe you reap what you sow and they will have to give an account for how they treat people. Save your self the headache and find a different temp agency to work for ☹ very disapointing.
bad,"Wish the manager was more helpful.  Lots of self training and very little on hand training.  The company has great mission statement, but the branch is not following it."
bad,"Make sure you read all the paperwork very carefully, they will fire you over a grammar issue that isn't your fault. They also take a percentage of your paycheck, which is understandable since they need need their money too, but it would definitely be better to go straight to they company and get hired on straight away than through a temp service."
bad,"Managers were free to do whatever they wanted including creating fake employees files, list hours worked and receive checks for face employees which they cashed for their own profit.  Another manager was ordering office supplies and selling them to his church friends for his profit.  The Area manager was useless and was finally fired.  Another branch manager was using Meth and would consistently show up to client visits looking like he just crawled out of a gutter."
bad,"Four years of bullying mind games & drama, can’t believe I lasted so long, just waiting for things to get better. Smelter good place to work Manpower are awful."
bad,"Temp employs were treated like dirt by management. No opportunity for advancement. Told me they would work around my school schedule, but constantly gave me grieve about it."
bad,"Dopo essermi registrato a questa agenzia interinale ho inviato molte candidature per i lavori che proponevano ma non mi ha mai chiamato nessuno,neanche per un colloquio conoscitivo."
bad,"the hours never enough, every time you have to call 2 hours ahead to find out if your scheduled to work. Salary too low could not survive on it. HR hard to reach."
bad,This company is not the greatest to work for and rules get changed without warning or proper procedure. There is not alot of room for growth and if there is no work you don't get paid.
bad,"Kurz vor Ablauf der Probezeit gekündigt von Manpower. Ich war jeden Tag pünktlich da, ohne kranken Tag, die Abteilungsleitern, war mit mir sehr zufrieden sowie Teamleiter und Chefs der Abfallwirtschaft Mannheim.. Manpower hat schon eine Rutine d.h. kurz vor Ablauf der Probezeit man wird gekündigt und einen neuen Miterbeiter wird angestellt, weil Manpower dafür eine schöne Provision kriegt. In dieser Fall auch wenn der Projekt bis Ende ist von Manpower geben sich keine Mühe um dir einer neuer Arbeitsplatz zu finden und die schicken bei der Post sofort kündingungsfrist."
bad,Agency don't have a clue what they are doing.  Full of fake promises and sack anyone at any opportunity then walk you out the building like you've committed a crime when in fact you've only had a couple days of ill.  Terrible human beings that run there Dundee office anyway!!
bad,"I would work until hiring consideration with excellent work habits, attendance, good reviews from company management and at times I would be relocated to new job assignment. And low pay scales made it hard to want to work for manpower. Which applies to each and every temporary service company. They pocket money without ever helping the workers, or if they do help its impossible to meet the requirements. In all the assignments were good, the employer use not satisfactory."
bad,Não costuma colocar os funcionários em bons pontos para trabalhar
bad,"Manpower is an awful temp agency in the Muskegon,MI branch. Took nearly a month to get my first paycheck because the office supervisor was far too lazy to do payroll until the corporate office had to get involved."
bad,Never get paid on time and have to wait weeks to get paid after getting told I would of been paid for it then to be an other excuse absolute joke of a company
bad,"En typiskt arbetsdag:"
bad,"Was not happy with the management in the way she handled things.  Had no benefits, no job security. Management had one side of a story and it was not the employee."
bad,They had sent me on different assignment it was ok I just go in and do my work each and other day. I learned a lot doing different things at each jobs. The hardest part of my job is just trying to get on perameant.
bad,"This company gave me an amazing opportunity to grow my skills and gain experience in a professional environment. I feel that I now have a decent variety of office, administrative, and recruiting skills to be successful in any professional environment."
bad,I worked there for 6 months and at the beginning it was great but I wasn't getting paid what I am used to and no training was given to learn about 'their' processes. I was always walked all over and it wasn't good for my health in the end

bad,This is a temp agency really nothing to discuss. I currently work at BCBSNC. Hardest part of the job is learning all systems
bad,"Am Anfang nett für einen da danach nicht mehr!!!!"
bad,"Busy and productive workplace, every day would be a challenge to try and give the correct advice, right first time, whilst making sure to keep wrap and not ready times to a minimum."
bad,"Bossez tant que vous voulez, donnez tout et le jour ou ils sont en difficultés, ils vous jettent"
bad,"Their Charlottesville location has only one client they cater to, State Farm.  That said, whatever State Farm wants, does, says is what they go by there.  They do not act as a buffer between the contract employees they place nor do they truly evaluate the skill sets of those who they chose to work.  Most are over qualified for the positions there, as I was.  "
bad,"p&g people felt they were better than manpower and very seldom helped on the line when things went wrong, I still did my job for four plus years without complaint"
bad,"This job taught me how cruel people can be. Although the staff were friendly I, among others, developed strong emotional issues working here"
bad,"could not get in contact with anyone during or after the assignment."
bad,Manpower personnel was extremely unprofessional. I endured major pay issues and lack of communication. Try other agencies before this one.
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever worked for.  The VP/GM was paranoid in my personal opinion and had email tracked, calls intercepted and even though she was terminated, this was a terrible culture. "
bad,"Um trabalho como outro,nada do que já soubesse sobre o serviço a direção sem comunicação com os funcionários,colegas ótimos para trabalhar."
bad,"Work was 8.5 hrs daily but 40 hour weeks were not guaranteed  however, they are not willing to work with your schedule unless you have paperwork. The training was not from Manpower but from the company itself and Manpower is not aware of how they train their temps. Management was the biggest issue. Supervisors were trying to sleep with the female agents and ignore all the male agents when asking for help on the floor. Supervisors were on Netflix and on their personal phones while on business hours and have a bad attitude when you ask for help. They do not pay you on time and they always have problems paying you the correct amount unless you address the fact that they made a mistake on your paychecks. They randomly change your payment method such as I was on direct deposit for 4 months and out of the blue without any of my authorization they switched me to paper check. The hardest part of the job was finding someone to help you when you had an problem with customers and all of the supervisors were no where to be found they would still count that against your score performance. They also schedule you sometimes two weeks in a row including Saturday and Sundays with no breaks and they still mess up on your paycheck. The most enjoyable part of the job was none. When asked for Human Resources (from Manpower) to address these issues they took all of the information and did NOTHING and things got worse. They are a corrupt company and they work you to the point where you dont feel like its a job but your stuck with no room for moving up or getting hired in because they want to keep the"
bad,"The company I was placed to work at was wonderful, most  of my coworkers were great.  My recruiter was horrible.  Would call her and she would never return my call.  I tried contacting the complaint line several times regarding an issue with something important that was going on where I was working, and about my recruiter and never received a callback.  They also are the lowest paying Temporary agency in my area.  I will have to hire an attorney to resolve my issues."
bad,Was sent on jobs that were not appropriate for my skills. I was sent to factories and industrial settings when my background was clearly in an office setting. Was sent to work with the worst employers in the area with terrible labour relations backgrounds. The last employer I had with Manpower did it for me. I received very little training and was unsupported. I obtained employment elsewhere. This employment agency is not suited to white collar workers!!
bad,"Manpower encourages a high stress environment where good workers are loaded up with more and more duties and responsibilities. You are not allowed to refuse to take on any duty. If you say you are overwhelmed, management informs you that it is your duty and you will do it. No appreciation for employee contributions. No tracking of what duties had been assigned to which employee so whenever something new came up they would add it onto an already overworked employee. Benefits were taken away over the years until only the holidays were left."
bad,"I worked as part of an assembly line, inside of a refinery, that made cans for major beer companies. My duties included placing cans on pallets and inspecting cans for damage or improper information, before being distributed. The job was pretty laid back as long as the machine was running properly and the cans did not fall as they were being placed on the pallets. If something went wrong, I was responsible for correcting the issue as quick as possible in order to prevent the line from stopping. Sometimes that was unavoidable. I was usually secluded but every once in a while i moved around and got the opportunity to meet some nice people."
bad,Worked in the kitchen 8 hours a day and 1 to 2 hours doing bookkeeping with no true compensation.
bad,"Although i loved the team i directly worked with, working fir this company is soul destroying. They have complete disregard for their employees, all they care about is your sales stats! Heaven forbid you needed to go home early because of a family emergency, as all they would is when you could pay your hours back. Plus the management are just lazy, you can never find any of them as their always on 'breaks'. And if you did find one, they tell you to sort it out yourself! As you know mire than they do at this point!!"
bad,"A politica da empresa é lucro acima de tudo, não importando o que é necessário. É exigido do funcionário resolução de problemas sem condições ou ferramentas apropriadas para tal."
bad,"You earn little pay, almost no advancement, hours are horrible."
bad,A company that shows no real care for the people that work for them
bad,No work security and very poor office work culture. Very low staff moral
bad,Feels like they don't want you to build rapport with your customers. Plus all the strict limitations really make it hard to do the job. Extremely stressful.
bad,"Manpower contacted me on a Friday and asked me to go to company on Monday to do some administrative work. I guess they were in a pinch. A guy came by on the following Friday and got my deposit information. I worked for the company off and on for about a year in different positions. The local director from Columbia contacted me and told me they were having trouble locating my pre-employment information. The only thing they ever got was my resume. I took the time to go and do the drug test and all the other little things they want you to do. The guy from Columbia was not very nice, but it was not my fault they did not do their job before I started working for them."
bad,"You had to live the job, 60+ hours per week, use your own vehicle, and have no backup as management was in Hawaii."
bad,Not worth working for a company that does not have your back. Will let you go for no reason and not even fight to keep you. States they will help you find another position and does not
bad,I worked through them for Evicore healthcare and they kept threatening to fire me for health issues that they knew I had before hiring me on for Evicore. Evicore is a pretty decent company that respects it's employees.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this company, only if you are desperate and are satisfied with anything.  The staff is unprofessional, and expect you to commute 15-20miles to work  for $10 an hour."
bad,"They don’t care about the employees. they let me and 2 other ppl go after the 90 day mark with no specific reasons. When hired they said after 90 days depending on performance we would get a $2 raise, but instead they let us go and kept 1 person who had just gotten a write up the day before. Now I am unemployed, I got let go a few days before Christmas. They still have not given me last paycheck and it will be 2 weeks on Thursday since they let me go."
bad,"Lavorare come steward è deleterio.

Il tutto condito con differenziazione di trattamento per amici/conoscenti/parenti, al riparo all'interno dello stadio."
bad,"The company treats you like a number. Automatically pays men (who have less experience, education and are younger) more then women for the same work. If you are a man, even lazy, this is the right company for you."
bad,"When I started they were a great company, however as the time went by the management went downhill, to the point that I had no interaction with management and no performance feedback. Then it went to micromanaging. Very poor experience the last 2 years."
bad,Worked for them at Gestamp...Was a terrible situation...The girls in the department set it up to make it look like I did something wrong with parts when all 3 of them had been hands on with the parts I was dealing with...When I was dismissed from Gestamp the girl that was the worst had thrown a fit on everyone including her husband because our supervisor had to go and fix part at another facility that the girls had messed up before I got there...And Manpower won't give u a job if u can only work 1 shift...They want you to work all shifts and in life that is not always possible....
bad,If you have kids this isn’t a temp service you want to work for your kid could be dying and they will call and end your assignment the managers are nasty and very mouthy
bad,"With HQ in capital cities across Australia for those working remotely there is a sense of isolation and being left to fend for oneself. Promises from management were never fulfilled and communication suffered."
bad,Too many people being hired that should not be working at manpower. Leads should be picked more seriously. A lot of favoritism goes on . People that don’t miss work are not recognized. Nobody ever gets a raise unless you become a lead or supervisor. A few good people are leaving because of no advancements.
bad,My position was elimated and it was a blessing.  I was already in the process of accepting another offer.  I received a severance package and I enjoyed them paying me for 3 months while I worked another job with better benefits and pay.  Perfect timing for me.  The territory manage had no personnel skills.  I was told my position was being elimated over the phone and sent severance package by email!  Completely unprofessional.  The regional manager had no leadership skills and gave no directions other than you weren't doing it her way.  They portray themselves as being good to their associates but when it comes down to it they couldn't careless.  Its all about numbers and not the people they employ .
bad,Nswra role for this company breaks so many laws and you are risking your street works card AVOID AT ALL COSTS
bad,"Would send me on jobs that we’re double booked out, go to units and didn’t have the right training or experience and was left just sat there for one shift unable to do anything but wouldn’t send me home as kept the numbers up. Very isolating job not somewhere you get much briefing or contracted team members talk to you your the typical “agency” and expected to no nothing."

bad,"Ich habe mich bei dieser Firma vor einiger Zeit beworben. Es ging um eine Arbeit in Wolfsberg.Das Vorstellungsgespräch ist mir vorgekommen wie ein Verhör. Es ging nicht um den Menschen bzw. was er kann, mir ist es eher so vorgekommen, als wollte man unbedingt Fehler finden( sprich Lebenslauf usw.) Danach wurde mir mehr oder weniger versprochen, daß. es mit dem Job für den ich mich beworben habe , gut aussehe.Ich bekam Anrufe und wurde immer wieder hingehalten. Sehr großes Mißtrauen von dieser Firma, keine klaren Verhältnisse bzw. ist mir es lieber, wenn Leute mir ins Gesicht sagen, was Sie von mir halten. Manche haben die Courage, manche nicht. Aber egal,das ist natürlich nur meine persönliche Meinung."
bad,"Management at both Bentonville AR & Springdale, AR (Springdale being the worst) have thrown me under the bus, twice, lied to client to save the contract.  No integrity, non."
bad,I wouldn't recommend Manpower because when I was going to work for them the manager yelled at me to quit my previous job and work for them. I only took the job because I needed a full time job.
bad,"From every step of the hiring process, temp interview, client interview, meeting with team leader, and meeting with the vice-team leader (the other guy), each person was very critical and mostly negative. I didn't even know who my supervisor was for over 2 weeks or how they felt about my job performance. There were warnings along the way, but I tried to keep a positive attitude. The client in Trenton, MO tends to not hire females, like myself. When they tell you your assignment ended, they have no other local assignment to offer."
bad,"Jacksonville insulation feeding line make sure you go in the machine to be cut right, UGA restoring book going through the book and removing the damage book"
bad,Worked for weeks with no paycheck due to their time keeping misstakes. Staff has attitude towards me can't keep me employed no advancement. I was injured a couple times so I was not rehired
bad,"As an employee of Manpower, after being hired I never once heard from anyone there concerning work or how it was going, and ran into major problems from both them and Cafe Valley due to lack of communication and pure negligence on their part. Was treated very unprofessionally and just was not a good experience."
bad,"They don't care about their people. Only care about how much they make to keep their stock price high at any cost. Very unethical, will do anything to make money. Push their managers for YOY sales at any cost. Understaffed in most offices."
bad,"Ser un trabajador para manpower puede ser un tanto complicado porque rara vez están al tanto de sus empleados, es decir, no nos daban seguimiento."
bad,Manpower is fine as long as you don’t need money to survive or want a secure job. The people who work there are amazing but the management/lack of management is horrible.
bad,Management went above and beyond to cover Manpower including but not limited to lying during a hearing.  No regard to me as an employee.  Shameful and unreal!
bad,In assoluto. Le offerte ci sono ma nessuno ti chiama. E se per caso trovi qualche Offerta su subito.it devi arrangiarti totalmente da solo per la burocrazia. Malissimo. Una stella è già troppo
bad,"They lure you in with the promise of a quick rollover and high wage but it rarely happens.  I've worked for them for 2 years and no hope for hire through 2 different workplaces.  The benefits are a joke and you most likely won't work enough hours to even qualify for holiday pay.  There is no vacation time and my last yearly bonus was a bag of popcorn,  a candy bar,  and 2 movie passes.  Once you start your assignment you will likely never hear from manpower again unless your assignment ends.  They are very unprofessional and unhelpful.  For my current assignment,  I was not notified about the interview until 10 pm the night before and the host was not even notified that I was coming in for said interview.  I had to initiate all of the conversations in order to find out that I had been hired,  my start date,  etc.  They told me the wrong hours and the wrong pay information as well.  Don't expect any raises or performance reviews. Also, they will sometimes forget to tell you if your assignment ends. In summary,  find a better job elsewhere and avoid temp agencies like the plague!"
bad,"It has been not only my experience but many people I have spoken with that are unsatisfied with this company because they lead you to believe that after working on a temporary contract through them to large companies that you will earn a full time position, this is FAR from the TRUTH. This company does not offer benefits such as vacation, sick time , etc...even after YEARS or employment. By far my work career choice"
bad,"Manpower ne donne pas l'impression d'une entreprise sérieuse."
bad,"Propaganda corporativa y poca profesionalidad. Poca estabilidad laboral, labores secundarias subcontratadas con pocas o escasas posibilidades de permanencia laboral."
bad,Will never work though them again. There not fair and do not give you a reason for letting you go. They expect you to run one deparment by your self ...
bad,veel beloven aan hun personeel maar als het zo ver is staan ze niet achter je. Toffe collega's!
bad,"E uma empresa tercerizado , mas o porém e que essa empresa fica distante dos funcionário e não temos qualquer informações pessoais , tudo se resolvia por telefonemas , era muito desagradável."
bad,Manpower is a temp agency so I worked several short term jobs through here. Nothing is stable. However if your needing a job fast. Manpower is the place to go.
bad,Det här företaget är inte seriöst. jag arbetade för manpower mellan 2013-2015. ser att många sparkas dagligen. stressigt. cheferna har inte koll på vilka uppdrag de skickar anställda på. feedback existerar inte. gör man fel får man inte en andra chans eller bli tillsagt att göra bättre nästa gång . utvecklas eller bli bättre på sitt arbete är ingen prencip här. det är en ond cirkel som aldrig tar slut. då många sparkas och ersätts hela tiden  jobba inte för manpower! eller något annat bemaningsföretag. dessa respekterar inte dina rättigheter eller hur du mår på din arbetsplats! vi är människor . säg nej till detta företag om du vill slippa att må dåligt hela tiden.
bad,"J'ai travailler 4 ans de suite pour cette boite d'interim, le lendemain que j' ai terminer ma mission il ne me répondait plus à mes mails et impossible d'avoir quelqu'un au téléphone."
bad,"As a Recruiter there is absolutely no job security. Even more so as a Virtual Recruiter. Also there is a month or more wait in between contracts with them once a contract ends. Benefits are horrible as a Virtual Recruiter. You are usually required to work more than the 40 hour work week and all phone calls made on your personal work phone are monitored and recorded. High micro-managing, high work load and very metrics driven. Work/life balance is horrible even as a Virtual Recruiter and there are multiple recruiters working the same roles at different pay ranges and recent college graduates supervising Senior Recruiters in Senior Management roles."
bad,Trabajar bajo gran presión no puede nunca sacar lo mejor de nosotros mismos...
bad,I loved working for this company but when your wages are messed that is not good the staff are ok the hours are good but it's a shame they mess up up on the wages but the staff are helpful and friendly
bad,"Ich war fast ein Jahr für Manpower in der Arbeitnehmerüberlassung tätig. In dieser Zeit wurde ich nicht ein einziges mal gefragt, wie es mir im Einsatz geht, geschweige denn (wie in der Banche eigentlich üblich) wurden meine Arbeitsplätze duch meine Betreuerin besucht. Emails meinerseits an die Niederlassung wurden erst zwei Wochen später beantwortet oder gar nicht !"
bad,"Zeitarbeit habe ich durch Manpower erstmals richtig kennen gelernt."

bad,"they only hire the people they want to work. never answer the phone"
bad,They had a first call and first serve jobs and most of the time I could not do them because i was juggling school. Plus juggling watch my kids.
bad,The company I worked for (Royal Mail) were very reliable and friendly.  Manpower on the other hand were very unhelpful and have a tendency to speak down to people that ask questions.
bad,"the work was easy, the management was rude the coworkers were nice, professional. the managers played favoritism. the hard part about the job was dealing with the management. working alone and working a straight eight were the best parts of the job"

bad,"I was given a position at Manpower, I was told it was a permanent job, but it turned out to be a temporary job. I was given a job as a driver for a company called Ryder, which in turn sent me out to AT&T. While at AT&T; I ordered and delivered supplies throughout Birmingham,Al. I was only two days away from finishing my probationary period, and i was let go."
bad,"The typical work day at Wal-mart dot com included, cleaning my desk, answering telephone calls, and returning from brakes, promptly, according to schedule. My co-workers were very nice and the work environment was healthy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to sit at my desk while working productively."
bad,"I interviewed with manpower for a position, and got it.  So this guy called me on a Friday and told me my interview was Monday at 9am and he would email me the address, I asked if he had my email address, and he read it back to me.  I never got the email. When they opened on Monday at 9am (my interview time) this guy says ""oh, it didn't go through, I'll reset another interview""  not a very professional start on his part.   For 2 weeks, Manpower could not get me a w-4 form, this guy was a idiot!  I called several times, emailed and left messages, I got a few calls with him giving me wrong information, but most went unanswered.  The rate of pay for this job was $14, but when I got my check (less over $100, because I never got a w-4 to fill out) the pay was $13!!!  I quit!  I'll never again work for this company because obviously they don't know what they are doing!"

bad,After  working for Manpower for about 6 years all together I've spent the last 3 1/2 years in the Manpower office as a Staffing Specialist and I am still a temp. For the last 2 1/2 years I have been told I'm going full time and it has yet to happen. My paid vaction time was taken away in June and I was told I will not be getting a raise this year. It has been a bad experience and I've learned how not to treat or manage people.
bad,"anything the had us doing, never stop looking for job poor management good people never knowing what they would have you doing leaving"
bad,I liked my job just not the employment agency I worked for. I enjoyed working 10 hour shift and over-time for the most part. Depending on which department I was in that day would depend on how my day wnt.
bad,"I don't know what to really say about this company because they couldn't speak English and I was in a assembly line. They kept saying I was never there but you have to have an ID card to clock in to the area where I worked, also was with holding my checks."
bad,"Management is only there for themselves within human resources department. They will place you anywhere just to get themselves an employee for their quota. Job placement does not depend on your requirements, but only what they need at the time. You can and will be placed anywhere for them to cover a job. They will also let you go from a contract not to have the right to pay you for your yearly vacation."
bad,Was thinking this was a good company to work for till I got sick on the job then was released because i didn't come back to work after being treated at the hospital. Not a caring company like I thought they were more worried about the parts we produced rather than the health of the employ. To me the health of the employs is important I could have died right there on the line and they did not care I couldn't breathe my airways were closed up and they fired me for it.
bad,"I was promised a job at cargill, but, oriantation wouldn't have been till the following friday, but, this client in minster needed help for a few days, so I agreed to do that until oriantation at cargill. Come the last day, my oriantation was cancelled because they didn't feel comfortable at sending me to cargill. Just poor management and doesn't stick to there word. they can promise you this, and then get put on the back burner and wouldn't advise anyone to go to manpower."
bad,They treat you like a slave the management doesnt do jack  the coworkers are good people
bad,Very productive and have very useful tools to have a successful day at work. 
bad,the hardest part of the job was the breaks.great place to work within the company.
bad,"I was nothing more than a pawn that they push into interviews to make them gobs of money. While my assignments were ok, I felt like a second class employeee at one assignment."
bad,"Manpower should have better people in place helping you to get a job. My agent was never around to answer any questions I had or to assist me in any way. She was very rude and disrespectful. Also, the agents at the main office could never provide me with any information. Benefits/insurance was horrible and a waste of time and money."
bad,like to tell people that they are on call and hire more people then they need so the new people get more hours then the ones that been working there which is not fair
bad,"Doesn't offer modern benefits, like flexible working. Micro management. Promises beyond what it delivers to employees.  Non existent social activities."
bad,"Manpower is a temporary staffing agency. they hire for contracted temporary workers for target warehouse, temp workers make over a dollar less than target employees doing the same job."
bad,"5 years no raise, no paid time off, no vacation, no sick time, $13 an hour in NY and then laid off without any notice or for any good reason.  Pyramid company making money off the backs of experienced EAAs.  I worked it since it was work at home and helped due to being a caregiver, however, after asking for a raise every year and not receiving, I continued to support Executives with the best support which was not recognized and then downsized me with no notice, no reason.  Not a company I would suggest working for."
bad,Was here for 15 months and was getting jacked every pay check from the actual employer @ maximum recycling and when I brought it to manpower’s attention about all the bad stuff they doing especially having to operate the forklift and not pay us for it. The employer told us not to tell manpower that we use the forklift or we couldn’t work there because manpower wanted to charge them a lot of money and well I brought this to manpower’s attention and they never did anything about it. So I quit and reported the employer to state labor board and manpower’s response was well when your done with your case come back for another job. Never ! No thanks . I want to work for a company or business that will fight for their employees. Not this place .!
bad,"The bad thing about a temp job is your nothing. You are replaceable anytime. No matter how hard you work or how flexible you can come in one day and they are done. I worked many jobs and never complained about changing jobs three times. I did what they told me. I worked thru most of my breaks. I do not smoke so I just went to the bathroom and took lunch. Once I get going I usually lose track of time. After months of not taking a break and getting offered a permanent jobs because I had done such a good job. One day I took a break. Next thing I knew I was in the office and packing my bags. They claimed I took too long. I might have been on break for 20 minutes, we get a 15. Everyone else was still out on break I went with a group when the bell rang. "
bad,"Management only cares about Production. You are expected to come into work even if you have the flu or get written up and given a point. Through manpower you only get 3 points. I had the flu and had a doctors note to miss 3 days, and they pointed me out, and refuse to give me another assignment."
bad,"I work for manpower/honeywell process solution in Houston, TX for 6 months.They dont know how to keep knowledgeable good employees.During the 6 months I have seen people leave and quit from the tech level to the plant manager. Alot of favoritism and drama at this factory.This place needs to be audit and bring in some real LEADERSHIP."
bad,They usually worked people for 89 days and let them go or sent them to a different factory. Wasn't a comfortable place to work because of job security
bad,"A lot of favoritism between co workers and supervisors, supervisor flirting with married women at work place and manpower manager never come around to see if there employees need anything nor care when they get hurt they just lay them off . When addressed a problem they take so long to fix it or do anything about it ."
bad,"I worked for Manpower at Kerry Ingredients Murrarie. Payment of wages by Manpower is completely pathetic and will make anyone really bitter about working for this company.  This Brisbane office either won't pay you at all for work done, won't pay you a correct rate for work done or won't pay you for the total number of days worked and the staff responsible for it act like they don't care. Very weird."
bad,"Manpower provided a flexible schedule, holiday pay. I enjoyed everything that I learned when I worked at the location that I was at. I met new people and we became like family."
bad,"They talk a lot of game, do not provide training, no empathy for family values.  The management is not cultural driving they are completely out of touch with what's going on in the staffing industry for the Jacksonville region"
bad,es una empresa con muy buena gente pero esta transitando un cambio organizacional y produce como consecuencia que esten con muchas tareas pero no bien enfocados
bad,gut:
bad,I would recommend this place only for someone needing a job quick as it is a temp agency and the usally always have some sort of job opening for everyone it may not be ideal but it pays
bad,"I was not giving a chance to actually prove what I could accomplish before I was taken off of assignment. The work was a lot to handle and being new to the company did not give me an advantage at all. There was no talking to the management and even though I worked hard and tried my best, they nit picked at everything instead of helping me to improve. I enjoyed the job in a whole, it was the management and the politics of the job that got me."
bad,"Very inconsiderate, treat staff like muck on their shoes. Only in it for themselves and should be closed down immidately. Do not respect their workers and only care for themselves."
bad,Busy from the time you clock in till you clock out. I learned about assembly work. Manager was easy to get along with. Everyone was friendly. Hardest part of the job was moving fast paced all day long. Most enjoyable part of the day was the last part when we cleaned up.
bad,"Went in asking about a certain job, only offered Amway or Steelcase because they have offices within those companies. Hardly saw the manpower reps, worked anywhere from 20 to 80 hours a week at Steelcase."
bad,"Niestety w przypadku pracy w syncreonie Manpower polega na całej linii. Niby renomowana agencja a tutaj tylko i wyłącznie przekazują ci polecenia z firmy. Nie ma co liczyć na pomoc, mediacje czy rade. Jedyne co się stanie to powiedzą Ci w grzecznej formie do widzenia."
bad,"Je suis intérimaire chez Manpower depuis 2 ans  la première année parfaite que je soit de la mission ou du salaire, mais depuis un an grosse dégradation."
bad,"Was sent to various sites to perform general labor work. Jobs weren't hard, work a variety on hours. Pay was on a weekly basis, management needs improvement."
bad,"cambios constantyes de centro y casi sin aviso, muy poca o ninguna información sobre el producto a ofrecer a los clientes"
bad,"Manpower is a mess. If you want to work next to people making 3 to 4 times your pay while doing the same things, apply today.  As a bonus, they will mess up your pay and wait for you to notice before fixing it, and even then, you will need corroboration from three people to be paid the pennies you already earned."
bad,"Es una empresa con buen ambiente laboral, pero sus prestaciones y el manejo de los derechos laborales deja mucho que desear."
bad,"Not a company I would recommend to anyone. Not professional, very unorganized. Dishonest employees. I was not trained correctly and was reprimanded for making any mistakes and being pregnant."
bad,Very poor management; unable to keep good people because of the poor leadership. Learned via conversations with other employees that they also felt disposable and disrespected.
bad,poor rating if they were to listen to there employees and take care of them to put them in jobs were they can work then they would be great
bad,"I worked internally at Manpower doing recruiting, staffing, and client services. Manpower in Peoria, Illinois is a very hostile work environment. Internally, Manpower is very understaffed and overworked. The management is terrible and makes for a very unpleasant work place. I do not recommend anyone to work internally at Manpower in Peoria. They have very high turnover and the branch manager is self indulgent. Terrible, horrible, no good very bad work environment."
bad,En realidad me costo mucho trabajo aprender todos los temas relacionados con mi trabajo y con relación al área laboral dependía mucho de las relaciones personales no laborales  por lo cual no me encontraba en total acuerdo ya que no se gestiona la capacidad de las personas con experiencia que es indispensable para el trabajo
bad,Very small company that has a very bad future forecast. There is no room for advancement.
bad,They got me a job working 60-70 hours a week. Money was decent but absolutely no family life.
bad,This was a temporary position at the Ok Tax Commission.I liked the data entry work which helped me build up my speed.
bad,"When they found me work, it was fine, but I never I ever worked 3 days in a row."
bad,"Management very poor at all levels. Be expected to kiss a** or you will not get along. ""Keeping to yourself and just doing your job"" is not good enough. Low pay, even at skilled jobs. They cannot keep help because of the low pay and therefore every butt-kissing 20-year-old know-nothing punk  gets promoted to positions of authority. I've been around awhile and have seen few outfits ran worse than this. AVOID."
bad,"I worked for Manpower for around ten months with my assignment eventually being ended by the client company. The company I was working for was great, but Manpower gave me continual, almost weekly problems with getting my pay right and billing the company correctly. The company in question used numerous agencies and only me and fellow Manpower staff had this problem with incorrect and late pay."
bad,"I applied for a job these were advertising for Royal Mail. How the advert was worded sound like they were just getting staff on Royal Mail's behalf. I went for the interview in Milton Keynes. I was offered a job. I was meant to start after i worked my weeks notice at my job at the time. The day i went to start i rang up MANPOWER to check if i need to be in a little earlier incase i needed to go through anything before i started my shift. "
bad,Hard aan het werk geen gepraat.
bad,"Hot,noisy,dusty environment,employer not friendly,not getting out on time."
bad,"Placed with a small manufacturer that had no direction, no policies made on the fly and a senior management team that that ruled by edict. Napolean complex top manager that couldn't hold by dirty laundry bag. With company 5 months. Let go 5 days prior to becoming permanent. Manpower rep wanted nothing to do with me after being let go in a multi-departmental salary dump because the company was underperforming, and probably always will be."
bad,"Companies they send u to treat you shady because manpower has a bad reputation,  so you have to defend your honor and the company won't keep you 80% percent of the time anyway ...they rather keep using temps than giving workers higher pay and company benefits. FACTS"
bad,"when a line scrape stuff . they want you to bring cart after cart and only wait on them. they get huffy,take it out on tugger drivers. very low pay.management could care less"
bad,"There is new people there.  They are RUDE and  say there is no work when it's posted on web page.  Always a reason for not having a job.  "
bad,"I felt like a slave owner.  MP makes money off the backs of desperate people.  Horrible insurance for the workers.  The company makes more than the workers, when an employee got hurt on the job,. MP fought paying them workman's comp.  No respect for the workers at all. A dreadful company."
bad,They layed a bunch of workers off without notice. And did n oi t have any other assignments lined up for us when they unexpectedly let us go. Horrible management.
bad,I applied for full time they got mad and started looking for a reason to fire me. Dont let them fool you like your a regular employee they'll fire you
bad,Chandler Location is unfair and was not helpful. The issues I had was pushed away and when Staff had a issues they did no investigation they are very lackadaisical.
bad,"Manpower forgot how the basics paid the bills.  They wanted to move away from light industrial and every office be cookie cutter no matter the city.  That simply doesn’t work in smaller areas. My manager was terrible, he did not provide any hands on visits to my area. Horrible experience"
bad,The agency was great up until it came time to pay me. I had to threaten legal action for them to get my money to me. Other than that I loved working at shipmonk the warehouse is small and the work is not back breaking.
bad,They only care about money not employers or employees.  They placed bodies in positions with ppl that didn't qualify for a position.  I had no choice but to go through them to get a job that I wanted.
bad,"When I worked at Whitehall through 128 of us were let go at the end of our shift with no warning on January 25th and I still do not have a job. I cannot get unemployment either, and because of that the government took all of my taxes for my student loans. When you do not have a job you cannot pay the bills it sure would have been nice to get some of my taxes back being I am in this situation. I have $5.00 in my checking account so it wouldn't close. When we had the meeting after our shift letting us know they were going to let us go Manpower already new. They could of gave us a heads up, not just a don't come in tomorrow ."
bad,My time with the company was strained by the inability of the upper management to see my worth and appropriately accommodate me for it. My immediate manager was solid and her hands were tied to provide further assistance with issues that led to my leaving the company.
bad,"The placement was actually at Jaguar Land Rover.  I would say that as an agency worker you get most of the benefits of being a JLR worker such as good salary and holidays but with none of the job security."
bad,"Entreprise qui ne fait pas attention a ses salarié , beaucoup de turnover , Beaucoup de points négatifs ."
bad,"The days are long, the management team treats you like a number, they dont care about you as a person. The hours are horrible, you cant get used to days or nights."
bad,"I have learned so much with this company working as Inventory. "
bad,The two ladies that manage the Red Deer office are very unprofessional. They don’t return phone calls I’ve tried to see if they have found any employment opportunities. I would NEVER work for them again go to other employment agencies there’s enough of them.
bad,"Build pre assembled parts and electrical motor parts"
bad,Did not do a great job of helping to find another job when a ssignment ended.  I called multiply times and took forever for someone to call me back.  And they were rude with me.
bad,I worked for manpower at 2 different factories this was only temp work.  I did not enjoy working for manpower I was put in factories I would normally never work.
bad,"Managers come and go, and none of them do their jobs. You're NEVER rewarded for doing good work and can never be good enough. No matter how much you excel and keep your nose down there will always be something they will complain about. Don't understand employee's personal goals. No sick time until 1 year of work and then only 3 days."
bad,crew leaders were lazy too much favortism co workers would talk about everyone this job was temp we didnt any kind of bonuses when the fulltime employees did  i felt that we should have cause we work as hard as them
bad,put your head down and work you will do well but there is little opportunity for advancement as the upper management (Calgary) is very much a clique and not interested in moving people forward.  ZERO life balance.  Highly fear based management style
bad,"Unfortunately,  I had no other options but to result to this branch due to a lay off.  The staff in the office acted as though they were better then me,  didn't listen to what I was seeking and we're very rude and basically laughed at me.  Due to all these reasons,  I choose to take my business elsewhere to someone that would be happy to have me work for them until my lay off got straighten out."
bad,A very diverse enviroment. My supervisor was approachable and unverstanding of his employees.It was nice working with a diverse group of people. I feel I've learned so many things interacting and working with people from different backgrounds.
bad,I was hired to grow a stagnant region. They let me go after three months despite bringing in 12 new clients. In house training program is ancient. Too many daily conference calls prohibit business development. Manpower ranked last in temp staffing agencies.
bad,"No messed up my payroll twice. Had to enter in all the times that I worked, online before Sunday every week. That's not right, we should have just had a punch card"
bad,Very poor salary and training. The working environment was horrendous. People didn't enjoy going into work as the Manager often had mood swings which left a terrible office atmosphere. Worst company that I've ever worki for.
bad,"i was told that i would be making a certain amount of a shift percentage, that was not true,  i was told that raises came at certain times of being on the job, not true.  their on site representative was never available, he would not answer phone calls, or emails.  poor service"
bad,"very busy"
bad,es una empresa muy foramada con todos los beneficios para el trabajador
bad,"Really enjoyed job and workplace.  Not at all imporessed with Manpower!  Terrible associate service.  Not in it for their employees AT ALL!  Minimal benefits; NO bereavment; low pay, terrible employee support.  As long as they get you a job and get their cut, that's what they're in it for."
bad,"I went 6 weeks without pay from this company. I had to file with the State Labor Board and ended up loosing my job because of it. I loved this job and would have continued to work with the company I was hired to work for,  for years to come. Manpower strung me along and cost me a very good Federal position!! There is no number to contact a head office, plus they sent me text messages when they didn't want to talk to me. I finally got a hold of one of the head people and he kept telling my payroll issue was settled. It never was, I waited six weeks and then had no choice but to file. I still have not received all of my money."
bad,Performing general labor at various industrial facilities taught me how to work even more safely.For the most part management and co-workers seen eye to eye.The hardest part about the job was digging with shovels.
bad,Mismanaged by 2 (oil and gas specialists) recruiters that don't know much but just to get bodies for commission. They take 35% of your wages for getting you a job and not doing anything to help you. Empty promises of getting on with company contracted to and that is the trap in order to get you to work for Manpower. Poor benefits. No chance for advancement.
bad,"Worked with them at BCBSNC. Was told as long as we did our best we'd be perm in a couple months. After eight months we was told our job would be ending soon. The whole time I reached out to our Manpower reps about moving to a better role that I'm more qualified for or what happens next. They would take days to reply just to give the broken record response of nothing we can do and you're doing too good of a job to get moved or give a nasty email saying why are you emailing me and not doing your job. A round of cuts was made after the first couple months of those that couldn't handle the work or didn't show up. Less than a month later they got assigned better paying jobs with BCBSNC and went perm in three months. Very unfair. It left a very bad taste in my mouth of Manpower and BCBSNC. "
bad,"Everyone seems so isolated in their cubicles. Management very impersonal and overall not available. Working with out-of-date methods and procedures. Working in ""crisis mode"" way too often."
bad,"Couldn't keep workers, and no benefits. Job site work was good, but the pay wasn't worth it with all the hours that was put in.  Checks was never on time, no holiday pay for working holidays nor weekend or late shift differential."
bad,"Fast paced with unrealistic expectations"
bad,"Usually got stuck driving homeless co-workers to the job site and back to Manpower, usually around midnight. Manpower was in the ghetto in downtown Cincinnati."
bad,"Straightforward job at market rate, no real issue in applying/getting a job. However while on the job is very different - Manpower workers can expect constant issues with payslips, underpaid holiday time, timesheet submissions going missing and getting answers to basic questions when trying to resolve these issues very hard. This only gets worse when a job ends and you need to figure out and try to get what they owe you at the end."
bad,The one time in 20 years that I worked for a temp agency.  I've taken a college level statistics course - there is no math to explain that.
bad,buena aunque poca paga te tienen checado no tienes voz ni voto en honeywell te auxilian en lño que pueden
bad,"The financial incentive for companies to *ABUSE* the protections garnered by the use of temporary employment agencies is far too large to overlook. If you want secure employment, get hired by the company for whom you work... not by a third party."
bad,"They paid for my HIAB cert to which i am very greatfull however Jewsons was a mind feild of back stabbers, snakes and liars. It was impossible to get on with the other drivers and infact one made up a storey about me swearing at a customer then when i confronted him about it infront of the whole team he took off his jacket and tried to fight me!!! Then moved over to another depot and again the lies and deceit were terrible! I ended up being dropped from the contract  with little or no explanation or backing from my Manpower colleagues in Reading. The drivers at Manpower do not want temps in there and i was dropped as soon as i started!! TERRIBLE ONE MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS!! "
bad,I don't agree with having a contingent worker employed for over two years. If t he position being filled is to be temporary than that needs to be explained more clearly. 
bad,"Stressful work environment, with rude customers, and complaining coworkers. Sick often."
bad,temp agency some what decent. didnt like that they didn't try to find me another job after one assignment ended
bad,Manpower is not about helping the public. They don’t listen to the employees they place on assignments. only the companies they work for. They do not back the people they place in these jobs when there is an issue. The individual is simply removed and put out on there own with no explanation and no further job assistance from Manpower.
bad,My day would consist of providing a number of services to customers and making sure cash drawer is balanced. I also trained newly hired co-workers.
bad,"My honest review of this company is ABSOLUTELY horrendous! The only good thing I will say about Manpower is that the pay was $21 an hour for talent acquisitions and the job location was in Downtown. Other than that, it was a horrible company that had no structure, no game plan to gets things accomplished, unorganized and very unstructured. Never offered benefits!"
bad,"Fick jobb hos dem via mitt arbete som ville ha kvar mig men kunde inte anställa mig så hamnade på manpower."
bad,"Esistono APL molto più strutturate e in cui è reale l’attenzione verso il dipendente (che sia esso anche solo uno stagista)."
bad,"I beleive this can be a good company to work for - unfortunately i did not have the greatest management. "
bad,"I wasn't new to temp services when this event happened, but I expected better.  I was a laborer for Manpower for several months, long enough to have moved for a position that opened up that I was interested in at least.  As a laborer at UPI through Manpower, the pay was good at least, and the conditions weren't bad or anything, it was being terminated that set me off and I feel was wrongful."
bad,easy job to do but no support at all very poor management easy to learn the job no job improvements some people thought they were better then others no team work most of the time. no paid time or anything really no pay raises
bad,Manpower has not placed me in months i need a 40 hour or more a week job they never call you and you always have to call EvErYdAy and who really has time to call EVERYDAY
bad,I’ve never even been to their office. Everything was done over the phone and online. There have been several times where the app that they want us to submit our time sheets in (iqnavigator) did not work properly and I never received payment for the hours worked.
bad,I started working with Manpower whilstat college and the weekend shifts did keep the money coming in but it wasnot enough to pay for my monthly tuition fees of £160 a month (I ered anaverage of £120 per month).With travelnot being paid for and some of the shift times including pick up times of 2am meant that I was losing money before even starting a shift.
bad,A typical day at work was great. I learned how to make sure packages were going to the correct state and city based off the labels and also learned how to properly T-Stack the packages into different sized crates that were placed on planes. The management at Fedex Express was awesome. The workplace culture was welcoming and safe. The hardest part of the job was trying to become permanent only because Manpower has a contract with FedEx Express that I did not know about. And the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and actually experiencing teamwork at a Airport.
bad,"I have never worked for a company that hires and fires so many people with no hesitation. You are literally a line item on a cost sheet. I was hired for a project before they had approval to do it. They made me hire people for this project knowing it most likely would not start, then laid them off. Moved me around on a couple programs and then let me go because they ""had no place for me"" The leadership is terrible."
bad,"They only care about the free money they get for all of your hard work, complete disregard for employee safety on assigned jobs as long as ""supervisor"" doesn't ""see a problem""."
bad,nothing was really that great about working here they are very inconsistent and don't try hard enough to help look for new and better jobs but i did just like working hard and having a job
bad,era un excelente ambiente de trabajo me gusta mucho mi trabajo aprendi a menjar un camion como acomodar el producto lo mas dificil era que ya en la noche nos arriesgabamos mucho para ser atracados y luego ya no alcanzaba transporte para llegar ami casa me gusto mucho el apoyo de los compañeros las enseñanzas y consejos que ellos me brindaron
bad,I liked working at kestral house.But as soon as you have any problems no one wanted to know.I was told I was not quick enought
bad,"My first assignment was  rescheduled to a later date, but they failed to notify me. I waited outside a closed dark business at 4am. Confused, I call the office, but calls are never answered by a human, always a machine to screen who you are, what you want and if you deserve a call back in a call back. It took hours to get a call back from someone other than the original recruiter, whom I felt was avoiding me out of guilt for his negligent work ethic. The caller was making excuses for him. Pathetic work ethic. Not to mention how they also failed "
bad,"Don't get duped like I did...they don't value you. The employee handbook is just sweet words...all butter and no jam.    The truth is your value to Manpower depends on your title/rank and not on your actually work record. I would never recommend a single person to work for the current management team of the Manpower Corporation and I strongly caution against anyone registering as a temporary employee within the Pacific Northwest of Washington.  In a nutshell, you think you are applying to work at one of the most prestigious agencies on the Globe but in fact you will be applying to work with garbage wrapped in a pretty package.  However, you won't know it's actually garbage until you have to unwrap it. The short review is that this company ended up being shady and unethical. It went from being one of the greatest companies I've ever worked for to being another lying corporation and a massive headache.  However, I'm glad to have worked there and learn what I have.  The full review is below."
bad,"discrimination for age, even in the hiring process, is illegal in Canada. Could be a good idea to make a report to the authorities to stop these hideous practices."
bad,I Worked a part time temporary position.No issues. The position lasted for 15 months.  Always able to contact them with any questions. Wages were automatically deposited. Staff was pleasant and helpful.
bad,"I couldn't change shift to nights, I wouldn't tell anyone to apply, I had many doctor appointments, so they ended my assignment.  They never got me another assignment/wouldn't give me a reference."
bad,"I did a variety of different jobs, some worth the money I was making, some not so much. They are a temp agency so, if a place needs a warm body with a heartbeat, you'd be there guy."
bad,"Management needed to be more upfront with core groups, on the reasoning why they were outsourcing all the jobs to India. Upper management simply did not care for the workers."
bad,this place provided me with a job which i was grateful for. however there was no advancements in pay or position. there were a few people ahead of me. the person who started first was at the same position for 3 years (lowest possible pay scale).
bad,"love to work in team.we do good but me along can do the job I work like to people so if its a time taking thing count me as the winner.like I sad ,,,,"
bad,I was let go of a good job temporary. I was looked at as if I could not understand. I had to work hard to get the job and the managers training to do it was very difficult. They would let everyone know that if you did not get it then you were let go.
bad,"The company, management and supervisors all are terrible people. They  don't  know how to run things. They push you to the limit with so many ridiculous rules and stupid reasons for write ups. They push you into working 60 hours or more. That's why so many people have come and gone through Manpower. I would not recommend working for Manpower."
bad,They were great in helping me find a job but the above doesn't apply.  They helped me find a job and then I didn't interact with them.  The pay was sufficient for a just out of college employee.
bad,"I have 1 word for this agency. Unprofessional."
bad,I didn't care to work here they promised to hire the temporary workers after 90 days and laid off 2 weeks before. We had to work pretty much every weekend. I would prefer not to be placed there again.
bad,"you train remotely without having access to any of the systems. Supervisors are nasty and rude when you need help you wave a flag and pray someone comes. When and if they do you get nasty comments like you should be reading this in blackboard I shouldn't have to read for you. When veterans"
bad,I was able to get maybe 1 day of work a week when when calling in 20 minutes after the Kenosha office opened and even when I was offered a permanent position at a site MP made no attempt to contact me about it am gave me the equivalent of 'you never asked us about it'
bad,"The work can be physically draining as it requires heavy lifting but this is known and therefore of no negative sentiment. I enjoy the work hours at Lakenheath airbase (8:00 - 17:00) as a full days work makes me feel more efficient and productive."
bad,"une journée de travail typique."
bad,"Hot"
bad,With this job it was a lose lose situation. Easy over time but having to follow the goals implemented by sprint made it easy to lose your job. Not a great job for a single mom. Its all work and no time for family or you have your family and no job.
bad,Most enjoyable part of the job is that i get to interact a lot with people  belonging to different profiles and have got a lot of market exposure. 
bad,I rate this company poorly because I did not feel like I received the proper respect as an employee for the company. I was placed at an assignment where I was not evaluated on my work performance which was excellent but instead on personal judgments. When I talked to Manpower about it I did not receive any form of reassurance and when my assignment ended no one from the company offered to help find me a new assignment even when I asked to be reassigned.
bad,"worked on learning how to read the blueprints to cut and weld jackets onto tank cars, helped weld and fit the jackets onto the tank cars. the most enjoyable part of the job when everything worked the way it should things went smoothe, co -workers for the most part easy to work with"
bad,The positions are contract only however they never last as long as they say there going to last. Then the company takes months to put you on another assignment! So your without work for a long period of time. Not a good fit if this is your primary income and your a single parent. The pay is excellent when on an assignment.
bad,"Poucas oportunidades em Castelo Branco, só área comercial."
bad,Work not hard just need more time and pay more.points suck you get a point just with a note or not when you are sick so u may just come and let them send you home if you can go home
bad,"This place treats employees by how much you are a suck up to leadership.  You can be the the best, strongest, hardest worker but if they don’t like you your Work means nothing.  Very unprofessional environment and not very honest to their employees.  This is my experience through both times working for this company.  Came back because I was offered a new role and was told things were different but it was the same horrible environment and bad leadership. A true leader leads by example and training, that was not implemented or experienced, ever."
bad,"I worked at the Royal Mail on a forklift throughout the Christmas rush period. I worked hard and put in loads of overtime. In 8 weeks, my wages were never correct and no one from Manpower seemed interested."
bad,"Only lasted a week at this place although I’ve been manpower before and they were good so there not all bad. "
bad,Its not a good place to work. Middle management is great but the tier below C level is terrible and brain dead. Does not inspire passion. Promotes people who are inexperienced by pretty or cute.
bad,"Been with them for about 5 years, maybe have had 7 assignments total. Only 4 have been in my field of preference. I wouldn't really suggest this staffing agency unless you are more interested and experienced in industrial, warehouse or machinery. Last assignment was at a shipping facility. Shift was supposed to be 10 hours, they would go into at least 12 hours. I asked to use the comfortable floor mats to stand on while I worked, they told me to use more comfortable shoes (which I was). At the time, my father was in the hospital, so I had to quit because he was coming home and needed full time care. I have no regrets for leaving that last assignment, but I wish that the recruiters would make their associates aware of what kind of clients they have before they send them out on assignments."
bad,"My review stated that I exceeded expectations, but when it came time for my raise it was only $0.28 more per hour. I was extremely offended. I dealt with crazy people walking into my branch, it was an extremely bad location. The HRIS system DO had so many bugs, it was almost easier to work without it. I had a great manager, but they let him go due to unrealistic goals that were set for our demographic area. There is no room for growth. And their bonus system is a joke."
bad,"The money was good in the beginning work, wasn't consistent I started out making $15.25hr  and ended up making $11.75hr No pay raze"
bad,Very rude and snide workers in the office. Multiple issues with payment and record keeping. They also only pay about 50% of the promised hire on bonus. Whenever you confront them about the missing hours on your check or on their records they become very defensive and rude. They only keep records of what benefits them so when they mess up your check or tell you the wrong instructions you're screwed. Glad I only had to put up with them for a few months before I was a full hire. Unfortunately I have to watch my newer coworkers deal with the same issues until they get hired in as well and can cut ties with the worst staffing agency in the area.
bad,we have no guarantee of obtaining a contract with the company therefore there is no job security what so ever. I currently work at jlr under manpower and they don't treat us the same.
bad,"Manpower, was a temp job, i enjoyed my time with them, i learned a lot about the company, the hardest part of the job was people weren't team players."
bad,they are very understanding employers and work very hard to make sure you have everything you need and they work very quickly to ensure your employment
bad,"I have applied and tried to contact a Rep with further questions about the job twice now. Was told the rep wasn’t available and would contact me, still haven’t heard back"
bad,"Goed hier zyn ze goed in ieder geval er een puinhoop v te maken, hele slechte communicatie naar de uitzendkracht zoals verbaal en schriftelyk."
bad,"I dont mean to talk bad about Manpower, but the days were dragging and little to no work was there, it was easy but we were done with the work within 2 hours and stand around doing nothing the rest of the 6 hours."
bad,Royal mail is a good company and their once again provided a great amount of opportunity for a variety of people. My role usually consisted of sorting out mail in the building into the chosen categories.
bad,"Hired for assembly at assembly pay but day one on the job MIG welding and operating URL robot welding arm."
bad,"The company was so strict on how much time you could spend going to the bathroom, taking lunch break etc. They also had a strict enter/exit policy in which you had to scan your badge and open the door meaning you had to slam the door on the face of whoever was behind you so they could scan themselves in which was kind of ridiculous."
bad,"2004-2013 Loved my job, staff and companies that we staffed for. 2014 new management stepped in and cleaned house. Lost all respect."
bad,"Satisfying all customer needs"
bad,"Avoid this temp agency! They do not care about you after you get a job assignment. Once you complete the assignment, they make no effort to find you another job. They'll even ignore your attempts at contacting them so they can claim that you quit the assignment. They have no opportunities to offer in my state while other temp agencies have hundreds of opportunities. They were not worth the time and money I lost. Beware!"
bad,"Typical staffing agency in a rural location."
bad,"Come in to work but first make sure you have on your PPE gear to start up. Line lead would tell you to either get into a 1,2,3,4,5 or 7 area of orders( all i am skilled in). Check out your lifts for daily checks and head into what work area you were assigned to."
bad,"Manpower was very unorganized, they had a habit of changing the rules everyday. There was no stability with the Job and they had a habit letting us know information the last minute. We were always blind sided, mind you the employers were virtual. They only visited the office once or twice within the year. When the company was closing they only gave us a two week notice."
bad,Working with this company will help the voids in your resume.
bad,"Every single time I pick up overtime, somehow they manage to screw it up on my paycheck. When I call in to get it fixed, the people who help me can't seem to do basic math and realize that I've worked more than 40 hours during the week, even while reading my hours off to me. This is a regular occurrence, and despite me getting this resolved time and time again, I run into the same issues. Many of my coworkers have this issue too. If the rest of the company is managed this way I can't imagine it's good to work for."
bad,The staff was somewhat friendly yet really didnt care when issues arose. There were deductions that couldnt be explained and a lack of concern in resolving the issues.
bad,"To many people trying to be in charge with no delegation from manager as to who is to do what."
bad,"Petite missions"
bad,start my work answering calls and supporting students to catch college board test. I like the work to be outsourced but the pay is not good and I have no benefits
bad,"Amway is a wonderful and rich company with much success under their belt. Unfortunately, working for this company as a temporary worker is atrocious. There are benefits that come from Man Power, but they are sad and very discouraging. The agreement between Man Power and Amway is very legalistic and you feel as if you are being played as an employee."
bad,"Décu par cette agence. Après plusieurs candidatures, n'y répondent pas. Malgré des relances par mail, des coups de téléphones ainsi que des messages laissés sur leurs messagerie, où personne ne répond. Lors d'une visite a cette agence, les deux employées d'accueil ne sont pas bousculées par leurs travail (elles auraient pu répondre au téléphone, au lieu de bavarder et boire leurs thés) mauvais accueil, aucune empathie, vous signale qu'il ne peuvent pas répondre a tous le monde, qu'ils n'ont pas que ça à faire, qu'ils lisent les C.V. qui les intéressent, les autres ne sont pas lues, ils passent à la corbeille directement, impossible de joindre la personne qui s'occupe des candidatures, elle est en réunion ! Bref, Manpower, c'était une super bonne boite d'intérim, je la plaçais en tète de podium, ce n'est plus cas le maintenant."
bad,"This is torture.  You should not have to answer all of these questions to post your resume.  The recruiters at this company...One in particular are horrible communicators and should not be allowed to work with people."
bad,Very unprofessional when it comes to job offers. To be a well known business they are very unprofessional or should I say the people who hires or fire 🤬 guess that would be human resources. Need to revaluate the staff or the people who do the hiring.
bad,These people are unprofessional and will waste your time. They’re too busy on their cellphones or gossiping about the people that come in. Don’t care about you or your needs. It’s a temp agency if you need something ASAP then a temp is for you. No insurance no PTO and no job security. Find a full time job some where else don’t even bother with these idiots.
bad,"Interviewer was almost rude on the phone, unclear questions, and very obvious that no prep for the interview had been done.  "
bad,"I emailed of a problem with one of their employees, my boss. My name was given to him. I was.later fired by him for not a good reason! (I did not want to use their lock, because a few months age the individual tried to break into my locker! My name was to be kept confidential! I was trying to help the company and instead I get pounced on!)"
bad,"N'est pas a l'écoute des personnes si le salarié rencontre un problème avec l'employeur"
bad,"Worked for third-party employment agency through Manpower.  The company was very unorganized,  too many people trying to manage one person's paperwork and onboarding process.  They didn't seem really know what was going on or how to manage the onboarding process."
bad,"Many of the recruiters at the Chandler, AZ location do not have their clients best interest at heart and they lie about if there are positions available or not"
bad,"Après avoir travailler, pour me payer c'est devenu un problème! Je les téléphonais presque tous les jours pour reclamer mon argent mais rien! C'est toujours des faux rdv, ils essayent de m'amadouer en me donnant de faux espoirs! ATTENTION réfléchissez bien avant de postuler dans cette entreprise mal organisée! Dégoûté, plus jamais j'irai travaillé à Katoen natie!"
bad,Pas assez de proposition d'emploi malgré les relances.
bad,"Sem comentários."
bad,"Le groupe se caractérise par une ancienneté élevée de son personnel (minimum 15 ans)une grande majorité ne connait d'ailleurs qu'un seul employeur : manpower.. "
bad,"Unprofessional environment, lack of employment assignments, lack of help and guidance from staff, no contact from agency regarding assignments matching skills and experience."
bad,"Wouldnt even rate them 1 star but wouldn’t let me mark 0!!."
bad,I dont think i would recommend this company to anyone at least the office i delt with on chyanne in north las vegas.the jobs i had were more labor then pay.
bad,"I don't recommend this agency to anybody keep going when you see Manpower bad customer service, bad upper and lower management is horrible, my pay was constantly being screwed up i also went thru discrimination & being harassed  at my job site i reported it and they never followed back up with me on this serious matter because it was not a big deal to them"
bad,"They’ve no idea on what they’re doing, have stupid rules and definitely don’t treat their employees right. There must be a lack of communication at Manpower."
bad,"Drama drama and more drama. You are treated as what you are, replaceable. I understand the need for money, and do it to get your bills paid, but continue actively searching for gainful employment. You cannot and will not be able to afford health insurance. Your check wont cover it."
bad,"underpaying company, not very attentive to workers needs, do not have enough worker benefits, do not fluctuate with hours, make workers work for 12 hours or more, do not investigate workplace occurrences properly"
bad,"MP taugt gar nichts!"
bad,"My opinion is very poor. I was not treated properly. They had to call me from the date of work. Unfortunately no one called.As it turned out, someone else got this job. I have not even been notified."
bad,"I had issues with the chemicals that I was working with and was told that I could not change positions to avoid the chemicals. Job was not hard, it was only repetitive."
bad,"низкие зарплаты, неуважение в к сотрудникам, заносчивость"
bad,Nikomu nie polecam pracować przez tą firmę zła atmosfera wynagrodzenie niskie zawsze coś jest potracane z wypłaty nic w biurze nie idzie załatwić traktują pracowników jak siłę robocza ludzie przychodzą do pracy jak zobaczą jaka jest atmosfera i wynagrodzenie po kilku dniach rezygnują
bad,My experience was one of a kind yet others may find some positive in the company so to each their own. Just always keep a backup plan temp agencies aren't reliable.
bad,Really didn't get a chance to show and approve.  It was a lot of drama disrespect. No training was placed anywhere in the line without the proper training.  Was basically set up to fail.
bad,C’était sympa de travailler là-bas une expérience parmi tant d’autres
bad,Really not must to say about Manpower. Some jobs there however I didn't find much no respect as a temp. just us as a stepping stone. paid every two weeks
bad,Rude and they don't pay you! Went through the Mount Gravatt office and I never heard anything positive about them. I ended up getting taken off their books because I wasn't happy about constantly not getting paid correctly.
bad,"Empresa multinacional do ramo de consultoria , bem conhecida no mercado por conta dos clientes parceiros."
bad,"couldn't really remember much from those days."
bad,I worked there a long time ago. It was a temporary assignment.  I was hired for a specific job and when that ended they provided no help to me to get a new job.
bad,Working for manpower was a mess didn't like how there staff handle the new hiring paper work. they really put me threw a lot . Wouldn't recommend this firm to someone
bad,"Boîte pas vraiment pas intéressante "
bad,"Cambian mucho personal de recursos humanos por Samsung razón nadie tiene respuesta cuando necesitas, las fichas no las entregan a tiempo."
bad,Was a great company to work for if I had any issues with my employer I would get a call back right away and if I was not happy with an employer they would move me to a job that was better and more my type of environment.
bad,"Terrible employers. They lied about my start date, my hourly pay AND how many hours I'd be working a week. They told me one thing when I was about to be hired on then changed it completely once I got to the job. Would no recommend."
bad,"Temporary assignment led to permanent position. Worthwhile due to nature of position, which was very interesting and resulted in permanent employment."
bad,"The time I spent with Manpower was very short. Because it was a temp agency i did not have much interaction with the company outside of my hiring. "
bad,I worked for manpower for about 2 weeks and their communication system is really screwed and they don't really keep you working very long at all.not a good place to work
bad,"Terrible place to work for. Staff at this branch have repeatedly been denying work to employees, turning their backs on people when they come to them for help, and they do not care about their employees! Very unhelpful and have been caught multiple times lying to employees about receiving employment. Staff is rude and will blame their mistakes on other staff members and employees. Terrible place of employment. Dixon office members are horrible to work for. Do not recommend to any person in need of a job."
bad,there was more stress in my life than there needed to be. there was no time for a life outside of work. instead of family time I was working non stop.
bad,"Pracowałem w tej pseudo firmie!"
bad,"dedique 6 años de mi vida a la empresa y nunca hubo apoyo, y el supervisor pésimo jamas tuvimos apoyo de el, en el trabajo los encargados te decían maldiciones y jamas se hizo algo al respecto el supervisor si no le hacías caso te amenazaba con correrte   para estar en su grupo tenias que hacer todo lo que te decía e incluso tomar con el  todo cambio cuando entro esa persona y manpower nunca hizo nada a mi me corrieron por que pedí mis datos para hacer mi declaración de impuestos, y siempre tenia fallos con los pagos de infonavit"
bad,This is the type of job that is a temporary job and not one that you would want to spend a career at. The pay is very low and you put in a lot of hours to benefit someone else.
bad,My manager is not very professional. I'm not sure how she got to be in her role. Doesn't handle conflict very well. As a manager you should make your employee feel like you can not approach and that is how my current manager is.
bad,I worked with 2 companies through manpower an was promised the second would be atleast 3 months contract with a looks to go permanent the role lasted a week.
bad,I was blocked out the system years ago because I refused an assignment that only paid very low minimum wage. I was given an assignment that had nothing at all to do with my profession...Avoid at all costs.
bad,I will love to take care my family financially and use my skills where they are needed I love work. I am dedicated to my work keep a positive attitude and meeting production every week!
bad,"The Winchester office called me after seeing my resume online.  I went in for testing & they said I scored well. After that I had one in-office interview, after which I never heard from them again.  Despite calling my ""representative"" several times, I was never called back. I've worked with job placement centers in the past. This one has got to be the worst."
bad,"Answered phones, maintained files, data entry and processed mail"
bad,Not at liberty to discuss nor do I want to.  My experience with the company was not a good one.  Leaders lead by fear. Does not foster a team environment.
bad,"grunt work , manufacture. No sitting , we were standing for 10 hours shifts.. workplace very demanding and lack of enthusiasm by employees."
bad,I loved the work environment that I was placed in. I was sad to have been let go and haven't yet been placed with a new assignment.
bad,I remodeled the west Burlington walmart I helped take down shelfs and put new ones back up I learned how to use a pallet jack
bad,"Staff was all helpful until I hired on, but after that they NEVER did respond to my requests for help.  Simply ignored my calls and emails.  After the temp job ended, they called me to let me know it was over, then when I applied for unemployment, they said I had quit the job.  About as bad as it gets."
bad,the lady that was in that office was NOT PREFOESSIONAL. She was dismissed from that position but otherwise the different experiences was nice
bad,I worked through manpower at CIBC. Manpower agents are very rude and has no empathy towards their staff. They simply will treat you like slaves. Awful job agency to work for.
bad,Unprofessional people and like to start problems within the staffing agency. Lie about what they won't give you employment.
bad,"The hardest part about working for a staffing agency is the low pay while you work for them. Most of the time these are used as a quick way to find work if you suddenly lose a job and aren't recommended, in my opinion, to work for them in the long term"
bad,"they say they have jobs that can turn into full time jobs, well thats a lie, and they are not treating everyone equallly. only the special people got the full time jobs."
bad,"I would not recommend Manpower Beavercreek. They are very rude. I did not like the way I was treated. I was just a body filling a position and as long as I was there, that was okay. Just know that if you have to work for them and you take a position with them, be sure to have no medical issues, no child day care issues, etc. They make sure you are there no matter what is happening in your life."
bad,"I just read a posted job Manpower has on Indeed for an Executive Assistant working for a large pharmaceutical company northwest of Chicago.  Now, an executive assistant has to be able to wear many hats in one day, know how to prioritize, and think on his/her feet.  The money Manpower stated in the ad per year (it was a range) averaged out to $11.74/hr. Take into consideration the fact where Baxter is located, you'll need to buy gas, pay taxes, etc...your pretty much going home with nothing at the end of the day. It can take years for an assistant to work his/her way up from reception to assisting an executive.  Why insult someone by paying $11.74 for experience?  I pray I'm never put into a situation where I'd have to rely on Manpower for job placement."
bad,I didn't like working there because they expected us to lie to customers. The young employees did not have a good work ethic and were not fired for screwing around. The calls were not bad except when the customers had to wait for us to have supervisors answer questions employees couldn't answer.
bad,"I Learned most to my job, how to handle people with different traits, how to deal to my terror boss, How to manage my time in terms of travel to one store to another store. encounter different kind of customer thats why you learn how to handle your patience"
bad,"bad company to work for, they do not care about their employees. very unprofessional environment"
bad,sat in a cubical all day on a phone and computer and got a lot of angry custermors
bad,I felt the management was poor. I was not scheduled appropriately since my team lead came in 3 hours before the end of my shift. I felt there was no support on the job.
bad,Need more staffing working inventory in a warehouse with only 2 staffing
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job while working for ManPower is that I was work with preschool aged children. I absolutely learned a lot from them as they learning from me. I really looked forward to the return the next day because of the teacher/child relationship gained with the children.
bad,"mise en place du barrierage,"
bad,"Awful workplace, the bring you in with the promise of the world then lay you off at a whim."
bad,uma empresa com uma vasta área de aprendizado e também boas oportunidades para crescimento dentro da própria empresa

bad,"no benefits at all, unsecured work place."
bad,"1 star is to many , this it what it should be  - 5 they are very  un--------professional"
bad,comein the morning and have a team meeting. I learned a lot about the company. the hardest part was learning the right way to stack the lumber
bad,"Rotina de trabalho muito corrida, aprendi a trabalhar em equipe"
bad,Worked for over two years for this company and anytime I mentioned the fact that i had been with a company for the alloted amount of time needed to get hired i was fired shortly afterwards. Eventually Manpower just stop giving me jobs and has refused to accept any new apps from me
bad,They have poor communication  skills between their representatives
bad,The hardest part of the job is leaving when you really enjoy your work.
bad,Everyone was rude when you tried to talk to the temp agency. Still never got the 10 dollars that i had to pay for our temp badge(wich was a pice of paper). Neither did my fiance.
bad,I only was called for one assignment while reside here in VA.
bad,Journée à l'usine plutot tranquille bonne ambiance entre collégue mais un peu épuisant à la longue car c'est du travail a la chaine pendant 8heures d'affilé.
bad,The plant manager and instrument tech talk down to you like you are nothing. Plant safety is a joke. Training is a joke and by joke I mean non existant. Convection header in Lemont II is expanding out at the center..So the remedy is hourly temp readings. Linde in romeoville is a joke.
bad,"lack of communication implementation of actions without reviewing the possible outcomes, total loss of management control infrastructure"
bad,"Everyday is a new experience at any job. A learning experience, every job I've had I want to learn everything about the buisness."
bad,coworkers where very unfriendly to the temp. employees that where working with them. Management was very nice and kind to the temp. employees.
bad,"I have been attemping to find employment through Manpower for over 4 years. I have never received a single phone call on any job openings and everytime I call the same message is given and that is there are no openings. 4 years and nothing, Really?"
bad,"stressful, learned a lot about manufacturing, management was un professional at addressing co workers, co workers were uptight nosy lazy, complainers, most enjoyable about the job was the perks"
bad,"Por mais que tenha sido uma rápida experiência, aprendi muita coisa, aprendi a trabalhar com o público, aprendi a ser mais ágil, mais organizada, sempre busquei atender os clientes da melhor maneira possível, o ruim era ter que trabalhar de 8 a 12 horas por dia sem comer, não ter um refeitório e a ""comida"" que nem de comida podia ser chamada eram, dois pães, um com manteiga e outro sem nada e um suco de caixinha, além de exigirem coisas de mais para mim que não eram minha função por que pessoas não queriam fazer e eu fazia. O bom foi as pessoas que conheci e os conhecimentos que adquiri."
bad,"Once I was hired, they had no contact with me. There was no 'how are things going or are you okay' questions. I felt unimportant and couldn't wait to become permanent. They were from Wisconsin which isn't in my state but how hard is it to check in on the people making YOU money."
bad,Estávamos sempre a fazer vários tipos de trabalho de redutores de gás.
bad,I worked in different Corporations within Somerset areas the jobs range between 11 - 13 dollars and hour.
bad,"It was a really good company I got a lot of hours they were highly reputable I I feel as I was going to work there you need to be on your a game for real they give you one. Don't apply if you're not going to work..!,"
bad,"Manpower used to be a great place to work. Great people and great ethics. Then about 5 years ago, they started outsourcing jobs to other countries and continue to do so. Prior to the outsourcing, I recommended them to everyone and rated them excellent across the board."
bad,"They didnt speak very good english and i couldnt understand what they were asking me to do, long boring lonely shifts, as i couldnt talk to anyone as we didnt understand eachother."
bad,"load and unload the front loader,and dump each  material in it's own dump site."
bad,This was a temp service that placed workers although the outcome may come out freat or not so well. the ypside is they helppeople get jobs the only downfall is they dont specify in your personal field.
bad,"Har tyckt om alla mina jobb fast de har varit inom olika områden. Roligt fått lära mej så mycket, sen alla trevliga arbetskollegor som jag haft, ledningen har varit kanon, har varit fackligt förtroendevald, när jag jobba på Kvantum, och inte att förglömma ALLA trevliga kunder som har passerat kassan."
bad,"bom, Empresa indônia  possibilidade de promoção estabilidade"
bad,I worked through Manpower for six days. They were very professional and helpful in getting me this job. Soon after I was hired for a regular job.
bad,Learn to work with a new system and developing new skills every day was different files looking how to fix it and new daily updates in making our customers happy
bad,Poor communication between the recruiters and employees. Emails never answered phone calls never returned. Overall a terrible work experience. The assignments were excellent fellow employees were great just the agency for lack of a better word was very disappointing.
bad,"no cumplen con fechas de pago, ambiente laboral bueno."
bad,I worked at Cape P&G. The management is unprofessional. There are no pay raises and no room for growth. Someone working 90 days will get the same pay as someone working 10 years. There are very few incentives given and they're usually given to management. Safety is highly stressed which is good.
bad,"Was hired for a production operator. I was told that i would be offered a position in the company i worked in after 1 year. 3 months after starting, was put on mandatory overtime, which was only for the temps. 12 hours a day 6 days a week, with Sunday being 8 hours, on a rotating schedule every 2 weeks."
bad,for what you were required to do you were unappreciated and treated like you were nothing at some of the places you were placed at. I was always sent to the same building doing the same thing.  Never really got to venture out to other departments.
bad,"non estiste stabilità, non c'è possibilità di contratto"
bad,"Hjälpa kunder över telefon"
bad,it was a temp job. i never really stayed at a job no more past 6 months. if you like moving job to job then this is perfect for you. i like severing customers
bad,"Long hours, low pay. The company I was contracted to expected no life outside of work. Manpower was more than willing to work with employees, contracted employer was not"
bad,For those who are needed job urgently if want good career must seek other company working with this organization is average for fresher's that will know how company Operations works
bad,"Just a job to get You by if You are desperate for money.  Not a long term solution.  Not a place to look for advancement or better wages, also no benefits."
bad,Manpower was temporary not something I planned as. A Career. But they will get u in and have a steady paycheck for those who.  Need it. The pay could be a little better.
bad,"You work every weekend and you hardly get time with your family, i really didn't learn anything because you didn't interact with anyone. I really didn't like working there"
bad,I started my very first position with them no one checked in with me I had to always contact them. No benefits as to Holiday pay and health benefits way to expensive. I felt like I was forgotten about.
bad,"Manpower is a good starting job finder, however do not plan on being hired at any facility they send you to or being able to find work again should your assignment be terminated or laid off."
bad,"This is a call center and the main goal for this company is assisting sprint customers with billing, payments, phone problems and other various issues.  I learned that there are many people who think they are entitled to free service for what ever reason and think they should have money credited to their account when ever there is an issue.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers and maintaining professionalism. The most enjoyable part of this job was going home for the day."
bad,"Opening the office daily, Answering multi -phone lines, preparing coffee, meet and greet clients. order supplies. worked with a verity of cultural people. Most enjoyable day is communicating with clients daily."
bad,I did not enjoy working with these people. None of my co-workers were nice. It was not the nicest place to work. I would rather work for anyone else on the entire planet than this place. They're a temp agency.
bad,"I endured working for this company for 1 year, i have not been hired and there's a lot of micro managing especially with the assignment i was given, No one has advanced but the ""supervisor"" who make working there a nightmare, even some of my co-workers were fired from Manpower completely for just asking for a new Assignment and for even telling them about the problems inside of the assignment that we were working for, you can't even get a day off with out them threatening you about getting fired, you can only get a day off if you fall ill or have a doctors appointment, or family emergency, Then to be questioned about why you're calling off or running late every single time and being asked when your appointment was scheduled and why you're going to the hospital is crazy! if you are able to endure a tough place like i did for 1 year then go for it but otherwise Please be aware of everything about this company before you apply if you even do want to apply.."
bad,"Helped me when I needed work, but overall not a great company to work for, lousy benefits etc. Always messed up on weekly paychecks when first started for company it was a nightmare"
bad,"Slecht uitzendbureau stelt zich heel afhankelijk op t.o,v. de opdrachtgever en denkt alleen aan diens wensen."
bad,"If you want a job, better do it yourself.  You sign up with them and it is up to you to bug them at least once a week to see if anything available. They don't call you , you call them"
bad,Summer Youth Employment. Supervised a crew of 6 people. Painting and cleaning hallways and classrooms at Gateway Technical College. Extended program for those who excelled.
bad,Salary is not competitive.  Salary growth non-existant.  Lack of professional development and promotion opportunities.  Lack of training. Not a professional work environment.
bad,Not a very flexable job for temp work and there is no trust built into the suport team on site. The staff will call and escalate situations before talking to you personally.  There is always someone on site but they won't talk to you if there is an medical or personal issue.  So I don't trust the team with Manpower.
bad,A typical day was very busy. I learned a lot of safety tips working a refinery. Management was a little tough. I did enjoy my co-workers. I enjoyed learning knew things.
bad,"I did like Manpower until they merged with Experis..... I have worked with Manpower since 1983....when they had the carbon copy time sheets.....now I would not give them the opportunity. Poor management. I will go to Randstad, OfficeTeam or Mancan. They care about their employees more then satisfing the ""CLIENT"" Last assignment with Manpower/Experis was 2 and half years, no vacation days and no pay for holidays....sad when you have been on the same assignment that long....getting them money but no incentives for employees. Plus wages were very low when your working with a Fortune 500 company....never again will I work for Manpower as long as they are affiliated with Experis!"
bad,The jobs were short the managers typical treated you as meat. Te Manpower resources were nice enough just not helpful as they could be.
bad,"A typical day at this job would be working at the same building doing the same thing for 12 straight hours. I have not really learned anything from this job that I do not currently know already. As for the management/supervisors they are not the best and do not care or have the employees best interest in mind. To me that does not make for a good supervisor or a good place to work. The other workers I work with however are decent. Some can be tolerated while some should not be there. The hardest part about this job is the fact that you could get fired for anything even being sick or injured, also the fact that we do have to work every holiday no exceptions. That being said, there are no enjoyable parts of the job its boring and very repetitive."
bad,To obtain a position that will allow me to utilize my education and work experience to benefit the company as well as for personal growth and professional advancement.
bad,"This was a boring job, did the same thing over and over everyday"
bad,Worst job ever. They treat their employees like they are nothing. The best thing about working there was the wonderful coworkers.
bad,"It was a poor time to be at NPS with the Government Shutdown"
bad,"Manpower itself was really not to involved in the day to day routine where I was a temp at. WS was the leader in that roll. There was favoritism showed. I called to let manpower know, they were going to check into it."
bad,"El cobro era a mes vencido, no existía posibilidad de mejora y la comisión de la ETT era del 30%"
bad,"I was a temp who worked  the producer/operator side of the current operations I now lead."
bad,PAY WAS POOR BUT IT WAS A JOB.Ilearned how to operate a forklift and to safely use hoists for assembly
bad,"The management at I.P is terrible but the service techs I worked with were great. We would repair & rebuild box machines, load and unload machines. I took care of the parts room. The best part of the job was troubleshooting & repairing the machines. And working with a good bunch of guys."
bad,This gave me the oppertunity to learn warehouse work. I was able to work for a couple different companies and learn the types of business.
bad,"I am tired of temp. services that treat you like another number.they don't care about you,all you are to them is a warm body to fill a job. It's nothing but a revolving door with these people!"
bad,I use to work for Manpower years ago. Was a good company to work for to pass the time away until something better came along. Review does not show what low to high rating.
bad,"When I began working for ManPower I was given qualiy assignments. Working temperary positions works very well for me. Among the many companies I provided service to were StonyBrook University, Fleet Bank, Bank of America and AON. My assignments varied in duration, as short as 1 month and the longest being 9 months. I am a business professional, with a Bachelor's from St. Joseph's College. In the past several years, Manpower no longer has quality assignments."
bad,Not very helpful in finding me a job and very rude to people. I don't think I would go back to them to work.
bad,"they didn't have a clue most of the time. unprofessional, had to wait over a month to receive my one day pay. monkeys could do a better job doing whatever they do"
bad,"Para trabajo temporal de 3 meses Ok, mas es una perdida de tiempo y un error en planes de carrera y vida"
bad,"Wer da als Reinigungskraft für die DB einen Vertrag hat, wird behandelt, wie das, was er in seinem Objekt zu beseitigen hat."
bad,"Manpower manager does not care about their employees, they are only concerned about number. They are unprofessional, they lack the management experience to manages anyone. At most staff meetings they would used unprofessional words to speak to their employees as if we were kids. Overall not a good company companys.companycompanyto have a career with"
bad,"I know it's a temp to perm company. When they say 90 days and you'll be hired on full time to find out it's actually closer to 2 years, they had to have known and should have been honest and upfront. A few were very rude to talk to, which is very unprofessional."
bad,"Decepcionado con la gestión en la empresa farmacéutica que me llamaron, pagan por debajo del salario del covenio de química, te quitan de tu salario el tiempo de descanso y encima si te cortan para vacaciones y si sigues buscando trabajo se enfadan."
bad,"Not a permenant job, something to do to stay busy, pay is awful for what you have to do. They were not consistent with checks."
bad,"Inconsistent regarding rules, immature supervisors, forgot to activate card so I couldn't get in first day on second contract period, this was normal according to older colleagues."
bad,"No raises or benefits ever mentioned. No sick days or vacation days with pay and you're pay is not enough to live on."
bad,Work sucks never will hire you full time will ask you to work all sorts of extra hours when full timers get paid double le time and pat you regular overtime
bad,If you like busting your butt just to have them let you go for no reason. Get a temp job. The only good thing about it is that you get a chance to experience different types of jobs to see what you like.
bad,Manpower connected me with Trico for a temporary position. When coming in with no experience they expect for you to learn in a couple of days everything. Current hired workers are owed raises from months ago.
bad,Ficaram de me pagar adicional noturno e hora extra. Fora isso me abriu uma otima oportunidade.
bad,"Management constantly lies to you. No vacation or paid time of. No raises, they tell you they are over paying you as it is. The absolute worst ever. This company should be shut down."
bad,"Bad place to work. Would not recommend to anyone. Employees drug users that I personally know and sneak around drug tests. Low pay, unreliable jobs and no opportunity for long term employment"
bad,"Me contrataron para un trabajo de una semana que nada tenía que ver con lo que se me ofreció, que era realizar un inventario y el trabajo fue realizar una mudanza y completo desmontaje en un almacén. Después de esto, se me obliga a hacer una formación online sobre la historia de la empresa, para así poder seguir trabajando con ellos, y dado que no tenía tiempo material de hacerlo, nunca volvieron a llamarme para nada."
bad,Ho lavorato  con la manpower  1mese ma il lavoro  l'ho  avevo  trovato  io e l'azienda  mi ha messo  con l'agenzia manpower  e da allora  non mi hanno  mai chiamato
bad,"Work is temporary. Not enough jobs. The job helps for the time being. But management should look into permanet hiring on through the company.  Management should also look for more jobs, be more reliable."
bad,"The Vice President level was among the worst leaders I have ever has to endure in my 20-year career. Had excellent structure and processes to succeed and grow, if not for the VPs making extremely poor decision time and time again. Promoted internally solely based upon who you know, and had the worst internal communication of any company I have been a part of."
bad,This is a temp agency.  I would not recommend that anyone go through ANY temp agency.  They are making over double what you are getting paid. If you have the opportunity to submit a resume or fill out an application; That is how you should do it.
bad,Manpower can be used as a temporary place to find a temp job. Most of the time they have no work or its work that your not qualified to do so it's of no benefit to you. The work is usually short term with little pay.
bad,"Typical day starts off with a meeting and hear about the target goal of orders to be assigned. A lot of pressure from supervisors and team lead to make sure we finish if not more. The only great part about work was coworkers. No opportunity for growth, if you want to move up then you would have to work extremely hard to get recognition and for years. A lot of favoritism from seniors."
bad,The recruiters only wanted to fill seats in the chairs. There was little interview process other than can you do the job. It was very disorganized and not an experience I'd like to have again.
bad,"""Um trabalho muito bom de trabalha ,com um público as vezes é meio corrido ,mais aprendi a ter paciência pois estragava jornal para as pessoas na rua, vou levar esse aprendizado po e toda vida, não tive nem um momento difícil pelo contrário me esforcei muito ....."
bad,The only thing I had to do was manufacturing related. I never really interacted with the management at Manpower. The only person I really interacted with was my supervisor at the manufacturing facility. I was working as temporary contractor.
bad,Management is really disappointing and work is too hard for what you get paid... Don't apply if you don't want to use painkillers after each shift. Really not for anyone!
bad,"It's not tempt to hire and some management act as if they know what's best for you or are short with you."
bad,"The salary are not conducive to the work assignments or your skill level.  The management are not truthful when it comes to providing accurate information when leaving the company,"
bad,Hardware is shipped in a timely manner and checking parts. Hardest part of the work day is working in a very hot environment and doing heavy lifting and moving parts alone.
bad,"There a temp service so they just get people in and out of there offices, as quick as possible. they do not care what your experience is. the just get you out there so they can make money."
bad,"Typical day was busy"
bad,"You work until they end your assignment or you get hired. They paid you the lowest amount. You don't get holiday pay, or vacation time. No healthcare."
bad,worked for 2 years in same place only made 2 dollars more never got hired through. They dont try to get u hires in they use you for your work skills to nake a profit off of the hard work you do and you get no applaud for your hard work.
bad,"Manpower is a temp agency. They in no way shape the environment of which one works. Their job is to find you work so they can get paid off of the work hours you perform. The opportunity of getting hired in the company you are placed depends on the persons own interests, work ethic, and behavior."
bad,"If you are on a Manpower contract, watch your back. The wages are shocking you can be sitting next to someone on a Bt contract on the double the wages. Bt staff tend to work 8-8 Monday to Friday. Whereas Manpower will be 7-11 Monday to Saturday. Management are brown nosed youngsters with no idea how to look after there team fairly. If your face doesn't fit they will find anything they can use against you with useless union staff. "
bad,I believe the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with people from all over the world including the employees I worked with. Hardest part was being on your feet for 9 hours.
bad,"Typical work day, very clean and tidy. They do not hire in much but it is perfect for people who need a quick job or a job or in-between position. I world recommend."
bad,They promise you that their assignment will be hiring you into the company after a few months but that never happens. They are horrible at communicating with you when you have to call in. They will pull you from a job instantly and tell you through email.
bad,"commis administratif, répétition des taches , travail d'usine"
bad,"You really cannot expect much from a staffing agency. They put me into an entry level position with a company that promptly went on strike. After the assignment ended there was no more work available. Getting in touch with my contact is impossible, as she is never in the office. It takes a day or two for my calls or emails to be returned. When you are looking for work, waiting a day or two just to talk with someone and get an update on the situation is torture. "
bad,Os funcionários são abandonados no clientes onde prestão serviço. Não há amparo para negociação do banco de horas.
bad,Shift was awkward and didnt really get to do what I was hired for. I ended up doing something in another department and was there for 6 months before they actually pulled me to do what I was hired for in the first place
bad,"I learned a lot of computer skills. I took part in recruiting temporary employees, as well as running background checks, and scheduling drug tests."
bad,"Good company in general. a Lot of competition among co-workers, bad management in certain branch's. Learned a lot. Challenging."
bad,"get laid off whenever the company doesnt need you"
bad,Temporary agency that sent me out on a very few assignments. Enjoyed the assignments sent to but when its over never hear from them again.
bad,They are not very fair when picking people for jobs. Ive learned there is not stability in temp services even when you are hired permenantly.
bad,Old school thinking for a new world was not working. Not understanding your market and reaching for this that are really there. Tough environment to work in. Calling people that don't have job for one reason or another and trusting them to go out there and do good work.
bad,"I enjoy my job as it brings its challenges everyday. I have decent co-workers and they do not mind helping. Changing out cable can become rather difficult as I have to change the ink that goes in the machine rather frequently. If I have any issue, I figure out the problem and find the solution as quickly as possible."
bad,this was a temp place didn't stay long found a full time job but other than that its ok will help u find jobs.. can't remember too much because like I said its a temp place that finds jobs
bad,"Ist kein guter Arbeitgeber , so nur aufs Geld aus vom Verleihbetrieb kein gutes Arbeitsklima  , keine unterstützung , keine Besuche beim Betrieb !"
bad,I wouldn't recommend this agency to my worst enemy. You are a number and they will use every trick they can to pay you less.
bad,"Build a workplace strategy and roadmap that drives innovation and productivity"
bad,Don't like this job much. My co-workers are good hard workers. Sorry I am not willing to say more.
bad,Its kind of monotonous work but its alright. Having weekends off is good.  Management is very kind and personable.  Nice overall experience.  Came into the job already having the necessary skills so i didnt need much training.  Good deal of freedom as long as you are productive and have minimal mistakes in your work.
bad,"id never work for them again,the company is disorganised not enough work and only phone you when nobody else available"
bad,Great place if in real need of a job fast. Temporary work. Companies abuse this service. They keep temps so as not to pay benefits. Manpower needs to makes sure that temps are hired or move them on to another job.
bad,"Ils n'écoutent pas leurs employés. Parfois ils ne regardent pas ce que vous avez pour la formation, avant qu'ils vous envoient à un chantier, qui parfois créé un mauvais environnement de travail. (Notez que ceci est mon opinion sur la Manpower en Suède en 2006 et que ça a peut-être changé depuis)"
bad,The job was really fun but very stressful and the swing shifts are extremely hard.
bad,"Manpower has become just a service for employers to exploit the workforce for temporary needs.Pay is minimal,with very few benefits."
bad,"Unhealthy, high turnover, poorly managed.  Likely has changed since i have left."
bad,"worked whole day without having Lunch"
bad,I had no trouble with manpower but once again the needs of the employees was barely met and the value of the employee was little in manpower's point of view.
bad,"The good thing about working for a temp agency, is that I learned a myriad of skills that could be useful elsewhere. I know that those skills worked because when I learned them, and sometimes not always in a calm situation, they worked--on the job."
bad,"12 hour shift typical day was manufacturing wafers, management micromanaged, co-workers were hard to deal with cause of language issue, the hardest part of my job was dealing with the management and co-workers and all the work dealt to you with no coverage or back up, there was no enjoyable part of the job it was basically just a job with no chance of advancement i would not recommend working here."
bad,"Worked for a company that had a third party payroll system. Started with them on a Tuesday by Friday still didn't have any info how to enter hours in the third party payroll system. Pay day came didn't have a check, they had to give me some of my check in a western union . Bby the the next week still didn't have info. Worked 12 hours after a holiday. They still didn't have info. Called the branch, the customer service line . Stated that they have to get the hours verified . By this time it has been two weeks going on three. It take them almost a month to get it verified by The company I was working for in Forest Park."
bad,"temp employment worked there for less then 90 days"
bad,No hay trbajo en equipo y no se aprende cosas nuevas del area que estudie
bad,Takes a long time to be hired on permanently. Overalll tey will put you in the right spot.
bad,"This was a temp job....there was no advancement anywhere.  This company is the worst company I have ever worked for, and that is from supervisors, office people and other employees.  I was a temporary employee"
bad,Worked for several different companies.  Enjoyed the flexibility of moving around.
bad,First temp job ever! Didn't realize how different employees treat temps.
bad,I learned how to use a sewing machine at this job. Most of my co-workers were great to work with because they was helpful. The hardest part of the job was working in 100 degrees heat or hotter in the summer time. The part I like the most was just learning to do different sewing jobs.
bad,"The only thing good about this job was the people i worked with, manpower itself is very unorganized, very rude, and would try to find any little excuse to fire you."
bad,In my 6 years I learned a lot about meeting client needs and being able to recruit to meet and exceed their expectations. I am hopeful this training and experience will take me forward to my next great adventure.
bad,"a typical day there is as I said like a yo-yo. The environment is like high shcool that people are constantly talking bad about someone else, everything you do is everyones busisness. Other than that the basic day there is just to try and get through the day without killing someone else."
bad,This job taught me to adapt to all different situations and work environments. It was temporary work but exposed me to a lot of high demanding jobs. It worked well for me until I found permanent work
bad,temporary agency with poor communication as well as poor management structure
bad,"Good place to learn how production works and there are always other job  opportunity in the department. The negative is Full-time workers does take advantage on the temps. If they don't like you, no matter how good of a worker you are, you definetly won't be back at the same job site because you're not permanent. Also when the job site shutdown for 3 months. Manpower Agency lets you know last minute, when you will be laid off. Once you laid off you on your own to find a job and wait if they call you back. On top of that, the agency is aware of the layoff for years and till this day they only care about filling the empty slots when needed and don't matter after is completed."
bad,"If your looking for a quick source of income I would suggest it. You generally start work the same week if they have an opening. Again, a great foot in the door for anyone."
bad,Move to pass them I can not believe how horrible they treated their employees no support at all. The best thing is to move to another agency that believes in their people
bad,Not a good place to work. Was wonderful in the beginning until the Vice President made himself manager and micromanaged every single second of the day.
bad,Do not go there. Was the worst temp place I worked for. Had problems with another manpower employee. Refused to find me something else. I would ask everyday.
bad,Gutted experienced people and replaced with offshore.  Too many VPs and not enough workers at HQ.  Good workers are overloaded and non-performers are not held accountable.
bad,"La proposition de cdi n'est absolument pas intéressante puisqu'il n'y a aucune chance d'augmentation de salaire due à une ancienneté puisque cette prime est inexistante pour un travail temporaire et la perte de salaire comparée à un travail intérimaire de base est considérable, il n'y a plus de prime de fin de mission. Autrement le travail en lui même ne varie absolument pas."
bad,"I worked as a temp along with 4 - 6 other people, the company we were working at did not ever consider hiring any of us on full time regular. I may have staying if I thought there was a chance of getting hired."
bad,"It is horrible and there is poor management, in addition to that, this has been five years of experience with the  company and I have to say that I have had enough."
bad,"Not enough people who have a work ethic.  Constant turnover as people either don't show up at client companies or walk off the job, then workers compensation issues."
bad,"most of manpower is temp jobs or short projects, not really for or against them. been placed at good and bad jobs.pay doesn't really match the jobs placed in though."
bad,"I left a full-time job for a temp job with Manpower and was fired after three months for a misunderstanding with a co-worker.  "
bad,"I worked under two manpower's clients. I did not work directly under them. The staffing agency irregardless of location has extreme poor management and are careless for it's employees. At the Manpower in Tampa location, the system to document proof of wage and it's follow up to correct errors are horrible. You will have difficulties getting compensated correctly and must have constant follow up to assure that you are receiving correct pay.  "
bad,"The employees here are rude, don't know how to talk to people, are always disgruntle and act like everyday is a terrible day, willing to underpay every employee for poor hours and work, would not wish this opportunity upon my worst enemy."
bad,i wouldnt work there again. the owner wants food costs and labor costs that are unreasonable. if you want to be a chef this isnt the place for you. you will have no menu input. and be fully micro managed as an executive chef. and i wont get into the atmosphere. ill just say it wasnt positive
bad,"This is great if you're looking for somewhere to get experience in a variety of light duty manufacturing jobs, but not if you are looking for something long term."
bad,"Applied for and requested FT, M-F, with possibility of permanent hire. Positions are sporadic and temporary. Not an advocate for the employee. Middle man for contracted companies."
bad,"they were good at getting a placement for me but I wouldn't go back to them for a job in the future, I have nothing else really to say about manpower. I dont want to use them to find a job. I feel like i was going to find a job that wasn't temporary"
bad,"They had very poor management, their managers did not know how to speak to people , and you werent treated very respectfully, the work on the other hand was very easy."
bad,"Empresa atrasava o salario e os benefícios , alem de não atender telefone , não responder emails enfim o funcionário ficava a mercê da má vontade deles."
bad,This is an ok place to work. The people can be friendly but do not get too comfortable. The job is based on the demand of the customer and when the volume drops so does the work demand. This leads to layoffs and other things. Management is not very good but can work with you on certain things depending on what it is.
bad,I worked quite a bit for Manpower until one particular company apparently submitted a bad review of my performance at their site.  I never got any assignments after that or an explanation.
bad,not so good this place got let go from nike. LOST my JOB!!! they never found another one for me. not to sure if i got paid for some jobs. I wouldnt rely on them. there are other companies that are better and have benefits as well
bad,"This place is all about turnover. They are always looking for the next person to get over on. The management doesn't even bother to learn your name so all you hear when you're needed is a whistle, snap or ""Hey you..."". Absolutely NOT a good place to be."
bad,Working through Manpower was a black hole. You know that you would never get a permanent position at the job they sent you too. When the company you worked for got to a certain number of days you would be terminated and be sent to the job.
bad,"The staffs at the New York City location are not well organized or well informed, as well as not being supportive towards their temp-employees/clients."
bad,How to enter and retrieve reports and type the correspondences for those reports. Arrange deaf services for appointments. Organized next day calendars for physicians and nurses.
bad,"I have work for Manpower  1990's on and off,I working long time assignments.  For two  years straight 40 hours a week, even sometime overtime.  And I have never gotten paid for Vacation time."
bad,Weekly pay but not permanent position.  Temp agency only.  They provided horrible benefits and the pay is very low.  They don't care about their employees.
bad,"Went through Manpower to apply for Walmart.com. It was a requirement to work as a temp with the potential of being hired on by Walmart.com as a full-time employee.  Manpower was not a horrible company to work for; however, they were not flexible with scheduling and, being a temp employee, no good benefits were offered."
bad,"Its a small town mentality and not very professional."
bad,manpower is a temp company that basically uses your resume to find temp work for you. Full time work is hard and not looked at as a positive outlook for the company
bad,The branch I worked out of was so out of sync with what needed to be done on a weekly basis.  So many failed attempts at contact with anybody from this office.  You would call one time and speak with a young lady who apparently forgot to tell anybody what was going on.  Call back again and get somebody different who was completely clueless.  Go to another staffing agency if you want work.
bad,Aucun suivie va bosser .....sur les deux dernières années je devait aller bosser à 35km aller et retour...en 2014 en cours de mission  ils ont oublié de revalider mes caces 1/3/5 étant en poste aux milles à Monier depuis 2 années.. mon contrat. À pris fin... depuis 2003 aucune évolution.la a70 km par jour sans frais de déplacement..ni prime ... à 43 ans je repars de zéro avec rien ...agence Aix pont de l'arc ce sont les pires des incompétentes chronique...
bad,You are bounced around in so many directions.  They tell you one thing and then go another.  Its hard to get information out of this company
bad,"Temporary assignment lasting only 4 months.  Assisted with Interviews, job placements and general Administrative duties."
bad,"in my opinion and experience , this is not a recruitment company but merely a labour broker for companies only prepared to pay lowest possible wages, I cannot recommend them."
bad,"Da necessidade surge a função, e e para esse efeito foi mais que produtiva a relação."
bad,This job was a temp job and I found it like a high school environment and the pay was not worth the amount of work you had to do.
bad,It is an ok place to work. you do not get alot of hours. you only get to work whenever they need you and there is much room for advancement.
bad,Learned how to run a tournament providing customer service to bowlers and general clean-up and it was a temporary assignment.
bad,"agréable ,direction et personnels gentils , salaire pour du ménage"
bad,Find another company to be a consultant with. They do not now what Master card management was doing. You were never told how well or what needed improving until the annual review. This is what it was when I worked for them. It could have improved since.
bad,OK place to work. Compensation is decent. Management not dependable. Not a structured work environment. I enjoyed helping people find jobs
bad,"Un día típico? recibiendo ordenes directas del personal de la empresa usuaria"
bad,"This company needs new leadership"
bad,"low paying wages, no job security, no real benefits or vacation time, temp companies just dangle the carrot on a stick for people with poor job options available. Even the decent factory jobs all use temp companies to keep the revolving door going. Temp companies invest NOTHING in the future of their workforce, and therefore build ZERO value in sustaining a productive and profitable workforce for American workers in the next generation"
bad,Assembly job. Treated like a child. Manpower very disorganized and slow to answer questions. Gave no reason for not being called back for next season work
bad,"Have no real concern about you, simply hire you and send you off. Quick employment but no benefits. Co-workers are all good, however there is a lot of workplace drama."
bad,I work with the most unstable group of people ever. Lots of promises are not kept by my current job assignment manager. Total lack of communication by management with employees.
bad,"Terrible employer, no interest in employee satisfaction. Constant changes to bonus or payschemes directly before the were due."
bad,The hardest part about working for a temp agency is leaving at the end of your assignment.  I found I really enjoyed my co-workers and when the assignment ended abruptly I was not only out of a job but lost friends as well.
bad,"I was hired as a test technician. Manpowers representative at EMC did not properly notify EMC's  management to my job title. I worked for over two months as an assembler before management was a where. How ever assembling was a good learning experience and did give me a better understanding of the computer servers. When I was laid off from Manpower they had only left me with a message on my answering machine stating I am no longer employed by them but I do have one more day on my contract if I so chose to come in for the last day. As a man of integrity, I did work my last day."
bad,"Manpower are poorly managed. Very unfair pay rates between BT staff and Manpower staff within the centre. Someone on a BT contract could be doing the same role as yourself, they would be on a rate of around £8-£10, while a manpower employee would be on £6.20/£6.50."
bad,"I wound up doing much of the work my manager should do as she was incompetent. The company was constantly hiring and firing from week to week. It was a lousy culture for IBM."
bad,They told me they would always have work for me.  After a 6 month short term assignment had to go onto unemployment for 6 months because they literally had no work.
bad,"As a contract employee working through Manpower, you will be paid much less for the work you do than if you were hired directly by the company."
bad,"travel around, fixing copiers all over london. Not much back up when needed,"
bad,good mangement to help find you jobs and also had a good inviroment to work
bad,"I was recruited for this position, and then I was told I would be working from home. I received 2 days of training, the rest had to be done on my own through Webinars and other parts were self taught. I had not worked a perm desk in 8 years and they knew it."
bad,"worked hard, tried harder, didn't really get along well with management, felt very uncomfortable working there stayed until laid off, needed a job."
bad,Work consisted of preparing stores for next business day by stocking shelves and cleaning work area after complete. Managers were rude 70% of the time. Checks were not deposited in a timely manner and assignments were not long enough. Co-workers were wonderful and worked together. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,Worked a few months there but got married and got pregnant and they laid me off without pay until I had the baby because of the chemicals.
bad,"Never know when you are going to work or get laid off. Enjoy the work and co-workers, just wish it was a stead full time job. There is no chance for advancements."
bad,"Working for Manpower is a soul destroying, the management only use you as if you are a wind up toy to bring out if needed, with no regard to the employees needs. Very poor planning skills."
bad,"The general place of a staffing agency is to find you work that you can do."
bad,"8am to 50pm,I learned,more about interacting with people,safty,management was very professional,my co-workers we're just the best.There is no hard part,working is great,the most enjoyable part of the job,when everyone help everyone,it makes this so much easier."
bad,"was temp, but received the office experience there, management took advantage of the temp help."
bad,"most of the time i couldnt get no work for weeks"
bad,okay while it lasted. never got a call back.  very temporary.
bad,"you are contracted out by companys "
bad,"Manpower initially contacts you for new temp positions in the beginning. You positions can be for 1 day fill-in for another employee, 3 weeks and sometimes a couple of months (nothing that could promise long-term permanent)."
bad,"Fun job , just wish the company had more to offer. It has a lot of job opprtunities."
bad,run various machines and inspect for quality and quanty.
bad,I had to work hard every day to reach taget
bad,"Stressful job working with the public over the telephone or via internet, minimal training, no advancement or option to be hired to a company position. Strict break policy as well as lunch, limited to go outside of the building during the day at lunch only, breaks must be taken inside, you had to ""badge out"" to exit the building. Short term employment with the ""option"" of a position within the company that is never offered."
bad,Hardest part is this was temporary work so you might not be there long.
bad,Co workers were very nice.
bad,I was not impressed by the management at this position. Very unprofessional and very rude.
bad,"takes awhile to hear back, not enough information about time lengths of a potential offer if you get it, decent salary"
bad,"Au CE aucun buget donc pas de places ciné etc. Pas de chèque vacances, ni rien du tout pour Noël... A éviter ! "
bad,Worked at Amway of factory and warehouse floors. Very hectic and stressful environment. Breaks were too short. Nothing was free. Had to rely on weekly job assignments and didn't have a choice of which department to work.
bad,Es una empresa que solo presta servicios no es como trabajar para la misma empresa tengo dos hijos uno ellos es especial por eso esa quisiera trabajar para una empresa reconocida
bad,"I had helpful coworkers who showed me the ropes, but the support by upper management was not felt as I expected.  I couldn't see myself with the company down the road because the motivation wasn't there."
bad,"Not consistent, nonresponsive, incompetent. Worst experience I've encountered with a staffing agency. Staff portrays an inconsiderate attitude toward employees who want to work."
bad,"Not very organized.  The recruiter that was working with me was very nice, encouraging and very supportive.  On my third day at the job I called her and ""she is no longer with the company"".  I was paid a dollar less then agreed upon.  It took over a month to correct a problem with getting my time sheet submitted online so I could get paid.  My background check and drug screen was conducted in a parking lot.  Needless to say I was not very impressed.  Assignment ended earlier then expected, not their fault, although when I called Manpower they had no idea what was going on. Every time I called the office I was dealing with a new person, never knew who I was going to speak to each time I called."
bad,"Terrible pay for the most part unless you work overtime every single week. The thing with overtime is if you work too much then all you will do is work. That is no way to live. Also the more important your job, the more stress is on you by management."
bad,"Lack of effective communication"
bad,"Was ""unassigned""from a position for showing up for work during regularly scheduled hours. Ridiculous when you go to Manpower rep.first with a dispute and get let go for NO GOOD REASON!! ."
bad,If you need to get ya money up real fact this is a good place for you. But they lay off often with at least a week before your placed on new assignment so everyone works like it’s their last week every week
bad,The company has no clear direction right now and is not keeping up with the market or competition. Some upper leadership have no skill for their roles.
bad,I was hired 2 times the second time this happened...I was hired to perform a job they provided me with training and at the end they just forgot to call me back for the job and I had to call back to check what had happened.  They said I had to wait they had me waiting almost 2 months to be placed in the job I was hired for.
bad,Almost no care as to whether or not the job works for you as long as it works for them. Overtime is usually mandatory and if you can't work it due to prior plans they pretty much tell you to work it or lose your job.
bad,No room for advancement or growth. Management team does not understand the work that goes into the job because they are all externally hired. No sense of security and terminations and layoffs were very common. There was no investment in resources and tools to do the job for employees and success was measured inappropriately.
bad,They have let their workers go and refuse to help find them jobs if any employer lets them go. It does not matter the reasoning that someone is let go. The worse was when a person was let go for being too pregnant or when someone had gotten in a car crash. Manpower gives no respect or cares about their employees.
bad,"I worked for Manpower inside a large retail distribution centre for ten hour shifts. I worked for six months and left after my contract was completed due to a recurring back injury I had previously sustained elsewhere. I repeatedly requested Manpower to replace me in a job closer to where I lived before I left but nothing was done afterwards about my situation. Although I have a bachelors degree and I had proved myself to Manpower during my employment with them, they never had any further opportunities for me except more long shift factory work which I couldn't accept. My back recovered over the months following."
bad,If you want to work with little to no management then this is the company for you. They don't return phone calls or emails. No chance for career advancement as most of their contracts expire
bad,"Wasn't the right fit for me. I did enjoy the people located at the manpower office in steubenville, ohio. But the jobs just weren't the jobs and pay that i was looking for/ needed to provide for my family of 6. Thanks to them though i was put on the right track and found other employment."
bad,"The people that you go to for support or help with your pay are just imbeciles, sometimes you don’t get paid one week and have no explanation or warning. Their employee handbook is also contradictory, it says that you can either be paid weekly or monthly however in the job role that I have done you are then told you can only do weekly  There is pretty much no benefit other than some sort of income. The money is awful and the amount of issues that people have had to deal with and no one at Manpower cares. Would highly recommend getting a job with a company or a different agency that at least pays you a lot more to put up with this."
bad,"I went to Manpower in good faith that Manpower would honor their word in paying the 100.00 bonus if hired on to the World's largest Retailer with their so-called state of the art headphones that fall apart easily or the fact the operating system crashes all the time causing delay in the high production expected. Not to mention if you really need to use the rest room your adherence they call it goes down. never late always early, gave over 100%, but was told they want 98% on everything. Expect too much work with the poor tools they supply."
bad,"La culture de l'intérim est devenu omniprésente ces dernières années, à tel point qu'on oublie même que les intérimaires sont des salariés comme les autres, mais en plus mal lotis car ils ne possèdent pas la sécurité de l'emploi."
bad,your best interest does not matter to the company this company is only a good idea to work at for necessity you will stay temporary if you are not well known
bad,Ladies are quite nice and helpful. But the company does not offer certain jobs for example Office Administration. This company like many other company in Reno only has warehouse
bad,The workplace culture of the jobs I was sent to were very stressful. I felt the people at manpower did not have my best interest at heart and experienced unfair treatment.
bad,"too far, most of the people there did not speak my language, they cancelled our bus that was meant to take us there from home and it was 40+ miles away, but they still paid to fly people in from Romania because they worked for less money, I was messed about constantly with my wages and I could never get hold of them, the managers didn't do their jobs properly."
bad,"Personally, I really, really didn't like working there.  The most of the bosses and co workers don't give you enough space.   Just wasn't no room for anything."
bad,"I didn't mind my time there however, they weren't very efficient in finding employment for me or many individuals. The staff and managers at times seemed to be annoyed."
bad,Complete lack of communication. Never got any feedback or opportunities even with calling in regularly. I have a lot of experience and was just completely ignored.
bad,"work days were 12 hours when I left i was in charge of doing change overs on machines for the different bags they make at SC Johnson also ensuring that I keep the machine stocked and running."
bad,"Most co workers were supportive and wanted to see you succeed within the company, weather you were temporary or having the opportunity to work full time"
bad,There's always a hidden dark side to the assignments that they give you.  The health insurance is awful and expensive.  Your local Manpower office is only there to fill seats and doesn't care about what happens to you after they provide you to the assigned employer.
bad,I will never work for manpower in my life because they was not paying good an when we got our check they would take 67 dollars out of every check we got
bad,"Would not refer a friend, the staff was always changing. Most of the jobs offered to me did not fit my skill level. The staff was hard to reach at times."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there. Management tells you one thing and then does something else...horrible experience! I enjoyed working with the public more than the staff!
bad,"I had an average experience with this company.  The pay for the jobs they offered me was somewhat low for my needs, though and they apparently did not have better paying options."
bad,"Okay it was a long time since I worked there. Different assignments that  lasted for different times. If you don't like the job, or not physically up to, you might be able to find another job. Sometimes there might be a long time between assignments, but sometimes you might be hired on full-time."
bad,"Ik kreeg een contract voor 3 maanden, echter opdrachtgever had na een week geen werk meer."
bad,This was my first time working with a temp company. I had to  make calls to them a lot of the times waiting on information. I really did not care for this at all. I did not feel like I was a priority with this company at all.
bad,"You are standing on ur feet for twelve hour straight in the heat,  plus u have to walk two miles just to get inside the building before 7:30.. Then u only get 2 15 min breaks for lunch ND by time u walked to the caffeteria u only had five left."
bad,their policy on attendance where horrible. not so much on the assignments to where they send out . But once ending no follow up to help or assign new assignment.
bad,"Good place to work as far as potential opportunities in major corporations. But don't get too comfortable, they can, and will, pull the rug out from under your feet at any moment without warning. The fine print you don't read, pretty much states this."
bad,Of the three jobs temp to hire positions they put me on only one hired anyone from manpower.  They were not honest about the prospective employers seeking full time laborers.
bad,Would not recommend this company as a place to work unless you absolutely need a job. Work place gets very stressful and policies are not clear.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people.  I am a back up lead and help build a culture on the shift. They then hire people that don't fit the culture and people that were here before but were fired. I learned to keep my head strong and just continue to work and get better at my craft. Management gives no incentives to work.
bad,"Gives a chance for those with no experience but it is very hard to progress. Managers play favorites so it would be difficult move up. Stability of the job is low-very metrics driven. If you are not performing well or not meeting lead expectations, you will be let go."
bad,It pays well but if you want a life outside of work then this isn't the place for you. Scheduling isn't bad but it interferes with social and even family life
bad,"Não souberam trabalhar, não se prepararam para tal evento que foi a olimpiada."
bad,Overly selective in certain aspects and a bit too judge mental unsure if scales tilt fairly always in picks.Very good pretenders in caring for employees needs.
bad,"Support HR management in job placement of employees. Maintain files, answer phones. I enjoyed helping people complete resumes. Overall working for this company was okay, but no room for advancement."
bad,Morale is low because you aren't able to speak or message colleagues.  Feels like you are constantly being watched.  Not enough work to spread out amongst employees.
bad,"The work force is unstable and unpredictable. There was easy hours to work, but was not a permanent job to work for. I will not be working for manpower again."
bad,Certainement plus avantageux pour l'entreprise utilisatrice que pour l'intérimaire mis à disposition
bad,"Foi minha primeira experiência profissional e apesar do curto período em que fiquei, aprendi muito sobre processos seletivos e aplicação de testes específicos para R&S."
bad,"ive only been contracted by manpower for two months but have been at my assignment (caterpillar) for almost 2 years through 2 other agencies( first option, aerotek) the only thing I liked about manpower management is that they let us know that our assignment at caterpillar was not going to convert us full time. Caterpillar is a terrible company to work for"
bad,I work as a staffing specialist. What I am required to do changes often.  The good thing is I work with some really nice people.  I enjoy helping our candidates find employment The upper management is very disorganized. Regional manager is incredibly hard to please.
bad,"Worked for a company that is okay but the outsource work , Can never be smarter or more productive than the people in charge .  Instant to find a way to fire you ."
bad,Muy atentos en poder capacitar a su personal para poder trabajar en un ambiente tranquilo y muy estable para cada persona a la que contrata
bad,I was hired at Manpower to work in the call center payroll department.  This was a part-time job working 30 hours a week.  The training I received was unorganized.  I was in training with 16 other people who struggle to understand the process. My first day on the phones was terrible.  I wasnt trained properly to deal with the type of phone calls I received.  I would ask for help from the managers but the would direct me back to the training material.  The manager and team leaders were not helpful or friendly.
bad,I was promised a 40 hr week and have not got one yet.  When I asked for another assignment I was told to just keep calling the hotline.  The hot line is how we know if there is work for you that day.  Can't make any kind of plans.
bad,"Um dia tipio no trabalho"
bad,"You need a break into IT support industry then Manpower is the best option however you get paid accordingly. Different accounts, many contract jobs and chance to gain some valuable experience."
bad,"As many times as I have interacted with them, they still act like they do not know who I am. I understand that they have a few hundred employees, but continuously asking me to do a job that I am not physically capable to do after I have stated this several times and it is noted on my employee record, does not make the company look good. "
bad,"A typical day a work was good. I learned a lot from the job, I learned how to weld nuts to parts for a car. It was a great experience for this job. The management was slow they came and left and leave us there until our shift ends. My co-workers were a lot of fun talking to them and getting to know everyone while we were working. I think the hardest part of the job is when the sparks putting holes in my clothes and I was afraid that a spark was going to hit me in the eye, with eye protection on. I believe the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers and all of us helping each"
bad,Very unorganized company. It seems if you have an issue they just send you to someone else instead of dealing with it themselves.
bad,"8 to 5pm "
bad,"Los dias normales son de contactacion aprox. a 200 clientes en una jornada de 6 horas/dia. Mis compañeros exelente ambiente laboral, lo mas facil la prospeccion telefonica, lo mas complicado el acoso telefonico de algunos clientes. Mi supervisor muy accesible con mucho empuje,"
bad,"Like working inside of a 5 gallon gas can. The chemicals might meet EPA standards, but there is not an efficient amount of exhaust to eliminate danger to one's health. There was no way I could have stayed at that job. employees were not even required to wear masks, let alone any other protective shielding and/or clothing."
bad,I twisted my ankle at home and for 6 weeks while off work I was lead to belive that I was going back to work and the day my doctor gave the go ahead to work manpower calls me and tells me not to report to work.
bad,Worked here for a while and it's the worst ever. They really could not care less about you and are not supportive at all. Poor salary aswell
bad,it was ok but had to keep chaseing up my pay as it was never in on payday and there were shifts missing
bad,I loved it. I was able to meet and help out a lot of people. I also learned a lot. I am truly grateful for the opportunity
bad,Raises are very rare and once you reach a certain level you cannot get another raise.
bad,"terrible experience with manpower, didnt know who to get clarity on training. BT very daunting, very poor company and have the cheek to ad for minimum wage. Job security is awful too, constant pressure even though is inbound calls"
bad,"This job was so humdrum I couldn't stand it, but I needed to work to take care of my daughter."
bad,"No room for growth, the branch of Manpower I was at just wanted to JUST find temps there was no hopes to ever be a fulltime employee"
bad,was a machinist for a company that was unorganized and didn't have the proper tooling or proper programming or programmers. my job was to set up and run a 5 axis snk with i30 funuc controls make edits as needed
bad,placed in different companies for a temporary service for a few weeks .. not great pay
bad,Manpower was ok place to work. But not for me. the pay was not that good and there was no benefits.
bad,"Manpower called me promising me a factory job at $12 an hour through them. I went into the local office, signed up with the agency, only for them to tell me the only thing they had available was a job for $8 stacking pallets in a rundown warehouse I had never even heard of that was 25 miles away. I took the job, seeing as if I didn't they wouldn't have worked with me any longer."
bad,"8 to 10 hour shifts. learn to stand for long periods of time. a typical day was to stay at your station and meet your production quota. Learn how to properly print , label , and package your finished product. co - workers keep to themselves and stay busy."
bad,"Moral shattering work environment with poor management, long hours, no respect for family life balance."
bad,"No day typical. 3 different work places. 1. peeling pears, apples or capsicums in production line. 2. desk hand at printing firm."
bad,"Non professional management  , no possibility for advancement , the promotions and advancement are not based on efficiency or hard working , simply they promotes according to their own standards which far a way from the known standards."
bad,"They don't get enough work, I honestly don't understand how their particular agency is still in business. "
bad,They do there best to find work but you can go months at a time to only work maybe a week and when they find nothing they throw you towards Speilos production line work and the management at Speilo treats you with disrespect and would terminate your contract if you sneezed the wrong way and once that happens manpower doesnt seem to go out of there way to find you work. I will say pay was descent and my agent lead manager was helpful within her power of course.
bad,My shifts were set out each week and my job whilst with Manpower had the possiblities for advancement but for the majority of people it was practically impossible. I felt that I learned new skills whilst working for them such as dealing with many complaints and how to advice customers so that they felt there query had been dealt with. I worked with some many nice people in my team although felt the overall company was badly manged as well as the manpower office.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the general public.
bad,Company they are supplying workers for changes daily procedures and work schedules often without communication on what is expected. One example of the inefficiency of the system employed was a forklift that we were using for a year and a half that couldn't reach parts needed on the top section of pallet racks.
bad,I learned that working for a temp. service is not a good option for me . The work was to unstable as far as how long and where you will be working
bad,"They're not in it for the employee at all, they're looking for the $$$ that's it. No chance to advance and quick to write someone up. I've learned that these people are not the people you want to work for."
bad,I have been with Manpower for approximately 14 months and was converted by IBM from a permanent employee to a temporary employee due to offshore outsourcing. I am still contracted to IBM through Manpower while doing the same job I did as a permanent employee.
bad,work from 4 am to 4:30 pm.
bad,Nice office staff. Genuinely tried to help find appropriate work
bad,Needs to improve on job referrals to clients. Be more understanding whenever an illness may occur.
bad,"Benefits are almost none existent, pay could be a lot better, depending on who your adviser is, you about have to twist their arms to find you something. If you are in dire need of anything, they would be a good start point, but I would continue looking for jobs while working for them, because depending on where they place you, work orders don't come your way very often, and if the assignment is over, good luck getting them to find you more. If you do find full time employment through them, be thankful, and count yourself as one of the lucky ones."
bad,"its only a stepping stone if you have no income , it can get you in the door of a good company. they made promises they didn't keep. this is a temporary service . make plans to find a permanent job thru this company."
bad,They fill positions for companies that are known to mistreat their temps. And when an attempt is made to address issues you are dismissed and told not to return to your assignment.  I say H-E double hockey sticks No to working for Manpower aka slave power!!!
bad,"Different work assignments, always learning something new. Hardest part of the job is waiting for the next assignment and hoping to find some consistency."
bad,We had to call in to manpower to tell them what was going on. They had a management change at manpower . They did not let us know. They tols us about another position once our contract ended . Have not heard from them since
bad,"Nicht wieder, sehr lange Wartezeit innerhalb des Unternehmens"
bad,"Numbers numbers numbers. If you have 1 good day, it seems to be wiped out quickly by the first not-so-good day. Extremely a ""what have you done for me lately"" environment. Constant high pressure. Lots of times I was told by a colleague who knew I needed to improve my performance that ""it's not about numbers"". I knew all along that it is EXACTLY about numbers, which creates the ethical dilemma of rushing someone through the process vs. finding the right fit. Many times we would set someone up to fail. Very tough on the conscience. I was actually relieved when I walked out the door on my last day there."
bad,"Small work area"
bad,"*Assembly line. Rotate to different positions every 2 hours. Basic list of types of assembly..."
bad,"It's a temp agency, with a little luck you might get a good assignment, and with a little hard work you might get hired on by that employer. Temp jobs are good if you need work right away or are in between jobs."
bad,"I did not enjoy the job. Some weeks there is alot of overtime but "
bad,"No room for advancement, only temporary jobs. Would say the jobs are permanent an much room for advancement, all jobs they had sent me to were low paying, schedules not accurate, an one place was getting ready to lay off the temps"
bad,"You work 12 hour rotating shifts, usually on your feet, heavy lifting, working around dangerous equipment.  There are no benefits.  It is either too hot or too cold and you get very few breaks."
bad,"head ache. no overtime pay, peopl are nice, the pay though is low compared to the company. no sick days. and calling is confusing. plus you jus show up and wing it hope to find where your going"
bad,"I didn’t like working here at all, it seems like you’re being monitored at all times and the supervisors were nice but manager was not understanding. Workplace was good though if you want to just work without any interaction"
bad,"Inizialmente era stato detto che loro avrebbero fatto un piccolo contratto di 2 settimane per poi fare un inserimento immediato in azienda. Dopo 3 mesi avevo contratto di una settimana per volta, al massimo due. Nel quale ovviamente non ho maturato ferie, permessi e Tfr. Ti tengono molto sul filo di un rasoio potrebbero non chiamarti più da un momento all'altro per non rinnovare il contratto. Dopo l'arrivo del decreto dignità hanno fatto e rifatto il contratto per tutelarsi. L'unica cosa Positiva è che sono puntuali nel pagamento. Ma trovo ridicolo che si finisce nella loro lista nera se per motivi reali non vuoi/puoi proseguire il lavoro. Purtroppo tutte le agenzie interinali sono così, non c'è da meravigliarsi."
bad,"You have to consistently contact them on other job oppurtunity. They some times don't return your calls, via emails and some times text messages. Slow to advance at some employers."
bad,"I provided admin support to execs and paid low with no benefits. They offer health insurance but it is so bad and expensive its not worth it. They pay you for a holiday after you complete an amount of hours and work day before and day after the holiday. Otherwise you have no increases in salary which is so low you cannot live on your own, I have a wonderful manager so I'm fortunate but that's the only bright spot in this job."
bad,I was told that i will be having my job back after FMLA when i came back it was gone.  I worked as Clerk and to input the info in the system for Dept of Children and Families.
bad,"n/a different work sites, temporary staffing agency. The work sites were far but it was exhausting work. Management was 50/50, the paid on time every thursday."
bad,"There are many subsidiaries with this company but ManpowerGroup is the worst. Layoffs are conducted every six to nine month. No job security!!!"
bad,"Ich habe mehrere monate über manpower gearbeitet"
bad,"Neochota přeřadit po určité zkušenosti na jiné místo,okamžité zrušení smlouvy ve zkušební době po 2 nedostatcích"
bad,"I don't recommend anyone, especially people of color, to work for Manpower. I believe they are biased in their hiring practices And when it was time for another assignment, they failed to send me, a black male, ot on one, I noticed, however, that white employee sent out on assignments all the time."
bad,"Worked a variety of jobs.  I was assigned for the car auction.  It was one day per week.  Could not live on that 8 hour job, so kept asking for other jobs"
bad,"A good agency before August 2016. After, not a good experience due to  a turn over in staffing at the agency. A former ""employer"" through Manpower called me directly to see if I was available for a temp assignment because they had called Manpower multiple times to see if I was available.I made repeated phone calls  and finally asked to speak with the office manager. before I was able to be placed at the assignment."
bad,"ottima l'ultima collocazione trovata grazie a Manpower. Azienda ben strutturata, gestione perfetta."
bad,messed up paycheck many times. will switch you around from place to place to prevent you from getting hired. no benefits. the medical is horrible . and seriously underpaid . only thing that is good about these guys is if you get into a pharma company through them its good experience. other than that they will rip you off and offer you nothing
bad,Manpower is a very prejudice place.  They give the good jobs to people that they know and are not helpful in finding work for other people of color.  The are very slow with finding you work.
bad,"I did many different things at manpower, so each day was different. They had so many jobs that i was able to work so the variety was a great thing that was brought the table"
bad,would not recommend working for manpower. they make a lot of money off employees who work very hard side by side of associates making twice as much. no opportunity for advancement and no raises.
bad,Foi uma experiência muito interessante e rica. Porém a organização da empresa e comunicação interna deixaram muito a desejar. Tive problemas (por falta de comunicação interna) desde a contratação até o término do contrato temporário.
bad,I feel this company has a lot of things that need to be worked on. In the location I was at with this company seemed like a lot of favoritism with the locals.
bad,"Temporary On-Call Employment"
bad,Mail Handler it was a very fact paced job and I didn't care for it at all. the people wasn't very nice or kind. and they didn't care about us and that was sad.
bad,They required a lot of hours before i was able to be hired on full-time. I had many problems with my check being correct and the staff was not helpful. The staff had an attitude every time I called.
bad,I was able to get some jobs through this company but I was not able to get hired. They only kept their employees at one place only long enough to get some money then would move you. Also when I had left and decided to come back I was talked to like a idiot. And communication was really rocky.
bad,"Era um trabalho bastante cansativo. A questão de ter 4 horas de trabalho no contrato e trabalhar sempre, no mínimo, o dobro era complicado. A questão de ter folgas aos fins de semana e trabalhar todos os sábados e muitas vezes os domingos também complicava."
bad,"The jobs they send you to tend to lay people off or fire them without warning and sometimes they will fire you claiming you are responsible even if you did the job and had good attendance."
bad,I'm not going to be extremely thorough of this company because they are a temporary agency. Although they promote the idea of temp to hire  I found that a bit hard to believe with both of my assignments. I put fourth great effort and had a  positive attitude through out both assignments but was ever offered a full position with either company unfortunately.
bad,Manpower was a wonderful experience. The but it not for me I love to move around and not stand in one spot. I met some friendly people. I enjoy their company.
bad,"This is a staffing agency so no expectation of job security."
bad,"Manpower grossly misleads you about: What the job duties are, amount to be paid, hours per week your going to work,etc..."
bad,"Manpower in the beginning does great with training and motivation for new candidates. The leads and co-workers help with teaching you how to perform well, they offer tutorials, web classes to help you eventually get certified as a Sourcer and Recruiter."
bad,"Sin oportunidades de crecimiento, decisiones arbitrarias de la administración, modificaciones a los contratos sin previo aviso."
bad,"Always in a state of transformation, never settled. Minimum work/life balance, was required to travel 80% of weekdays. Poor leadership at the VP/SVP levels."
bad,"Average staffing agency, able to make up time lost from work. The hardest part of the job was the call center aspect. It was enjoyable only wished it was a direct hire to be able to get health benefits"
bad,"Any good paying jobs didn't last more than a week."
bad,"I enjoyed working through this company however it is a temp agency and work is not stable. always had a different job assignment, as soon as you get used to one job your assignment ends. communication  between agency and employee not great."
bad,I really didn't enjoy the assignment it was a call center position so there was a constant ringing of the phone with people calling about consumer issues. It was awful.
bad,"I worked with Manpower very little with the placement I received from them.  However, when I worked with them, they were supportive and would ""go to bat"" for me when I needed help."
bad,the temp work was only temprary till i could find a good full time job i need something that is good pay and i can pay bills and afford food for my family. if the job can't use you anymore then you are out on a job and no work. a temp agency is for like college kids or students just getting out of high school. its not the place for a married man with a family.
bad,Liked my job but on and off work and real hard to get hired on. Co-workers great management not so good even when you work real hard and there every day still would get cut that means they have no work. they would have people there that have missed work.
bad,"A typical day would consist of people constantly gossiping about each other behind employees' backs. This was an extremely pessimistic environment that left employees gloomy and anxious to leave at the end of the night. In order to have a stable and functional environment, the supervisors and leaders had to ensure that they themselves knew what was required. The facility wasn't well structured due to the supervisors and floor leaders' inability to supervise properly. Several co-workers were friendly and dedicated to their jobs, while others weren't. Some employees would waste time talking to supervisors and floor leaders about irrelevant things in order to decrease the amount of work that they do. The hardest past working here would have been the strict demands placed on the workers."
bad,"Don't believe the lies your told on your induction and certainly don't bother joining the union who will actually go against ya if your agency even if your a member to help the permanent staff. The management couldn't care less if your genuinely Ill , or late or can't do the job, your just a number who can be replaced. Can't book ya hols when ya want if at all (in fact the union will insist that the permanent staff get there's booked first) and don't believe that you can apply for internal jobs like they tell ya at your induction, you can't, a idiot with a full contract will get a skilled job before a genius on the agency, you will get no backup from manpower (as I said your replaceable) and no job security, they will move you around or change your shifts at will regardless of whether it suites you (as I said your replaceable).  On the plus point the monies great but is it worth it? I thought not after 8 months I took a 110% drop in wages left but got my life back."
bad,"Really was not happy here, seemed to be total chaos in the office at all times.  The not being able to supply a doctor note for an excused absence was crazy.   Really?"
bad,"Moja oceana w tej firmie jest dobra , mozliwosc awansu ,dobre zarobki, zetelni pracownicy,"
bad,"Working for Manpower was one of the worst decisions I had made and even though the pay was good I still would not go back. In a typical day we were told to reach a quota which they would increase constantly. They did not care for their workers and would lead OSHA inspectors around the problem areas of the production. I was injured once where i sliced a vein and when I asked for some basic medical assistance I was told they only had band aids, not even any medicine. I had to cut my own sleeve off to tie up my injury to prevent more blood loss. When I approached the safety department to alert them to my injury, i was told I could either get back to work or take 3 weeks off with no pay. My coworkers were the absolute best part of the job. I met some very good people there and we all got along very well."
bad,"I had a great time working at HP! For the most part, i was treated very well. "
bad,"While working for manpower it was good money but i had concerns with my supervisor having issues with me over another manpower employee he was having l relations  with and got pregnant twice .i recieved my application from jonhson controls inc in Northwood ohio all for him to place an unwarranted hold on it and hire everyone else around me,i told manpower about his diaplaced feelings and my contact amy nickel told me to stick around he is actually a good guy,i then was fired a few weeks later under falsehood of sleeping that was backed by the other supervisor whom said he questioned 8 people on my line all of whom ive sppken with and said they werent questioned. Needless to say i still have NOT received notice of job termination nor a call returned from manpower i went to their toledo office also and still nothing .I liked manpower until thwy did not back me when it mattered and i wasnt in the wrong ."
bad,"When a customer curses at you, you WILL NOT hang up. If you do, automatic termination. Bad pay for such a demanding job."
bad,"Not only are your hours not guaranteed, the locations usually consist of the most mind numbing, repetitive and backbreaking work you could ever find. Then, at the risk of your knee cartilage, you're usually in a place that pays 8.00 an hour."
bad,very very impersonal company.  will not back you up.  do not follow their own policies.  not well organized.  very difficult to reach supervisors on week-end while working for them.  calls unanswered and not returned.
bad,The company was not the greatest job security was always a worry there. very much enjoyed the people and place I worked at but the management was terrible. the people in the office had no clue what was going on and there for they sent people into an environment with little knowledge of what was going on.
bad,Everyday was walking into a work environment that was loud and full of noxious rubber and plastic fumes because the building was very poorly ventilated.  I learned how to operate different types of injection molds. Management was severely lacking because I witnessed many people not doing their job and management would do nothing to correct the problem. The most difficult part of the job was the production that was expected on a daily basis was not feasible with machines that were constantly being fixed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I could work at my own pace.
bad,"Manpower got me a job quickly, but the hours were none existent after my first two weeks or so, and even then the only hours I would get is from getting called in to fill for someone about 10mins before work would start. "
bad,They help you get a job then if they job doesn't keep you you never hear from them again
bad,"Manpower is a temp agency and I was placed working at IBM in Boulder. IBM was a great place to work at. The coworkers were very friendly and helpful in learning new jobs. It was always a new learning experience daily. There was room for growth and"
bad,"The jobs they had available were far and few between. "
bad,"Never know what I will be doing or where I will be working."
bad,"20+ years ago I was placed with a company through Manpower Temp and wound up a permanent employee who grew within the company until they closed their doors.  When Manpower approached me about a position, I was hesitant because it was an 80% paycut but I figured I had nothing to lose and it might lead to a great opportunity."
bad,"plusieurs postes a mon actif"
bad,You always got your hours and overtime but when its no work you lose pay.
bad,Being a temp to hire is one of the worst things companies started doing. It basically requires the employee and employer not to have any loyalty to one another what so ever.
bad,"I was pleased to be hired quickly with Manpower, but when my first contract ended, I had no notice. I was called and the representative told me my contract was done and they would let me know if another contract came up. I was never contacted again"
bad,12 hour shifts standing on feet all day. standing processing mail and boxing it. pallet jack used to pull pallet when full. 
bad,"I was contacted by Manpower to work as a dissassembly Mechanic.  They required long hours and were not understanding if I needed a day off to care for my son.  Laid me off within 2 months of starting work, with not much reason given.  Tried to deny my unemployment claim and locked my account information so I could not access it."
bad,"Machine Operator , Administrative Assistant, Packer and inspector. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be a lot of standing and working on projects such as updating, upgrading, and repairing tablets. Management really wasn't all that organized at the job and almost everyday they made changes to try to do project better. The managers were going day by day, trying to figure out themselves what was the best way to tackle the project."
bad,"I was repeatedly promised five shifts a week by Manpower, but I've been working one or two on average. I had to sign back on to JSA with up to 16 hours work per week but, since I rarely earn more in a week than JSA pays and your wages are deducted from your benefits, I am effectively working for nothing as I still get the same £71 per week whether I work or not. This is extremely disheartening."
bad,"There is not accountabiliy in the compnay. Even after repeated mails, there is no reply. Declarations are not taken into account for tax calc"
bad,We worked fast pace shipping. we shipped over a million dollars a day. One thing I learned is that you have to be able to muilti task to move up in a company. I get along with all wlaks of life and had a great experinaces with managment and all staff.
bad,This is a temp agency in Maine.
bad,"Es recomendable solo si no tienes otro trabajo, es un trabajo de paso."
bad,"12 hour shifts, 3 days on, and 3 days off. I learned how to perform a few transactions in SAP, how to be a safer forklift operator, and how to safely clear a jam and ready a pallatiser for continued operation. The on site managers were helpful. The co-workers that were there when I arrived were helpful, and good at their job. The hardest part of the job was keeping the pallatisers running. Working with a crew that worked well together is the best part of the job."
bad,"Manpower was contracted with Eaton corp. The Eaton supervisor was good to work with, as well as the Manpower supervisor. I could not plan on being with Manpower long term."
bad,"Job has a high turn over rate, has gone down the whole since it was teletech and it was bad then. has ok pay and not so great benefits, work schedule some times requires overtime without notice and is hard to get out of"
bad,management was good but no job security. they could let u go in 4 hours.
bad,A typical day at Dana would consist of the preparation of loads to ship to the customer. I work with all departments of the plant. This would include machining and production. I work well with my co-workers. It is a team atmosphere that is needed to accomplish daily goals. The hardest part of the job is being pulled in different directions that may take away from shipping and not having the components necessary to build the product. The most enjoyable part of my job is accomplishing goals that were set forth at the beginning of the shift.
bad,"the companies that manpower sends their employees to do not care about people in general. People get treated like they are expendable, even if they do nothing wrong."
bad,"12 hours of extreme heat, truck and forklift fumes, harsh breathing conditions, and various insect encounters both poisonous and non poisonous."
bad,I've been working with Manpower since 2006.
bad,"productive place to work. friendly staff, good work environment"
bad,"Manpower is great for those who need a job while they are in between jobs. I was placed quickly, and there is very little interactions between Manpower and myself while I am contracted to a company. The biggest problem is payment. Paydays are supposed to be on Fridays, but it is not uncommon for the check to arrive several days late."
bad,"Es ist ok "
bad,"l'ambiance est assez triste beaucoup trop guindé."
bad,"Just an OK company, As employees are not treated all that well and told to get the job done no matter how many hours they have to work to get the job done… Especially as a contact recruiter; You were treated like a second-class citizen as a contractor and like your personal needs are of little value."
bad,"I don't have much more to say the job was great.  I had a good experience,  i learned alot in the role.  I found a better opportunity that made more money"
bad,First-shift supervisors like to not inform the second-shift supervisors that there will be no orders for the day. That leads to thirty people coming into work only to be told that there are no orders. They will either clean the building again/re-tape the floor sections again/or half of them being sent home after most-likely having driven through the usual Michigan snow/snowstorm to get there. You will not be technically hired until you have worked for a full year due to you most-likely having gone through a temp agency; after that you will go through a 90-day probationary period where you can now be eligible for health insurance. This place is a meat-grinder on top of being an At-Will company in an At-Will state.
bad,Not Too Hard But Not Too Easy Just Depending On Where You Are Placed . Very Okay Company . Very Nice People . They Are Very Understandable && Will Work With You .
bad,Position was temporary. Getting a full time position was almost impossible. The pay was too  low and alot of temporary employees were not offered full-time position
bad,"Supervisors tell you your going to be at your placement for 3 months however can not give you an exact date when the contract is going to end.  We were let go abruptly on a day that we thought was a regular day.  They had it all planned and did not give us a warning.  Everyone thought they would be there until the end of May.  I would often ask the supervisor when will our last day be and she or he would state, "" We don't know at this time"".  But they did.  They said "" Okay today is your last day thank you for your time"". with no on warning."
bad,"No it was not a very joyful time working for them, because you did not know really when you worked and when you did not work.  You could be there for one day or for one week, or a month."
bad,det va en rolig tid.men jag skulle inte rekomendera detta företag för andra.
bad,"Temp employment.  I worked at Unilever in st albans. Too far for me to travel."
bad,"They only cater to certain people and do not look at both sides of situations. Loved the job I had with them though. Your concerns never interested them and they did not want to correct manager and employee relationships."
bad,Ambiente giovane ma senza prospettive e sotto pagati
bad,Got let go from job to be told to call the office monday. Only to call on monday morning and get answer from no one in the office. And come to the realization of there not giving me another job.
bad,"I was told I'd be doing manual labor, and I did, for a week here and there, but they mainly had me in call centers. I prefer to work outside, with my hands."
bad,if you working assembly you have no life its nothing for you get educated and move forward in life if you want to be at a standstill stay at kohler engine
bad,They make promises and don't keep them. I later found out I would be layed off when they said it would be year around. I will never go through them again
bad,Srednia ocena opinii nie doszło do pracy w niej przez ograniczenia zdrowotne nie wszędzie mogę pracować produkcja wzbroniona okej przez ograniczenia nie dopuszczono i rozmowy do pracy w niej co do atmosfery to nie wiem jaka jest
bad,Jobs where rather simple with no hope of expanding or growing within any of the companies or roles. Unsure of management as they didn't seem to deal much with actual employees
bad,They’ve rarely had work for me. And you’re blocked from being hired on until you’ve had 520 work hours. Some type of scam to me... especially when u can’t provide consistent work.
bad,Worked at Byrne Dairy doing tasks of making ice cream cookies and bake cookies in oven. Also did construction at the Hilton Hotel on Buckley Rd. Also did construction at Destiny USA for the hotel being built there.
bad,I worked at Man Power as a job filler for income nothing permanent just a quick job till I got a full time job somewhere. I would recommend you work part time and go to school.
bad,"Was working as a temporary staff not enough hours. They company will always send temps staff home when there work is done. We as a temps staff,  get pay less than the regular staff."
bad,Being a mobile employee was the best part of the job. Working hours were set and the client provided the laptop. Communication with the client was mostly done through internal instant messaging and email. Little to no face-to-face interaction unless virtual conferencing. Enjoyed supporting clients.
bad,been over 10 years and I was a kid went I work for Manpower. they ware a good agency at the time. that not pay will but help people get a job and the work experience.
bad,dont really try to get you to branch out and better your self or your skills but if you need a job fast this is the place to go but dont except to make money bc you wont
bad,ManPower nicht gut bezahlt und es gab kein Urlaubs geld
bad,"The job I am assigned to is very boring and hurts my hands. Some of the car rims are very heavy and some of the people there are very weird at times but I don't know if that is due to the 10 hour schedule we are on which is from 4:30 am to 2:30 pm or they are just weird by themselves. The breaks are way too short! Like the first one is at 6:30, the second one is at 8:30, lunch is at 10:30, and the last one is at 12:30. Each 10 minutes long accept for lunch which is 20 minutes. Working overtime seems to be mandatory and not volunteering.   I was told that I would be working 10 hours for two weeks and then I would be on 8 hours but here I am still on 10 hours my fourth week! Only come here if you are old, inexperienced, have low skills, have criminal records, no education, or desperate!"
bad,"Il y a toujours des soucis par rapport au heures et au journée de travail et a la paye de fin de mois. "
bad,"Typical agency call centre work, no rights, no sick pay. Expectation is high for staff to perform, plenty of training given but some managers/coaches not really cut out for the job role. Potential to earn good money with bonuses"
bad,"Mundane work. Latterly poor scheduling and parts delivery caused too much driving, instead of working. colleagues not inspiring. morale poor. management not inspiring. \pleasant to deal with customers."
bad,Débutante en tant qu’intérimaire j’ai constaté  qui nous explique mal et parfois qui demander à d’autres intérimaires de nous former pas de tuteur référent pour les personnes en début de formation.
bad,"This was an assembly position where from a designated work station, I pulled parts  from motors, gear tooths, shaft, bearings, and housing units for a work order using a forklift and overhead hoist, to assemble base on schematics from beginning to finish,clients various size environmental monster muffins."
bad,manpower is a staffing agency that gets you to a company whether it be full time or partime depending what your proffession would be they put me with a wireless company as a mail clerk with good pay
bad,It's a temp service overkill on drug testing that's a waste of time and money..ie.  look how long it takes for the pothead to complete the computer based testing thing ..which is a waste of time.   Spent most of my time on it waiting on the computer and staff  ..I felt like my IQ dropped during that experience.   20 minutes that's how long it should take but no it's drawn out.  Now ..staff coordinator this is how it should go..especially if you haven't ever done the work you are assigning.!! 1. Don't talk like you have or pretend you have (you sound dumb telling people the pen is blue when it actually neon orange survey paint in a can) 2. Just assigne by the stupid (meter) computer test results finish the paper work and sit behind the desk answer phone (optional)  and hold your body. (Temp)a ture roughly in the 90's. .  Thank you.  Other than that.   Solid work assignments no pay issues (my experience) overall good place just . Maybe  a little better pay and higher moral would complete the package.  Just saying.  And I  never met the CEO of manpower..so I can't approve someone I've never met... see (that's a  dumb question.)  MHH!
bad,"Horrible treatment from the company itself. You feel completely uncovered and unprotected by Manpower. "
bad,"Manpower is a temp agency that help you find good paying temp jobs, there are possibilities that you could get hired on but you have to have no tardys or absences"
bad,"First thing we were told was that the average recruiter will only last about 1 year working here. Loved the team, management was awful. Corporate continuously made changes and wanted to see high number results, but never came out to understand the hiring crisis our area was in."
bad,"Great company in theory however, too big and too many excess managerial titles instead of focusing on true culture development and transformation. Would be better if there was a focus on human capital advocacy."
bad,"worked temporarily for them and was placed at low paced jobs, well below my experience level.  I was placed in different positions that had no chance of becoming a permanent position."
bad,No physical workplace at Manpower-temp service. Hard work did not pay off. Management was unfair in hiring. Workplace was diverse. Te uncertainty of work was hard. Being provided a job was pleasing.
bad,De très bonne mission sérieux profesionalisme . Très bonne réaction
bad,mmionoinonojnojnoinoinoinononioniononioioiiooinoinio
bad,That was the introduction to the professional life. I had to adapt fast to the different businesses I was hired for. It was challenging and full of learings.
bad,"Don't have much to say about it because all there jobs were temporary, never knew when you get laid off,  no reliable sources thar you end up with a full time job."
bad,"i worked alot of places so its hard to really say, most jobs where fun some where a little harder because they already had set ways on how things where done!"
bad,"The do not follow up if you have issue with the clients personnel. Perform an array of functions that may include receiving and processing incoming stock and materials, picking and filling orders from stock, packing and shipping orders, or managing, organizing and retrieving stock in the warehouse."
bad,Muy bueno el trato era impulso y degustacion de pantones donofrio
bad,"they don't find jobs that fast. do all types of warehouse work. i do all of the warehouse work and more. i pick,pack,load and unload truck, some assembley work"
bad,manpower only cared to fill its contracts. benefits were horrible. would not recommend manpower to anybody. unless they made massive changes over the years
bad,Working for Manpower is great if you are looking for Temp work. I'm looking to find a career and maybe retire from and you can't do that from there. Is great atmosphere and great workers.
bad,"The managers on staff didn't really care about their employees, Since it was a stepping stone to get to the company that was in charge it made it a stressful place to work"
bad,"Muy bajo el salario, no hay posibilidad de prosperar"
bad,Easy work but lot of moving around. Most factories are hot and hard to get use to but manpower is quick at getting you into a factory if you can handle the work.
bad,"ambiente dinamico, cordiale, stimolante, l'unica nota stonata niente pausa caffè..."
bad,I was sent out on several temp to hire postions and they all only ever lasted a couple of weeks and then the clients would let you go. Nothing for what I normally do for work .
bad,Lugar de trabajo rapido en reponer alimentacion y poco mas
bad,"Great employment company, great with help on anything I needed, always there to answer questions.  The only draw back is the position I have they never hired me in as a permanent employee.  I need permanent work and that would not happen with them."
bad,"Manpower was helpful in getting me in the door to full time employment, while allowing me to gain work experiences through different avenues. Good opportunity for beginners."
bad,it was an number driven environment where all they cared about was numbers and not much about the employees that worked there wish they could have invested more into people as well
bad,"I left my job to take an assignment with Manpower at UPS . My contact was suppose to be for 12 months I specifically asked the recruiter to please make sure the assignment would last the 12 mo or close to the full contract, because otherwise I was not interested in leaving my job. I started the assignment at UPS on Nov 21, and it ended Dec 22, just 1 month. I was so mad at first  and then disappointed, I immediately called the recruiter to ask what happened, however she was no help, except to say  sorry that they only wanted help for the holidays. She didn't even try to help me find another job. Why they even agree to a contract that  was not going to be upheld, I don't know."
bad,No paid lunches and back breaking with unfair compensation. Extremely short breaks and no garentee that there will be work every day. There are some nice people though
bad,Calling lapsed blood donors to donate again. Creating BS400 profiles for those unable to donate. You dial different regions every day. Not a job to get excited about.
bad,"Hard work"
bad,a qui apredi varias herramientas  para desarrollarme como ejec. tel
bad,Manpower is a contracting agency for quick job fills. No job security. Posted to multiple different companies to do short contract assignments. Over people are nice.
bad,"this was a temp job, in which I did a lot of data entry and inventory work. Working for Corning Inc. In Corning NY.  I only worked this assignment for a year then got hired on with Corning Inc. in the IT dept."
bad,"Janitorial/Assembly								2005-2007"
bad,The job was good at times depending on what assignment you get sent sent out on. At times they may not have any work available so you could have months off.
bad,they found some cool jobs but just to far out for me and were stayed but some times they did pay good and had some good hours too and long time jobs well
bad,"Poor management, lack of communication, poor leadership, lack of notice of things going on (like when you had to work, some days you go into work to find out your not working that day)"
bad,Yea out of Ok Treating you can get it right after u texted me that to start going over there when the game was sleep walking work tonight and working in farmville
bad,"I've worked under them,meaning they would call me and setp temporary jobs here an there, several jobs in various locations. Mondays thru Fridays  week after week,hours varied,"
bad,MAnpower was a temp agency that was suppose to help find a secure position. When I went to them looking for office work they placed me in a cleaning job telling me it was until an office job opened up. They refused to move me after I started the cleaning work telling me they did not move people around. So this is an untruthful company that will not find jobs to match your experience.
bad,"My employment term taught me a lot about this company. I learned how to work as a team player. I learned that when you work as a team you can accomplish much more than working as an individual. "
bad,"Good place to go if needing to find temporary work. Some options for permanent placement. Start date was repeatedly pushed back, but not fault of Manpower (was from hiring company)."
bad,"The job served it's purpose.  Was not great.  I wanted to get into accounting work, and had hoped with would get my foot in the door.  Could not get on full time, so there was no room to move."
bad,Assistants say one thing but another happens. You call every week to check in and they basically just get your information and then hang up. IF they do call you for a job it's with little notice.
bad,mann wurde wie ein stück Vieh behandel also nicht gut
bad,This job was ok but they never called or assigned me anything most of the time. It did give me some experience and money just not enough. Kind of disappointing.
bad,Nicht empfehlenswert lohn sehr gering tim laaa.....laaa... keine Hilfe bei Kündigung kein Grund .
bad,Alright place to work however they messed up my pay quite often and there was miscommunication alot. I didnt like the fact that they called me on my way to work 20 minutes before I was suppose to clock in to tell me that my assignment had ended and then have yet to call me back with information on any new job
bad,trabalhei na empresa como prestador de serviços da Procter e Gamble em período curto. o que se pode dizer é que falta melhor suporte aos contratados.
bad,"On m'appelle aujourd'hui pour une mission de 4h,bien évidement je dis non,j'essaye d'expliquer à la personne que j'ai au téléphone mes besoins étant donner que ça fait 6 ans que je travail pour eux,je pensais quand même être écoutée. Elle me dit excusez moi j'ai pas le temps il faut que je trouve du monde pour demain. Mais où va t'on??ou est le respect??!!"
bad,No benefits or vacation. No room for advancement at all. Temporary jobs. Lower pay than the full time people make. Honestly this should only be used while you look for full time employment.
bad,boring job it was u never new where u where working from day to day u could be working on day there and then the next day some where diffternt so im looking for full time employment
bad,"when your in need of work it allows you to gain more chances of getting a job, it allows you to work with people in order to gain more experience which in return helps you build yourself."
bad,hard to contact manpower they dont compensate for most holidays several issues all in all decent co to work with quick job placement if any availability
bad,"While on assignment with them you may think that they know what they are doing but don't be fooled. They only care about meeting the needs of the company they are working with and could truly care very little about the individual worker. If you father dies and you have to be at work, well suck it up they won't partner with the company they have you with to help you get the time off. They still expect you to show up to work."
bad,From the standpoint of a hands off environment Manpower is great. They need to improve in supporting the people they hire and actually get to know them. Some individuals had a difficult time remembering your name.
bad,"Manpower is has very poor communication with its temps. All jobs they offer either eventually end, or are very intense hard work.They have a good attitude though."
bad,Your typical temp hiring agency. They try hard to place you in jobs that can potentially hire you on after a period of time. The issue is that man companies exploit temporaries and that was just what happened to me. Work 90 days of probation as a temp the potentially get offered a job. As they tell me sorry we can't hire you or the rest that reached 90 days we walk right past fellow temps from the same agency. What a slap in the face that was.
bad,"I was not as happy with Manpower, Because they only was able to find State jobs, that did not hire you on after doing the work for several months or years."
bad,"This was  temporary assingment to help me get realigned after moving from Florida to Indiana   It was during the Economic down turn and jobs were hard to find."
bad,I would never work fir manpower again they sent me place promising fulltime work to only get to work a day then be laid off months they would put me on waiting list to only forget about me and give everybody else the jobs that came after me
bad,"When I was contemplating accepting the offer, a former superior of mine told me that ManpowerGroup is ""where careers go to die."" I was promoted within a year and a half and at the time thought she was totally off. But now having seen additional almost three years and understanding the culture more, I understand what she was saying. The pay is below market; there is no internal development whatsoever; only a select few see any levels of real promotion or advancement; the talented people leave, which leaves a bunch of complacent, adequate-to-sub-par employees remaining."
bad,"They served as a means to an end. there was little interaction with them after the initial hiring process. they however at the particular location I went through had forgotten to send in my insurance information. As a result, I ended up with no insurance during to duration of my time working for them."
bad,"Được làm việc  trong môi trường tốt,nhưng không được làm đúng chuyên môn được phát huy khả năng của mình."
bad,The pay was good for the area but the turnover rate was high. They placed me at a company that was temp to hire. The work was confusing for most. I stood out among peers was offered a more fast pace position with higher workload but wasn't offered a permanent position. The permanent position came with a pay cut and wasn't offered until about a year after working there dispute being told 3 months then 6 months etc. Where I was placed there was a fight almost everyday. Most people didn't follow the rules and regulations. Overall it was Ghetto and rachet but paid weekly.
bad,they was ok to work with/ tried to find work. when they could. most of the time. they didnt have any work. didn't really have to go in the office that often.  /
bad,Security work is very boring and the pay was very low with small raises given. Not something I would consider ever doing again.
bad,"Not an easy company to work for. They are a temp agency and do not communicate with you. And they treat you just as you are, A temporary person for the job until something better comes along."
bad,"Less than supportive - did not follow through on advertised commitments during employment."
bad,Poor management and very unorganized company. Not good for a first job or anything. There are way better staffing agencies out there other than Man Power. All around bad experience.
bad,did not like the agency liked the company that I worked for and the TL was ok people on the team very young and childish nothing more to say about this place
bad,"I would not suggest this, no job advancement. Very rude co-workers, can't even feel you are in a safe work environment. No one working for manpower will answer and help you, you leave voicemail's and no one calls back"
bad,Very tough working 12 hour shifts loading 6 - 12 trucks at a time by yourself. I walked back and forth in and out of 6 - 12 trucks throughout my 12 hour shift.
bad,"Manpower is the typical placement service, while the company does not generally seek to place a person in his/her specialty they will provide temporary employment for those seeking work."
bad,Overall this job lacked many things. Job stability being the primary thing missing for this overall experience. Working at this company made me exceptionally more knowledgeable in how things are made.
bad,A contract employer that normally provides an augmented technical work force to employers. I was hired because of my lengthy service to hp and could provide skills that were of value to hp.  Unfortunately the work environment was fraught with regular and irregular  layoffs scheduled by hp that often were disruptive to both the contribution and lives of the many of the Manpower personnel.
bad,Deveriam tratar melhor seus funcionários e estarem preparados para comandar um evento igual o das olimpíadas.
bad,I work for them for year just bad place to work always giving you the run around lied about everything that's going in the warehouse just a waste of time
bad,I worked at various companies they would send me to. Did not like the floating around because by the time you got to know a co worker it was on to the next company. But it paid the bills I had at the time.
bad,I had issues with the treatment of employees and I spoke to the Staffing Rep on the job site and they agreed and were looking to get out of the business themselves because they saw everything bad and could not do much about it.
bad,NOTHING TO SAY THIS is a temp company no security only get pay for holidays after 1500 hours of work Nothing much to say about this company
bad,mauvais suivis des ouvrier mauvaise entente très mauvaise accueille des entreprise
bad,They do not answer the phone. They have their favorites. I really don't understand how they make it. It does not seem like they ever have work.
bad,"Maintained up-to-date knowledge of store policies regarding payments, returns and exchanges. Worked as a team member performing cashier duties, product assistance and cleaning"
bad,Manpower is a great company to work for. I am just looking for something that has more involvement in my career field. being coordinator  an Human Resource Coordinator is not in my career path.
bad,"They did not find that many jobs, and had a hard time contacting them. When I would go in they would not have anything available"
bad,"Moving boxes from shelf to van and then to other warehouse. management are very nice "
bad,The places I did work was very nice. But it was in consist in the work assignment.  But if your just trying to make ends meet this might work.
bad,Manpower has limited growth opportunities. I really like the opportunity to obtain lots of training. This position is contracted and the benefits are not affordable.
bad,"I am a Sr. Virtual Contract Recruiter RPO, Specialist, home based in Texas. I source and recruit Management Territory Teams in Indianapolis and the State of Michigan for 4 Hiring Managers and one Director of Sales. "
bad,"Awful place to work, no one really cares about you all they care about is giving you unrealistic sales targets and terrible hours, the company do not care about their customers. I was there 6 months and the only good thing was the like minded people who hated their job as well. "
bad,Sehr unpersöhnlich.3 Jahre lang nur Tarifliche erhöungen. Grundlose Kündigung musste sogar einen Anwalt einschalten

bad,"hard to get answers from people, they don't return phone calls, applied for many jobs from them...went in and filled out the paperwork and then never heard back (even though I applied for multiple jobs), I've called many times, but the person in charge of my account is always on the phone, I leave a message and never get a return call"
bad,Typical day at work.Packing out CDs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I learn how to work Computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                             There was no hard part to my job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The most enjoyable was my co workers.
bad,Worked at this company as a receptionist and it was very busy nonstop phone calls.  Alot of paper work and multi-tasking.
bad,I was not satisfied with how quickly they would try to place you in a position that would not fit your background or really have many positions available.
bad,A typical day would consist of working from six in the evening until six at the morning. I've learn that the wafer that were processed were  worth millions of dollars. The management did their best to help out. My coworkers were just coworkers.
bad,Working for Manpower at Motorola has been different but fun and learning experience of being able to learn to assemble and disassemble phones.
bad,Everyone who I work for is very friendly and helpful. Work is easy and they accommodate with Gatorade.  However there are no raises and very little opportunity for raises.
bad,Close to home and nice people. Just need to start having some benefits for their employees. Example: Paid vacation and affordable insurance.
bad,IT was ok i only worked temporary for about a month for them. never really got any responses back for any workI was working in a ice cooler for packaging lettue. it was an experience to be in . but the job ended thirdy days later. i just wished they had more work.
bad,"Mulit-tasking throughout the day conducting interviews, orientations, drug test and internal training. Following through with voicemails, referral cards and compliance. Weekly and daily conference calls, regular meetings with management and order fullilment. Approving criminal background checks, resume composition, client visits as well as termination, attending job fairs and organization and implementation of new policies and processes with-in the office."
bad,They are a temp agency. They are not very reliable and don't work you very much. pay very minimum. They move you from one company to another.
bad,This company placed me in services I was not comfortable doing. I would have preferred to have been in an industrial/ warehouse setting.
bad,some of the places where fun place to work and others were not so much fun but i did what needed to be done to get the job done and that's it
bad,The pay is okay. The benefits are horrible you basically are working to pay for your benefits. The potential for full for permanent placement isn't as likely as they make it out to be.
bad,I have been placed with the largest health insurance company in RDU area through Manpower. I have been a temp on the job since May 2014. I have yet to be offered a permanent position within the healthcare company. Many people that work on other teams and departments have become permanent in a very short time.
bad,Busy steady work. Management was knowledgeable and easy to work with. Got a long really well with co-workers. The hardest part at times was finding a location in warehouse for product
bad,"I was told by my Manpower rep. that assemblers perform all tasks conducted by the team in the assembly process and rotate through all or most of them rather than being assigned to a single job. "
bad,its a good place but they treat people unfairly . I was forced to do the hardest station for 7 hours because no one wanted to do it and I was the newest hire. They use people.
bad,Manpower is a good way to get your foot in the door at a lot of places. The pay could be better.
bad,High employee turnover rate at staffing agency and not very good assignments available
bad,Då det var alltid uppdrag som man inte själv kunde påverka och välja så hamnade jag oftast på olika fabrik som jag inte trivdes med och som man inte kände sig delaktig då personalen såg oftast oss som extra.
bad,"Manpower was okay to work for, but the companies that they hire you out to are something else, because it's just about money they don't care about you or your well being."
bad,"The staffing specialists at Manpower are good people. However, Manpower just does not have that many office jobs available. I believe it is a good company but doesn't have much to offer me in the way of long-term, permanent assignments which would utilize my skills."
bad,"Prepare the machine for each production task.This can include entering "
bad,"I reviewed the data of Foreign exchanges, what was stated on the phone, to what was input into the system. If there was a discrepancy, management needed to be notified."
bad,"brak możliwosci rozwoju,korporacja,kiepskie kierownictwo poszczególnych biur,niski zarobek jeśli słaba sprzedaż usług"
bad,Agency that places people in work areas. Doesnt have enough customer service reps to help their clients/staff in assisting with needs that werent met
bad,"a decent place of work"
bad,"hôtesse de caisses"
bad,"travail a la chaîne,emballages,cartonnage,faconnage."
bad,Not set up for long term career growth and the company lacks a strong understanding of communication.
bad,"suck attetudes"
bad,was mostly on a fork truck for this company. They had a job lined up for me most of the time but it still was just temp work. Good experience and learned different work environments.
bad,"not so good partners, assignments didn't last long, was told one thing then it was another."
bad,They will take people without vehicles in buses to jobs. Be sure to keep up with your hours.
bad,Not my cup of tea. first time working in a factory setting where I didn't work in the cafeteria.
bad,ich habe dort über diese Firma in verschiedenen aderen firmen gearbeitet und von daher kann ich dazu nichts sagen
bad,They gave out really good jobs but  no intent to hire. Managers were hard to get ahold of and never returned my calls.
bad,I had a ok time there I feel I was fired for something someone else did
bad,"Duke Energy Payment Center, Very busy with a very high volume of customers everyday. I learned that when people are subject to disconnection they can and will be very mean. There was very good co workers and lazy co workers. The hardest part of the job was telling people you do not have a enough to keep from disconnection. I enjoyed meeting alot of new people."
bad,"We would start at a specific time, have our breaks all laid out for us and end at exactly the same moment each day. You always knew where you were supposed to be, however, there were times where multiple people would be asking you to do different projects. Everyone expected me to do what THEY wanted and not what WE needed. I would sometimes get confused as to what was expected of me, especially when it came to taking the initiative to learn something new and better myself."
bad,My co-workers were the best part of the job. A day at work was placing metal buttons on a tray then putting sandpaper discs on top of those. The trays were then pushed into the assembly machine. There they were heated and pressed together. The hardest part of the job was making quota.
bad,I have attempted to find a local job in the pensacola area thru manpower but 99.9% Of the responses I receive are jobs located nowhere near florida
bad,learned a lot about customer service and putting the customer first
bad,Worked at ice mountain water plant. I drove fork lifts to supply production lines with plastic preforms. Constructed cardboard gaylords for shipping of plastic preforms. And cleaned the work area at the end of every night. co-workers were easy to work with. was a good job but too hard to get into as a full time job they layed off do to decreased sales.
bad,"I worked hard and tryed to learn different thing.I got along with most every one ,my manager was ok. I liked this job because it kept you bussy."
bad,"hired as oursourcing, not bet place to work for or in. Not much else to describe."
bad,Some people I worked for was not that nice and they made feel like I did not want to come back.
bad,the pay not enough pay for not enough job offers and every two years get laid off or another two three  to six months get laid off for holidays not enough sucure job constantly lad off cause of lack of work.
bad,"I work for Manpower but I work at Acument Global Technologies."
bad,i was signed up with manpower for almost two years and was provided with one job. i had asked for temp-hire but was given a job with out any information reguarding the time frame of the position. i was informed by another associate working with that we only had four weeks. i had spoke to recruiters constantly about new openings but was never contacted.
bad,Needed to work and take care of my grandfather at the time. Like the flexibility to work and chose jobs I wanted.
bad,"Trabajos mal remunerados y y con muy poco tiempo para presentarte en el lugar donde te destinaban a trabajar, con muy mal ambiente en la mayoría de ellos"
bad,Schlechte Mitarbeiter Führung. Gewerbliche Untergebene sollten von mir ständig überforteilt werden. Sehr überhebliche Vorgesetzte
bad,working for manpower was also a very enjoyful job. Manpower is a temp. service so everyday was something new . i enjoyed being able to talk and watch tv with my patients when they wanted i didnt have intoracting with any of my co-workers manily the doctors and nurses at the hospital and for the most part they wher ereally nice 
bad,Grand dysfonctionnement de l'encadrement et petites bandes à l'intérieure des UT ambiance très malsaine. 
bad,"Different summer jobs to pay my studies."
bad,Really didn't have any long term work assignments for customer service.  
bad,"I loved manpower, I was exposed to a lot of different jobs which gave me lots of experience and because of that they gave me more intense and more difficult work which taught me different things."
bad,I work for man power at cdc. I repair diesel engines to make sure there are no leaks.
bad,typical of a staffing agency. Decent pay and assignments. I would recommend this company.
bad,"The times that the call about a job, very little info."
bad,"I was exposed to several oppotunites with good people but the jobs were only temporary, but the experiences & opportunites were good."
bad,"* Learned - how handle client, candidate, contingency situation while recruitment process"
bad,It is good place to worked specially for some beginners because they are giving more time in training.
bad,A typical day at work was just hard work. I learned that people expect you to put in your share of the hard work when you work the production line. Management did their job as best they could and tried to be fair while still trying to get the job done. Co-workers were mostly nice and helpful people.The hardest part of this job was keeping up the fast pace. The most enjoyable part of this job was the over time and going home early if work was done.
bad,Era bom de trabalhar lá mais ninguém tinha uma meta.
bad,"Jobs ranged from packaging to just sitting around doing nothing at times, it was a good job to get experience, and that is it."
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was being around the friendly coworkers. management was not the greatest they all were stuck up. i learned how to operate machinery
bad,I was called as needed to work in various factories doing line work on a production line.
bad,"trato profecional, muchas fallas en la liquidacion de sueldos."
bad,"I was not pleased with Manpower. They were not prompt in answering emails or answering questions. After a first assignment did not fit me well, they basically made no effort to help me find another assignment. I will never work with them again!"
bad,I was able to get out and meet people and be involved in the community
bad,Really no chance to get familiar with staff because of the changes every 6 months.
bad,I learned alot about customer service when i was working with Manpower and gained alot from the role such as confidence in dealing with customer problems and complaints. Apart from that the management was terrible although i enjoyed the job itself when it came to any issues i wouldn't get any help. Human Resources for Manpower was the worst management i have worked with. I will take the positive things away from the time i had there.
bad,it was my first job at assembly line packaging. no problems with
bad,"A typical day at work was alright as long as the supervisor was not present. I learned to load and unload tractor trailers with a sitdown forklift, also i picked up some office experience such as filing, dispatching, phone customer service and inputting orders into system. As far as management goes the job would be much better if more qualified personnel were present, the management was lazy and often the extra work was put on me as well as the warehouse lead. My co-workers consisted of only the warehouse lead and the over night team for a few hours, the co workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would be the hours that you had to work which was 3am to 1130am other than that the job was easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the lunches that we would have."
bad,they will match you with a company that fits you. sometimes really fast alot of times it may take weeks.pay fits the line of work
bad,Jag fick reda på varje fredag om jag skulle få fortsätta jobba på det företag jag var på. Det var inte optimalt eftersom jag då inte kunde planera någonting.
bad,"Hard heavy work on feet for up to 10 hours a night with a 20 minute break all night "
bad,I do not have time or space to leave a comment. Staff are unprofessional and will get angry if you do not take a particular assignment. will not refer this company to anyone I really care about
bad,As agency and takes about 50% from your actual salary. Easy to pass the interview. Late payment for salary as they will pay on every 7th of the next month.
bad,"Manpower is a dependent company So if you want to join this company, you must have to confirm about your job security. Although company is good. There is no increment process."
bad,The jobs are a good fit for what I like to do but there never long term they are only 2 or 3 day assignments and that not something I can have I need long term.
bad,"You went from site to site, some days u didn’t work. It was hard to get to your point of contact. Ppl weren’t always informed that you were coming to there site until the day of."
bad,We were not provided with adequate lunch arrangements.  We were expected to short lunches but were expected to walk at least 15 minutes to our perspective lunch areas.
bad,"They were nice to work for, until it came time to get a new position that they had but wouldn't get back to me on it, and then tell me later that the position had already been filled."
bad,Not flexible nor do they care at their employees. There was no chance to move up within the company. They are a temp to hire where you may never even get hired from the other company. Empty promises.
bad,"esta bien la empresa, son agradables y te tratan bien"
bad,"The pay isnt the best and they definitely take their cut, depending on assignment you could either get a decent job temporarily or a really unfair low paying high demand job that doesnt provide hours that you will be put on low priority if you leave before your contract ends meaning you wont be allowed to find new assignments through them."
bad,"Conduct, cold calls, interviews and other HR related task. "
bad,"It was a temp to hire job. I worked for them for almost a full year with almost no call offs. Unfortunately, I was hospitalized and was unable to make it to work for a few days."
bad,I was a contractor through them for my current job and my recruiter was just awful. She never answered her phone calls or emails and even after leaving a voicemail she would take days to get back to you. When she did finally get back to you she had an attitude and like it was a chore to talk to you. She was very rude and condenscending when going over the reviews from the managers. She accused me more than once of doing things I did not do as well.
bad,the office i worked in you were put under a lot of pressure each day however the salary was good. some of the management are good however others aren't.
bad,"I turni non venivano rispettati e a volte, facevano storie per pagarti gli straordinari. Disorganizzazione è la parola che userei per descrivere il tutto. Per quanto riguarda gli stipendi, erano 7,20 euro lordi l'ora. Per stare 12 ore in piedi e senza la possibilità di riposarti. Il pagamento doveva arrivarmi entro 45 giorni l'arrivo della notula. Che era prevista per metà settembre. L'ho ricevuta 7 giorni fa. Ah, la notula di agosto ovviamente, quella di settembre, chissà quando arriverà. Per il resto, almeno i colleghi erano simpatici e alla mano."
bad,"Jobs alimentaire, travail pénible , pas de possibilité d’évolution dans la logistique."
bad,"Beaucoup de stress entre les équipes, ainsi qu'avec le responsable d'agence qui tient mal son role de manager, mais accentue plutôt la pression."
bad,I dont care much for the way they do things but it will pay the bills and maybe get u a permanent job. The benifits are not good u r under paid.  There is no sick days
bad,The company I work for was RR donnelley's and Sons and it was through Manpower I would put in overtime and they did not won't to pay me for the over time I put in
bad,"Busy operation but low paying. Close to home. Good hard working people to work with. That's it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"For those who likes paying their bills on time. Temp agencies are good for learning new things in a short period on time!  That's the only thing good other than that it's not worth the short assignments, and even if you've been with a job for months, they will call you after you've gotten in the glove of things will call you out the blue, and tell you your assignment is over. Of course then you'll have to call in for work. So I wouldn't recommend Temp agencies."
bad,A typical day working for Manpower was showing up at your assignment and performing your job with precision and speed as required. Management is somewhat concerned with your needs but at a bare minimum. The workplace culture is stressful and high demand for productivity.
bad,"The work place is fine and the co-workers are nice just the hours are long the managment is rude and doesn't understand we have car troubles you may miss coming in at 5:00am  when you tell them a day before, hardest part was staying awake , most enjoyable part was paid weekly, workplace culture is strict"
bad,"Nada que apontar."
bad,"I was told I would be offered new assignments directly after my current ones had ended, however, I was told there was nothing in the area and that I would have to wait for a job to come up after my assignments. The photos for security were taken on a phone and I was thrown into the assignments and didn't hear from Manpower until I contacted them about things."
bad,"Boa cultura , ambiente um pouco instável devido às constantes mudanças."
bad,Poor management and total disregard for employees. Unfair treatment of people of all nationalities and terrible work conditions. Employers were sometimes required or demanded to do jobs thatcdidbt fit their work description.
bad,they have alot o seasonal work which could be good for those needs seasonal work but for someone like myself its not really what i was looking for. but its  not bad
bad,Third party agencies generally do not promote good work life balance as it is all about hitting targets and quotas.  The people at this agency were overall very professional and nice to work with.
bad,"This employer was not very professional, the company that would hire temp employees would end the temps assignments with their company before they reached 90 days to avoid having to hire them as ful time employees. This keeps more and more temps coming in to replace workers laid off at their 90 days. The company doesn't want to pay you as a full time employee, offer benefits, or pay you as a union employee. They will find any reason to get rid of temp workers before they're employed 90 days to save themselves money."
bad,"All the time your working and earning them money you're their best friend."
bad,"I started my Temp job 2 weeks after I came into Manpower looking for a job. I am very pleased with my worksite, but it took sometime to get used to being a Temp. I have been on my job site for over 6 months now and I know its a temp position, but I was hoping for a raise for being at the same job for a few months. I rarely ask for time off and I haven't been late. But overall Manpower is quick to get you in a position, so I guess its fine."
bad,"- Not enough benefits"
bad,Company lacks monitoring of it's employees in the field. Worked at two sites and both had safety and harassment issues that were not addressed by ManPower nor it's clients.
bad,Working as a Temp at an entry level during a six month assignment at Century Bank was educational in the sense that true team-work was instrumental to get assignments completed.
bad,Ten hours of lifting boxes up to 60lbs each off a line and onto pallets that you have placed by hand on spring loaded table. Required to punch out for lunch.
bad,"Gives you jobs, pays minimum wage, it's alright. Factory jobs, could pay more. Trys to put you in a best fit position. No bad words against manpower itself."
bad,"Poor leadership and branch managers totally lost."
bad,"pouco organizada."
bad,Working with Manpower was very rewarding. I enjoyed coming to work everyday to accept the challenges that were ahead of me.
bad,"My description of this job is that I was a receiver I had to unload the 2 simi field with big boxes"
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. It is a temporary work service. No benefits, pay is terrible, you do more work than anyone else and get nothing for it, pay wise."
bad,it was a nice company to work for. Pay wasnt that great and hours were very long. small company so hiring help wasnt an option. I was just under paid and under appreciated.
bad,Sold a dream of temp to perm work but released shortly before the end of the qualifying period.  Holiday entitlements are not clearly explained and I was allowed to take time off without the warning that I would not be paid.  Trying to obtain a reasonable outcome was met with stern rejection which required months of grievance meetings before a satisfactory resolution was reached through a meeting with head office representatives.  In no way is the a route in to work it is a meat machine designed soley for the purpose of profit to the company.
bad,"short pretty fast"
bad,"Empresa de pequeno porte, ainda precisa investir um pouco mais na estrutura, oferecer meios de trabalho mais apropriados. A gestão deixa a desejar."
bad,"The job in hand was very rewarding helping customers with their queries, however, the long work hours were not ideal working until 11pm at night."
bad,"I felt very replaceable at Manpower. The benefits were expensive and did not cover much. Time Off was the only positive benefit. My manage didn't do much but took most of the credit for our success. We were often berate and chastized but did not recieve much praise."
bad,"Little chance of going anywhere here... A temp job is only good for one person... A temp. Someone irresponsible. For someone looking for full time work, go find another job. While they give raises, you have no job stability and are basically transient... sent where and when they need you."
bad,The overall work is not difficult. The most challenging part wil have to be the variety of products that come thru the warehouse with different weights.
bad,Manpower dos not like to partner you with jobs I your field. The job I work was part time and did fit my school schedule Co workers were  very helpful we all got along. Managers were very strict and gave you the guideline book for everything instead of just telling you the answer.
bad,"The worst part about the job was the boredom and the lack of gaining any transferable skills. Everyone takes the job as a contractor hoping to get in to the company which from what I see is next to impossible. No paid time off/holidays, or other benefits. On the upside the people were nice and there wasn't much stress."
bad,The work life balance is good because you can only work a 40 hour work week.  This means no over time and you can logoff on time everyday.
bad,"Cuando trabaje en manpower, me senti muy comoda con los superiores y compañaeros(empleados). Un ambiente trankilo,respetuoso,dedicado y exigiendo puntualidad..."
bad,Not very good at finding additional assignments. I would not recommend this staffing agency
bad,A typical day at Manpower was busy. I learned a lot about the staffing industry and some HR related job functions. The management at Manpower was typical.
bad,"Ok company to work for, but the pay is too low.  The management team typically has no idea what roles and responsibilities the employee has and reports to an IBM manager"
bad,Temporary service only worked for them for a short time and moved on to a permanent position else where.
bad,"There is a LOT of training on ""rebuttals"" to say if someone doesnt commit to a solid donation. They do require a certain dollar amount of donations per hour, per campaign and if u dont reach them u get sent home."
bad,ils m'ont permis de vivre une très belle expérience dans l'horlogerie.
bad,Nice place to start out at but was let go due to a problem with another Employee
bad,"I only worked through Manpower to get on at Dillard's.  I had dealt with some people there that, honestly, I would say is unkind.  I didn't particularly like working through them.  Sometimes you got your check when you were suppose to and sometime something happened and you had to wait another week or two for it.  It's certianly now one of the better temp agencies out there"
bad,When it came to handling your pay and or missing hours it was the worst time
bad,bonne présentation de l'entreprise pour laquelle je devais travailler
bad,"The practice of using temp. agencies is becoming more widespread throughout the manufacturing community. Temps are treated with disrespect by the full--time employees and face a more hostile environment when starting with a new employer. The potential for achieving full-time status diminishes with each new placement. "
bad,A typical day at work was hot. I learned how to packed insulation boxes. Some co-workers were nice and helpful. Hardest part of the job was packing 90 pipes in a box with no help. The most enjoyable part of the job was packing the short pipes.
bad,they seem to always Down grade the Workers benefits & don't value them. but always increasing upper management
bad,"Friendly and Diverse working environments"
bad,"the training program is virtually non existent, HR team and management team have no compassion - got paid off whilst on sick leave "
bad,Empresa só pega funcionários para trabalharem por um tempo determinado em contrato.
bad,"Overall, great company to work for. Paid weekly. Good Assignements. Went on assignments geared towards my backround."
bad,Not guaranteed a job. They will send you from place to place. Better if you know someone that works there.
bad,"While working in this contract position, I did not receive any feedback or support from the employer or Manpower as to my job performance, length of contract or other opportunities."
bad,unstable work environment
bad,I injoy the job when i was working! Just need more long term jobs.
bad,it was a temp service. they sent me to a few good places to work. the bad thing it was temp position. i need job security
bad,"There is a huge lack of communication. You will be told one thing and another will be done. Prime example is when your information is not checked in depth. By this I mean contact info etc, So you may not get paid or as much as vacation pay or holiday pay."
bad,Manpower is good for getting people working but most of the time it's for low paying jobs and most of the staff doesn't pay attention to what you really want for work they just want to get you in some where quickly so they can make money.
bad,Finds great company’s to work for but they don’t update you on who you’re recruiter is and how you can get ahold of them and there is always issues with being paid probably 8 times I’ve had a short check or gotten paid a week later wouldn’t recommend for this reason alone
bad,"Buena "
bad,"Ich bin bei der Bewertung etwas unentschlossen. Das hängt damit zusammen, dass die Kontaktperson bei Manpower sehr nett und entgegenkommend war, allerdings das Management beim Kunden von Manpower nach einem Wechsel in der Führung des Standortes die Mitarbeiter*innen bezüglich Jobsicherheit und -Beschäftigungsdauer aktiv belogen hat. Das gibt für mich den Ausschlag zu einer negativen Bewertung."
bad,The person who found me positions didn't get back in a timely manner and one time gave me a position to go to which i did and then called me after i was already there at the time saying they didnt need me that day.
bad,"gute Vermittlung aber wenn man mal ausfällt durch Krankheit, keine Ruhe"
bad,"its cool as a stepping stone. the pay is bad, I was glade when the company hired me on full-time. the jobs that they are hiring for are for teens or young adults"
bad,"Working for manpower is fine for temporary work. Don't expect to be hired on with the company you're contracted for because it rarely happens. Raises are never given, only if you switch to another department."
bad,"The pay should be more then they pay and i feel like they can be more understanding with people schedule and giving more chances, reason i say that is because people got children and it's time's you are going to need to go take your child that's sick to the doctor."
bad,"No se preocupan por el trabajador, no ofrecen nada de flexibilidad y comunican todo por whatsapp, buen sueldo pero no vale la pena."
bad,"The company failed to modernize it tools, lost a lot of money, wasn't aware of it or ignored the warnings from staff. Spent too much money on solutions that did not support the business, Eventually had to outsource"
bad,Its not much you can say about a temp job. They basically place you base on past job skills or none to fills temp spots at different company's that they have contracts with.
bad,The management was ok.  It was a slow paced atmosphere and I don't feel it really challenges you to your potential.  They kind of trained for the position but I feel it could have been more inclusive of what the job entailed/
bad,Felt expectations were way too high compared to compensation being offered. Also felt there were way too many bosses offering conflicting rules. Also didn't receive adequate training.
bad,A typical day on the job would be me documenting blue prints. I sit in an office and scan audit digital pictures. I also was responsible for overseeing crews work.
bad,no advancement opportunities. I refuse to work for this company again. Leadership could care less if you are injured on the job or have a complaint. Only action taken is you losing employment
bad,La giornata lavorativa è di 8 ore con pausa pranzo.  Ho imparato moltissimo sulla gestione dei contratti e sulla ricerca e selezione del personale.
bad,"Se trabaja normal como en cualquier empresa pero SIN los beneficios, es decir, te pagan menos por el mismo trabajo que haría otra persona sin ser outsourcing. Creo que las empresas outsourcing dañan al trabajador para beneficiarse a si mismas. Ojalá que las empresas como esta piensen mas en los trabajadores que el en el negocio que somos para ellos."
bad,Nice place if you are looking for temporary work. But not recommended if your looking to get hired in and make a career. Work is not consistent enough to pay the bills especially with a kid on the way.
bad,"Zatrudniają na kilka tygodni, potem zwalniają pod pretekstem ze ""nie ma pracy"" , obiecują ze gdy będzie praca napewno o tym powiadomia, po tygodniu zatrudniają nowych pracowników, nie dając szansy poprzednim."

bad,"In the Data Entry/Human Resources position, primary responsibilities included but were not limited to gathering and compiling demographic information for new employees.  Responsible for entering information into internal systems and then exporting the data to an Excel spreadsheet on a daily basis.  Printed and filed demographic data, I- 9, and W2 paperwork into paper filing system."
bad,"Decent place to work, the culture is inviting, it's not a very physically demanding job. The pay is rather low given the nature of the job performed."
bad,"I worked for Manpower for may years, working different factory, wharehouse & assembly line work. If you needed a job they would find one for you. They seem to be great friendly and professional staff that would match you with the job you were looking for."
bad,I done building repairs plumbing assisted the mechanic and cleaned at a landfill. Great people to work with. Was able to get occasional overtime.
bad,"Tout est dans l'urgence "
bad,i like the job opurtunities that they offer but very poor communication skills and managers tiona and heather dont know how to talk to people and only care for themselves
bad,"mis días de trabajo no son rutina para mi, siempre estoy tranquila y se me hace ameno el trabajo, por un tema de tiempo y malos entendidos, o envidias no pude continuar trabajando, me evalúo con un 7 en dicha empresa, pero los administrativos siempre fueron cambiando lo cual siempre habían privilegios, mis compañeros de trabajo eran tolerantes para reforzar las falencias de los que recién comenzábamos a trabajar, en las contingencias la empresa los técnicos en terrenos y técnicos supervisores no se preocupaba de dar un buen servicio o si lo daban era de mediana calidad, el compañerismo era excelente en los horarios break 15 a 30 minutos, siempre se realizaban actividades que no eran de la empresa manpower, para el día del niño se realizo una convivencia para niños de escasos recursos sin el logo de dicha empresa manpower, la parte mas difícil era cuando los supervisores no eran tolerantes con mis peticiones para atender bien a las personas que estaban en zona roja, lo que mas me gusto fue la participación de compañerismo y integrar a los que recién comenzábamos.."
bad,"mapower mal organiser prévienne au dernier moment quand il annule ou pour aller travailler ce n'est très bien moi je pence qu'il manque de l'organisation  chez eux .."
bad,the company has an assortment of cultures which is a blessing in disguise.  you learn all aspects of life personally and in the workplace.  It has been a great experience working with  many cultures and learning different work ethics from them.
bad,Some jobs were fun and exciting but others were boring and very short. Some jobs I worked months and others just a few days.
bad,"BT promise the world but never delivery, its always just over the horizon. Manpower pay you pennies for your work and mess up pay constantly. Adding the two together makes a pretty poor job. Reliable and secure if you can keep a good work standard, but below average pay and no chances to move on in a career."
bad,A challenge to those interested to work for an advertising agency in the Philippines especially with the dynamics and culture within the organization.
bad,"I motivated individual who is highly, energetic, outgoing, and detail- oriented. Handles multiple responsibilities  simultaneously while providing exceptional customers services. I quickly learns and master new concepts ans skills. I passionate about ensuring customers leave our business with a positive experience."
bad,"Well its in the title, Temp work in this area for warehouse work is basically disposable workers. I'm more then disposable help."
bad,"Work started as picking up the phone and quickly try to resolve problem within 6 minutes, if could not solve problem then escalate to appropriate department and continue to pick up calls none stop. Managers were not too knowledgeable and all they wanted was production. Co-workers could not interact with one another since they had to be on the phone."
bad,I didn't mine the jobs they sent me on the comapines was great I learnt a lot but the only thing I didn't approve of is how they took the site from New Castle and didn't notify anyone and when you called in for assignment you was told they are no longer located in New Castle and you have to find another agency
bad,Overall good experience. Should put more effort in hearing your employee point of view on things. I worked their over a year at one particular job and despite my hardwork im nolonger able to get a job thru manpower over something totally didnt do.
bad,"Manpower has given me several job opportunities. All but my current job have been temporary even though I have been seeking a permanent, full-time position. My current job that I am working for Manpower has mediocre pay. $9 an hour for working on big truck tires and tractor tires. And I am starting to get the impression that I am going to be let go from this job too as my hours are getting cut. Last job I was let go from I was told by Manpower that they didn't need me anymore right before my shift. I was literally getting ready for work when they called. No job security, even with the ones that are supposed to offer advancement or permanent hire."
bad,"a typical day at work  first waiting to sign in then report to our stations then once we finished with offloading we hit recycling if we done with that we go to the shuttle afterwards we clean up and help the drivers haul packages in their trucks show they can go deliver them. I learned the day-to- day business of shipping at FedEx. "
bad,pues no me gusto mucho no era un habiente agradable y no crecías en esa empresa te quedabas donde mismo siempre
bad,Don't try working threw manpower. They pay low and they barely return your calls. But the up side is they are very professional.
bad,"A typical day for me was to data enter part time student loan request forms onto the in house system. This needed to be done efficiently but overall accurately with the creation and sending of correspondence for any missing or incorrect information to be sent in. Due to the form type I was dealing with also being available online, my team finished the forms very early in the shift and usually spent the rest of the shift on e-learning programs."

bad,"Call center environments are known to be relatively stressful but manageable. Normally. This call center experience was awful, poor management, poor planning and extremely poor communication between employees from bottom to top."
bad,"Hard to find work when everything is slow."
bad,"El ambiente en el trabajo era en general bastante estricto, la comunicacion entre compañeros bastante buena. Aprendi a desenvolverme bien con mis tareas laborales. No habia partes dificiles en el trabajo cada uno tenia claro lo que tenia que hacer y lo hacia bien. Lo que mas me gusto de trabajar en esa empresa fue basicamente todo."
bad,"Busy inbound sales call center, not what I was looking for. This job was advertised as a home move role, just moving customer's telephone services to their new address. This was not the case hard upsell was expected. I did not enjoy the job as I am not a natural sales person.  My colleagues were great, this job was not for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was training on new systems as I have a thirst for knowledge."
bad,"Manpower's partnership with Jaguar Land Rover is a strong one and the recruitment process seems pretty thorough, as does the induction process. "
bad,General duties in day to day running of production line with emphasis on quality control and health and safety.
bad,The hardest part of the job was staying awake.  All day long was entering peoples last name and check information and many times there was not enough in the bin to enter so we just sat and waited for more to be loaded.  You never knew when you were going to leave.  They started us with 8 hours but they gave us 4-5 hours.
bad,I recommend not finding a job this route as temp services are irregular and not dependable forms of work.
bad,"my coworkers were great and they taught me a lot of new processes such as auto insertion. my bosses were nice but they were cheap,"
bad,"A typical day of work consists of fats paced, team based assembly of car interior molds for KIA suppliers. The pay per hour was low, but such long work days pay checks were decent for young people like myself."
bad,"Jobs were okay, but didn't want to place me on jobs for permanent hire."
bad,"There  was more luck with manpower in Dallas Texas then Arkansas,"
bad,I appreciated the fact that they found me a job to begin with. however I worked very hard and didn't get the oppertunity for another assignment after my temp job ended even though I am still in good standing with the company. I wouldn't suggest working there.
bad,It's all about filling the job. With anyone. Pay for staffing specialists is very low. Offices are not very professional.
bad,"I have no typical day/ everyday  is different/ one day i might be working loading & unloading trailers /next day stocking a warehouse /  another day maybe inventory / picking & packing / I have learned just about everything about shipping and rec. warehouse duties. Management i found to fare , some better than others. My co-workers you get along with some better than others , but the reason your there is to work.Not to make friends.The hardest part of any job , is when you first get there  getting to know who your working with and how thing are being run. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is loading & unloading trailers , I like people, knowledge is the key in life!"
bad,not a full year around job. hard work and some guys are hard to work with.
bad,A typical day at work was when I had to build a faucette and wasn't able to get it to stop leaking. I learned how faucettes are really made. The management for the agency I worked for was not professioal at all. The co-workers there were not team work type of people. The hardest thing about the job was dealing with people that did not want to come to work. I enjoyed being able to be off on holidays.
bad,I worked my first job in Canada through this agency as a general laborer.
bad,"Yo estaba asignado a la bodega de la tienda ,y entraba a las 7 am,se le daba entrada a la mercancia pendiente o se recibian directamente a los proveedores en general,tenia una hora de comida y mi hora de salida era a las 4pm,o de 11am a 8pm,cuando entre no sabia manejar la telson ni como dar entrada a la mercancia asi como hacer devoluciones entre otras actividades,el trato con gerencia era cercano para informarle de faltantes o cambios de mercancia,el trato con mis compañeros era agradable y cordial sin problemas,lo dificiel fue cuando recien ingrese pues todo era nuevo para mi,pero aprendo rapido y el ambiente era agradable."
bad,The staff at manpower have very poor communication skills especially when you are in a long term assignment.
bad,I really felt as though workers weren't valued very much and I was treated rather poorly by two of Manpower's clients. It just wasn't the best fit for me.
bad,"Working in the Manpower Office was stressful with the high telephone usage to verify employment, and quality of work. I encountered plenty of resumes that looked nice, but were boring. From that experience, I learned to variate my own resume for future job applications."
bad,worked at a variety of job's for this company in part because it is a temp service.
bad,"Manpower could not care less whether their employees stayed or left, it seems that everyone who works there is just another drone in the hive that is that call center. The only incentive is money, and it's not a very good one. There were a select few people who made the job worth while, but on the whole most supervisors and higher-ups were rude and not helpful."
bad,If you need a job for a temporary income they are ok. Make sure if they send you on a job site that does not have tools call them and tell them you are going to get yours or you need tools for that job. Otherwise they fire you and won't help you again.
bad,"work anywhere he  asigne you: productive center, banque  compagny in recyclable products, distrubution center and any where they have a contrat. you must work in under supervision"
bad,"Nothing stands out, except for the pay, which I'm not sure it's worth it. From my experience, they mostly send you to places that are equal to or below your abilities, and not good ones. Plus they don't give you all the information you need to know."
bad,"I loaded & unloaded truck's & put product's where they belong , I learned that you had to be at work on  time everyday & make sure that I was  motivated at all time's & make sure things were in the right place & Safety always came first."
bad,"Went to work for a warehouse, worked for three months and then they told everyone not to come back unless we received a phone call to return, many people didn’t get a call and I’ve tried four different numbers to contact manpower and none have worked."
bad,"A hit or miss work giver and some times had to get good communication"
bad,Mentir par rapport avec mon c4 et pas de communication
bad,"Ok the failed to pay on time the refuse to pay for orientation and safety training so dont expect it. if you working out of the oxford nc office run away. poor communication .they fail to pay on time xmas week ,and in there apology  rude"
bad,"The company is good.  The job is challenging, I just wish the training and management style is better.  Everything is online.  In person is non existence."
bad,not paid nearly enough for work put in. They ask you to work your butt off on your feet for 8+ hours a day just to make minimum wage and live paycheck to paycheck.
bad,Les missions très riche en expérience sous la direction des différents managers.
bad,"On doit s'inscrire sur de multiples sites sans que cela fasse avancer les choses. J'ai effectué des missions en septembre et nous sommes aujourd'hui en novembre et je n'ai reçu aucune paie pour le moment. Lorsque j'arrivais encore à les avoir au téléphone la personne n'était pas très accueillante, installait une pression. Ne répondent plus aux mails."
bad,It all depends on where they send you to find out about where ever they send you on how your day iss going to go.. then you will.find out what you will be dojng
bad,I can recommend this company for high salary seekers but risk takers. This is a consultancy company and software projects are not quite often..Job security here is not so good.
bad,They are not good at  following up or returning calls. If you don't have a rapport with your recruiter then your pretty much on your own. Besides that the positions they offer are usually of good quality and time length.
bad,"Manpower subcontract you to different companies so the work will vary from place to place. I found my subcontracted company to be very helpful/friendly people. "
bad,"This role was in a permanent contract role in which I would deal with HR issues along with training/coaching of personnel. Assisting and providing direction to staff for both internal and external clients which was highly rewarding especially in difficult situations and scenarios'."
bad,they are only seasonal. They lied to me and told i would get 40 hours a week no i didn't. i didn't even work 8 hours a day.they lied to me all the way around. they had my taxs papers all screwed up.
bad,Current job (unilever) t is not a guaranteed source of income.Very unorganized no real good benefits...most likely require a second job at the Unileverp barely any hours..
bad,"Terrible pay and no room to advance. started sending jobs overseas to India recently."
bad,The work is usually easy but it does not pay well. The employees will tend to treat you differently because you are not a regular employee. They do help you find work.
bad,"Manpower denkt niet meer aan de werknemer."
bad,"Describe Your Work  Training for machining."
bad,"La empresa prácticamente deja a la deriva a sus empleados en manos de los que contratan los servicios de Manpawer en mi caso estaba laborando para grupo Gepp ( Pepsi), pero según te manejan un horario fijo pero el cual no es verdad tienes hora de entrada pero no de salida sin goze de horas extras ni nada."
bad,"ConAirs Fast paste production, working at this job tought me to be fast on my feet and Quick with my hands. Far as the Management team I enjoyed that they were actually hands on workers, and worked as hard as everyone else, and made us feel equal as employees."
bad,"Managed and trained a team of 15 both in permanent and contract /payroll. My core responsibility was to ensure the team achieve their individual targets, bringing large corporate accounts and delivering my personal target of RM 30,000 a month."
bad,"Manpower was a okay company to work for on the smaller local plant level! Being at Honda I learned lots from my time there! lots of issues with Office and the onsite supervisor and barrie branch manager! Co workers were great and still good friends with a few of them! Hardest part of the job was waiting for the parts to arrive lineside, and the most enjoyable part was the Parts quality people form honda!"
bad,"Estoy conforme con la empresa para la cual trabaje, ya que me dieron la oportunidad de formar parte de Waltmart y su equipo laboral. "
bad,I worked for E.on through Manpower the hours weren't too bad but didn't have much choice. Pay was good with a chance to increase IF they keep you on and that's a BIG IF. All I can say if you can't handle sticking to their compliance guides and you go wrong a couple of times it's see you later alligator. Felt uncomfortable working their because slowly one by one the team I started with let go and then it was my turn. There's literally be jobs all the time because of the HUGE Amount of people who get shown the door! Put me off temporary work for good!
bad,trop de turnover de personnel. Mauvais suivi des équipes. collègues agréables et professionnels
bad,"the hours went fast until the last two, same people every day although new ones came in, but there's no difference in routine. You're doing the same thing over and over each day."
bad,"My experience with Manpower is that at Exeter they do not really care about applicants. I had an appointment at Exeter and arrived in good time. The door was locked and they did not answer the bell. I had made a round trip of over 60 miles and paid for car parking. "

bad,"My job itself has been awesome. I enjoy working with my co-workers and coming in to the office everyday to so many smiling faces gives me more of an explanation (besides my family) as to why I love doing what I do. I have learned a lot moving from being an accountant for customer service at Genworth Financial to here. They have taught me lessons that could not be taught in a textbook or going through college but only through life experiences. I would say that the hardest part of my day is waking up Monday through Friday to get prepared for work, not knowing if it will be my last day in the office. Unfortunately, as contractors, we are not eligible for hire and there is no job security for the position held. It is definitely a scary feeling knowing that your job is not secured and that you do all that you can in the workplace (and do it well) not knowing if you're be able to maintain your family if anything happens with the contract between contractor and agency."
bad,the jobs manpower provided were low paying and not work the work. most of the people at the jobs were good people.
bad,"Empresa com alto Turn -Over  e dinâmica ."
bad,my review on all jobs is I love working with people and I am qick to catch on to new or old things
bad,"Well, I did variety of assignments. I don't like going door to doo trying to convince someone to do anything. i prefer working indoors."
bad,"assim que chego ,tenho sempre trabalho a minha espera..isso é bom porque sei que nao vou ficar aborrecido porque ir trabalhar e nao ter trabalho pra fazer é a pior coisa, porque 1 minuto se torna uma eternidade, de outro modo a hora passa,isso é bom. Os colegas é como em toda parte,a uns que nos damos melhor que outros. a parte dificil é ter que fechar sozinho porque algo que deveria ser o mais facil tornasse dificil porque a limpeza e muita,por vezes. a parte mais agradável é o salario no final do mes!"
bad,A typical work day for me was to make sure all the assembly line has product.The hardest part of my day was making sure that I keep up with the assembly line.The most enjoyable part of my day was having the satisfactating of getting the product out to the customer.

bad,J’ai travaillé là-bas pour avoir une paye en dessous de toute attente
bad,"They will get you a job but honestly: it isn't worth working with them in my opinion. They don't check their messages so when you leave one they don't even check it... I left one saying I wanted them to reassign me to a different job (and that I am not going to work for the company they assigned me to at that time since they had left me waiting out in 6 degree weather for 2 hours on my first day...) and they didn't check it for 2 WEEKS.... I got called 2 weeks after I had left the message asking why I ""haven't been showing up to work""... I explained to them that I left a message the very next day after my first day asking them to reassign me to a different company... They refused to believe me and marked me down as ""absent"" and put a strike on me... OH, and I didn't even get paid for that day until a MONTH later... I don't recommend this place AT ALL."
bad,"I worked thru them for places that needed employees for there company, I really want a fulltime job opportunity to work for without an temp agency to go thru."
bad,es trabajo por agencia lo cual priva de bastantes prestacione
bad,Branch Manager was completely inept.  I increased sales for the office by over 150 percent.  Filled professional positions for the South East Louisiana region and Ms. Gulf Coast.
bad,They were a decent temp agency to work for they just really need to offer positions that match your skills and what you are looking for. Other than that they were fine
bad,I was working at Philips through Manpower. I learned that temp jobs are not the best.Management at Philips was Ok to work for. The hardest part of this job was that I had triplets that I only would see for a few hr in the morning.
bad,"Manpower basically specialize in industrial jobs assignments.  Therefore, rarely would the agency have an assignment to meet my skills. Pay wasn't good."
bad,This service says that it is a place to gain full time employment with company you are temping for and is just not the case. When you call for question it takes so long for them to respond to a concern that it normally is never resolved nor address at all. You can call them repeatedly all you get is the run around
bad,"I love the work that I did for this company. The management was not professional at all. The Manpower Agency was awesome. But for Zoetis themselves, the management was poor."
bad,"Ploegendiensten."
bad,Working for a temporary agency is stressful at best because you did not know if and when the assignment was going to end. You also did not know if and when you would work again once the assignment finally did end.
bad,"8-10 hr. shift, safety procedures weekly, daily meetings."
bad,I found that manpowe could support their employee just a little bit more when they work for company.
bad,They are  always messing around on getting me started or accidentally taking me off the list for a job and not providing all the information of a job.
bad,"As with all  temporary employment services, there are limitations that only a permanent employer can provide like health insurance and retirement. But they tried."
bad,I didn't feel that manpower was there for me when I needed them. My contact was rude and hard to get a hold of. Would never recommend to anyone. I did not like them.
bad,"At first, working there was fine, there was the amazing hours and guaranteed 40 hour weeks. $10/hour wasn't bad pay if you lived near enough, but unfortunately I lived about a 40 minute drive distance. Now, when I first started, there wasn't any restrictions against false nails and polish because we all wore gloves when we worked, so it wasn't a big deal. But then a little over a year passed and suddenly it wasn't allowed. That's fine, things change, so it wasn't a big deal and everyone signed the new papers about what was okay and not okay. In the packet had no mention of make-up, no restrictions on that anywhere in it. On the 3rd, of July I decided to wear make-up in celebration of Independence day since we weren't going to be working. That day I got sent home for wearing make-up along with another colleague. That following tuesday our assignments ended. So, basically, we got fired for wearing make-up even though, we didn't know that it was something to not do."
bad,I enjoyed working for manpower i had a chance to meet some real nice caring people and i wouldn't mind working for manpower again if they have any jobs in baton rouge
bad,"At Manpower, my job mainly involve delivering goods ordered to customers addresses nation wide which was fun driving meeting with new people along the way. it was very challenging, as well as beneficial. it was from this experience gained I decided to pursued a career in accounting which evidence can be seen in my CV."
bad,"If you like being lied to and lied on then Manpower in Winchester, Virginia is the place to go. I'm still really disappointed that I wasted my time working for this company. "
bad,I worked for Manpower when it was privately owned and when it became part of corporate. I did not enjoy working for them once we were corporate; longer hours and the pay was less and I had to pay more for my benefits.
bad,"No work limited work limited work. limited work etc. I haven't been abled to secure work for this company in 2 years. They never call, and you have to search for other things."
bad,"Manpower is a temp service, they place employee at different locations for a temporary time. The communication between the employee and the individuals working the office was lacking."
bad,Needed full time employment not enough work. A bunch of promises not enough work. People were nice though. If employers are there and employment is study would consider going back
bad,"im working this company last 4 years the institution is not bad, i am searching a new opportuinity that is why i am leaving the company time any other good opportunity getting i am trying my level best to that organisation."
bad,This is a temp agency so can can't really give a good rating. You accept this position you are offered.  However the people I worked with helped me get the job that turned into a permanent position.
bad,"Very industrial type of work "
bad,"I had brought to the attention of my manager on site, there were no efforts and or lack of response to help me resolve the issue. I have yet to receive my first check."
bad,"Lack of communication , unorganized company , did get full benefits because its a temporary job , pay was good , worked 12 hours a day get payed weekly"
bad,"surveillance étude, récréation"
bad,My experience with manpower was that while they enjoyed the fruits of a contract that I simply continued working at the same rate of pay regardless of the length of the assignment.  They suck up the wages that employers used to pay workers directly for the value of their employment.
bad,I will never work for a temp-contractor again. Manpower soured my taste for any future employment with any type of company running this business model.
bad,"There were three lengthy steps to the application process. Upon completion of all three steps, I waited several weeks before being offered a job. It was also difficult getting in touch with recruiters at the branch location."
bad,This company is local and will find you temp assignments to get back into the work environment. Most jobs are well paid and very doable. Work schedule is on your terms.
bad,Typical day was very boring and was poorly managed. Workplace culture was bothersome. Lack of training effected productivity. The hardest part of the job was not enough communication with upper management.
bad,solo puedo decir de ellos que pagan el salario puntual
bad,In charge of assembly of industrial size cleaning machines. Worked on mostly all of the workstations there every person was in charge of different tasks.
bad,"Work from home full time which was great but no benefits or room for growth. Same job day to day, not much exciting. Management was great, no micromanaging which was really nice. Clients were nice too but definitely not something to continue long term."
bad,"Many jobs were done for a short period of time."
bad,This company placed me with my current employer and was ok to deal with. The pay i got thru them was not very good when compared to the position in which I was working in.
bad,"The best thing about ManPower is they do find you work. That saves the stress of finding work on your own."
bad,It's nice when you need income but never reliable. They toss you around because they know you'll stay as long as possible because you need the money. Should be fixed
bad,A typical day at work can be varied depending on the problems occurring during the week. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the ever changing environment.
bad,"Não tenho muito o q questionar, porém è uma agência de emprego e não temos muito contatos com a agencia."
bad,Por que faças é sempre pouco e mal pago. O empenho em fazer bom trabalho não é reconhecido.
bad,"Dealing with Class 1 and 2 drivers "
bad,"Manpower is loosing ground locally and in the market as whole.  Because of this loss, there was a ton of unnecessary and unfocused local pressure.  Perhaps from he top down but overall just no focus and undecided if we wanted to be day labor or true staffing partners."
bad,Manpower really tries to make their employees happy with their jobs. They will find a job that fits your needs and lifestyle as long as you communicate with them
bad,"Reasonable pay, however temp workers weren't told there was a hiring freeze at the company, so there was no chance of going permanent. Within 1 year, 23 out of 24 new temp hires had been let go."
bad,moyen peu etre améliorer ne repond pas toujours au email

bad,"Detta var mitt i lågkonjunkturen, det är svårt att ge en rättvisande bild av Manpower, dels för att jag var väldigt pressad och dels för att det av olika skäl såg ut som det gjorde på arbetsmarknaden. Jag avstår därför att recensera då betyget ej kan anses vara rättvist."
bad,"While I was working for Manpower they had sent me to UPS in Elizabethtown, KY. The job itself wasn't to bad but the building there is extremely hot in the summer and there isn't to much air flow. For someone like myself who gets hot easy, this isn't the company for you."
bad,Perfecta ubicacion de trabajo pero se genera un descontento con él trato al final del contrato
bad,I don't understand why they make you sign up for things but its never what it seem to be. Think it be a scam to get paid to see hoe many people can they put on.
bad,"I was thankful Manpower talked me into taking the job with Modern Marketing Concepts, however when it came time for MMC to hire me on I never got a call from Manpower asking me if I wanted the job or that MMC wanted to hire me on.  After being hired by MMC I was very impressed with the company, MMC.  I loved the people I worked with, I loved the hours, I loved the training I received."
bad,"Putting associates on an assignment. Background and drug screen. Interviewing, supervising 30 plus employees, payroll, and all administration work"
bad,CiOX would hire lots of people when work was plentiful and have big lay offs when work was scarce. Personally I disliked the work itself as well which factors into me leaving the company on top of many friends and coworkers there getting laid off (I lived with a lot of people and almost all of them worked there).
bad,"en daarna hoor je niets meer van ze !"
bad,I was supposed to get paid every week they paid me every two weeks.  It was a constent problem.  I worked for Greenville Metals as a fill in for a person in rehab.  It was short term assignment.  My job was to drive forklift and fill  50lb.bs barrels with 25lb. eggets.
bad,"You work, you get paid that's how it works in this company. No benefits and very small communication with branch associates."

bad,"Good for quick money, don't learn much on the job. A typical day is assembling products. You learn to work at a fast-paced environment, the management is fine and the co-workers are awesome! The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility and variety of jobs."
bad,i have worked many jobs through manpower. i have worked at factory's machine shops and done a lot of odd end jobs nut i have gained a lot of experience in many different fields and aspects.
bad,"this is not a job I would recommend to anyone, its boring and its not worth the pay and your standing on your feet for 8 to 12 hours."
bad,"great place to work if you need to get work asap, they keep work for you most of the time but be prepared for a job to end without notice"
bad,"I gave this company a two merely because the job they got me was at Raymond Corp and there was a good chance of getting hired on there. The experience at Raymond was great but dealing with Manpower was not a good experience. Starting off, my rep station shut down right after I was hired. So any time I needed them, it was a hunt for who was actually going to help me. I honestly wouldn't have cared about that but since they were not consistent with when pay day was (sorry but for some people the difference between Wednesday and Friday is pretty big, if Friday is your ""pay day"" then better to stick with Friday. People plan out their bills.) it got to be a little frustrating. As long as you are healthy and ready to go, you are good.Once I hurt my back outside of work, that was the end. Raymond was ok with my absence but Manpower dropped me."
bad,"Working for this company helped me realize how versatile I am in many different positions. They were thorough about testing people to match them to the right positions available to them - narrowing down their employee options with drug testing, background checks, and credit reports.  I can't say it was easy to get anywhere with this company.  It is set up to keep you continually employed with them. However, after a year of short term going out of business job assignments, they did offer me an opportunity for hire at a more permanent part time position.  Unfortunately, I could not accept that offer due to health problems that led to surgery at the time.  I did try to obtain employment with them again after a doctor's release, but was not considered a priority anymore, and did not get anywhere with this organization. They seem to focus more on jobs with companies that were about to go out of business, and just needed some short term help with last minute details."
bad,Manpower is a good resource for short term temporary work while looking for a more permanent position.  On a positive note it give the candidate an opportunity to work in different environments and decide if that is the company they would like to work for permanently.  Communication was fair.
bad,A typical work day involves interaction with the public as well as all construction personnel and equipment. Management and Forman's are great to work with. All my co workers work in harmony together.
bad,The employment agency will not place you in a position if you haven't worked with in six months of apply for a position. I feel this is crazy. There are a number of people out here looking for work that for some reason or another was not able to work for some time. Perhaps if they would place some of us in positions unemployment would go down.
bad,"	Lead employees with phone/email outreach to BCBSNC vendors and business partners to resolve service issues."
bad,"Pay not as competitive as I feel it should be. Assistance in finding a job not very successful. Not a good variety of jobs for my abilities, skill level, pay desired. Seems to be good if a person was interested in factory work. Staff very friendly."
bad,"I worked with Manpower for a very short time. I was assigned to work for a company, who had not so friendly supervisors and made the work environment miserable. I brought the issue to the attention of Manpower, but they weren't willing to help out."
bad,Manpower was a Temp Service. As jobs were coming in. They would call us to fill in for a company so to speak to get product out to whome ever the assignment were to be. Just something to fill a gap until something more permanant came through.
bad,"- daily work is to process documents of our clients and employees, helping our employee regarding to their benefits, give all satisfaction to their needs, meet all deadlines report, timekeeping, interview etc."
bad,Placed on assignment where distance traveled was far and had minor attendance issues however the company i was placed at wanted to hire me on and manpower overruled their decision.
bad,"lange uren en moeten beschikbaar zijn tussen 07u en 20u constant. Vaak veranderde de uren tot 3 x op een dag. "
bad,"Overall, my experience there was good, because its very easy for me to cope in any situation. I put my work ethic before any problems that the job may have endured just like I would do if there was any other job I worked at. I learned that no matter how good you think you may be doing, the decision of longevity will never be up to you as a temporary worker. Management was fairly decent. No actual problem but the communication could have been better. My co-workers made the job breeze by because on some difficult days we had to stick by one another to get the task done. The heat was the hardest part because it set up exhaustion and sometimes the bosses didn't take the actual steps to make sure we were safe. The most enjoyable part was learning new things, and being highly respected for the things I was able to accomplish. I became the person they depended on for the things they wanted accomplished."
bad,"Very diverse company, great cafeteria and fantastic view of the Milwaukee River!"
bad,I enjoyed working at the hospital.  It was exactly where I have wanted to work.  It was a fast paced and learning experience.  I learned all about patient care.
bad,Temp to hire place that never got me anywhere. Work they sent me out on i learned alot from it went from shipping and receiving to assembly line worker in different places alway temp to hire but never hire after time was up to do so.
bad,"management was good "
bad,"Doing odd jobs. Nothing really perminate. Setting up shelving, clean up areas. It was just a gereral lober job."
bad,No steady work once they stick you at a factory you only get work at that factory. If your not in with the line leads you get laid off alot
bad,"I worked at Perrigo threw Manpower, and the only thing that I can see about Manpower is that the pay is not good for the work that I did."
bad,"Pressão e bater metas era o principal."
bad,"There was not typical day at work since the job assignments varied. However, each job I had was much shorter in terms of duration than communicated prior to taking each assignment."
bad,Busy call center and management is horrible. It was a very stressful company to work for and the pay is very poor. Benefits are so bad they should not be offerred
bad,har man inget val så går det. men vill inte tillbaka till bemanningsföretag.
bad,A typical day at this job was very stressful and confusing. I didn't enjoy this job because it was very unorganized and it was hot.
bad,une journée de travail est des heures fix avec des possibilité de formation pour evolué et pouvant avoir different poste se qui évite la monolité. le plus dur sont le travail de nuit car tres long a force et tres fatiguant
bad,"absolutely loved the assignments, was good at my job and the company for which i was assigned to appreciated the hard work.,"
bad,I inspected contacts for damages and prepared for shipping.
bad,In the four years I was employed with Manpower they were constantly changing managers and staff.  The last year I was there they completely lost my resume'.
bad,with mapower spain.working in the factory is  a nice experience. and i was i can work for jark in u.k
bad,Dzień pracy rozpoczynał się informacją liderki na jakiej linii będzie praca a następnie ustawiałyśmy się na linii tak żeby praca szła nam sprawnie w taki sposób żebyśmy mogły spokojnie wyjść na 2 śniadanie a praca dalej trwała.Tworzyłyśmy zgrany zespół także liderka nie musiała nas ciągle kontrolować a technicy pracujący razem z nami na linii obdarzyli nas zaufaniem.Czasem potrzebowałyśmy pomocy  więc przychodziły osoby z innych linii.Przerwy śniadaniowe trwały 20 min-były o różnych porach.Czasem była zmiana produktu więc wtedy odbywało się sprzątanie linii I przerwa w pracy.Po 8 godz pracy również sprzątałyśmy linię.Następnie pracowniczy autobus rozwoził nas do domów.Kilka razy odbyło się szkolenie przeciw pożarowe I bhp.Minusem było to że zimą na rannej zmianie było bardzo zimno a latem gorąco.
bad,"Operated machines, completed shipping orders and returns."
bad,no longer work for them but they try very hard to find you a location to work at.
bad,"Temp agencies are good for only temporary work in my opinion. This one is no different. I was let go several times from the various companies, only to be rehired as a temp by the same companies. They promised permanent positions, but never delivered."
bad,operate injection molding machine.
bad,always getting sent home early
bad,"i was involved with an incindent at work, could not find mangement so i could go to hospital"
bad,temp job that unfortunately did not lead to full time position
bad,"Everyday I would rotate between putting bags in boxes, packaging bulk into the boxes, weighing the product, and palletizing the product. My co-workers were friendly and helpful."
bad,I didn't work here very long. They laid me off after a month. I did one thing all day long.
bad,Alot of part time factory temp jobs hours and jobs changed one of the factories I built parts for cars the other was for a perfume add distributer
bad,"This was only a temporary position. It was a good company to work for, seemed as though they had my best interest at mind."
bad,A normal day at BT conferencing via Manpower was straight to work. You come in sign in on your computer get your schedule and to work it is all the way till your shift ends. Some days there would be no lunch and no breaks.
bad,worked with some great companies. Job placement was consistant
bad,It was a ok job until two week in when they ran out of work and I couldnt get any hours
bad,"Accounts receivable, customer service, invoicing, manager was never there.....entire building reeked of cigarettes because all the employees stood with door open to smoke. (Basic Energy Services)"
bad,Good company. Sometimes stressful as demand far exceeded the available work force.
bad,"8 hours straight on your feet. Not much movement, the management and coworkers are disrespectful and rude. Hardest part of thisjob stay on your feet. Best thing..."
bad,I answer calls and provide information as needed. I have learned to become more persuasive with sales. I am genuine with customers. My mangers do the best that they can. I have made a lot of friends at work. There is not one specific thing that is hardest about my job.
bad,I felt that Manpower was a good temp agency. They did let me go over something stupid though. I asked too many questions. I honestly didn't know much about the job I was doing so I did ask questions just like anyone else would.
bad,"Job Security, learned alot about Computers Management the best"
bad,"They do have jobs avalible, but without a vehicle to get to the job, it seems to be a no win situation."
bad,when manpower sends you to a good assignment but when it ends its always a while before they find a new one
bad,"My day consist of general warehouse duties including shipping and receiving,loading and unloading,logging tracking numbers,and keeping a clean work area.Everything that I do here I am very experienced in.I never really go to know my co-workers because my assignment was terminated after a half a day's work.The hardest part of this job was being told my assignment ended before a full shift was worked.The enjoyable part was learning that this company makes promises that they do not keep, so I know not to go through them again."
bad,I enjoyed how you were very independent in the work environment and not that many rules just get the work done.
bad,"I was told I had an assignment at a bank. When I arrived, I took a typing test. No assignment was given. I had to give the recruiter my resume. What a wasted Friday morning."
bad,Started work there as an loading bay opertive. Managers and staff were pleasant to work with and helpful. Was working on agency first 3 weeks got offered work 5 out of 5 days. I would get a text every day to confirm my shift. But when I get there I would get sent home. This happend alot which wasted my time and travel cost. I tryed to put up with it as I got offered a contract with TNT start date 7th of January. The person running the agency was not nice nor helpful. I asked for a new pair off gloves and was given two left hand gloves. Went back to get a right and glove. The reply I got was I did that because your an inbread from nuneaton.
bad,the contractor I worked for was a very good contractor. we workin in the building of a new hospital. Management was easy going. they actually treated us like we mattered and were not just employees
bad,"erg leuk werk met veel jonge mensen om je heen, dat voelt fijn"
bad,"I believe it was a very good place to work."
bad,"the job comes with the same routine carried out everyday, with minimal supervision, with interactive , supportive  and well managed superior. The building ins't weather conditioned and can get extremely hot  cold depending on the outside weather."
bad,Uma empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar gostei imenso
bad,Typical day was just cutting wood or sweeping. I learned how to stack wood and cut wood perfect.Job was easy to do. Co workers were enjoyable to work with.
bad,A very fast paced and pressured environment. Put your best foot forward if you want to get anywhere in this company. you will be surrounded by some of the coolest people you will ever meet that will make the day just fly by.
bad,management sucked never took care of there employees fast paced got the day over quick
bad,Great job but manpower is getting on my nerves. I'm sick of waiting 5 day for my paycheck then 9 days the next week when you ask manpower about it they say well your pays not guaranteed to come until Friday if you get it sooner you're just lucky..... I can't wait to just get hired in and be done with manpowers nonsense 
bad,Basic 9 to 5. Have to make your full 40 hours a week. Be at work or have a real exuse.
bad,As Far as pay rate the jobs are good. as far as communication its poor. they only have 4 jobs and it takes a long time to get a new one. its fun besides the bs.
bad,"Manpower is a nice place to working at, nice vibe , excellent team work , fun place. the manager are very cool ,and working for manpower can help you with your school"
bad,"Was a temporary job 90 days and was for running the fork lift, reach, or cherry picker to stage and load orders"
bad,"forced to do 12 hour shifts 4-5 days a week plus work sat or sunday"
bad,warehouse skills are shipping and receiving;forklift;assembly and order puller; due to my past work experience at hewlitt Packard.
bad,"Aprendí a trabajar alegre y siempre unido con los compañeros de trabajo, porque todos eran bien lindos sobre todo lo ingenieros de seguridad , y otra gran parte de mi aprendizaje es a analizar y evaluar riesgos y peligros que amenazan en el trabajo."
bad,I work a couple of temporary with this job. The thing I did not was that you kept geting laid off. So you had to keep finding jobs. All the site I went to the head person would only keep a certain amount of us for a day.
bad,Was continuously harassed by supervisor who was there at the time. went out of her way to find ways to get me fired. caused me to have issues to find a new job. person has since been fired because of treatment of other staff but too late to help me with my case.
bad,"Excellent employer to work for , would recommend to family and friends. I enjoy working for them, they are always attentive and courtesy and also helpful"
bad,Great job when it comes to them placing me at safe workplace .Thanks for everything each years of your services. I look forward continue working with the company.
bad,"Manpower is a temp agency that provides labor  for any one in the bay area. I have worked here in two different occasions, one for fed ex and two in a line of needle production."
bad,"I took a typing test and was able to advance in my skills, as well perform the duties, meeting all internal deadlines and completing tasks."
bad,work was fun only problem i had was they only have jobs out of the county where i live and travel can be hard alot of the jobs are only temp jobs and they say 90 day probation period but it turns in to like a year but its a great place to work for if you have a car they always have openings
good,"Manpower es una contratista que tiene mucho que desear, mejores empleos y mejores salarios."
good,It was a  different environment.  The Director I supported would not delegate work.  Very controlling which made it quite difficult to do my job. In addition the firm had a skeleton crew of administrative assistants who were stretched to thin.
good,"Typical day at work begins with escalations that will arise out of ego issues with the top notch... Simple things that need a small touch and can go on and on if not pampered at the grass root level."
good,Assigned to various temporary assignments.  My recruiter was a very sweet and supportive with assisting with work.  I would recommend Manpower to anyone who is looking for work.
good,Learned about Wire Transfer and meeting deadline for Customers
good,My job was great but the hours changed all the time! always worked weekends! I was only off two days a month!
good,"Very fun work enivornment, would manually punch-in coming in to work and manually punch-in. Then, would proceed to go about the day's task. Work tended to become mundane at times, but overall the enthusiasm of the workers made a mundane and tedious day tolerable. Temporary work. Company offered just what I was looking for."
good,I enjoyed working for them but job security is an issue i have with them.
good,working in a shop. How to grind and buff out parts that had to be painted. It was a very noise place to work in.
good,I have been send to one work place so far at Melwood. I earned how to work with adults that are not like me. I enjoy working with people. The management was all was there to answer and thing I had to ask.The co- workers was very nice and helpful. I hardest part on the job was getting to know everyones names. the most enjoyable part of the job was get to learn something new.
good,A typical day at work invovled data entry all day. I learned how to process record requests. Management was invovled with employees. My co-workers were older and close to retirement. The hardest part of the job was starring at a computer all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was dress down Fridays.
good,I came in and reviewed loans. I wasnt there long enough to get a good feel of it.
good,"Management, had no control on what the places that I worked for the places they sent me to were places that were very advanced , thus I could not keep up with the requirement."
good,"Management was friendly. You never knew when the job would end. The best part was getting paid every week, meeting different people and learning different jobs"
good,It's not that great of a place to work for a long period of time. They put you in jobs  that don't train very well or expect you to know the job the first few days. The places that they place you at don't hire in until you work there for five months at the  minimum and up to two years for the maximum. Manpower is not that great of a place to work in my opinion  the pay isn't much over minimum wage for the amount of work that they make you do.
good,"Stressful work environment, cut-throat, very competitive.  Management did not convey information to staff, led to hostility in the office.  Workforce reduction only made for more problems."
good,For temporary jobs it was ok. However there was not that many job placements that they called me for. The comunity just did not seem to have that much of a need for workers through manpower.
good,8 to 5pm You will learn if you really like working with people. Dealing with rude people. Going home on time is the most enjoying part of the job.
good,"A day at work is stressful"
good,Got hurt on the job and they let me go. Didn't offer to find me anything while I was put on light duty. Once I was released from the doctor they acted like I never existed.
good,"I work closely with people who need assistance daily such as calendars, appointments, and errands. Management is ok, they enjoy picking on their employees and have unfair rules. So if you get your arm cut off and have a doctors note to present and of course no arm as proof, you willl not be able to provide the note due to stupid rules. that also goes to if your child dies and you need to go to the funeral, Manpower will not accept any kind of documentation saying so and will doc you on your attendance points."
good,Es de las empresas que te mantiene con un sueldo sin antiguedad y salario minimo
good,They were able to find me a single temporary contract which did not materialize into any form of long-term stable employment.
good,"low pay and no raises. also poor benefits. slow job placements, poor insurance, not very job safe, most jobs are high demanding for less money."
good,"The work conditions were terrible-could not get paid on time, wasn't happy-Glad when assignment was over"
good,Too many changeovers in Management position...very unorganized.
good,"I started at this job08/2013 and is currently looking for another job, they expect ur life to revolve around this job and don't care about your child or anything going on in ur personal life the hire through employment agencies, and say you have the opportunity to become permanent but dont make u permanent"
good,"Production of frame and door components of Toyota Solara."
good,"It was kind of an unorganized facility. Every night they had me running around to different sections of the building,"
good,"trabalhar nesta empresa não e grandes coisas , no meu ponto de vista a gerencia e péssima não trata os funcionário com devido respeito"
good,Some assignments didn't match my skills. No further comments
good,"Collecting pamphlets and putting them together for events.I learned how to enteract with diverse cultures,that was fun.Co-workers were nice and helpful.I enjoyed meeting people.The hardest part of the job was finding my way around."
good,I learned alot at where I was assigned. I loved the job and the people at assignement. However Manpower staff stated they didnt have time to talk to associates they had to keep the phone lines open for customers.
good,"Performed tour of the main factory. Answered questions about H-D Company, history and factory. Assisted in the tourists’ safety while on tour of the factory."
good,temp service. worked in a ware house and did inventory the staff were ok. hardest part of job was having big shipments that took all day
good,Temp agencies themselves are helpful for finding placement but this agency in Florida seemed to be very hands off. The benefit I recieved was that I was placed as a temp employee for a great company.
good,The work place was one of those very fast moving environments where things were explained to you later on when it was too late. Need more good trainers.
good,"I was the lone selector who selecting every outgoing order for the assignment they provided me.What I learned is not every company values there employees,and there is nothing like direct hire.The management cares very little for the real life situation there employees may encounter,and that as an employee your the equivalent of a slave;due to the fact that i worked for an assignments who treated and spoke to the temps as if they were slaves.The co workers were both apleasure to work with and very friendly.The hardest part of the job was being spoken to in a disrespectful manner and knowing ii had to deal with it to pay my bills.The most enjoyable part of the job was the physical labor aspect."
good,"worked starting out in manufacturing, low pay and unreliable jobs."
good,"Processed Magazine Subscription, renewals and cancelled subscriptions."
good,"No comment other than the pay was great, they negotiated an excellent salary."
good,"i was employed in 1998 with this company. I was Being abused and stocked by my ex room mate. I would get harassing calls at the temp jobs, how my ex room mate got the number, Man power gavethe number out, stated it was told it was an family emergency. Long story short, room mate would not stop calling the job I was missing calls and the supervisor I was working with complained. Manpower called me at the job and told me that they were letting me go because I could not handle the busy astosphere. I tried to explain to them what was going on andthey did't care. I don't know how they are now but this is how it was then."
good,"If you are not sure as to what you would like to do, it is a good way to test different fields. Also gives you a feel for the companies themselves, and the options that are available."
good,Its better to have a part time job than to wait and not get called. Seems they dont want to pay unemployment so the contracts are often short. Managers/recruiters arent altogether attentive to ones needs or desires in regards to stability.
good,"New locations and always getting to meet new people hard to get a job but once you become a a everyday worker more jobs came my way, if u work hard enough at it u can get a pernament job with one of the facturys the agency land u"
good,No fue una experiencia positiva. Al principio muy ilusionada porque cumplía mis objetivos de ventas. Reclamé que las compañeras que entraron al mismo tiempo que yo atendían al día entre 10 y 20 llamadas y yo llegue a atender 60- Me dijeron que me había tocado a mi. No se porque me despidieron. Cumplía mis objetivos de ventas diarios el 23%. Sólo me dijeron que no había pasado el periodo de  prueba. Realice la contratación de 42 pólizas y no cobre nada por ellas.
good,"Standing for long periods of time around strong chemicals that was effecting my breathing it was to strong for me some days, we never got off on time which had me late to school most mornings but over the people I was working with was cool and funny the management was terrible and confusing"
good,I did not actually work at a Manpower location.  I worked through Manpower as a temporary employee at Pinnacle Foods Group.  I have worked at Pinnacle Foods as a Financial Analyst since August 2017..
good,"If you  expect to be hired full time do not apply.  I've worked 40+ hours for this company for a year,  had excellent attendance,  and learned multiple areas of the warehouse, exceeding expectations everywhere I went.  And never got more than 10.50 an hour with no benifits."
good,Manpower sent me to a company at JPMorgan Chase in Lewisville as a data entry clerk/lockbox. Worked there for 2months only to be let go for production. Now the requirement to work there you have to be able to key alpha numeric 8500/9000. I keyed over 11000 now something not right on their end. I believe they use that excuse as a reason because work volume was getting low. This company stay hiring because they can't seem to keep anyone. Very strict company to work for.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to learn new skills and people, and the worst part was repetitively lifting the heavy trays all day long."
good,"Não existe reconhecimento algum do colaborador, apenas cobranças desnecessarias ."
good,Management always played favoritism also threatened to fire us if we went to some hire then them . management was also prejudice. They talk to you like your not a human. It was nice working there and we had enough breaks just very very poor supervisors.
good,For a temp service sending out laborers. This is a good place to work. Safe environment. Wages are good not excellent. If its just seasonal job placement. They can help. There is room for advancement. Very productive day
good,"The salary they offer is always at the bottom for the work you do."
good,This is a temporary agency where you are placed with an employer for a period of time either short term or long term until the employer either hires you or you complete the part time assignment.
good,"This company was unprofessional and unorganised, there was no room for progression. The staff that worked there made the day more enjoyable - if you are looking for a stepping stone workplace this is the right company to go for."
good,Worked for them for a year and wasn't paid very well. No opprutunity for advancement.Poor communication from supervisors and staff.
good,"sent to various jobs, most lasted 2 months some good pay low pay. only issue I had with them is not letting you know when a job end I would show up at a job site and find out I was no longer needed."
good,"terrible management as far as pay on time and employee issues, the people they have in charge of the production department only promote their friends unless they get fired before they have a chance to do so if they can't promote their buddies they pick people that will also cover up the unfair pratices."
good,"It's a Temp. Agency. I was sent to be a data entry clerk at a warehouse. On a typical day, you show up to work and key in whatever is on each pallet. Everything must be entered and precises because it's all going to be sent to the repair center. My typing skills improved...somewhat. Management was helpful as far as providing the proper equipment for back support. There was no room for advancement or raises. The worse part about the job was having to deal with the heat and the cold in an aluminum warehouse. They did provide Gatorade.....up  until a certain point other than that you'd have to bring your own water."
good,I worked for Manpower in NM for 1 1/2 years and when my last assignment ended and they were not able to place me with another position I filed for unemployment and they tried to challenge my eligibility.  Plus all the jobs I was getting were all temporary and I have been looking for a permanent position with decent pay which they have not be able to supply.  Plus you receive no benefits don't work for Manpower they treat you like you are not worth their time.
good,"Could be a great place to employed, but the managers and supervisors doesn't push their employees enough to do so. The job isnt hard at all by far the easiest work ive ever done in my work experience."
good,"Manpower is a good temp agency. when I'm out of work, i always am able to get a job with them even if its for a day or so, but sometimes the process takes awhile."
good,"I loved where I worked, through Manpower, and the people I worked with. It was a fast paced environment and also a busy place to work. I liked being on first shift and having my weekends off."
good,"El trabajo fue para uno de los clientes de manpower, DIRECTV lo cual quedé muy inconforme con los horarios de trabajo, los días de descanso y el jefe"
good,Would love to find a company to work Full-time /career opportunity.Would like to find a job with benefits and a place to call home.
good,I was happy that I was allowed a position at the mine. I did  not expect lay-offs to come so quickly however. 14 hours a day shifts are not for the faint hearted for sure. Especially while only getting paid for 12.75 of those hours.
good,My rating is sole based on the lack of communication with management.  They fail to reach out to their employees for any concerns or employment.
good,manpower is only good for 2-3 days of work in a given weak .which is not good. they send me out on bad jobs .every one i work for is thinking  that people are a dime a dozen . all thow that may be true they don't have to be a but about it
good,A typical day was to greet and meet victims of Hurricane Sandy and make as many appointments as possible to get homes rebuilt.   My learning curve was to understand policy and procedures within the Department of Buildings.  I manage many applications a day for approval to the next level in order to ensure the recovery process began to fix the homes of the victim. Co-workers were supportive when available. The hardest part of the job is working with non- team players and the most enjoyable part is assisting a homeowner put their lives back together.
good,"they are ok they are a temp agency"
good,I did not mind working for company but I did not have much interaction with any of their employees. I worked with employees of the company we contracted out too. Management is not very respectful and they are rude.
good,"An expected  amount of work was completed by end of day.  I learned how to inspect  for dents, out of date labels, broken seals, damages and leaks.  "
good,Its really just a temp service that holds you in there system and call you for random assessments at your local Walmart or such
good,A typical day a work was ok because I was able to look over negativity. Some of the coordinators were mean and had nasty attitudes. They talked to you like you were kids. You had no say so. This position had job security and no income stability. They would send you home so other people could work in your place like you had no responsibilities. They would only give you a certain amount of hours a week. Coordinators had alot of family working under them which caused alot of favoritism and mess. They would tell you one thing and do another. Your pay is almost always messed up. They would tell you one thing and later on it would change and they would give ou any notice.
good,"Typical day varied by where I was placed at the time.  I usually worked with state employees, doing their jobs for them.  At my second assignment, I got so much done that my supervisor received a $1500.00 bonus for the work that I did."
good,"The jobs that were provided were good and were fair in pay, but when each job was done the managers at the Manpower facilities were not at all good at having more work lined up when each job was done. I feel if you have a worker that has great surveys done on him/her then then you should have more work lined up so they keep making money for themselves and the company. A person sitting at home waiting for a call for work is not making money for the company."
good,I was contracted to work at a company for 6 months but was lead to believe it would be longer by the direct supervisor I was working under.  I was also lead to believe this was a direct office position & that I would not be working with clients.  The co-workers I did work with were very helpful  & willing to train as required.  I did learn quite a bit within this industry I was assigned to but there was no real chance for a permanent position as most of the employees had been working there for at least 5 years or longer.
good,"Job was temp to hire but I wasn't hired, I worked hard and didn't complain much I got all the hours i could want and more. The hard part was all the manual labor but it wasn't anything I'm not use to."
good,"A sub-contract of a sub-contract of a sub-contract etc., with American, Ontario and Quebec companies involved.  Because of the various borders, there were too many loopholes that allowed many involved to too conveniently overlook substance abuse issues which compromised the safety of the work sites.  Also, billing methods were manipulated, with work schedule regulations requiring certain amounts of time off for a given period being flaunted, etc.  The pay was only interesting because after a 44-hour week the rate was time-and-a-half (I averaged 53 hours per week).  A textbook example of everybody looking the other way because that's just the way it's done."
good,"i worked as a machine operator for car parts, work wasn't that hard in the beginning but did get harder."
good,"Typical day at work is answering 50-60 inbound phone calls and request."
good,I was used regularly which was nice and mostly used in the Clark County School District - different divisions
good,a fast pace job learned the proper way to stack boxes had fun working with my co workers hardest part when they overload us with work most enjoyable when the line clear
good,"This was bad career move, cause of the company not backing me up and doing little nasty things to me like using my overtimers up so if I needed a replacement there would be none available to me."
good,"I started with the company in October of 2011. They sent me to a job for second shift. The company took me on permanently. The job is now being out sourced to the Phillipines. I had requested they call me when a day shift job opened up. They only called me after I was taken on permanently with two other night shift jobs. I am now going to be unemployed as of 09/15/2012. Not really happy with the way things went. I feel I am a very valuable person. Hard worker, dependable, reliable and good team player. I feel I would be a good asset to any company."
good,"I was let go when my dad passed away and never called back. There is absolutely no job stability. We had a meeting everyday before the shift started so we knew what was going on and what our quota was, but you would see people coming and going nonstop"
good,Learned about Vaccine production
good,i have worked for manpower for 9 years and just recently in a cost cutting procedure have been made redundant.
good,good temp service that provides various jobs to choose from. They try to match your skills to the type of work you are looking for.
good,"I've done very good work for them in the past, then got employment somewhere else.  Once I was looking for work again, they always gave me the excuse, (as soon as something becomes available, we'll let you know.  It was 7 years later that they all of a sudden called me to fill a job position.  Poor management."
good,It's never enough hours people never want to show up so that puts more work on other people it's not set hours the best part about the job is the swing shift
good,"You are a number."
good,"I'd only advise someone to get a job through Manpower if they just needed a job. The last person I worked with was just AWFUL. I've worked through them several times at some nice companies that I probably couldn't have gotten into otherwise. However, the last one put a bad taste in my mouth."
good,"Ne prend pas en compte votre rémunération, Manpower propose des salaires au SMIC alors qu'on a 10 ans d'expériences."
good,felt like just a number here no room to advance or even get hired in by company work at .  vacation time based on number of hours worked were so high you could probably never reach it
good,"If placed in the right company you have a chance to advance. But if not you are just used to work until the company no longer needs you as an employee. If Man Power would have better job placement, they may have a lower turn around rate."
good,Things were all well and good then company I was working for went in a different direction and since this occurred ManPower hasn't had the time of day for me.  I call and they say they have zero jobs Zero.  I find it hard to believe this is true since they are a temporary job agency.
good,"I worked for Pacific Crest Research with them. The automatic dialer called people in all 50 of the United States to conduct, verbatim read off the computer screen, surveys with people of varying demographics. It was always hard when we had called during dinner time or a natural disaster such as a hurricane."
good,Centered around one main focus of work hardly had work. Couldn't support my family with this job. Favoritism towards other labor hands would give more work to people that they like rather than the people that actually worked
good,Job assignments were temporary and I found it harder to get hired in full time through a company I was  placed with. Pay rate varied and was hard to determine a budget when your switching jobs every 90 days.
good,"Once you accept the contract, you soon after become aware that you're just a means to their bottom line.  If you experience any difficulty, it is best that you figure it out on your own."
good,It all depends were you are placed. I worked 12 hour days and lots of overtime. Manpower is fine and help out when you need them to for the most part.
good,The leads in the job site only speak Spanish. Lack of leadership. Training was lacking due to language barrier. No one tells you exactly what your job is or what you are supposed to do.
good,The atmosphere the workers the many things you learned about the auction business works the most enjoyable part of the job as locating the cars to be sold and auctioning them off on auction day fun place to work
good,Il vous trouve de bonne mission sont à l'écoute mais au niveau service paie ce n'est pas du tout sa surtout si vous avez besoin d'un acompte en urgence admettons vous travaille 19 au 23 mars il faudra attendre le samedi 31 mars pour faire une demande d'acompte alors que dans tout autre boite d'intérim vous le demander le 26 il vous font déjà cette vous avez que l'argent le jeudi ou vendredi alors que Manpower 48 h après la demande si ce n'est pas un samedi ou qu'il n'y a pas de hour fériée entre deux dans ce cas là beaucoup plus long
good,"Good wayto get your foot in the door at a company weekly pay check was really nice, only one raise, too many saftey restrictions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"overall not a bad place to work, but there all temp and low paying, very nice people, always tries to help but there all low paying jobs and bouncing around job to job is stressfull"
good,The client for MPG was horrible at the time I worked there. That was my only experience with MPG.  They may have better clients but they were very un-organized and things changed on a constant basis. That was partly the clients fault.
good,"Long hours and little pay, no time off. Management is not willing to speak up for you. You are basically a number to fill out the commitment of the contract."
good,"Excellent place to work, great people, and great work place culture.I would highly recommend to anyone looking for work. The staff is great and accomodating"
good,"I worked for Manpower as a temporary worker.  I asked many times to work in an office, but they only offer factory jobs.  "
good,Management continues to make promises on addressing the unfair payout of bonus but changes have yet to happen. Salary/wages are too low for the positions/titles which you are employed.
good,"Good place for temporary work, but look elsewhere for long term carreer.  Disorganized, so be persistent if you need info or  trying to fix a problem,"
good,Placed in position with limited training. Little support from employer and very little management interaction/support. Very little improvement of skill sets. No advancement or input on advancement opportunities.
good,"They were honest with me and gave me my first opportunity to break into automotive.  The benefits were not great, but they gave me my opportunity to prove myself."
good,No information to give - there was few people who would work nd answer the call sent to their extension - I tried to take messages 80% of my day and deliver those messages to their recipients with employees who also were under worked and underpaid
good,The company provides temporary employment opportunities and underpays you. I worked for a construction company ands was unfortunately injured due to an incorrect installation on the job site. I was asked to resign during my recovery.
good,manpower should be a place that helps people find the right career path not randomly place their workers in dead end factory positions and they do not do the previous statement
good,Manpower pays pourly and gets rid of people as soon as they don't have jobs to put them in. Never meet any kind of management or someone close to an management. When you had something to be taken care of no one helped you.
good,"I liked working for the place but they got rid of me after my 3 months trail so they wouldn't have to pay benefits. I did learn quite a bit from the Armark company and manpower. That helped me in the upcoming jobs I had the other years. I was able to use the tape machine better, and learn how to fax on computer verses fax machine."
good,"i do not have anything to say about the company, I only worked a few assignments and they were not long enough for me to comment one way or the other."
good,"Temporary service, they provide temporary jobs to which you either work or you do not. Not much room for advancement and placement can be questionable at best."
good,Very fast pace job it is very hectic and a lot of paperwork to sort through can sometimes get confusing. They rush you because they have a time limit and it's only seasonal so their peak season is mostly in April.
good,A typical work day at Manpower is very stress full. You never knew what to expect. I learned that you can be replace at anytime. The hardest part of the job was working with attitudes from the manger. He would bring his home life to the office.
good,"lot of openings, but that time my skills were not matching to the requirements, hence stretch out the skills I have and learn in IBM a lot"
good,"Okay place, and okay people. Too little employment provided. Needs to provide more employment options. I do not work AT this place, I work for another employer through this place."
good,Decent work place but quick to replace people. They are a temp agency so most times it's hard to get hired on at a location because of money  loss. Most of the jobs barely pay enough but overwork you.
good,Primeiro emprego na área de rh...foi um ótimo início....muito stress e pressão na empresa-clientes e funcionários-chefias
good,Every week or so I would have a new assignment. It was a great way to experience different job fields. The pay was reasonable for the jobs you were chosen.
good,Good place to find a job that will hire full time if work hard enough. Working with manpower gives a foot in the door to the carreer wanted
good,"I work from 8am-4pm I work at Hearthside Quality Foods. A typical for me is we pack bags of broken Granola pieces on boxes of 6. We also inspect them for holes in the bag, and the quality and amount in the bag, It's a fast-paced job and we also have to keep our work area clean, free from granola pieces, make sure we have plenty boxes."
good,"IBM är ett bra jobb att landa på när du kommer till Irland, men det är inget ställe att stanna på. Språklön (inte mer lön oavsett om du talar fler språk till skillnad från många andra ställen i Dublin)"
good,I had good luck working with Manpower in the past. The amount of  availability a person has can really help with job placement. Keep checking back in with them for upcoming work.
good,Didn't help much in obtaining full time employment with benefits. Was laid off without having further employment. BCBS is outsourcing so there isn't any other jobs available at this time. This means I have a lay off time until I can find another job.
good,"unprofessional, un reliable, no values in their employees. they were not compassionate with certain situations. When asked for information, sometimes it wasn't given, or when it was, it took alot of time to recieve it"
good,"Temp position at Vermeer in Pella. Excess mandatory overtime,short breaks. Poor management on assembly line I worked on. Was told by management that I was good quality minded worker but doubt I would consider another position at this particular employer"
good,"•	Will responsible on day to day transaction of backup their file day and night."
good,"The job (Amway) was physically demanding, the pay was average. They ONLY have temp workers so they do not have to worry about paying for insurances. The temp service would not listen to their workers. There was no Job Sercurity."
good,Congtract employees are consistantly disrepected and degraded in every possible way
good,"Provided a service for members of the community. Worked with very nice people. You gotta have patience dealing with the public, The hardest part of this job is when you can't help someone who is getting their service turned off. I enjoyed meeting people everyday, especially the elderly. They leave you with some good advice."
good,"great co workers"
good,I dd any thing that they needed done. I learned not to work for them again since I got low paid. The coworkers was ok. The hardest part of the job was to listen to other coworkers when I knew how to do things faster and safer.
good,"I enjoy working in collections. I am  responsible for contacting customers regarding payment for overdue bills, loans or mortgage payments. Locate customers using credit bureau information, background checks, loan documents, and other paperwork or databases.I learned how to  follow federal and state laws dealing with debt collection while handling  inbound and outbound calls."
good,I think working at II Stanley was a lot of drama. I liked my working there because I liked my job. I just didnt agree with a lot of things going on in the work place. It was disfunctional and unorganized.
good,"Had the chance to work for various companies, lots of temporary jobs nothing ever permanent.  Weekly pay is very nice but no benefits."
good,"They were a temporary service for Accugear. 2 1/2 yrs ago when I went to them to find a job, their staff were very helpful and friendly, professional. So my experience with them was short,"
good,"Filled temporary positions as a machine operator applying labels to products by machine that required attention to detail, multi tasking, mechanical aptitude to maintain and troubleshoot equipment. deadlines, production quotas, sterilization of equipment per sanitation guidelines with paperwork to meet required standards for production of each item."
good,I was at Avago Technologies through manpower and they have no people skills. Great for skill set and good for the permanent people but treated temporary workers horribly.
good,"son dias relativos en cuanto al movimiento hay dias pesados donde no tienes tiempo ni de ir al baño, aprendi que el movimientode un aereopuerto no es facil,la orden de jefes y superiores es ningun montacarguista puede acender por conocimientos que tenga,algunos compañeros como en muchos trabajos aperentantan trabajar recargando labores propias de ellos a otros,lo mas dificil del trabajo estar en un cuarto frio en montacarga sin generar ningun movimiento solo acatando la orden del supervisor,la calides humana de los compañeros."
good,This job was for extra money. Kinda an all over the place type of job for temps. We really didn't work the hours that was offered when offered the job cause the plantthat I worked kept closing down.
good,"agent de production"
good,"I enjoyed being part of a newly developed department.   During my time with Manpower I was allowed to expand my skillset to encompass more technology.   However, it was a very volatile workplace where you were unsure if you would have a job one day to the next as lay-offs and changes were happening monthly.   The people of Manpower are trulyw hat make this place valuable more than anything."
good,the assignments I was granted were short but I was never short of another job from man power.
good,"The jobs varied from typing, filling, answering and routing telephone calls. Greeting and registering visitors and vendors. Documentation and file creation."
good,"Manpower stuurde mij als uitzendkracht naar Dynafix. Ik moest hier het magazijn beheren en orders picken. Ik werkte met een verouderd systeem dat niet meer klopte maar dat mooie cijfers naar voren bracht waar het management indruk mee probeerde te maken op de controleurs die af en toe langs kwamen. De werkdruk was door dit systeem absurd hoog en niet logisch. Het management liegt wat bij elkaar om de werknemers tevreden te houden. Collega's waren oke, sommigen was het lastig om mee te communiceren omdat ze weinig Nederlands spraken. Je wordt er zonder pardoes uit gegooid als ze je niet meer nodig hebben of als je te duur bent. Vast contract kun je vergeten. Als je voor management gaat moet je bereid zijn de billetjes te spreiden."
good,They find me temporary jobs ranging from 2-14 days long. Most of the time they don't have a chance for advancement or full time openings.
good,"On a typical day, I would unload truck, afterward, I would then proceed to cleaning up the warehouse."
good,"The leadership skills I learned is the impetus behind why I am looking for a management role in this community."
good,"Was ok, but you wasn't secured for any jobs.You never knew how long you would be working for a company."
good,Working for Manpower was a good experience for me get experience and skills for the clerical field.
good,A typical day at work I learned to do work in a fast past work studyi the manager was cool the hardest part of the job is having to work in a fast past the enjoyable part is that i got to learn something new
good,regular trato aprendi a seleccionar y sellar y el compañerismo en puente piedra mis compañeros muy buenos el jefe de man power no es comprencible lo dificil era sellar en maquinas muy rapidas pero pude hacerlo lo que mas me gusto fue el compañerismo y el refrigerio que nos otorgaban gratis
good,"I liked it at first. But then I got hurt at a job so that job let me go. So until they could find something, but they never did."
good,"The company is okay, but I would rather have a full-time job."
good,"Everyday was different with them. Depending on what assignment you were on, depend on if you were at one location or not. The jobs offered paid well but they were never anything permanent. You didn't really have a manager, just someone that might change next week that you reported in to. Different co-workers at each assignment, but I am able to adapt well to changes."
good,A good agency to work for. At the moment they dont have any openings.
good,The Temporary workers were treated with disgust and disdain. Had no representation while on the job. Manpower had no concern about how we were treated as long as they got their money.
good,"factory work mostly, environment changes constantly. Most places need people for the grunt work. the heavy lifting or tedious work that the full time employees don't want to do."
good,"I only worked two jobs with this company, so I really dont have much experience.But I do know that there arn't many jobs as I though it would be."
good,A typical day at work consisted of working hard at the assigned position although it was temporary. The mangement and co-workers were usually very helpful the first day but needed me to be educated by the next day of the job I was hired to do. This made me study harder and develop better listening skills. I also learned how to work various office equipment as well as meet individuals on the phone or in person. Overall my jobs enhanced a great deal of experience in being professional while treating others as I would want to be treated. The hardest part of the jobs was finishing the assignment. the most enjoyable part of the job was being paid weekly.
good,"As I had said, only a part time job, working hour not stable, sometime you had to work at 4:30 am, or only 2 hours work."
good,"buen trabajo,buena relacion con los companeros de trabajo,trabajar duro para ganar lo mas posible."
good,"Extremely busy working environment which was great for those easily bored, however the manager allowed very little downtime even on weekends. Many times when you were off for the weekend or in the middle of the night, you would be called in to supply an employee for certain employers."
good,I Couldn't get flexible hours for mentoring. and would constantly change hours.
good,I enjoy working for manpower
good,There wasn't fairness to being a temporary employee versed a permanent employee..where responsibility  wasn't enacted when it came to taking responsibility for your wrong decisions making when it came to permanent management decisions overall.
good,Serviço temporio chances efetivação. Serviço bem puxado. Pra quem tiver desempregado vale a pena
good,"Seminer, işe kabul, işe başlama ve bir ayı tamamlamadan iş feshi. Bu arada başka yerlerden gelen iş tekliflerini kaybetmiş bulunmaktayız. Kamuda istihdam edilecek insanlar kendi ülkelerinin arşiv araştırması adına veya mahkeme kararlarına bakılarak işe uygunluk kararı verilmemelidir.şirketle çalışılmaya başla dıktan sonra. Fesih yerine başka alanlarda istihdam  imkanı varsa oraya "
good,bonne boite d'iterim mais toujours une insécurité de poste
good,"Packaging Rayovac batteries on different machines. They are sent out to many different stores. The job is pretty easy, can also be boring. Management specifically at Rayovac is very poor."
good,"There is little room for advancement unless you get in good with the management team. The wages are low starting off for being such a well off company. The leadership team will only notice or promote you as long as you are brown nosing, and/ or throwing others under the bus. A lot of promises are made, but the company falls short."
good,"This is not the first time that I worked for Manpower. I have worked with them in the past. The different Manpower policies vary from state to state. Where here, there was a possibility to get hired on with the company that you worked for, in the past, it was difficult to get hired with the company that you work for past 89 days."
good,"Since they only have a few jobs they try to keep you as a contractor employee as long as they can since they get a percentage of your pay, I got paid 15.00 an hour they got 3.00 for every hour I worked charging my employer 18 and hr. I was a contractor for 3 an 1/2 years, with no sick pay or vacations. I was not hired as a full employee by the company that I was assigned for since it was cheaper for them to keep me as a contractor. Manpower did not do anything to help my cause, the only thing they did was try to keep me as content as possible so I wouldn't leave."
good,The place is more for industrial work. Lack of communication. It depends on the position applied for I worked as a temporary worker and they don't have enough jobs for office positions.  The staff that answers the phones are polite and professional. The person that places you at companies sometimes does not place you for the type of jobs you are looking for.
good,You will be laid off and if your not you will have low wages. Send you to a job for 2 days then call and say your assignment is done and have nothing for you. No permanent jobs. They say temp to hire but your basically temp for a while.
good,It's good to help find temprory work until u find something more permanent. It is a temp agency bthey help u find work. It is a good fall back not a long term career worthy job tho.
good,management was ok up until i had an personal issue that they did not try to understand or care to know what happened and just had me fired after being with the company in that position for a year. After I have tried multiple times to communicate with them communication with supervisor or agents was horrible. they return calls and you never know when they are in the office to speak with them even during very urgent times.
good,"I've held various positions working at Manpower, some good some not worth mentioning. This is not the fault of the agency since they don't know if you will enjoy the assignment you're given until you actually work there."
good,It is a temporary job no matter where you work or for how long. where I worked was great but no benefits. The benefits they do offer like health insurance is too expensive and they don't match 401k.
good,its fast paced long hours and not good pay. they need better management. people are childish and the managers do not do their jobs as they should. the good part about it if you work all the hours you want you can make good money and you get paid every week.
good,I enjoyed the people i worked with at the job but due to no opportunity to become a full time employee at the company or receive any benefits and is temporary makes it hard.
good,I loved this job until there started to be a conflict with another employee that was a good friend of the manager.  Favoritism was played.  Made job very stressful.
good,"They were relatively fast in finding me employment, until I ended up with a criminal record. After working with them for 10 years, they suddenly refused to even speak to me in my most desperate hour. For that, I have a hard time forgiving them and, therefore, will not recommend anybody to them."
good,worked all sorts of jobs from construction to ride along. every new contract was different and allowed me to get experience in new job positions . my favorites were foundry work.
good,"Would only use if there was no other options. I do not prefer temporary services, as I like a long term job to build experience and learn more knowledge"
good,Manpower ist ein ganz ordentlicher Arbeitgeber jedoch sollte man nicht zu lange bei Ihnen arbeiten. Sonst tut es einem nicht gut.
good,"They find you work really quickly. the pay won't be good, work won't be worth the money. However with the job market the way it is, it's a job that pays."
good,"working in a factory atmosphere was good, the companies permanent employees did not afford  courtesy to anyone that was in a temp. position not allowing for permanent opportunity"
good,"you can wait to find placement, not always in a field you are qualified for. some places are very filthy, the pay is small and no room for advancement unless they like you so you are consistently under pressure of losing income"
good,Just dont work here unless you need money or to build a resume. Management will not help you in anyway if you cant show up to work do to personal reasons. I was fired after i missed 4 days becuase my house burned down. Manpower known of this i tried applying back 5 months later was told i would be hired back and to come into the office. I just showed up today and was told sorry we dont hire back old workers who dont show up to work. Manpower doesn't pay minwage or pay enough to work for a place this bad.
good,I worked in the Mini Lab and checked diapers for defects that could harm babies. I worked in  the Wet Lab that checked the water product that went into making paper towels and toilet paper. I worked in data entry as a data entry technician and a data entry supervisor
good,Enjoyed the jobs that I was assigned but there were large gaps of unemployment between assignments. Management didn't seem too helpful in this regard.
good,c est de l intérim on fait des misions qu'on prend ou pas???
good,"I cant really say anything about this company either good or bad.  Its a temp job, so it is what it is.  The people were okay, the pay could have certainly been better, and there were no benefits."
good,"It was one week and I worked for my mom’s office, so the only way to do that was to apply through here. Not much to say about the whole company. It was one week"
good,"No full time opportunity, although it is advertised on Indeed. No benefits offered. They claim to have a referral bonus but when I referred someone they said it wasn't applicable."
good,"Very very hard work, every day, 12 hour shifts, people were difficult to get along with, machines always broke down, i worked specifically at SC Johnson, Manpower is a job placement agency."
good,"Very fast-paced environment at times"
good,company told me they would contact me with jobs but the never did. every time I would call them they would say we will call you when something comes up.
good,"Great plans, expansion and continued growth"
good,"As a ROI analyst,the company they are contracted through just throws you out on the floor. Very little to no training is given to the new people and are expected to know it all in one day. The director of that department loves to micromanage and has no clue what she's doing."
good,Fun place to work great temporary jobs just to make some extra money it's okay it's okay I really don't like working there but I had to get my bills paid what I recommend someone else of course if you need to get your bills paid
good,"Need full-time or at least 30-40 hours if possible.  It's not a secure job, plus it's only a temp position and you have to call in on a daily basis just to see if you have work the next day."
good,"usually goes to a different place ( wherever they place you at)"
good,"It provided a stable job for several months, but once that job ended, have been unable to find any long term employment with them that meets my needs-close to home, day hours, and 40 hours a week"
good,"Im job was easy. The work wasn't hard, it was the people that made​ working there hard. I learned how to be patient with others. The managers pick and choose who they would let get away with anything. I wouldn't recommend anyone​to work there."
good,I am actively involved in the recent Section 189 dismissal that was done at our site for the TES employees. i have built close relationships with client and management.
good,"While the job overall pays great, management is rather picky about who stays and who goes. For example, at Quality Park, which is one of the assignments you could have, management only picks who they like and not who has the experience for the job, or even who does a good job."
good,"Easy work. nice people to work with. No room for advancement, temp to hire process does  not happen often. Pay is inadequate for skill set. Easy to work with. Good staff. Large company with small town feel. Learned how to multi task payments."
good,Don't go to c-team they only care about there yellow shirts and the pretty girls if you go a d work hard they reward you with harder work if you go out there and tell them you can't do it they give you easier and easier jobs till you don't have to do anything
good,"This was a long time ago, but I do believe manpower is one of the best temp agencies out there. I was employed for 18 months and got steady hours and benefits. Also some really great experience. If I needed to use a temp agency I would  go back again. But not to ATCO Gas I would go to a different contract."
good,Not much to say.Seemed to be adequate work.Had differing types of work such as labor to shipping to doing personal work for people at their residences.
good,"Atraso no pagamento de ordenado e ferias, dificil resolucao de problemas. Como é um part time da para estar mais tempo em casa mas o que preciso de momento é um trabalho a tempo inteiro. O unico  aspecto positivo é mesmo os fins de semana livres e o convivio com os clientes."
good,"Good counslers who set you up with jobs but jobs are few and far between or are last minutee needs call night before to offer 4 hour shift just for that day, or always have different jobs every day"
good,"Aprendí a interuactar con mas facilidad, ser mas ágil en la redacción de una nota o documento..."
good,"Em geral negativa, má gestão de horários e folgas. Alteração das mesmas sem prévio aviso. "
good,is a great place to get job experiences for those just starting out.  Very hard to get hired in any place.  Management was easy to get ahold of and were professional.
good,"Place: opening of large big box store (construction in progress)You're replaceable!!! That was the feeling I Had first day on the job. Watching the zombie like temp workers, glazed eyes, non existent smiles was comparable to sweat shop conditions in a third world country. As I met my HITLER  like supervisor I knew I was in for a experience like no other!! So being a trooper I braced myself and hoped my first impression was hopefully wrong. Sadly my optimism did not come to light. The managers, a group of dysfunctional socially inept humans on a strange power trip. Micro-managing, belittling, talking to staff like pre school children and a dismal work environment.... Needless to say after many days of ill treatment I felt the need to stand up for myself and told the supervisor I will not tolerate her regime of terror and disrespectful behaviour, thus ending a horrible temp job."
good,"Not Applicable"
good,"Built, tested and troubleshot aircraft systems. Learned the breakdown of legacy systems decode software, scheduling for timely delivery. Managment and co-workers were fair and helpful. The most difficult part of the job was coordinating with individuals responsible for scheduling and parts procurement. Enjoyed working with senior program technician."
good,Blev felbokad till fel kunder 3 ggr. Mycket dålig arbetsgivare som inte ursäktade sig för alla fel. Trivdes på alla företag men kan inte rekommendera Manpower. Kan inte heller rekommendera transcom som dom söker folk till.
good,Worked there for over 2 years on a zero hour contract. Poor wages but was happy up to November 2015 when I was bullied by one of the managers who had a problem with her attitude and this had been documented by Manpower. Awaiting hearing for Industrial Tribunal.

good,I had a successful internship with Manpower and built great colleagues and friends. Which lead me to a brief term at the Nike Factory where I was an Inventory Specialist for a short time. It was a very interesting and new work experience.
good,"Typical workday place products into container five tiers high.Swept, cleaned mopped. Rarely spoke with management.at most sites.Co- workers OK. Jobs are hard at times I man up and work. The most enjoyable part of the job is punching out after a hard days work."
good,Most leadership had a typically sarcastic Philly attitude and overall the leadership fosters a toxic work environment.
good,Hay que esforzarse más con los que buscan trabajo y darle más a poyo. Y mejor resultados
good,They are a good company and they have nice agents.  A lot of the jobs are not long term because of several reasons. Manpower will work with you and put you in a position you will be most comfortable.
good,"it was a great job agency. It has brought me to different working areas such as exel my current employer, ups, Samsung, and the airport. it was a various of different working experiences"
good,"They send you on assignments that at one day and very far away from your location before placing you in a different position. "
good,"Good learning"
good,"bueno pero le falta comunicacion con sus emleadod,mejores salarios y prestaciones."
good,no communication I had no experience or knowledge of the machine I was working on but I wasn't a pioneer employee so the pioneer employees just left it for me to learn as time went on this was overcome and there wasn't much I didn't know by the end of the season
good,"a typical day at work for me really just consist of running tires through the machine since I am only a temp I can't do the other jobs. "
good,lavoro saltuario con poca stabilità economica e salario basso
good,"Los de mes missions intérim je m'adapte aux postes et au personnel assez facilement, la dernière chez ALLIORA, j'effectuais la mise en caisse d'étuis de produits cosmétiques, et engageais les carton dans la scotcheuse automatique."
good,"about management"
good,"This job was a temp job that lasted two and half years. I scanned paper work and validated old student records. I helped with answering phones, processing applications, and organized the scanning department."
good,"nothing was enjoyable about man power, co workers was all right. hardest part of job was keeping rate . easy part was fixing the machines"
good,I liked working here for this company when I first started and then after about 3 months work started getting slow and the agency act like they didn't want to send me anywhere else. So I toughed it out until I started getting disconnect notices and so I quit to try and find me something more stable.
good,Manpower did not provider consist work. I am seeking a permanent full time position.
good,"I have been employed by Manpower since November 2013. Thus far I have worked on two different assignments (Trident Seafoods and IDEX) and both seemed to have had issues with Manpower due to lack of communication."
good,"I am just a temp but I need full time permantent , I love my co workers and I do work 5 days a week so full time hours but once again I am only a temp . NO benefits"
good,I enjoyed the places Manpower sent me to work. They don't get too many  long term positions which is what I'm seeking.
good,i had the privlage to drive and obtain my class b cdl through this job all i have ever wanted to do is have a driving job
good,"Manpower offers the best temporary job placement in the area, however don't look for many temp to hire positions.  Once placed, you do not have the option to apply to any other positions, which greatly limits your options. Their healthcare benefits are $100 per WEEK and so it is not a viable solution for healthcare.  The office staff are friendly, once you get to know them, however coming in as a new candidate, the office staff are not very welcoming.  They did find me a position within a week, however without many benefits it isn't a position that I can look to for permanance. I will gain some valuable experience, however, for continued job prospects outside of Manpower."
good,en el tiempo que yo estuve habia buen ambiente laboral y los compañeros te ayudaban en lo que necesitabas
good,"Un día típico consiste en comunicarnos con clientes para corroborar que esta todo bien, o en su defecto, solucionar los inconvenientes que se puedan presentar: ausencias sin aviso, accidentes de trabajo,    reemplazo de personal, coordinación de ingresos, entrega de recibos, etc. "
good,Manpower was a good place to work when they had hours and jobs available. The thing I didn't like was that management was never willing to return your calls when you called them for any reason.
good,Being able to have multi-culture relations. Job assignment was at PSI Packaging and there was good days as well as bad.
good,Responsible for verifying all information sent to housing requesting adjustments to tenant rent payment amounts using 3rd party verification.  Calculate and adjust participants rent payments and Housings assistance payments whenever changes in income or household statues are reported and verified.  Follow up on requested information with the participant either by phone or by mail to ensure change is handled in a timely manner.
good,"They were very quick at finding a position to start right after applying, most of it was seasonal work with no chance of getting hired on, or just short term day by day work at different factories that were behind or needed extra help to get their work completed. You don't need to have any experience to work in most of the places they work with, and with the companies that work with manpower for seasonal work that's available for a period of time every year, they can request that manpower call people that had worked there and done well they year before. You get paid weekly, on a pay card so your money is available Thursday nights at midnight."
good,"Manpower is a temp agency.  Your assignment can be cancelled at any time for any reason.  Assignments rarely work out with an employees home life.  I had requested to not work second shift because of a conflict with college.  After one day on first shift, I was transferred to second shift and missed my final exams because of it."
good,"temp jobs. management seems ok. hardest part of the job would be changing to different jobs when one runs out."
good,"It's the staffing industry, so no such thing as normal working hours.  Very fast-paced environment.  As branch manager had to be able to multi task at all times. "
good,they don't care about you as a person they only care about there clients. If one person on the job assignment doesn't like you they will go off there word
good,"A typical day at work would be setting up/ breaking down presses, retrieving paper, etc. Unfortunately job security is not that great, because its up to the company whether or not they want to hire you in. Manpower only helps you recieve temporary jobs, which doesnt guaruntee a permanent position."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage was face paced and always challenging. I would start my day by checking the voice mail system. Emailing responses to particular questions in my inbox from the previous day before then spend most of my day following up on files and ordering title insurance and home owners insurance for new clients. Also, shipping items overnight and tracking sent packages. My manager and I worked in the same office with each other and we got along fantastically. She kept me busy and taught me a great deal in the Mortgage industry. My only co-worker was my manager/boss. The hardest part of my job would have been stacking the files to be faxed into be reviewed. Having to remember what paper went where out of 100-200 pieces of paper was a slight bit challenging. But, with the help of my boss I managed to learn exactly where the papers went and even more, what the papers were for. The most enjoyable part of my job was always the marketing meetings. Getting to meet new people who were working in the same industry made me feel great to be a part of this cohesive team."
good,empresa que tem bons benefícios e não atrasa o pagamento do funcionário.
good,"No benefits, this was a contract position.  Company was unsure how long the position would last. Enjoyed co-workers and the learning experience."
good,"I learned a lot of new skills"
good,"Manpower overall is a good company. They try to keep you busy, but with more people in their database than there are jobs work was spotty at best. This is true of most Temp Agencies I have found."
good,"Did not enjoy working here at all, low hours, on call, low paying, and unorganized. The only good part of the position is the fact your always doing something different. "
good,"Checking the same parts for 8 hours roughly 30 parts every 30 minutes or as material services deliver parts I would set them in an easy access way so the can continue production."
good,Provided Customer Service in 3-different Department of Public Health.
good,It was a temporary position and did not get enough work to keep me work full time. I learned various job in the office where I was placed. The people that I work with was very helpful and nice to work with.
good,I learned that you need to have stability in any job. I did not enjoy going from job to job.
good,"Enjoyed the interaction with my IBM Manpower rep, but I have had a great lack of interaction with the rep from the Lafayette office once moved to Broomfield location."
good,I was a temp worker and it depended on the job they sent me to. So i cannot give an exact discription of what my duties were at this company.
good,this particualr job was not run well and it was difficult to be worked with it was long and frustrating and you constnatly had to keep certain stats that made it hard to keep.
good,"product manufacturing, handling, lifting, pleasing management, doing the same thing over and over. Inspecting."
good,"Manpower will get you a job, yes, but as far as making your wishes come true they are not there for you. There are no benefits available for a temp worker. They will not go to bat for you if you have a problem with your employer."
good,"Another temp service, that had its good points. But i felt like just another body going through the warehouse. I did'not feel like family there. and if i had to, i would not recommend them to anyone i know."
good,"Working on an assembly line, Changing over the lines, helping others change over lines and clean and clear the lines,easy work when effort it used."

good,"always supplied me with enough work to keep me busy, from data entry to receptionist"
good,"ran machines, packed parts, file parts, label parts, assemble parts,"
good,Temporary work that spanned several regions. Involved a lot of heavy lifting. I learned how to do several different jobs from wine bottling to stacking. Co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was not knowing when the next job was coming or what I was doing.
good,Good place to work.FUN and great location.I learned alot from supervisors and co-workers.I got to advance and earn more.I also was allowed to work overtime.
good,I would have to say this was my least favorite job I've had. The supervisors were horrible to people and the co workers as well. They never let me rotate on the line and never took me serouisly because I was a new employee and young. I'm the kind of person I like to learn new things. I wouldn't want to work there again.
good,they gave me a chance when nobody would and the people were different but team oriented
good,Co-workers were very friendly and helpful. Customers were very nice.
good,"Cash handling, Meet sales quota, Advertise autographed photos/collector's items, Customer service"
good,Hey it is what it is.Got me back in work force. Don't bother with insurance. They pay out Dollar for dollar what U pay in over a year with $1000 annual cap.It was so bad they needed a waiver from insurance commissioner to offer.
good,"Management wasn’t all that great when I worked there but most people were easy to work with. The job isn’t difficult at all, the only problem I had was waking up at 4:30 in the morning sore from the day before."
good,Maintain updated knowledge of all company products and service in order to execute the job description assignment responsibilities to the best of my abilities.
good,Équipe formidable. Travail intéressant. Charge de travail conséquente malgré un salaire bas. Mais il est gratifiant de pouvoir aider les intérimaires a trouver du travail et répondre aux exigences du client.
good,"I really enjoy the people i work with the down side to working there it is not steady and you have to call the conformation hotline every morning to see if there is work and at times they dont put the message on early enough and i feel the managers at times pick there favorite people and it is not fair to the people that has been working there years alonger , it also makes you feel like not putting pride into your work."
good,"Temp to hire assignments are always different. One man warehouse/"
good,"Manpower has alot to offer from temp jobs for a day or a week, or they can place you on a more permanant assignment as long as you work hard and do what you are asked by the company"
good,I was laid off from manpower for missing work due to health related reasons. I feel like this was unfair as I could not control having a medical issue
good,Aide a se remettre sur pied et trouver un travail
good,"I worked as a Contractor, my assignment was based in a unorganised, poorly functioning team. I was working amongst colleagues on a permanent basis who made it apparent I was just a contractor. I was on a 3 months rolling contract earning terrible money and my colleagues proudly made me aware of their pay vs. mine. I was very aware I was simply a contractor, yet I was expected to produce the same level of work as my colleagues. Management was poor and generally didn't want to address the issues in the office, they would implement a change somewhere and never address the team. We would be obliviously doing our work incorrectly, and marked down upon checking. Pay was shocking, no benefits, no progression, working amongst bullies and management didn’t want to know - makes for a awful place to work. I approached Manpower who were unable to do anything, they couldn’t even a new assignment elsewhere (which I was told they could do on my first day), they we’re limited in what they could do to help me. I’d never work as a contractor again, anywhere."
good,"Sem palavras para essa empresa."
good,"The hours sucks if you are not used to waking up at 2:30am or 3:00am to get ready for your shift starting at 4:30 am and ended at 2:30pm for 5 days sometimes 6 days a week. And the breaks are really short, so bring something light if you want to at least get one bite in. The people seems nice but stay in clicks, which is fine because I am not much of a talker. Only thing good here is maybe the pay of 10 dollars an hour."
good,there is alot of negativity  and favortism  there some of the people are easy to get along with the supervisor is to laid back watches what goes on and does not help the employees if the is a disagreement lets others do somethings and gets on to other people foe doing the same
good,"Interview ok and mostly managers call you in for jobs but always Temporary, I didn't work for Manpower in Business, But did in such of employment opportunities for finding work, but with all and even this one employers will higher and even train they won't offer you better paying job, as they tend to loose documents of were you worked and history of work that you might have gone after for employement most work is easy and some employers and employees can be difficult with Temporary jobs placement, if you put full time you will be waiting for job opportunity as employers Temporary more then full time. "
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar , porém me desagradou a falta de reconhecimento, ética e cumprimento de proposta de efetivação"
good,Manpower is a good place to work with the right people. But things can get pretty hard when people aren't doing their  job properly or complaining too much about not wanting to be there. Physically it can be invigorating and if you get along with those around you can also be fun. The managers are usually pretty good at being on top of any altercations or if someone doesn't return from break when they are supposed to. They also try their best to staff us where we like to work at but it doesn't always happen.
good,Temp service that was valuable at the time.It will get you in the door and it is up to the employee to impress the potential employer. Good to start if job hunting is stalling.
good,"I loathed this job so much. The management was terrible and never on time, or much of any help at all. The other staff were definitely a reason to hold onto the job."
good,"none too offer at this time."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of staffing individuals into temporary positions, interviewing prospective employees, outside sales to obtain businesses, observe and produce personal safety equipment to employees based on the specific position."
good,"Uma empresa com um bom clima, porém faltam oportunidades de crescimento e muitos talentos acabam se perdendo por uma má e desqualificada gerência de cargos e salários."
good,Depending on the job I was working as a temp would range through warehouse or a desk job.  I would be doing working a line through production making items.  The desk job would be answering phone calls and helping customers.
good,"I have learned a lot but not manpower taught.  I learned from GVS where I work in a warehouse. I do receiving and kitting, quality control, The hardest part is moving heavy pallets around a warehouse that has to much stock and temperatures of over 98 degrees."
good,"I worked in a factory on a busy machine. Not only did I work hard enough to keep up(most everyone else they had to slow down the machine), but I never got hired on. I watched countless lazy slackers get hired on.  I felt like management never vouched for me."
good,"I worked for Manpower for a short while they placed me inside a warehouse called backyard products."
good,Manpower is with contracted caterpillar. manpower pays a 1.00 less than caterpillar. this job is horrible communication and management skill. you work everyday just to get a decent check.
good,"If you have been without employment for a while, Manpower is good at getting you back into the workforce.  The downside is that person to person communication with anyone in charge at Manpower is next to impossible."
good,the work was easy to learn and perform but the managment was very poor/. i reported to them that some of the employess were under the influence while on the job and the did nothing about it.
good,"As above, Manpower was a busy place to work with a steady flow of assignments. After Hurricane Katrina, things slowed way down."
good,This job was only a few weeks in duration. the pay was about 9.50 per hour. There were no other positions available after the assignment ended. I was unemployed after that for approximately three months.
good,"Not bad but wasnt secure"
good,When working at temp agency you are not there long to know anyone work is usually in and out . As for the managing staff they were nice they gave you instructions you did the work as instructed.
good,Was an onsite coordinator at a manufacturing company.  The position turned into a 24 hour a day job as I had to use my personal cell phone for business.  One good thing was I could work from home when needed.  The position was very stressful as I was put out at the manufacturing site and pretty much left on my own to do it all.  Did not receive any real backup from my Manpower office.  The pay rate was a plus.
good,"Trabajo bajo presión, competitividad, poca cercanía de Directivos con el personal."
good,"The staff at the East Norriton location, are very friendly and helpful. The job selections, however, are slim and the assignments are too short. Not enough temp to perm position available. "
good,Peoples how are working for they at other client side never have proper responsibility from Manpower representative. But it's not only about manpower but also all remain facility management company except JLL are have no liability for their client based employees.
good,"to be honest, i don't really care that much I just need a job that can help me, help them, money is an issue and so is transportation. to be fair, id like to say these guys wouldn't give you the time to get the money to get the transportation you need. therefore rendering this job as a last resort."
good,It depends where your work assignment is stationed.  The hours are idea if you are looking for full time employment. The people are really nice and professional.
good,this was a job that helped supplement my  income between Keur industries and BBi in which I was later hired direct with better benefits and better pay
good,"Preparing equipment for day use,,start by handling the heaviest of the work for the day, finish early as possible and restock suppies for next day. Ask other co-workers if help needed. Wrap up the day by cleaning and organizing...."
good,"Manpower is a great place to get work to fill the empty spots between jobs. Recruiters work hard to get you into a factory job it seems. Even if you're looking for something else. These factory positions are physically demanding and usually the most vulnerable to physical injury. (hence the use of temporary employees) The jobs, in a factory that I took to fill the space between full-time perm. jobs were very low pay, hard on your body and brain numbing. I'v had very good positions within companies for clerical but all have been temporary, no benefits and no options for a permanent job, but that's what a temp company is for (temporary). You can get benefits but they are not available to most because of the vast discrepancy between pay you receive and cost for the benefits. Many worksites had great people to work with, they know how hard it is to get and keep temporary employees, this was one benefit that helped make the work possible."
good,Job was funny... Am as a trainee.. No important responsibilities. Collegues were helpful.. Training period was helpful in building a good carrier for me
good,I learned about how the financial aid process works and I was able to help college students find the best options to help pay for their education and teach them how to apply for grants and etc.
good,"I was so excited to work for MANPOWER at the beginning, we were informed it was an 8-month job and we winded up loosing our jobs 1 month later. We were not even given notice, we were informed from one day to another that we had 1-day left to work and after that we had no job. Over 300+ Registration Intake Specialist were speechless at what happened."
good,Needed full time job and was unable to find that at Manpower so I decided to move on to a job placement with more work hours. Also they id not offer any benefits.
good,"I didn't work there for that long but it wasn't pleasing at the time. The work pace was very slow and the supervisor was rude. When there was no work to do, they got mad at you for not doing anything."
good,Manpower was a good company. Pay and management could have been better. Customer driven. Was not allowed to use skill set to full potential. Teamwork was also a positive.
good,"I enjoyed working through Manpower while it lasted.  I didn't have any real problem with them, I did my job and they were happy with me."
good,Manpower is not a very well paid company. Companies treat Manpower contingent workers awful. When there is no work sometimes they don't even call. You show up and they send you home.
good,"bon contact avec le bureau,  expériences  multiples, très enrichissant"
good,there ok for short term work wouldnt say dependable if your looking for long term they had some decent jobs just wish some were contracts that could lead to getting hired in the company
good,If you like working in factories this place is for you. They will send you to a place where the people will treat like a bottom feeder. But if you work hard and ignore them you can make decent money. But 50 plus work weeks is not fun. Especially during the hot summer days.
good,they found me a job fast but when the place laid me off for a week they wouldn't find me another job saying technically i was still employed by them...
good,"I feel like as a temp it should be based on ur work and I feel like that was not the case when I got let go because I had to have foot surgery, and I let them know when I got hired that my foot was broke and I would have to have surgery, I worked almost 2 months before I had surgery on a broke foot"
good,"A empresa em si é boa, uma das maiores empresas do mundo na área de prestação de serviços porém deixa a desejar no cuidado com os funcionários e na capacitação dos mesmos."
good,Staffing can be a stressful industry. Compensation and benefits package for those on the front line is greatly lacking. Training is pretty much non-existent so one must be a self-starter.
good,"It was an ok place to work. I Just average, nothing special. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. The pay was awesome but the everything else wasn't very good."
good,Must get on same page as recruiting office. Company must stay on one accord with their pay system to successfully get their employees the correct amount of funds on time.
good,Manpower does not answer or return phone calls. They offer no advancement and was supposed to find me another job when frito lay dropped them. Overall sorry place to work for
good,It was a good place to work and I was treated nicely. It is a good company and has many other employees.  What I like the best is that they tired really hard to find me a job.
good,"I enjoyed talking with the customers and resolving any of their issues. I felt as if management was supportive of there teams and instead of coaching, they would just fire people because it was easier for them. Very high turn over rate."
good,una buena empressa que ayuda a la gente para tener trabajo
good,"I was posted throughout Oxfordshire in lots of different roles. Jobs consisted of warehouse work picking, product-assembly, and data entry to be honest I didnt really enjoy the work it was probably me rather than the company you could never get a consistent job role as  the roles where mainly 2 week basis. The night shifts were hard as I wasnt used to it. I enjoyed working in a plastic bin factory where needle bins where produced for hospitals, you were expected to keep up pace which is fair enough."
good,"The jobs are very easy most of all ,they are just temp so its not something that's meant to last and I am looking for where that I can build a career 28th"
good,Pour rester actif et en recherchant dans sa branche de dessinateur publicitaire
good,very hard to get in and hired takes almost a year. ladies at offices aren't really helpful at manpower. Also not understanding if you need time off with children.
good,"This company faces a lot of daily opportunities that seem to get swept under the carpet. They do not enforce attendance policies, and they were seldom available in evenings during our shift."
good,Inestabilidad por parte de la empresa no le dan el valor a las personas
good,"Chacun s'occupe de son secteur et voire même se tire dans les pieds (lamentable)"
good,when you get laid-off they take forever to place you on another job. Also when you call for information you can never get anyone because they never answer the phone
good,"They are good at placing you and finding you a job quickly."
good,"Apres 20 ans de fidelité, navré de constater que cette grande entreprise manque de proposition d'emploi dans mon domaine et meme dans des postes de manoeuvre..."
good,"Could be very early start, or afternoon start with late finish, so if you rely on public transport you are stuck. Learned a lot about the road network and transport restrictions. Management had no idea who you   were or what duty you were doing. Great team of people to work with. Explaining to management about public transport. Driving to different parts of UK."
good,"I never like this job, only because most of the employees take advantage of other good workers, most are on the phones all day, and the job never gets done unless another worker covers for everyone. I dont like this company, because no one take responsibility for their job but a few employee."
good,"Agency work temporary.  Usual day was 8hrs in call center environment."
good,decept place to work when i started here.  but in the last two years there has been lots of turnover in the senior management ranks.  communication is poor at best.
good,expérience enrichissante car m'a permis de travailler dans plusieurs structures et établissements différents
good,Beaucoup de manutention peu de reconnaissance travail pénible
good,In the 3 1/2 yrs I've been with Manpower they have not found me a position in the field I have 12 yrs plus experience shipping/receiving. My skills have been wasting away.
good,It was very nice dealing with representatives from Manpower and getting a job with no benefits and surcharge for every working hour.
good,Toujours être appelée au dernier moment (malades ou autres)
good,Taking advantage or the temporary opportunity and making it to a permanent position.  Management was good as well as co-workers.  There were no hard parts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping busy.
good,"Petite agence"
good,it payed well but they place you for the benefit of the company and not where you have the best chance to be hired on permanently.
good,On a typical day we were always in a rush trying to get people into work. Business work environment not the friendliest. Needs more organization and better management.
good,"I am constantly pushing, pulling, moving, carrying and lifting things. it is extrememly physical and seemingly non rewarding. No matter how hard I work, instead of being rewarded I just get a bigger workload to do in the same amount of time."
good,"The management was bad, couldn't work like i wanted because i was getting looked at which made me uncomfortable. the Co workers kept drama going. Hardest part was lifting heaving boxes that was to heavy."
good,"Great service to employer in the community. Although the position was not fulfilling to me, it was a great learning experience in community needs, interviewing, employee placement and orientation."
good,"Ability to learn new tasks, meet new people and companies though there is no job security, no benefits, when on assignment and work is slow hard to keep busy on some assignments"
good,"Depend on your personality the job can be rewarding. A good customer service, communications skills is needed. Many times you just need common sense."
good,"Foi uma ótima experiência trabalhar como entregador de jornal. Apenas não gostei de ter que trabalhar na rua, entregando jornal nos sinais de trânsito. Foi um tanto perigoso."
good,"Very little production for temp employees. Perfect for a college student living at home with their parents, but not ideal for a parent or anyone paying their rent and bills."
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Manpower. They did their job as best as they could with their heavy workload."
good,"Management staff is not very nice to interact with. I would not recommend working for the Wilson, N.C branch. Very rude people in the office"
good,"lo  mas dificil de aprender es a termosellar."
good,Empresa que permiti um grande conhecimento devido ao seu seguimento
good,"Some of the staff are rude, pay is low and some of the job sites are not kind employers. Other than  that, they will put you to work."
good,"Manpower is an on call staffing agency.  Contact employees to work on as ""as needed basis"", not a  steady  source of income employer."
good,"Installed routers and switches throughout Saskatchewan at retail stores, this was for head office to do their purchasing with information from the computers. I worked alone got to see many new areas of Saskatchewan."
good,"It is a good company. I recommend. Good money, good hours. You can trust them, they are good people. I like them.They pay weekly on time. I was started immediately. Minimum 45 Hours on week."
good,This is a temp agency. Not much work available  but when work did come in it was a decnt place to work. It really depends on on where you are sent to work.
good,"they told me what i wanted to hear to ""sign me up"" as a usable body, and then when i actually had requests for advancement or more wage potential opportunities they were 100% unwilling to work with me. Even though they made several dollars off every single hour i worked, they would rather let me leave their company than help me. I enjoyed the work, facility i was @, and my coworkers and direct supervisors. 1 thing thatt shocked me is they made me be available 7 days a week to hopefully end up working 4."
good,"No benefits. I have over 12 years in banking and had to start all over. No sick time, vacation, holiday pay. Insurance offered is not that good. If I had known this before I started, I would have never worked here."

good,"Generates more than 100 phone calls to offer to Brinks' clients to continue the secured armored service  with Ranger.  Brinks' closed operations for PR and USVI in July 2014. Filing, photocopying, calendar management, generates more than 30 emails per day, etc.."
good,"Manpower has great recruitment agreements with many Fortune 500 corporations. I was placed on an assignment with a company that wanted to hire me, however they were in a financial decline that eventually led to the production plant that I worked in to close permanently. Manpower would not allow me to be placed on another job assignment or assist me with find a different company to work for until I resigned the temporary assignment I was working on. I did not care for that policy as it meant I would be giving up a job, without knowing if a better opportunity existed."
good,"I was sent to Manpower because I am a temp at Acument Global Technologies. At Acument it was ok at first. They have been flexible with my school schedule and other things in life that have come up. However, there was no growing for me. As I got more familiar with my job they wouldn't give me more responsibility and has never showed interest in hiring me on as an actual employee. I'm thankful for my time I have had with them for I have learned lots but it has been too long and I need to move on."
good,Enjoyed working with co-workers and management left the company cause offered more salary at another employer. The company I was attempting to get hired on full-time permanently was named Snap-On Tools Inc. which is a very good business to have a career with and overall I would attempt to apply for this occupation again.
good,It is a Fortune 500 company that is Global. It has great benefits and incentives for the right person. It is busy and you can be productive. You can achieve your goal if you focus on your placements and you can be successful.
good,"General factory labor with no chance of ever being hired in, and get treated like dirt by customers assigned to because easily replaceable with new temp"
good,It was a short time period of employment that I did not get a feel of a day by day work flow. A typical day consisted of visually checking incoming Patriot IN items and by using the correct equipment to measure/weigh them. I was working from December 2003 to July 2004.
good,"This would be a great company to work for if there were benefits and more compensation.  I have enjoyed working for the company; however I am looking for more-more compensation, benefits, room for growth and advancement.  One enjoyable part of the job is being able to work from home!"

good,"getting up going to a job, learning new skills. I learn how to adapt to my unique work surroundings. Management is fair, have a variety of co workers, hardest part of the job is there is no consistency on a short term assignment, most enjoyable part is when there is a long term assignment given."
good,"this place sucks dont work here"
good,"Asigan a un gestor el cual se encarga de mirar si el empleado esta  bien laboralmente , pero son muy descuidados con las gestiones salud, permisos, salarios,"
good,This was a job i enjoyed very much since i learned a lot about putting together contracts and what they entailed.  The only issue was that it was from a temporary agency and my time there was very limited.  My position i held with them was only supposed to be for a few months and lasted for over a year!  The most enjoyable part of this job was that i not only had the chance to use my customer service skills but i was performing clerical duties as well.
good,"Check email"
good,"The company is good, the co-workers from Manpower are friendly and the job assignment was nice."
good,I learned about the automobile industry. Co workers were fun to work with.
good,fast paste work. working the lines to shipping out product whatever needs to be done

good,"it is a job. i was fortunate to work. A ok place to work. not hard work, not challenging enough."
good,"I was disappointed they let me go with no explaination so I could learn from my mistake, whatever they were."
good,Was something new for me never worked at a sit down job it was easy.

good,a lot of cut throat bosses out on a mission to fire people always on egg shells but was a fun learning experience
good,"work was fine, everything i learned was from plastics employees, there management was good for the first couple months; after that it seemed as if they didnt care about you anymore. my co-workers were awesome and i enjoyed working with all of them. the hardest part of the job was dealing with my mnapower supervisor breathing down my neck the whole time they were there. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with the group of people that i was around."
good,"Clean complex grounds, laundry room, paint,sweep, some small maintenance work."
good,"ok not stressful but they get the clients and they get the people to work for them its an assignment im looking for a position where i can succeed, and do my job to the best of my ability and to also grow"
good,"learned how to run new machines such as welders and benders the mangers were decent, they had some issues where they would lay the temps off every other week."
good,sorting an packaging customers shipments at a fast moving pace typically on your feet for 8 to 10 hours a day
good,"My work day starts at 10:30 pm. I currently work 3rd shift. I have learned how to operate the depallatizer and robot in the pedialyte department at Abbott Labs. I have also learned to operate the pallatizer and depallatizer, the JCI blowmolder, vision systems and the trimmer that goes with the blowmolding process of making bottles."
good,UPS Freight was a good starting point to learn the ups logistics process. Customer service (on phone) is not for everyone. Hardest part was dealing with people that gave attitude as if you were the one responsible for their shipments other then that ok job.
good,work is fun i learned to used machines management is ok my co worker are friendly hardest oart is when machines break down i like most bout the job is getting paid
good,"The long hour were nice, I liked getting the overtime. I would start work and move at a fast but easy paste, making sure i do everything carefully."
good,Was responsible for everything from payroll for entire branch up to closing new business deals.
good,Challenging and a fun place to work. Great environment. Worst part was working through a temp. agency which had no job security.
good,"Empresa tercerizada dentro das quais citei na avaliaçaõ acima, serviu de ponte para aprender e relembrar Os serviços na areá operacional pois tinha ficado um bom tempo sem exercer a funçaõ."
good,I already submitted a review on this Company. I dont have anything more to say about them.
good,"I had just been layed off from a fabulous position that I very much enjoyed and where I was very well compensated, due to the terminal illness of the attorney I worked for. I decided to apply with Manpower and began filling out my online application. Before I was able to complete the application process, I was contacted by Manpower with a position they said was ""tailor"" made for me and I was scheduled an immediate interview and testing."
good,Manpower is a wonderful company to work for. The staff seems caring and willing to assist in any way they can. They always visit job sites to ensure the safety of their employees and to ensure proper treatment. They recognise you for your hard work through letters and bonus programs.
good,"Picking up a work order, locating order in warehouse, scanning merchandise, inventorying merchandise, pricing merchandise (if needed) and redistributing merchandise to various Gottschalk's stores throughout CA."
good,Manpower seems to only be happy while their employees are working temporary jobs only. They are not out to help their employees get anything permanent.
good,company over worked you and did not give you enough breaks or train correctly
good,worked two jobs and eventually was hired on at the 2nd plant I worked at.
good,Stand in the same spot for 10 hours doing the same thing. I didn't like that job at all.
good,"I worked for an office for my first temporary position here. I then, later, worked in production. I was told the office position had some potential to it and could become a permanent position but was pulled into a conference room 2 months later and told that this was my last day."
good,just found us jobs not gaurenteed to stay for a long time production work
good,You will definately get to meet lots of new people. The hardest part is moving to the next position and leaving the friends you had made.
good,if you can get work it's busy I learned to operate testing machines such as pressure gauge machines which test for leaks or cracks in the finished product. Most supervisors are good at what they do and the co-workers are good to work with. If trained correctly the job is not hard and the best part of the job is being able to come to work.
good,Received perfect 30 out of 30 on reviews. Twenty-five cent raise every quarter for review performance. Hired regular full time (RTF) after approximately 13 months on the job as a temp.
good,This job is good for a caring but firm person. You get to work with employees and Management. You are also treated with respect. Multi tasking is a must on this job also a good memory is a plus.
good,"Rarely get enough work to survive on. They don't fairly share the shifts, some drivers boast they're on £800 a week, where as newer drivers are lucky to earn £100.00 per week, despite being available for the same assigned shifts. Management are non supportive and communication is very poor. You're very much on your own at client premises and there's no support at all from Manpower. from Manpower."
good,"Beaucoup de concurrence et peu d'entraide entre les collaborateurs."
good,"Where I was working was a good job.  But there was little communication from the leadership.  Other than that  the pay wasn't bad, and as long as everything was working,  you would get all your hours."
good,non buonossimo per l'ambiente ma in linea di massimo un'azienda stimolante
good,"I was super excited about this position, but that excitement quickly faded when they changed the structure of our team. Too many mangers and not enough workers. Our team is full of managers, or senior employees that I am almost unsure of what they do. Managing one person is not managing. Team meetings seem insignificant. There is almost no opportunity for advancement with 3 managers on a team of 8. By far the most enticing perk is the ability to work from home, but that makes collaboration almost impossible. I went into this job promised collaboration but I feel like my is work completely solo on most projects, very little interaction from the rest of the group."
good,"Manpower is a not a very stable place to get a job. Unfortunately, that's just what comes with a temp service. You don't know if you'll have a job the next day. Management can be somewhat frustrating and communication isn't always clear. Luckily, job assignments are frequent so most the time you have options."
good,The manpower I worked for it's hard to get in touch with a person most of the time. They found one place and after that one ended it didn't seem like they're trying to hard to find me something else
good,I like to show up on time and that most part I enjoy is making a career in to the job you like to do I learned to focus on the job no matter how hard it is always show you deserve a opportunity
good,"It was ok.. "
good,Mission Springs Water District is a public service provider of high quality fresh water. They provide the highest standards of customer satisfaction and service.
good,"It was a nice environment because the workers, but usually we feel like we don't have the support just of our supervisor, not more than it. They used to recruit people even when they are enough to covered the shift on certain points of the year. That affect the hours that a normal worker can work."
good,"Manpower they are nice but they are very slow its hard to find a perment job there but they willl try and get you work"
good,"El ambiente laboral es bueno, el sueldo no es bueno"
good,"Management needs to learn to communicate, take care of their staff, goals are not desirable.  To much drama and do not like to let people have their time off.  No much tatting and not working as a team."
good,The pay was good for the first job site I worked with. But management was poor and had favoritism. They didn't care about the temps in the slightest. The perms could do whatever they wanted with no consequences. Overall not that bad but be weary of management. They also hire just about anybody so you will definitely work with absolutely awful co-worker on top of the unfair micromanaging permanents with no accountability or consequences for poor work performance. Many problems arised after working there for a over a year.
good,"Excellent management. Amazing co workers. "
good,"valoración de objetivos aunque no sean asumibles."
good,"it was a fast paced environment,learned a lot from several of the employees where i was at.hardest part of the job was all of the traveling.most enjoyable was getting to meet people from all the walks of life"
good,"The company is too ""old school"" in their thinking. Management is out of touch with Client Relations Specialists. If they would take the time to truly listen to employees it would be a better place to work."
good,Didn't care for management they were rude and didn't give me hours I needed I wish I could've got the hours I needed they were slow as far as putting me on jobs
good,"-Such a good environment with many varieties community"
good,"Said I was not working up to production standards, then would not give me time to improve.  Thought I would stay there at least through the summer, and continue working there."
good,"I operated the heat press, die cutter and scanner. I was the assistant line lead. It was my responsibility to see that material was prepped for next job."
good,The job is very slow on hours and get a couple of minutes on break the pay is low not much communication on breaks they have certain people working more then others
good,"It's not a bad place to work. The people in the office are friendly, and will do what it takes to get you a job you like and that works for you. The pay is not too well for most of them but it's a nice company of they have work."
good,First job after military when job market was tight trying to help family stay afloat. Didn't offer and training to help improve job opportunity so reenlisted in the ARMY.
good,Typical day at work was normal. No pressure. Learned how to test medical equipment. Management was patient. Work culture was no pressure. Everybody worked. Not a hard job. Having a job was good because could still contribute.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and the learning environ was good, although there is understood a need to move on.  "
good,I tried at least 3 times to get in touch with my manager during office hours and was told each time that he was either out of the office or couldn't take a call but would call me back. He never did. I also worked in the paint department and had to pull hot carts out of the ovens 10+ times per day with the person that was training me. They only provided one pair of gloves so that meant that one of us was constantly burning our hands in the ovens
good,"I have been working for manpower for 2 years & it's a okay job if you are young not a career job also it would be smart to have a car dealing w them, cause you young t have to go to a pot of different places"
good,"Trabalhei como prestadora de serviços dentro de uma multinacional, então não pude vivenciar muitos os valores desta empresa. Tinhamos pouco envolvimento com a empresa e funcionários desta organização."
good,"they will find you work and it wont be the best but its work, it could be lots of work at one time or none so take what you can get and if you go in a lot they will expect it"
good,"Trabalho em equipe"
good,I worked for Unilever and suddenly my hours changed which prevented me from taking classes.  The manager we had there for Manpower was fired and so was my Unilever manager so I feel they had management problems.  I was glad to be working.  It was a short term position.
good,"mauvais critères de sélection. Le client cherchait un mécanicien, et pas un électromécanicien"
good,"Setup grinders and inspect and clean them,get products to grind,train new employees how to properly lock out and clean them. And how to restart grinders"
good,not applicable and I am not certain why this popped up during ;my updating of the Indeed account.  Manpower is a temporary agency that is managed by under experienced management who spend most of their time micro-managing each other and subordinates.
good,"Needed a steady job with a steady paycheck out of college. Worked at other temporary agencies and Manpower was one of the better ones out there.  However, jobs can be lower paying."
good,"There was a frozen status for my assignment, so I didn't have the option to get hired for the company.  I didn't have insurance.  There was no time offered."
good,"Ambiente pesado, empresa con poca estabilidad laboral y poca posibilidad de promoción."
good,"Il faut se présenter assez tôt le matin pour préparer une assez grande quantité de documents pour la numérisation. La formation dure une dizaine de jours, puis vient la phase d'observation et la mise à niveau. J'ai appris à découvrir un nouveau système de classement par avec des méta données et la réparation des documents abîmés. J'ai apprécié la hiérarchie qui était toujours à l'écoute des employés. Les travailleurs étaient notés chaque fin de semaine et quand le superviseur était fier du rendement, il offrait des collations gratuites. cette même hiérarchie organisait des célébration des évènements du personnel comme les anniversaires, les accouchements..."
good,"I think manpower is a decent place to work for someone that is looking to change career paths, however it is not easy getting hired into a company that you are contracted out to. You will get training and experience that will help you in the future possibly with a different company where you can get hired in permanently."
good,"Day by day managing electronic medical record, gaining experience by learning your mistake, team player, the hardest part of the job is when the job is ending"
good,A good contract employer to help you get a job to help get you started moving toward a full-time position. No benefits until at lest 1 year of continuous employment/
good,I worked with Manpower that Bic graphic Warehouse specialists Iran or Pickers and turrets and forklifts I would slide all the powers that the floor needs and send it out I had  papers of what to select and which locations to go to
good,"I enjoy the work but need to make more money."
good,I loved the job i had just did not pay what i was asking for. The staff was nice and i loved going to work everyday no matter how stressful it got. Various other perks made it worth it.
good,"Manpower was a difficult employer to work for, the targets were unachieveable and the senior managers are not fit for purpose. The onboarding training was excellent however."
good,"El puesto es tesorería, es muy dinámica se inicia con el depósito remoto, se hace todos los días. Luego de con la carga de pagos de los clientes, se ingresan valores de cheques. Se imputan las facturas ,control de cuentas."
good,Sorry I have nothing good to say about Manpower. they do not try too put u ahead. when u tell them something about the company they sent u too they do not believe u.
good,"assigned to various job assignments.  Some jobs are under pay, but its was good because we get to experience new jobs skills. Some of the recruiter are friendly"
good,"Manpower assigned me to a position at a call center selling health insurance through multiple insurance carriers in multiple states.  My average day consisted of sitting at my desk, logging into the computer, and the phone line to sell insurance as an insurance agent.  Throughout the day we attended meetings to learn about new rules, regulations, changes that insurance carriers made to certain products and different states.  The work place culture was laid back, most of the employees were entrepreneurs,veteran insurance agents who opted to work in call center sales during the medicare open enrollment period.  Much of the work was independent but collaborative in taking and processing health insurance applications. The hardest part of the job was notifying customers about changes to coverage, pharmacy discount changes due to location and new agreements.  The most enjoyable part was the flexibility."
good,I tried working overnight for as long as I could make it work but I was really struggling trying to stay awake for an overnight shift. I also worked for UPS as a seasonal handler for about a month.
good,Temporary jobs are never good for anyone. They can send you to work one day and let go the next. So don't fall in love with the job they send you to. It is what it is.
good,"I worked for Manpower in Durham, North Carolina and San Diego, CA. I worker in positions varying from Secretary, Receptionist, Customer Service, Travel Agent Assistant, Administrative Asst. more."
good,"Travailler chez Manpower a été une expérience très enrichissante, dans la mesure où j'ai été amenée à effectuer plusieurs tâches tous les jours. Face à la pression engendrée par le travail, on apprend à mieux s'organiser. Le seul hic que j'ai rencontré en travaillant dans cette agence de Fosses était tel que la Directrice d'agence se faisait facilement influencer par ses deux collègues (Delphine et Carole) et ne pouvait pas visiblement juger les choses de son propre chef. C'est dommage!"
good,"I worked with Manpower for 1 year, at UPS in Swedesboro and overall it's a great company and job but the management aren't that great. They complain a lot, and most of the time they hardly do their own job - or any work."
good,This is a temp employee company. They find jobs for other contract house.  Good jobs usually.  You don't know what you are getting into though.  It could be a dream or a mistake.
good,You're temp so it doesn't last long. You're on thin ice until you get full time at your job. Its easy to get fired from Manpower but it isn't too terrible of a company. They usually can have you in a job interview or orientation the next day
good,"Loaded or unload trucks, clean warehouse and keep track of inventory. Packed and unpacked order as measured, cut, and spooled wire materials. Place unloaded merchandise on correct shelf locations."
good,"I was not impressed with there temporary to perm. positions, usually did not go into a full-time perm. position. The work was not always plentiful or readable available."
good,"différents postes, travail intérimaire soumis à la fluctuation des demandes"
good,"This is a good company to start some where but don't make it your career goal. They never check to see how is work going nor how are you doing at your job. They seem to put ore on their plates then what they can handle because when you are looking for a new job due to your assignment ending, you will have to go to the nearest office and basically remind them that you will be out of work soon. Some of the recruiters are nicer then others though."
good,Easy to get alone with.  I wasn't with them long enough to give a big review.  What little time I worked three then I did not have a single issue what so ever.
good,It was temp jobs and didn't last long I would work there again but  hopeing to fine a full time job the people was very nice tho and I have great job experience
good,"Provides a stepping stone till something else comes along. Can be chaotic due to so many people managing each project, but overall the onsite management is great."
good,"como colaboradora em regime de outsourcing e em 1 mêss de projeto, considero que não reúno elementos suficientes para uma avaliação justa e tão abrangente."
good,"Great reviews , awards , ..no promotion or raise. Was told that it would be 30 days , maybe less! relied upon this, to be told..little longer..little longer...at some point , you just can't hold."
good,it was just a temp assignment at night until i gained better employment the hours were good worked third shift 9pm til 6am stocking the floors with merchandise.
good,"Not a bad company, but you tend to get stuck with rough schedules.  Also, there is the risk of ""corporate restructuring"" that will lay you off with no warning."
good,"Nearly everyone I worked with I would do so again, however there is no IT strategy apart from cut cost. As a result there have been years of out-sourcing and off-shoring."
good,"We transfer from one place to another"
good,El trabajo era muy duro para el salario que recibias
good,"The assignment was great while it lasted but I now find myself not working.  Work isn,'t as steady as I'd hoped for.  Recruiters seem nice and helpful for the most part.  Temporary work has changed a lot over the years, as far as to how many people you have to go through before you get an assignment. Plus much of the industry is automated which make some things a little more complicated,  It taking longer get your next assignment and there are holiday in which companies you're sent get paid for but Manpower employees do not.  I think it takes too long to become elgible for benefits. But thats my opinion, but like I said there are some really nice people at Manpower.  The pay is nice , when you're on assignment your recriuter keeps in contact with you and helps with any problem you might have.  They make sure things are going well at the work site.  They usually get back to at a reasonable amount of time when you call them.  Overall it's kind of nice working for Manpower."
good,a typical day at work beside where they would not allow you to use time for a meet for your children and you gave a good notice. The hardest part was meeting your goal for the day.
good,"working for manpower is mostly about the money and that is all. you can never forget that whatever company you are at you are only working with them and not for them. you are at the mercy of a company that really does not have a lot of benefits and if you did use them, you would not have enough to pay bills."
good,"Good agency to work with. However, I have not got a pay increase in  2 years. Paid holidays is the only benefit. I wish they had more offices in the Northeast side of LA"
good,The clients are what's the best about this company.  The benefits are sub-standard and there is a lack of communications between the Manpower managers and the employees.
good,"Mostly warehouse work that I do. Most jobs they send you too is very productive and fun and I have to work hard but the people I've worked with so far has been making my job easier, which is always a plus"
good,It was a temp job.  Worked for Sprint as a greeter.  Everyone looked out for them selves.  No advancement opportunities.  No challenge.  I did not enjoy.
good,"Overall structure was lacking and work load far to substantial. Was forced to lie about transitions to primary company to our agents with the only rebuttle being ""business is business""."
good,I worked at a trailer park in Kalamazoo. The owners refused to hire me because of a misdemeanor on my record. I didn't get recognition of my talents. Manpower takes money from their employees but only protects the interests of their clients.
good,empresa na qual se inserem varios projetos sendo ela uma empresa de recursos humanos que presta mão de obra a outras empresas (outsourcing).
good,"Foi uma experiência agradável em que aprendi a amadurecer profissionalmente,já que as metas que a empresa splicitava a mim,eram cumpridas"
good,They sent me to First Solar which was a beautiful plant to work at. The people there were very friendly. It was the cleanest factory I have ever worked in with great work conditions.Just wish that when First Solar downsized and I was laid off that Manpower would have had another job lined up for me.
good,"Manpower was a decent temp agency to go through for work. I was placed at Vivint in London. I worked in the production and assembly department. I learned really fast how to do my job and any other projects that came my way. I soon was helping the supervisor keep things in order especially when he was not around. I helped the new temps that came in, and made sure everybody was working. I was basically the team lead there."
good,Was laid off with no warning and not done fairly based on work.  Management was out of touch with the basic Human Resource laws and was not acting appropriately.
good,"During my day at UPS which is where Manpower assigned me, I was able to call and assign the extra staff that would be available during the holiday season."
good,"It's a good place to work if you like factory work. They keep you busy if the productivity is going good.  Don't care for shift work, but if that's what you are use to then it is good.  Lot's of drama in these jobs.  But overall I didn't have any bad experiences."
good,"Lots of 2nd and 3rd shift jobs. not very clean  or enjoyable work. Paid over time, hard to get hired into any of the job placements. make less money then other people doing same job"
good,Ive learned many trades in past year. They are super friendly and always on point. It is very clean. They work with your schedule. They are great agency.
good,Bonne société d'intérim. Missions régulières et souvent agréable (autant que possible)
good,Man wird in einem Betrieb gesteckt wo die Arbeitsmoral unmenschlich ist. Die bezahlung war sehr  gering dafür das es eine unbefristigte Arbeitsstelle war mit 3 schicht system
good,nothing much to say apart from being confused about the hours i was told compared to the hours i am doing. either i can manage my personal life around the job.
good,"A temporary job that lasted 3 years and two weeks instead of a few months.  Poor training and management."
good,I really enjoyed working at Perrigos. I learned a lot. There was a lot of down time but you always made up for it later. Some of the people were friendly and others just stayed to themselves but were still nice. I just hate that Manpower is a temp serve and you hope and pray you get to stay but you almost never do.
good,The location I was temporary working at was great I loved working there and the people I worked with were great. Sadly it was only a temporary position.
good,"This was a small, family owned office. Did not care for the owner/manager. She had no idea what she was doing and inherited the business from her parents. She was really into making herself look good and was all about power lunches, etc. But never really did any work."
good,pas d'emploi fixe et d'evolution un mileiu d'interim difficildans les entreprise
good,"I wasnt anticipating a direct hire position, only contract assignments which they provided. A lot of the labor I had to do felt very disposable, I cant say I am accustomed t that type of work, but I recommend this for students who have changing schedules"
good,"its ok temp work,if there is any work some times there is no jobs to work.but over all not to bad to work for,but no full time jobs.You some times dont no what your walking in to at some places."
good,"There was never a typical day working for this company. I was never properly trained, and was thrown into software that I had not been granted full access to, but still expected to do all that my coworkers were doing. It seemed that the manager had been spread too thin, and it led to a negative workplace."
good,"Good work hours"
good,Infelizmente é uma empresa que terceiriza o serviço e pouco se importa com os seus funcionários.
good,"Its a good company to work for, but haven't stayed with steady work."
good,ManPower is a good place to help find employment. It's been a long time since I went through them but I remember it only taking a day or two to get a call back.
good,"The job assignments were good, but very,very limited. For almost 2 years one of my assignment as a temp, I was performing more job duties than the other temps and most of the company employees at half of the pay.The holiday pay policy is a joke. My latest Manpower search that I viewed showed that they only had one client."
good,"good place to start "
good,"I had found manpower to hire when necessary and also ready to let go when not needed."
good,"They do ok but not great.  Theyre not real good at advancing their employees but will get u in the door the job they got me at Ryder was good, but when I tried verifying getting hired on, there was no support from manpower."
good,its ok i guess.... it was just a job to get over the hump.....not to happy with the pay an hours... seasonal work pretty much.........................
good,Contracted to Dell (formerly EMC Corporation).  The job is good.  Minimal oversight by Manpower as Dell management handles the immediate job functions.  Management and co-workers are good.
good,supply own tools with no help from company on replacements long days and nights to suit them with no regard to anything but them and no benefits at all
good,"easy job work with interesting people and learned new things about the automotive industry, also jobs change frequently learning new process."
good,"My time at manpower was interesting and fun with the customers. "
good,"Most coworkers are nice, management can be touchy at times. The hardest part of the job is the people. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new machines and processes."
good,Not a great place to try and work with. Always had to call to get my work ticket. and at least once a month my pay got messed up.
good,Gros changement (en mal) depuis que certaines personnes on quittés Manpower
good,The company needs to get more work!! The hardest part of the job is one never knows if or when one arrives if they can even go out on a job!!
good,I was placed in Abbott Labs and was a great experience. Had the best customers and learned many skills that enabled me to use in the most recent work experiences Ive had had. Unfortunately these temporary companies doesnt have employment stability.
good,"While working as a staffing specialist within Manpower, I had no   benefits, worked 50+ hours per week and was never offered a permanent position.  I was responsible for  running the office as the manager had walked out and then told I couldn't become manager because she had not trained me enough on reports.  The most enjoyable part of this position was actually placing individuals into positions that helped them support themselves and their family."
good,They will find you a job and help you with all your concerns. Have good pay rates. Only bad part was their Supervisor at Amway.
good,Two weeks before I was about to get into a union Manpower laid me off. I was excited to work for them until this happend. i really have nothing else to say but they gave me an opportunity to learna new skill.
good,"I worked at amway though man power."
good,they tried there best in find me work in a low work state and did there best to find me something i can do they were very help full
good,Working for manpower was a great opportunity but the pay rate could have be better. But the manpower staff was always kind and helpful.
good,"I love working here, this was a fast-paced working environment. One thing i don't like about  this job was it was a temp job. Everyone there was very nice."
good,It can be difficult to be a temporary worker.  However if you have the stick-to-it-ness to hang in a long time it can help boost you into a new career.
good,"Como empresa é muito boa, dinâmica; ofereceu treinamento para entrar na empresa; respeita e valoriza o funcionário, da apoio principalmente quem está no seu primeiro emprego"
good,"Groot bedrijf, contacten moeilijk te krijgen omdat intercedent vaak afwezig was."
good,"Unfortunately it has no job security from day to day, most of the companies that use this agency are not looking to hire you on."
good,Cette entreprise est solide et présente des valeurs fortes.
good,"forklift operator"
good,I would have enjoyed my employment more if there were more work assignments available. It seems to be that work was more available to employees that worked in the plants than the office. At least that is what I was told.
good,"Prestador de logística Procter & Glambe planta Anchieta, ótimo ambiente de trabalho, colaboradores dispostos e proativos,o agradável a flexibilidade de horários e locais de serviço, parte difícil a comunicação entre planta e matriz."
good,"Recruiting is not for everyone, Manpower gives a motivated and determined individual the opportunity to learn and exercise many skills and aptitudes that can be transferable to a myriad of other roles. Working for an agency also allows you access to some of the harder to find jobs before the public becomes aware."
good,J'avais pour mission d'assister 2 Chargés de Recrutement.
good,"Tout dépendant de où nous sommes envoyés, certains jobs peuvent être chouette, malgrés le travail, mais cela est normal. "
good,Working with Manpower Agency at TNT was a lot of physical work which was the hardest part of the job but all my co-worker's were friendly and easy to work with which made the job easier.
good,"My typical day at work involves receiving, scanning, data entry, answering the phone. I create Work Orders for our Maintenance department as well as generate the monthly Preventative Maintenance sheets for Operations and Maintenance. On some days (not all) the hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness. I like to see and talk to the different people that come into the maintenance department; vendors and employees alike. Interacting with people on a day to day basis makes my job enjoyable."
good,"Arbeit war sehr gut , Kollegen nett."
good,"its a recruitment company ,i learned how to deal people in different culture....•	Answering and directing phone calls, taking and distributing messages."
good,"Manpower certainly does provide a much needed service for those looking for employment. Unfortunately, they do not match the benefits the person you work beside day in and day out receive because they are employed by the company you are assigned to."
good,"I worked as a temp through Manpower at the post office.  On a typical day, I would go in at 4 a.m. and work till either 4 p.m. or 6 p.m. I'd spend the entire day in front of a computer keying address labels. Afterwards, we had to sort the pieces that we keyed and then distribute those to the trucks. I learned that accuracy, punctuality, organization, and perseverance are incredibly important. Management was pleasant but didn't often interact with the temps.  The co-workers were decent, the actual employees were not nearly as pleasant.  The hardest part of the job was probably trying to keep your eyes open. The most enjoyable part was that we got multiple breaks and lots of overtime."
good,"Seasonal position, nice place to work, must pay attention to detail and tax forms. friendly co-works flexible hours. Can be called back each years to work 4 to 6 weeks, good pay."
good,Manpower is a good place to work for and but it also has its downside. they put you on mandatory on call and mandatory OT without notice.
good,"en general un dia de trabajo no se refleja lo que manpower es sino a la empresa que se le da el servicio y para mi jabil fue una gran empresa a la cual es facil ponerse la camiseta"
good,I was able to keep the conveyor belt filled for the fill room at all times. This made the company employees enjoy working with me.
good,"Al ser una empresa de trabajo temporal y además, para esta empresa, te avisan día a día, es difícil conciliar la vida familiar. Pero el caso es ir trabajando, que hoy en día escasea y hace mucha falta."
good,"I worked 1st shift so I basically worked all morning placing component parts in circuit boards either 8 or 10 hours a day. I caught on pretty fast so not much was difficult in the position. My coworkers were nice, but it was very evident that they were hired in and temps were not so we had little protection from managers, all though the longer I was with the company the mangers didn't seem mean. The most enjoyable part was just being able to put a headphone in and work without people disturbing me. It was peaceful and kept me on track to just get what I had to done."
good,The agency is only concerned with the employer needs.  I felt as if I was just a journal entry on an accounting ledger.  The staff I interfaced with was very unprofessional.
good,"too many bosses and not enough people willing to do their jobs, too many breaks and way too much downtime everynight. not enough money"
good,"I left a full time job of four years to go to what appeared to be a more promising company."
good,"I have just left this role and your constantly stuck in the middle between what the distribution centre in South Hampton and the transport centre in glasgow and the branch managers, the branch managers think you work for them but you don't."
good,"I met some  friendly people there, and learned more about the different ways to ship products."
good,"Hardest part of work is that you give it your all, comply with what is expected of you and then based on temporary hiring once you meet almost three months they claim that you are not producing.  I never heard any complaints and then I am terminated.  I worked Sun- Sun like as initially requested and unfortunately for what."
good,This position was on a Military Base and is confidential. I trained team members in the art of Corrosion prevention and control.
good,It is hard to care fro my family without constant work.  I am looking for a full-time job which Manpower can not currently offer me.
good,Call Center Phone Support.  Provided over the phone technical support as well as warranty claims.  Working for the temp agency was difficult due to having multiple supervisors for the same department. It seemed very redundant.
good,"Fun, energetic young professionals.  I spend my days working closely with whichever client I' m recruiting for.  Sourcing for qualified candidates to fill the jobs.  Looking at resumes and calling candidates. Daily meetings with the team and our client.  My co-workers are always helpful and supportive to the team.  Finding people jobs and filling the positions for our clients is a rewarding feeling."
good,A typical day was fairly easy. It was really repetitive. I learned how the power coat process works.
good,"conduite engins de chantier."
good,Good experience but wouldn't recommend to anyone looking for long term. Co-workers was great upper management was too demanding
good,"Manpower is an ""ok"" company to work for they found me an awesome job with a great salary however the ladies in the office could be a little more enthusiastic. The management at my job is fantastic they are willing to work with you and they are really easy to get along with."
good,"They had work at times when I needed it, I had fun meeting new people."
good,A typical day at work was like you had to go clock in then go straight to work. You had to stand a lot which I didn't like and your break was 2 hours before your shift ended. What I have learned was nothing that I already knew how to do. The management was rude and disrespectful. They didn't understand that you had a life outside of work. The co-workers would cuss you out if you didn't do something right. The hardest part of the job was carrying the plates to the kitchen with a serving plate. I didn't really enjoy this job.
good,They say that most of their positions are temp to perm but most are really seasonal positions for the AEP.
good,"Honeywell low balled me on ($). Typical behavior for them. As far as"
good,"My present role revolves around speaking to customers and listening to their issues. I need to have in depth conversations with them to understand what they want and how to improve their overall perception of the Bank. Once I have all the relevant information from the customer I then have to go away and investigate the issues presented by them and try and find a fair and unbiased way to achieve a fair outcome for the customer. "
good,Completed several UPMC mailings. Making sure this is completed accurately.
good,"Ingresar a la compañía con anticipación y revisar temas pendientes día anterior (si hubiese), iniciar labor principal del cargo y gestión correcta y oportuna de sus funciones inherentes al puesto."
good,lots of good work at first then it dissapeared and this company has to be chased for work
good,I appoint select employee to be directed to an client that require general labor task to be completed for one day or a contracted period of days or weeks.
good,Interesting company to work with opportunity to meet others.
good,"I have dealt with the Medford, WI office of Manpower.  As a temporary placement agency I'd say it's the lesser of evils available to me in my area.  If it can be avoided, I would at all costs."
good,"Overall its an OK company to work for. The office staff are friendly and helpful. The assignments can end with out warning for no reason."
good,I really dont work long here the key word its temporary. I can only live check to check with this job.
good,"une journée de travaille de 7/8 h ou plus habituer au déplacement régulier en île de France, peu d'opportunité dans le domaine que je recherche (électricité), entreprise sérieuse, je n'ai pas eu de différent avec mes collègue lors de mes missions pour Manpower. L'aspect le plus difficile de mon derniers poste est le peu de connaissance dans le métiers de ma mission (aide au couvreur) j'ai déjà aidé à la réalisation de couverture/charpente sur d'autre chantiers. Le plus agréable est d'apprendre divers compétence j'ai été satisfait de l'équipe avec qui j'ai travailler, bonne rémunération."
good,"Good people on my job assignment, management is fine. My interacting with other was quite enjoyable."
good,"My typical day at work I go to U of M hospital go to the floor I was assigned to. sign in go the patient room. get a report from the last person. Then after I get the report, I start working., But the time I get in it was time to eat so I might have to feed the patient or set up their food for them. might have to bath the patient or help them to the bathroom. after all that I just have to make sure the patient is safe at all times. "
good,This job entailed shuttng down a warehouse and shipping everything to either Mexico or China. I enjoyed learning how to use a High Bay System and side shift fork lifts. Co-workers while capable were not motivated. I felt a sense of accomplishment in completing the task
good,a day at work with manpower you learned about a job and how to get along with your co-worker and you also learned from management about life and hard work
good,"photo copying and admin"
good,Management was not really caring toward employees. Worked 40 hours a week.
good,pues prácticamente es muy cansado y todos los supervisores encargados y lideres se sobrepasan con los ayudantes generales hacíamos mas sin recibir ningún porcentaje mas a nuestro sueldo y son muy llevados en todos los ambitos
good,I really enjoyed my time at Evercom. Working through Manpower was  slightly challenging sometimes due to their strict demands.
good,"Worked with kids at the elementary level, fun to see the world thru their eyes."
good,"Not a terrible place to work.  Management was clueless, did not communicate with one another, and really did not do anything but stand around with clipboards.  The compensation/benefits were bad $10.00 but I wonder how much it would have been without over paid management standing over everyone with clipboards.  Since it was a temp agency zero job secruity.  If you need a job, don't mind tallking on a phone I would suggest going there but they IBM/manpower are fire happy, so be on your p's and q's."
good,Manpower is a Staffing Agency that was not very good at placing me in position with any longevity 
good,Liked the work that I was doing throughout most of the time employed. Was told in the beginning that first hired would get preffered shifts and later told that it did not matter when hired. Job was changed without notice. No opportunity to go from temp to full employment.
good,only worked for a short time I would have like to work a lot longer the company that I was working for was temporary work.
good,Quick on finding Temp positions
good,you sit in shipping all day and gauge parts. very little chance for full time
good,"The Hackensack, NJ Branch I worked for came up with some temporary assignments. However, the Sacramento, CA Branch is nothing more than another employment agency. Therefore, you're better using a job search enginee (INDEED is the best) on your own."
good,Working at the Escambia County Health Department for Manpower has been a great learning experiance. I enjoy working with all the people there. I am intrusted to start work before anyone else gets there.
good,Got to have hands on training basically at numerous jobs. Never got bored!
good,Awesome experience working with pre assembled micro boards.
good,Estou a pouco tempo na empresa avalio como uma empresa buscando a excelência como todos as outras e quem tem os seus contras.
good,This was just a contract job through manpower.
good,"Ambiente stimolante, ma competizione distorta dal fatto di essere tutti assunti in somministrazione."
good,"Every job I take they seem to offer me less money on the next job, yet I am the first one they call when they need someone who is dependable and reliable. To my knowledge they have not had one complaint about me but that has not went far in this job."
good,It not the greatest company to work for. There is little to no job security. The management at certain locations is not the best. Not even good to be honest. Very lackadaisical about placement and too cavalier when it comes to urgency of delivering information and paying people on time.
good,good positions available and nice recruiters. they work hard to place people in good positions for growth and to learn new skills.
good,Can not remember any trouble at all with them. Did not work for them long or much face to face.
good,"Had an ok job @ $12.00 an hour , lost it due to a repeated motion injury, NOT an industrial accident. now they no longer want to help me find employment."
good,"It was a fun job but very insecure. After 18 months if Amway don't decide to hire you, then you are forced to find another job."
good,"It's not the worst job in the world. If you work hard, you wont really have problems. However, If you are having trouble with some jobs, with some of the companies that I was sent to, the mentality is that they could just get rid of and procure temps easily.Which, in turn made the workers that would come in to work care a bit less. Before I left for school, the group that I worked with got along quite well. Everybody tried to pull their weight and were not to afraid to have a little fun."
good,buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,"Start folding boxes to put oil jugs into, and labeling them as quickly and neatly as possible. Lift 65 pound boxes for two and a half hours repeatedly, while maintaining a certain pattern, and going as fast as possible."
good,was a great place to work other then they used me and proimissed me a fulltime job then when the time came i was laid off while other co worker was hired on.
good,"Unlaoding trucks, putting product away or getting it for the line. Learned how to check the product to makesure it was the right stuff. Worked alot on my own. Some times it got alittle hard to unlaod, put the product away and get the product for the lines when it was very busy. I enjoyed the fast pase work."
good,there nothing hard about the job just to standing or sitting at one time peorid of 8 hr. only one ten minitue break and only 30 minitue lunch.
good,Worked from construction sites to water bottling company also in maintenance tech so worked various sites that I could help with the skills I had.
good,On a typical work day I went in at 8am and finished my day at 3pm. Management kept everything going as planned. I always enjoyed being around my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was having to be on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part of my job was meting new people.
good,I started with Manpower back in 2000 and after a 3 month assignment I was hired full time with Citizens Bank of RI.
good,"Co-workers are fun. Management not trusting and practices ""second guessing""."
good,"While I was with Manpower I worked at the Pfizer Bldg. on Milheim, I would come in attend a morning meeting, then do data entry, pull boxes and edit what was in them and then enter the scientific data accordingly. Sometimes they would assign special projects for us like sorting lab test samples, label and organize stock room, inventory. My direct supervisor at Pfizer was wonderful very appreciative with my work and easy to get along with. I enjoyed reading the lab test and results performed it was very interesting. I also enjoyed the people I worked with they were very friendly. Some days it was tough sitting and typing for eight hours and not moving around."
good,"I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that it was benefiting cancer patients. A typical day at work would be picking grapefruit and oranges for ST. Mary's Food Bank, the hardest part of the job was waiting to get paid, and having to be on the phone for a long period of time to sort out issues with pay. Other than that working outside in the heat was not that bad knowing it was for a great cause"
good,well what can i say its a temporary job.Some time there was work available and sometime there wasnt. i just needed a job at the time and ended up there.
good,They have too many employee's and not enough staff. Takes too long to get back to you. No care for others
good,"I started with E.on as a meter reader and found it a very relaxed albeit exhausting role. Walking many miles a day sometimes despite having a company van. "
good,"Mi sono sentita presa in giro, potrebbero far di meglio per favorire il nostro fabbisogno ..."
good,"Realmente no te sientes muy seguro de tu permanencia, frecuentemente te mencionan que habrá bajas."
good,"As this was a temp agency, there is nothing concrete that I could say. I was given an assignment to work and I completed it. There were no benefits do to it was a temp agency. The people were very professional that sent me on assignments."
good,Fast paced working environment that needs to work on their safety procedures. Materials being thrown around and damaged resulted in loss of material that could have been easily solved.
good,"It's a temporary job company that doesn't allow for much advancement.  No pay raises or benefits of any kind.  But it is what it is, a contract job company and you are treated as such."
good,"I found they have better paying and more skilled jobs available.  However, after 7 months I still wasnt brought into the company as a permanent employee."
good,"This company is a temp-to-hire company, they will place you somewhere like the American Cancer Society or Maximus, but there's little room for to be hired at either company and the hours are weird. You also can be let go with no notice."
good,You are under a variety  of management  and at once can be fired or told not to come in the next day.  Have an appointment  of some type?  They will tell you NOT to come to work that day.  Life happens.
good,"It is a stepping stone into a career. I would rather be a fulltime employee than a temp, but it did find me work fast. I worked for many warehouses through them and get paid alright money"
good,"Dobre wyjście w razie problemów ze znalezieniem stałej pracy, choć brak gwarancji zatrudnienia czy ilości zleceń powoduje stres i niepewność. Nie najgorsze zarobki i miła kadra."
good,I worked through ManPower for a couple of months. I did like my job up until the people started acting weird. I don't know if Id work through them again. They pick their favorites to work there.
good,"You're offered a promising 90 day before  You get hired on prominently with a raise in pay but this doesn't happen it turns into 6 months of brutal 10 to 12 hours A-day for little to no money, You are constantly promised and told that you are great worker and we're going to hire you on permanently and yes we'll talk about getting a raise but it turns into 6 months without any talk of hiring prominently no talk of benefits no talk of additional pay!"
good,"No room for advancement, no permanent placements, no benefits, I was able to get a lot of experience in the global corporate world and technical fields, meet a lot of great people."
good,Contract position is entirely too long. Employees must work as a temp for one year before the client can bring them on permanently. Onsite manager very unresponsive.
good,"Jobbade som truckförare på Volvo för Manpower. Lönen var mycket bra och arbetsuppgifterna var behagliga. Men anställningen var mycket otrygg, ledningen var dåliga på att kommunicera med de anställda och ofta var de svåra att få tag på. Anställning skedde månadsvis, dvs. man fick anställning en månad i taget och oftast fick man vänta in till näst sista dagen innan man fick besked om man fick fortsätta eller inte, vilket skapar stor otrygghet. Åldersdiskriminering förekommer, det är svårare för äldre personer att få fortsatt anställning."
good,I work for Tapfin which is a Manpower company.  I use to love coming to work but the last few years it seems becoming a little hostel environment.  A lot of favoritism and discrimination within the team that i'm on.
good,"Manpower AS ga meg en sjangse som jeg tok på sparket, men det var vanskelig å forholde seg til et oppdrag av gangen da det var så sporadiske arbeidstider."
good,"Travail intense."
good,"Good environment and people and all round company, but there’s no progression at all. I worked there for quite a long time and there was no sign of anything further"
good,"Many of the job assignments you’re sent to will be HARD work. The employers treat temporary workers with low regard,compared to their full time employees. You also have to do lots of traveling to get to your assignments."
good,"Layed off before my 90 days was up without notice."
good,Work is not much gotta keep callin in for availability but u probably won't be gettin called. Some sites u can end up gettin put on permanent just depends where u go
good,"I liked working there, but it was only a temp. position and I needed something permanent and long term.  We were let go right before Christmas with only a day notice"
good,"Ni tuve la oportunidad de convivir mucho ya que solo era de manera eventual el trabajo, pero me parecio muy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Manpower is an entry level position for routine labor. In addition, it's not designed for permanent employment. A required 6-month ""break"" in employment is necessary after each 150 days of employment."
good,"É uma empresa fácil de trabalhar apesar das contrapartidas, tem equipas e pessoas agradáveis para trabalhar."
good,The jobs that I received were fairly easy. I learned how to use certain power tools and dealing with car parts. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the pay was weekly.
good,"Its a good way to start working fast, but the job is temporary and you have no days off and no benefits or health insurance. if you get hurt on the job you are still required to work and they don't give you any time off or send you to a hospital or doctor to get checked. You are not covered by manpower or the company you where assigned to work at."
good,Manpower works with on trying to find what fits you. They gi e you certain test to figure what you are best at. They ha e a lot of fast paced jobs were you are working with your hands.
good,"I applied for what the ad said was a CTH position.  After accepting the role, found out was term contract.  This was not properly communicated to me, despite my inquiring about it."
good,"Uma empresa bem dinâmica, foi uma experiência curta mas de grande valia. "
good,"I don't even know whether these companies exist,"
good,"Little Guidance, and no training. i learned through other employees how to operate a pallet jack and manual scanner. management was non - cooperative."
good,"Very helpful in finding a placement position for you, will let you know when your assignment is done. Checks with you to see how the assignment is going, very flexible when you need time off for appointments. Wish the pay was more,"
good,a typical day would be scheduling appointments for the training staff to visit customers to teach them how to use the reprographic products which we sold. Also included booking hotels and flights for these trainers
good,Manpower är okej om du vill ha ett jobb kortsiktigt eller om du är student
good,Basically I worked through them as a temporary employee at a couple of assignments. Some jobs were harder than others and some were enjoyable. the hardest part was waiting to become a permanent employee at an assignment.
good,Manpower was a temporary agency. I worked in warehouses and also property maintenance. It was a good way to get variety and try out companies. I'd work there again.
good,"From my own experience with the temp agency, I have had a long wait period with time and less help with career choices and more of one job a week. I haven even went further lengths with helping people more than the front desk on tips for others to find guaranteed work to provide income."
good,"Answered multiple calls within an hour, relaxed, management was good at solving problems but take too long to review problems. most enjoyable part of job is the people."
good,"Overall, temporary workers are treated as such by most of the management. Someone else will be hired to fill the contract regardless as a temp is not a permanent fixture. You are definitely expected to remember that you are a temp and not part of the team."
good,Only problem with them is they took our vacation away by adjusting the date when you received your one week of vacation.  Not sure what their policy is now.
good,working at manpower was ok. it was just a step in the door to a better job and career advancement. I would use them again if the need would ever arise.
good,"Waking up earlier to don't be late."
good,Not a terrible company to work for but it's mainly temporary positions. Your left wondering if you'll have a job tommorow. They mainly deal with industries that have assembling parts at a very fast pace.
good,This is a temp service that uses workers. They place you and forget you. Often the jobs are demanding with little pay or advancement. The managers don't seem to care about their workers.
good,"At manpower I started working in a warehouse for re-inspection purposes. During my employment i was taught how to use a hot glue gun, box opener, and a pallet jack. During my employment I learned that favoritism was everywhere and i couldn't move up unless I was close to them. They had us work on our feet for a total of 10 1/2 hours. every 2 hours we got a 10 min break with 5 min to get back to our work area. we got our unpaid 30min lunch halfway through the shift. The hardest of the job was the strain it put on my legs. However the people there were friendly and would give pointers to help me work faster."
good,"Was able to work in Sorting, Loader and as a Driver Helper (w/ FedEx) & A Packager, Palletizer & Shipper (w/ the 3M Co.)... Good hours/Good Pay. [Was let go for reasons I don't know ? (Jose @ 3M was surprised about me being released!?!)]"
good,"OK as a job placement for young adults, but not for people supporting a family. Pay is not to good, the job assignments u you never know how long they last."
good,"Although I worked for Manpower, I was contracted to IBM as a sales support specialist supporting the IBM GTS Face to Face marketing team. I had a Manpower manager, but reported to an IBM manager regarding my job responsibilities. A typical day involved generating requests for price quotes for IBM hardware ad software contracts that were over $1 million dollars. The requests were either for new business, competitive winbacks or renewing contracts. All requests came from the IBM territory sales reps. Quotes were generated using the IBM ISAT tool, as well as Excel, to generate price comparisons and maintenance costs over time analysis if required.   "
good,"While good opportunities and decent health benefits are offered, the staff aren't as supportive of the employees as they are of the clients they staff for."
good,"nice and good co workers and team player "
good,people there are very friendly and the work is productive and busy. Everyone works together and help each other. Job keeps people busy and time goes by quick.
good,"Ok company. But they show some favoritism. They gave me a job that was 7 days a week & 12 hours a day . That was great for me , i can handle work hours like that ."
good,"Manpower is an employee agency, send me to a seasonal job, fast place environment, a lot of work  they needed to reconsider the wage for some positions"
good,"Manpower is a temp to hire with not really any chance of getting hired.  They wanted to hire you full time it would not be through a temp agency. If you get a job through a temp agency, don't expect it to be a direct hire to follow.  Now with that said, I am not saying it don't happen, I just said that if you start temp don't expect it to be more then temp.  Great things come to those who done expect it."
good,Managed and implemented various IT solutions including upgrading PC's operating systems and proprietary software as well as commercially available software and hardware. All PC's and laptops were upgraded and refreshed ahead of schedule.  Telecommuter laptops with specialized applications were prevalent.
good,It was a heavy phones job.  Training took almost two months.  High turnover rate. Great views outside. There was no real structure with employees and phones at their desks.
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to work loggin in checking your e-mail.  Heading down to get breakfast and then back to work to later head down to grab lunch at the awesome Cafe.  The most enjoyable part of the job is, its a job with very minimal supervision and able to own my own organization and get the job done."
good,"They expect a lot from you at Manpower, however the pay is the lowest I've ever experienced. They don't expect anyone to stick around for more than a couple years."
good,"Jusqu’à la fin de ma période intérimaire en 2012 , Manpower m'a toujours confié des missions dans tout domaines et c'est pour ça que je me suis ré-inscrit dans cette agence après l'arrêt de mon activité en tant que co-gérant de société."
good,"I do not have much to say about ManPower. They did not try very hard to find me jobs that fit who I was. However, I did find one good job through them."
good,"It was an educational time at Manpower during my employ. There are many good people to work with, along with flexibility in building recruiting solutions."
good,Manpower was a fun place to work until the layoffs came. Seems like every year around the same time 20-50 people lose their job and not due to performance.
good,Falta de responsabilidade para seus funcionários o tempo que fiquei .
good,"Wages are low, but it is typical of temp agencies, no benefits.   Temporary workers are the first to go at the first signs of a downturn in the business"
good,Its good for getting quick wokk. Its 90% warehouse work. It can be very convenient to work with manlower but it has alot of fowns as well. They can be very strict and rude. Over all its just stuff you can put up with.
good,High Standards at the company. Leading footprint. Management challenges. Strong offerings for global clients. Culture has diminished dramatically over the last 10 years.
good,A typical day of work at manpower depends on what job they have for you because they are a temp agency. The jobs that I worked for them were good and they were Linda bean as a good processor and pine state trading company as warehouse reclaim. At Linda bean the hardest part of the job was working in a cold warehouse while dealing with the crabs and lobster. At pine state the hardest and messes part of the job was dumping the old bleach and other chemical materials. A typical day at both places started at 6am and went home when job was complete or was not needed anymore.
good,The job was easy. But I didn't really like it. It was boring and the people who are supposed to be helping you are slow. Not a bad place to work it's just not for me.
good,les chargées de recrutement ciblent mal les besoins des entreprises dans lesquelles elles nous envoient
good,He tenido poco contacto con la empresa ya que estaba contratada en otra empresa y solo entregaba el parte.
good,"War mit der Arbeit sehr zufrieden,habe die mir übertragenen Arbeiten gewissenhaft und zur Zufriedenheit des Kunden"
good,"Manpower is a temporary service that send temp workers from job to job regardless of the work."
good,"Manpower Can do a better job at communicating better with employees. Its hard to Contact them at times and it usually takes a day for them to call you back after leaving a message. As far as, Pros go, they usually have long contacted work when positions are available.They also, have great hours."
good,"My own opinion, manpower is one of the best temp agencies to work for. They are honest to their employees and pay fair wages.  They also have benefits packages availabe, and make it easy for their employees to choose direct deposit options."
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phones, entering data into spreadsheets and typing docs. Small amount of employees but great to work with. Very flexible schedule."
good,"It is difficult to get a pay raise as your skills tend to go unnoticed. Unfortunately, this is because the company you are placed with tends to not communicate otherwise."
good,"I learned how to pick, ship and quality check product. Most of the leads spent time teaching others how to do their job correctly. Being able to have an MP3 kept the night moving. It was fast pace and most nights went by without incidents."
good,"Overall, compensation was good. I just needed benefits, which they did offer, but way to high priced. And wasn't very clear on what the enrollment days were."
good,Entry level place to work for those seeking to gain experience working in recruiting. More geared to those fresh out of college or seeking a different career path.
good,The employees of Manpower were instrumental in finding me an employer that matched my skills. My skills included a strong accounting and management background.
good,"A typical day would be coming in racking out foam like deposit out of a machine, in two different buildings and whiping the gaurd rails or he support rails down to get the oil off.  The same plant type culture. The hardest part we did not get to, so management was the hardpart the most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,It's an ok place to work. I would go through them if I'm desperate for money. They put you in work environments that really really suck. Jobs that most people won't do. So I guess there is alot of work to be done. It also pays low for the amount of work done. You feel extremely tired and broke still even after a 10hr to 12hr day. I usually don't recommend this place unless I don't know you. Not my first pick.
good,"everyday we follow the company sate regulations as a clean room, did learned a lot be more carefully work with medical device and safe regulation ,management was always good some friendly other more strict about the culture ,we were from different country so .sometimes we shares the food or their culture ,One of the hard part of the job was the translate and communicated with other  people,the enjoyable can I sed the job was done right ,"
good,"My time at Manpower was short, but in that time I was given the opportunity to prove my skills to the employer and was offered a permanent position quickly."
good,I put foil rolls on the machine. set up the cutter to cut at the right size. we also tested the strips.They don't like the way you are they will let you go.
good,It was too reppitave for me. I worked as a loader and a dock picker. I loaded trucks with the product and  and made sure it was all secured with load bars
good,A falta de preparo dos colaboradores do RH/DP da empresa refletia de forma negativa na produção dos prestadores de serviço.
good,"без коментар ."
good,"Good place to learn and start a potential career.   "
good,"In the past, I have never had any issues with Manpower; however, back in January 2014, I was placed at an employer who orders tradeshow furniture for tradeshows in Las Vegas. I was with this particular employer when I suddenly received a phone call from Manpower, stating that I had been let go. When I asked for a reason, I was honestly not given one, but told that this employer would not or actually could not provide an answer to Manpower. While I do not necessarily blame Manpower for this transgression, I believe that the employer to whom I was sent to should have shown enough professionalism, which obviously was not shown, and when I did receive the call from Manpower, it was after hours on a Friday evening, which I found odd. I did have an opportunity to work with another employer through Manpower; however, I resigned from the position because I felt that I would not be able to pick up the necessary skills for the position. I believe that I was always honest with Manpower as far as the reason(s) why I chose to resign from particular placements; however, after resigning from Manpower in December 2015 or beginning of January 2016, I have not contacted Manpower because I truly believe that their placing an individual in a specific position doesn't always work out."
good,Assignment given was at Sanofi Pharmaceutical Company. Great co-workers. Very extensive training. Simple tasks divided into work stations. Rotating system in place to avoid job dullness. Management was kind and understanding. Hardest part was waking up at 4 am every morning. Most enjoyable was break time to enjoy the campus.
good,was moved around to much and work overtime was non-existant bosses were unhelpful to me and disrespected me in every aspect of my work.I was very unhappy at north tech.And would like another shot at this job.I like loading trucks because its a sense of achievement when finished a truck.
good,productive great company to find work just no longjiverty far as permanate work other than that a great company to work for with great pay wages
good,Good Company with helpful employees. Temporary Service to allow you to stay employed. Keeps a paycheck coming in. Management is great
good,"the job itself was amazing but the politics that went along with Bernard are somewhat lacking in the management level."
good,Ett smutsigt jobb med mycket bakterier och dålig belysning vissa maskiner hade ingen belysning alls när du skulle byta verktyg.
good,"-como qualquer call-center cheio de trabalho"
good,Quelque soit le Manpower on retrouve toujours ses marques rapidement
good,The Pella branch manager is very nice and easy to work for.  But in the long run they are a staffing service and they main objective is to please the company they are placing people with.
good,"- aprendí a liderar un grupo de personal (47 personas) algo difíciles de entender las normas de seguridad y las políticas de la empresa."
good,"A empresa direciona para trabalhos temporários e terceirizados. Cumpre as propostas contratuais e mantem uma postura bastante objetiva. "
good,"Working a variety of positions and at a variety of companies, I enjoyed the capacity to learn about a multitude of companies, industries, and job functions. One thing that I enjoyed the most about working temp jobs is that it was just a job... I worked to the best of my abilities and gave 100% in all I did but at the end of the day it was not a position that I had to own. I was there to be a bridge for the person who normally held that particular position. It was my job to make their life easier while they were away and create a smooth transition when they returned."
good,"Buena capacitación al personal "
good,"The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum (ALPLM) was a great opportunity. I learned a lot of historical information about Abraham Lincoln, his childhood, family life and upbringing, his life as a lawyer, his Presidential race, election and his assassination. I also had the opportunity to work with many different people from all over the world on a daily basis. The job required hands on learning as part of the job required answering many questions about the Museum, the exhibits and about Abraham Lincoln himself. There is so much information that I believe it would take a life time to know everything about Lincoln. I found it very enjoyable to work with the public and answer their questions. I worked under direct supervision of the Education Department so I also contacted schools about upcoming events, helped coordinate events and staff/participate in the events themselves."
good,Manpower itself was not bad however they get people in with a promise of if you do your best and show up every day you will get a full time permanent position. This is not the case at all. I was there almost a full year and right before I was up to be hired as a full time employee I was fired. Why hire people your going to have to pay more when you can cycle through temporary employees every few months.
good,"Manpower payroll support has no room for advancement, the MACC(manpower associate care center) does not have a knowledgeable management that supports its workers."
good,I learned alot working the differnt jobs at manpower. It was a good experience coming right out of highschool into the job force.
good,"Ces missions apprenent à ce rendre disponible et efficace rapidement."
good,"Typical staffing agency lifestyle with some added bonuses along the way.  Management could have been better in my location. Overall, it was good."
good,The company was very unsure whether or not the company was going to stay here in the south. It's mother company were from Illinois and nothing was promise for job security.
good,"Manpower possesses very interesting international programs. I had the opportunity to manage a program for the Mexican government. "
good,A typical work day consisted of locating various products throughout the warehouse and packaging them according to the customers demands and needs.
good,"bien en general, buen trato, la gente sociable y lo único pondría contratos más largos"
good,The staff there will work to find you a job as long as you call and let them know that you want and need to work . they keep a list of employer on there website for you to review and apply for.
good,Manpower is a good starting place to begin in the workforce.  It doesn't always place one in the best of working environments with agreeable employees.
good,"Typische Arbeitstage gab es bedingt durch die häufigen Wechsel des Arbeitsortes nicht. Das fing bei den Arbeitszeiten an und endete bei den auszuübenden Tätigkeiten. "
good,"tres bonne societe,poste de manutentionnaire, bonne amb=iance , bons collaborateurs, unpeu penible  parfois le poste"
good,los colegas no todos trabajan en equipo los directivos no defienden los intereses de los talentosos empleados que tienen en su empresa y el trabajo es en algunos casos mecanizado y no pagan los dias festivos ni te autorizan permisos por enfermedad lo rescata ble es el ambiente laboral.
good,"Att arbeta som uthyrd konsult har många fördelar med tanke på allt nytt man får lära sig om företag och olika företagskulturer och alla olika arbetsuppgifter. Det positiva är att man ses som en resurs men det kan ibland vara svårt att på kort tid sätta sig in i olika arbetsuppgifter med tanke på att det kan vara knappt om tid att lära sig de olika arbetsuppgifterna (bristfällig genomgång med tanke på tidsbrist) och att man trots allt skall sköta sitt arbete exemplariskt för att marknadsföra både sig själv och sitt företag. Men det är samtidigt en tillfredsställande utmaning."
good,I've gained numerous HR and Administrative experience working with this company. I worked with very knowledgeable people who I was able to rely on for any question I had. Management was open with employee communication within the company.
good,"pues eimpulsar bien el producto de la empresa dela que hya sido contratada,aprendi mas el manejo de supremercados de cadena,y pues lo k mas me gusto del trabajo es cada dia saber mas el nanejo de impulso"
good,"they're not bad. mostly warehouse hard work. they have only 2nd and 3rd shifts work. associate's are sometimes nice, other times not."
good,Would like to expand my experience and learn more.  I have yet to experience any growth opportunities within Manpower.  The benefits and pay doesnt cater to the dedication and growth that we as associates work hard towards for the company
good,"Pharmaceutical Operator, my night starts Sunday - Friday."
good,"Given the area I utilized Manpower for, and the employment rate in Imperial County, they were slow in providing assignments. I would still use this employment agency."
good,They do not really care about you and what you want to do with your life.  The local office was rude and short with you when you call and get information.
good,Me proporcionou o aperfeiçoamento das rotinas do Depto.Pessoal.
good,Manpower does alright to help you find placement in temporary jobs situations. I've been exposed to a variety of different manufacturing companies.
good,"It's a 3 day on 3 day off schedule but don't count on getting three days off unless the plant is slow, 90% of the time there is overtime which is great for when you want the hours but it's still there and still mandatory when you don't want it. The job itself is easy, mostly just dealing with packaging product and assembling product on a pallet. If you are in dire need of money I would say this job is good for that and nothing else. There is usually a lot of drama and gossip but also some good people, just come and do your job and you usually won't have problems. The downside other than drama is the long hours and extra days they make you pick up which can take a toll on your family and social life."
good,ok company to work for the co-workers are pleasant to work with nice work areas and equipment. I enjoy working with the people there most of them are professionals and good to work with and office help  if they can
good,Somewhat helpful but work assignments are to sporatic and most are not in my field of work. Most are too far for the money amount of pay.
good,"clock in work 12hr two day on two day off, Then work one month off one month and the contract is 1000hrs or 6 months what ever comes last. I learn working for a Manpower got me jobs faster but anything could happen. The management is good and the co-workers are too. The hardest part of the job is waiting for straight work, like 40hr every week until the contract time is up. what i like most about manpower the staff personality"
good,Manpower is a temporary staffing agency that places team members in many different work environments.  This provides opportunities for the team members to learn more in different situations.  This also provides the workers the chance to work with a variety of team members.
good,Location is just currently opening and is still going through its growing pains.  Long work hours and seven days a week. Good hours if you are not family oriented.
good,"Working for Manpower gave me experience, but some of the work was not permanent. It felt like as soon as you got attached to the work, they would end your assignment. Sometimes it was not always Manpower's fault, but in fact the contractor themselves they brought you into. Most of the time, the job assignment was given to you with neat instructions. Other times it was a mess, mostly because the company I would be contracted to had no clue how to even train their employees. "
good,"llegaba iba a mi oficina y me ponía a verificar mi correo electrónico  , abriendo los correos con diferentes hojas de vida que llegaban, las perfilaba según los requerimientos que tenia pendientes, citaba alas personas que cumplían con el perfil . "
good,Manpower is good if you can't find employment. You are usually treated less than fair compared to the employees that work at the facilities that you are assigned to.
good,"The recruiters are very accommodating.  I was given an immediate work.  The negative is no benefits, vacation leave and sick leave.  Management should consider to permanent as Manpower employee after 6 to a year of continuous work with Manpower even though employees are assigned to different employers. Also, Management should take a look the possibility to increase the salary."
good,"Manpower gets people in the door to hopefully get into a career or field that compels them"
good,I feel job placement was poor. I was looking for a temp to perm job and they keep placing me in temp jobs with little hours. ?When there is a problem with pay it is hard to find help to get the problem fix.
good,Being an agency no two weeks are the same. I got to work with so many different people and companies. I worked with the London borough of Haringey and got a full time job in the stores.
good,"Great teamwork attitude and camaraderie. Feedback was inconsistent from management, and some management was ego driven and inconsistent. I suspect this was due to elevated stress levels and fatigue due to high overtime demands and lack of good planning. They do compensate fairly well and tend to treat their employees well. The supply chain was frequently broken, and tools, supplies and equipment were many times sorely lacking. Several co-workers were very good at training and instructing, but sadly,much of the management lacks in training and orientation."
good,Job en intérim donc travail selon la demande des entreprises.
good,It was a nice place to work. When I first worked with Manpower we used to get incentives and gifts for the work that we did. After change in management all of that stopped and the morale began to slowly drop.
good,"Repetitive tedious movement, Glad we rotated ever hour, 2- 15 minute breaks, 8 hours shifts, I worked 1st and 2nd shift, was told the day before to inform me i was working."
good,not all the workers have the same passion i have for doing good work day in and day out there is also to much down time between assignments.
good,"Como tive experiencia como temporária e minhas chances de efetivação foram muito pequenas, digo que a empresa é boa."
good,I learned how to inspect products in high paced mass production setting.
good,"Zeer ambitieus bedrijf, werksfeer is heel productief er wordt weinig gecommuniceerd onder collega's."
good,"Arrive at 5am and start pulling orders for the day. Pull and stage orders on dock for pick up. Unload parts for receiving from freight trucks. Receive in parts for stocking later. Take in returns around 7am. Issue orders to installers shortly after 8am. Once all orders have been issued put returns in back to stock as well as all newly received parts. After dock is cleared, handle all discrepancies sent per email if any."
good,I was promised work until January and they failed me. I still haven't been called for my personal items left behind either. The assignment location was fine
good,I learned allot of new skills working here and i met some really great people. This job really challenged my physical abilities in a good way
good,"Missions divers et variées."
good,Mainly routine work.  The work load varied day to day and hour to hour.  I learned something new every day.  I learned of evaluating procedure and different variables that lead to varied results.  I was given the task of data entry and handling the filing of paperwork because I enjoy an organized environment.  My coworkers were patient in me learning their procedures.  They also were able to trust in me handling projects with accuracy.  The most difficult part of the job had to be becoming comfortable in the workplace and the tasks at hand and having my contract expire with no ability to continue my employment.
good,"Its my part time job."
good,"Regular eight hour days, had good co-workers. I enjoyed the freedom to talk to customers on a daily basis. Hardest part was commuting."
good,Overall it can help you get back on your feet and I would recommend them over any other temp service
good,"Atypical day at work was sign in wait for the managers and get to work. Then break work Break work then It was time to go home. "
good,me dieron la oportunidad de formarme como promotora y conocer una profesion de desconocia en la que tambien me ayudo en mi vida personal
good,"I would like to be a little more productive"
good,Bad place to be as a temp. Have to deal with foul mouthed rude full time employees at Hilti. If you complain you are the one that gets in trouble. Very unsafe workplace. Full time employees don't use safety equipment while operating forklifts and cherry pickers. I would never work full time there. Some employees were violent and threatened bodily harm including death threats....Good company ...bad employees
good,Manpower was a good place to work for as a temp agency. They would match you up with jobs that best fits your experience.
good,"have to wait long for a job, and they keep getting your pay messed up...that you have to be taxed two times, rather than once."
good,"General clerical office duties: make cpoies, fax & file. Maintain history of airway bills."
good,"Très mouvementée, les journées sont rythmées par une multitude de tâches à gérer. "
good,"Recebimento e disposição dos materiais, organização e distribuição em semáforos. Comunicação e métodos de publicidade . Boa gerência, ótima equipe. Lidar com o publico, na maioria das vez é agradável, mas em algumas poucas exceções é um pouco difícil."
good,temp agency its ok but you never know if you will have work or not so not a good steady source of income but ok if its all you can find.
good,"Handle inbound calls.self motivated, team player, dependable, customer service oriented, work well under pressure and flexible."
good,"A typical day is pretty good"
good,"Working as a temporary agent is awesome, the flexibility and vast positions that become available to suit my skills and talents gives me the ability to contribute and execute the mission to fulfill the needs of the client"
good,"Being sent from job to job, More like a temp. agency. Co-workers were good to work with. Getting to job sites was sometimes hard to do, needed a map. The best part was just being placed without the work of doing it myself."
good,"Worked at an office furniture place, "
good,I learned warrent processing of parts. Data entry and more shipping and receiving skills. I enjoyed learning more computer skills. And the only thing that was hard some days was dealing with the intense heat. All my co-workers were very hard- workers and outgoing.
good,Well first off manpower is a temp company. I got work for 2 weeks and then after that nothing. They said the sight i was working at ran out of materials and they would call me when they got more in. Well i never got a call. I called 2 times and got nowhere so after that i just gave up.
good,Run machines and inspect parts.The hardest part about the jobs at manpower that it was only temp.I learn being a team player is always a good thing.The co-workers was not very nice cause i was a temp. but it didn't effect my work
good,"Manpower started off keeping me busy, but when I was transferred to another branch. I have received no work."
good,liked working with co-workers.  Loved my supervisor and the office manager.
good,start out with employee meeting get schedual for the day. pull in pipe to inspect and cut after new threads put on place caps and plugs on pipe send out of the building for pick up. Learned i realy don't like office work.Most of my co-workers were easy going fun. the hardest part was the schedualing of manufacturing materal and truck loads. the most enjoyable was the times everyone was on time.
good,We started our morning off with the daily stretches. Then we return doing our work. Some of the co workers are friendly and some would talk about people. I didn't really like working around the negativity. The place had mostly elderly people working there. There wasn't really nothing hard about the job. And there wasn't really nothing enjoyable about the job. It was the lowest paying job I ever had for Assembler. I don't think I would work for the low of a pay again and the work experience I had in a warehouse workplace.
good,"On a typical day at Manpower, we would sit in a cubicle all day and receive calls from customer's who are having issues with their cell phones. A lot of the customers being angry and only a few being upbeat and happy. The work load is near impossible to complete and the goals were kind of outrageous. Truly, the other coworkers are what keep you going at this workplace. The hardest part of this job is trying to fix issues that you, personally, did not cause. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to fix the issues. Hearing the happiness in the customer's voice when you're able to fix their reason for calling in was the best part of this job."
good,Jag fick jobb i en lågkonjuktur och var glad för det. Jag fick lära mig nya saker och trivs med kundtjänstjobbet. Jag vill inte skriva något mer om företaget eftersom allt ändras.
good,Typical call center with the usual duties of multitasking and applying to the rules and regulations.
good,"Working as a chef in the mining camps in the Bowen Basin has been ok. But I would really love to be back working outside as a gardener again. "
good,a hard and long day at work  management was ok workers were good to get in with
good,no benefits. no job security. People there need to be a little friendly to incoming customers.
good,Manpower is a temporary work place. I am sure my experience is not the same as others but I felt like I was never going to get anywhere with this company. It was difficult going to a job site knowing that I was going to be let go as soon as I completed the job at hand. Manpower is a great place to help people find quick employment. But their not good at finding you permanent employment.
good,"- Pessoal agradáveis;"
good,The company is only interested in the political views and to keep the seats filled. Not exactly who does quality work. More like highschool rather than a work enviornment.
good,The only thing I would Change is job security. The jobs were always temporary positions.
good, I just needed to show up and do my job and learn as much as i could. my co-workers were easy to help and work with. management was good to let me know what i needed when i asked them questions.i enjoyed learning some thing new.
good,A temporary job service that helps to find jobs quickly. Lower paying jobs but lots of choices.
good,"no hr benefits,"
good,"On a day to day basis i was a switchboard operator for a government company. everyday i learned new skills, we had many different contacts in which i was trained, These incluse HMP, Rail, Natural England, and a 999 railway emergency operator. my co workers were very helpgul as we had to help each other out alot of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing i helped a customer as much as i could."
good,"8:00 da manha me reunia no banco, locomovia para area de porta a porta, preenchimeto de contrato para abertura de conta, para poder solicitar maquinas de credito, documentações necessarias, não tive acompnhamento de gerencia so via web, trabalho solitario."
good,"They are very snotty people that work there. They thought they were better than you, hardly talked to anyone unless you fit in there category."
good,There is no job security and the payscale is minimum wage.
good,Helped me get a few temporary jobs but not at finding a permanit job.
good,"I loved this job for about a month, yet when I found out that they have a habit of double speak it made me a little uncomfortable. Overall they're great people , but they have their ways of keeping a tight fist on everything. Very strict workplace."
good,job wasnt bad just smelled awful and it was really hot w no air in the summer.
good,"This type of job needs a lot of workmanship. Nice co workers, the hardest part of this job is you work repeatedly for almost 3 years. Accountability is a must..."
good,Fast paced unstructured environment with little direction or accountability from managment.
good,Operating a sit down Fork lift on a daily basis loading and unloading trucks
good,Worked well for a summer job and paid more than minimum wage so it was a good place for in between college semesters.
good,This is a good company but they are going through some changes which makes the job positions a bit unstable.
good,"Business Management, Operations, Client Relations"
good,Agradeço pela oportunidade de aperfeiçoamento profissional. Trabalhei com uma ótima equipe que proporcionava um ambiente agradável e estável.
good,"A typical day as did my responsibilities at work varied every single time I had a position because I worked as temporary employee. So where I worked would differ with each assignment. Management also differed with each assignment as did the co-workers, and what a typical day was. It just depended on what the client needed. What I learned was how to be incredibly flexible, go with the flow, learn how to adjust to new and different environments."
good,weighed out chemicals.enjoyed learning out all the different chemicals
good,"At Manpower, I was a temporary employee- you never have any job security."
good,"Initial temporary position was in Community Development where I answered a switchboard, data entry and general clerical. I worked in the Legal Department where I worked as the Truancy Hearing Clerk. I entered truancy citations on a spreadsheet, created court documents and transcribed the outcome of each hearing. I loved working with the Legal Department Staff. The hardest part of the job was answering phone calls from angry parents. The most enjoyable part was seeing great improvement from the student and the case being dismissed."
good,"Manpower placed me in a position which in turned hired me. The company I worked for was great, I liked all of my job responsibilities and the co-workers were great. I learned a great deal of computer experience and my typical day was working on the computer with spreadsheet, payroll and help desk. Once I learned my daily responsiblities I did not have a hard day. The most enjoyable part of the job was working."
good,I was happy with the places of employment they placed me at but they placed where I didnt have an opportunity to be hired on full time.
good,"typical day could last from four, eight to ten hours. Be there on time. They handle there everyday cituations professionally. The hard part could be dealing with the new faces on the regular. The enjoyment is cash in hand at the end of the working day."
good,good temp service would recommend in the future. Very easy to find.
good,"I would receive a call per each assignment most of the time. I learn to do my assignment and keep personal business out of the office, howerver I get alone with each person I meet. The hardest part is not getting a temp to perm. The enjoyable part is the weekly pay!"
good,Great jobs with wonderful employers. Different locations and great environments.
good,Liked getting to meet new people.
good,"This is a pressurised environment, which I thrived on. The BT management style was ok. Though due to the pressure put upon the staff, the management would give one to one coaching advice even if there was a minor mistake, it made the conrtacted staff feel insecure about the contract. I learned a lot about the role of call centre workers, and how BT operates. The hardest part of the day was the volume of calls and the time allowed to speak to the customer, enter this on the software packages, run line tests, advise the customer where the fault was within the BT network and wrap up the call all within 340 seconds. Then the next call would come through in 2 seconds of the previous one ending. The contracted BT staff and the contractors were all very friendly together, and the BT staff were quick to offer advice if/when it was required, which was very helpful and not patronising."
good,"I worked for a company through manpower temp, the people were nice the training was easy it was ok"
good,As a staffing agency the where able to gain me employment. Good people with morals and values.
good,They will help you find a job. But you really have to keep after them.
good,"They are a great company to work for when you can, there is very little work for people over 60 years of age.."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Manpower but it was mainly because I loved the job they put me in at Great West Life for 15  months.  It was the only job that I received from them and in order to get a raise, I took a term at Great West Life.  Manpower didn't call me after that and I found full time employment on my own."
good,"No flexibility with dealing with outside issues... Lack of respect coming from some of the clients for staff at the job site they sent me to...."
good,"Started at Manpower with No recruiting experience, but learned the process quick and was able to contribute right away. I had the opportunity to grow and advance my career."
good,"was something different everyday"
good,"entreprise agréable , évolution un peu longue mais prise en compte au bout de nombreuses années"
good,I have work there it is good to gain knowledge..in the proper way...there is no work load in that department i work in good manner...Small scale industries to learn more
good,"Was very enthusiastic about where I was placed. Was excited to learn and enjoyed doing so. I worked in a warehouse environment so duties "
good,I like the fact that I was given a job quickly. What I don’t like about Manpower is I have been calling for weeks to get place @ a new job site . And still haven’t got a call back. I wouldn’t suggest Manpower to anyone I know.
good,"As a contract employee, you get NO sick days or Federal Holidays pay"
good,"My overall experience working with Manpower has been both positive and negative. I was a contractor for 7.5 years finally got a permanent position which I was excited about. My management was up and down in my roles, some good and some terrible. Manpower doesn't pay competitive wages and really value people for their long-term dedication."
good,manpower works hard to place you in the industry in which you have experience in.  Management replies and responds to inquires relatively quickly.  Upfront and honest
good,Enjoyed dealing with office staff but there is some breakdown with communication . I don’t think they ask enough questions of their clients when releasing an employee.
good,"Worked on the DXC contact."
good,Always willing to place you for a job. The process is simple and easy. Goes the extra mile. Management very helpful to find answers to any questions that you have.
good,"Via Manpower så jobbade jag via bemanning, vilket innebär många byten av arbetsplatser eller visstids utskickad till ett par ställen som behöver folk under en viss period."
good,"Overall my experience with manpower has been okay. Getting started with them was rocky, they knew nothing about the job I was applying for and any helpful tips they tried to give were the wrong answer so I'm glad I decided to trust my gut and do things my way otherwise I would've never gotten the job. Also, ever since I started with them I've only been contacted twice. Once a week after I started and the other after a poor but honest survey I did."
good,"Don't do it poor paying on time."
good,I feel they don't try and find something you are interested in. They just fill where ever is available. I guess a job is a job though. Can't be picky.
good,"Hours can be long (lots of after-hours calls to candidates), and there seems to be too many layers of management.  There is the positive of being able to work from home occasionally."
good,"Dado que se trata de agente de intermediación laboral, no existe oportunidad de ascenso o línea de carrera, por tratarse de labores para un cliente."
good,seasonal tax processor for bank of america treasury .!! just scanning taxpayers checks and in thru mail review .. nice environment all personnel was nice enjoyed my time there ...
good,"Un tipo de trabajo distinto a la s ventas es el Trade marketing, se aprende mucho pero laboralmente tienes un techo"
good,"This is a good place to start a career and meet people, but it is hard to move within the organization and pay is lower within this company than competitors."
good,"* Work with Stanford University’s Gift Processing center"
good,"Manpower has been a good company not to much interaction with management or with an advocate. I've enjoyed my time here at this location I've seen many people come, and go over the years for various reasons. The environment has changed somewhat, my assignment with the PA CareerLink for the most part has been very good. I've learned a lot and my duties vary, answering phone calls and dealing with people are sometimes very challenging. Each one you talk to has different needs and goals. Computer skills are pretty much basic, and its fairly easy going with employers as well as with job seekers."
good,"Sono entrato come interinale, la mia esperienza e' durata poco ma è stata molto stimolante e interessante"
good,Not enough assignment. The pay is low don't get no over time assignment don't last long management was ok work was boring had to travel a distance too work
good,"Great starter job, but not a great job for parents. Insurance plans are below average and incredibly expensive. The pay is also below average pay for the job you work."
good,"contacte avec les intérimaire"
good,Stressige aber abwechslungsreiche Tätigkeit und nette Kollegen.
good,Manpower placed me with a well known Manufacturing Facility.  I enjoyed the work and learned a lot about the manufacturing industry.  Initially there was flexibility with days/hours worked but six months into the position new management took over and strictly reduced the amount of flex time available.  The complete culture of the department drastically changed under the new management.
good,"Nice people,excellent pay,pretty easy work, plenty vending machines"
good,"Jag är tacksam för att det finns sådana företag, en del känner sig utnyttjade men jag ser det som att jag utnyttjar deras tjänster."
good,"well i usually get to work, greet a few of my co-workers while I'm getting ready to go to the floor and once i go to the work floor i make sure my area is nice and neat also stocked and ready for the day. Just so the day goes according."
good,I'm disappointed the position didn't turn into long term employment. I'm not sure if employers actually hire people for permanent positions now days. The pay was good.
good,Hadde forventet noe tettere oppfølging i et oppdrag med så stor usikkerhet
good,La position de l'intérim manque au regard des clients valorisation et respect. Une personne qui décide de travailler en intérim cherche une issue favorable à son destin. Elle porte des savoirs-faire mais aussi des parcours de vie qui ont du mal a se conjuguer dans un monde qui trop souvent reste figé dans un esprit où les institutions sont encore trop cloisonnées dans une conscience sociétale qui souvent n'offre pas trop de confiance envers les parcours d'autodidacte qui pourtant pourraient apportés au monde d'entreprise innovations et avancés...
good,"The positives Include:"
good,Job was not a bad job at the time. Worked some production work and some warehouse. Inside production work and outside loading work. Overall working for manpower at a Dow plant was a good job.
good,"It's an OK job to work at but in my opinion the workers should get paid more not only for the work, but for the amount of hours. My Supervisors  started me at 8 hours then by the next week made me stay for 12 hours, to which that is way more that a full time schedule."
good,Not bad company just sometimes had jobs with tough employers or company's that only had temporary work.overall though nice people that do try and help you get into work.
good,The perks are working remotely which allows you to move without looking for a new job. The team was friendly enough. The pay really isn't that great for the amount of experience I have. The health care benefits are basically non-existent. For the better of the two options you have available you would end up paying about 430 a month for pretty average coverage.
good,"The job is perfect if you are a student, or need another job on the side where you can make your work schedule around your main one. You call in and they tell you the days the company has available and you choose which ones you want. The pay for each job is determined by what the company hiring you is willing to pay minus Manpower's fee for acting as the middle man. Some of the temp jobs will offer a lot of hours, while others barely fifteen. It is a competitive job, because work slots fill in fast if you do not call in fast enough."
good,"Manpower provided employment when I needed a job, the pay was very low, the opportunities were very limited. I don't believe it was all Manpower's doing, IBM didn't respect the role administrators played in the company."
good,"I worked for a very small Manpower location with a total of three other staffing specialists.  The manager was not the nicest person and initially hired me for a full-time position to handle a very important client of theirs.  She found out shortly after hiring me that my husband used to work for them and the client they were hiring me to staff for.  She discriminated against me because of this through no fault of my own and it seriously impacted my work experience.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers, interviewing candidates, and providing our clients with highly qualified employees.  The workplace was a fast paced, and highly competitive environment.  I believe I performed exceptionally well."
good,"I was sent to Euclid Industries. It is a car part manufacturing place. We were paid half as much as the people who actually worked for Euclid Industries,"
good,"had to quit due to transportation, the Manpower Managers located in Alexandria,LA had me assigned at proctor&gamble look over qualified individuals to hire friends,,"
good,the work place was a very diverse culture which was a perfect environment to work in. A job was given and as long as work is done you are left alone. Hours was reasonable
good,Manpower was a staffing agency that placed me at an apartment complex to work which was a very good job in my opinion the only problem was the job was temporary
good,"Where I was place the overall management was okay. Nothing to brag about. The coworkers weren't driven to work as hard as expected do to the feeling of low pay, and many of their attitudes were very negative for the work place with always trying to start fights. But the Manpower managers are very helpful and try to do everything they can to place you in a work place."
good,"As temporary employment facilities go, I have found Manpower to be fair and pleasant. The only drawback to Manpower, as with most temp agencies, is they don't offer benefits such as paid time off, dental insurance or reasonable health insurance.  Other than that they have been good to work with."
good,the company has some good oppurtunities that come up but the management need to have a better way of communicating with the employees and provivng the correct info
good,"Brinda seguridad, ambiente laboral agradable, se cumplen los beneficios de ley"
good,Pagos y beneficios puntuales trato directo con el trajajador
good,Il y a une bonne ambiance. Je recommande pour le contact avec les entreprises.
good,"There really isn't much to say accepted that getting a call for an assignment was few and far in between. I typically would only get called for jobs that lasted 3 to 4 days, and then would go weeks without work."
good,"Checar horario de entrada y planeacion del día, entrega de ventas del día anterior, aprender nuevas técnicas de ventas día con día así como trato con diferentes clientes, trabajo con áreas diferentes , administrativo y operativo. Amor a lo que hago vender."
good,"fast and slow days did a lot of paper work of signed trucks & trailers of delivery & picks "
good,"Found out that if you are a certain race you will be placed in stereo-typed jobs ie. Mexicans were usually placed in cleaning positions.  If you had issue with parent company, Manpower would not go to bat for you, but would submit to parent company.  Worked for over a year for the company and all Issues I had were ignored, and I was threatened more then once if I kept bringing up issues."
good,Very good recruiters they kept me busy. I did both clerical and warehouse jobs with them. Got my forklift certification from one of the assignments. They gave me a lot of choices of jobs.
good,It was a decent place to work with good management. The hours were steady and the work was challenging. The compensation was not up to par with the volume and difficulty of work.
good,Good learning opportunities.  Many departments have been turned over to a vendor managed service.  Flexible work arrangements available and good benefits.
good,"Manpower is good starting point when you want to get your feet week.  For example, reentering the workforce and you lack work experience.  You will be assigned to jobs that help you get the experience that you need."
good,"In a typical work day, it was a constant work flow, I learned a lot from working with coworkers on a daily basis as a team to accomplish goals for each day. the hardest part of the work day would be to meet numbers as a team. The most enjoyable part of the day would have been setting the work goals and accomplishing them."
good,"Low wages for the amount of work that employees had to do. Manpower does train their employees ie., MS Office Suite if needed but still low wages paid."
good,A temp service with man assignments but not always truthful when it comes to details. some full time positions turn out to be part time in reality. overall a negative experience
good,"Overall experience was not in my favor due to  at will, but if one door close another will open. That being said I'm still active for opportunity for full-time work with Manpower Professional Staffing Services, Inc."
good,Manpower is a temp hiring agency. My job assignment was at a company called sporlan valve. I worked on a production line that consisted of sodering a valve together and letting it pass through a paint booth.
good,Worked at Swift Transportation Company; scan and file all paperwork submitted by employees; distribute requested information to claims department;help with opening mail
good,"I enjoyed the work place, each employee had their own work space,"
good,I think that Manpower was a great opportunity for me to start working in the administrative field and to be able to try out many different jobs to see what fit best. I appreciated the fact that I always had someone looking for a job with me and that I didn't have to do it alone.
good,"What I dislike most is working for a temp company, working in the same 2 departments for 3 years, get called back each season, am experienced in both departments, yet I am paid minimum wage, the same as everyone else that are complete new hires and have no working knowledge of what the job entails until they come to work on day one.  Manpower states it is harder and harder to find people.  How about a pay raise to the one's that come back repeatedly, are well trained and wanted back by Department of Revenue Managers?"
good,"Non stabile non continuativo."
good,L'agence Manpower sont sympatique mais les entreprises sont parfois embetantes
good,"Warehouse work is cool.was looking for something more hands on.love the hours,seven to three thirty.The big boss even bought pizza for lunch because we where on time with shipping."
good,This was a temp job and only if you like this type of work and in this industry it would be good for you. This is like a warehouse job. Only if you like this type of work.
good,"My typical work day varies. Sometimes slow paced and sometimes fast paced. Since working for manpower I have learned how to skid load, load trucks and assembly. The work place culture is pretty good,no complaints. In my opinion there is no hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part is working in a very clean environment with friendly work staff."
good,"This job keeps you moving, it requires being on your feet alot. They work with you and try to give u the hours you need to successfully be able to work.."
good,Low pay . Unsteady work was injured while working for the company and was treated as if they didn't care and no concern for my well being. Not even a phone call
good,"Lavoro sottopagato."
good,"Being on call, it depended on the work assigned and the company sent to. "
good,"It is hard to write a positive review for a JOBS company who laid you off.  I think that about says it all.  They had a limitless pool of talent within...  yet chose the easy way out to increase the bottom line by outsourcing, and then forcing their professionals to train the outsourced.  For shame.  Really, in this day, for shame."
good,"I've really learned a lot from Manpower. However, they were not stable with management. It changed very often and sometimes without formal notice. They tend to overwork their employees."
good,Manpower is a temporary service in his temporary services go it's not bad. Personally I don't prefer temporary agencies. I prefer full-time employment at permanent jobs but you got to do what you got to do to get things paid.
good,"fun environment. some places were better than others. staff members were very helpful and friendly. they kept you moving from one job to another and sometimes long periods of time. i worked a entire year with this company and ended up being there for seven years. became record center coordinator. and i got employee of the month through manpower and my job."
good,I did get a really good job through them. I have been thinking about returning to them for another job in the future. The staff was always friendly and helpful.
good,I needed a local job quickly and they placed me in a local manufacturing facility.  The pay was a little lower than I feel it should have been based on the pace and stress with the position.
good,"Pay was accurate and weekly.  I went to an assignment"
good,"My review is not going to be helpful unless your a temp for Thyssenkrupp aerospace. With that said, using a temp agency to screen your future employers is a smart thing to do."
good,"Was assigned to CCSD HS cafeteria project. It was my first job in food. Kids were sometimes out of line, but the staff and student workers all got along fine."
good,"Overall, the company doesn't mind working with your schedule if you have any conflicting dates such as doctor's appointments, school-related activities, etc. "
good,El tipo de trabajo permitía que se lograra un excelente ambiente laboral entre mis compañeros de trabajo.
good,"If you love , talking on the phone and enjoying Weekend ms off this will be a great job for you , also you do not work after 6pm , so you still have time to enjoy your day."
good,I didn't like the company because the staff was not nice when the called me and told me my assignment has ended they were I sh i could have stay at HB fuller longer but they let me go i will not work through manpower anymore
good,Very difficult to plan around this company as some weeks there was no work but then thanks to them I got the position at Windsor Life where I stayed for 7 years
good,Great place to work if you already have a fulltime job and need some extra cash or have a need to moonlight .I am no longer employeed through this company due to inconsistent work placement.
good,Desde los jefes cambiaria todo es arbitrariedad y no cumplen lo q t prometen
good,"This place is full of opportunities for those of you who choose to actually find a job and not live off the state.  The people who work here strive hard to find you a place for employment, they're great communicators."
good,I loved the REAL group feel and would go back if compensation was what was needed. The management needed a little help but all in all not a horrible place to work.
good,"While working with Manpower was a pleasant experience, there were times when I waited months between assignments. Unfortunately with the economy as it is, and the fact that bills need to be paid, I had to move on to something a little more secure. The people at Manpower were good to work with."
good,google fiber call center not a hard job but the description they gave us is nothing like what it really is. the other jobs i worked for them have also been wrong on the description.
good,"fast pace , not much of a job security. didnt have much care for medical emergency. i learned a lot at the job they placed me in but manpower cut me out of the career opportunity when a medical emergency came up"
good,This company was efficient and very professional in their staff management.  The work they supplied to me was constant and secure. The position that I filled under their employment was for a good reputable bank where the staff were friendly.
good,It an ok place to pick on some work but if your English speaker it sucks cause there are mostly Spanish speakers at jobs you get put in. Yes their are some people who speak both but mostly don't speak it alot anyway.
good,The work availability depends on who the case workers are. Some are better at getting jobs for you. Definitely for temporary work. The availability of jobs depended on the quality of case worker you had.
good,I liked the people I worked with.  The company had a beautiful office.  The company did good community service.  The systems worked pretty well.  I was let go because of the bankruptcy
good,"Yo daría un 7.5  ya que las instalaciones y el personal no están bien organizados, falta de comunicación entre las empresas a las que mandan a laborar."
good,Todo bien con sus políticas y contratos. Me agrado los beneficios que te brinda y el apoyo
good,Por se tratar de setor terceirizado deixa a desejar do quesito de salário e benefícios.
good,No hay posibilidad de mejora profesional en el puesto de promotora.
good,"I found the greatest advantage to using a temp agency such as Manpower, is the open scheduling and ability to choose the hours and assignments that best fits ones commitments and responsibilities"
good,tanto por comentarios de muchas personas como alguna experiencia en el pasado creo que podrían mejorar en las poloiticas de contratación dando mejores oportunidades a mas personas
good,"ventas y atencion al cliente, explicar los planes y los equipos a vender"
good,"Ambiente agradável"
good,Es una empresa terciaria la cual no mantiene contacto con los empleados
good,"dysfonctionnement des directeurs, mauvaise coordination des ordres donnés"
good,"My assisment was great , got offered full time position and 1.50 raise with in three weeks. Manpower is good up until your frist week of working. And then your on your own"
good,"I don't remember much about Manpower. I know, though, that it was not a hostile or tense environment. I remember things always going very smoothly. There were not gripes, at all that I could recall. Great place."
good,"Worked in a Manufacturing facility that produced industrial hydraulic hoses, learned a lot during the 5 months I was there. Most of the people were awesome to work with, but some had bad attitudes towards their pay and Management, which made it a hostile environment at times. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with short notice orders that needed to be completed the same day, which took time from completing your regularly scheduled orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was most of the people I worked with were great, and the hours and breaks were best in the business."
good,"I have done warehouse work plenty times before, i got along with where i was placed for 3 weeks until others noticed i wouldn't complement and make extra efforts to get along and socialize with management due to work at hand and safety. shockingly i was not offered employment."
good,"It is a different organization now with absolutely no job security and terrible workplace culture."
good,"Empresa organizada contudo poderia focar mais a componente pessoal de cada trabalhador."
good,"Two weeks at manpower building of paid training.  Then to Cobham company, actual work place, two weeks of MIC die attach training.  The third week assigned to solder station which I wasn't trained for.  PO's are no help at all.  They won't speak english clearly."
good,It was a great learning experience for me.  I learned how to manage payroll for multiple offices in this position.  The management skills  I learned at Manpower have prospered me in many ways through the years.
good,"une seule mission avec cette agence pour le compte d une entreprise qui n a aucun respect des employer ! fin de mission avec celle-ci , depuis plus aucune proposition ! c est bien dommage !"
good,"worked only short time, find me work fast and always nice and easy to deal with, was low pay but depends on contract and with who"
good,Was a very busy place to work. Made alot of friends along the way who I am still in touch with now. The office in Barrow is no longer open so this review isn't really of any use. Not really an awful lot more I can say.
good,"After 4 weeks on the job, the work hours were reduced from 40 hours per week to between 20 to 30 hours per week."
good,"where I'm working now matches my skill level."
good,"The company is a good company to work for,but its the clients who we work for they,re clients have no compassion for convicted felons who try to come home and turn there lives around and be a productive citzen they will keep you on as a temp all the way up to your 90 days or more then when its time to hire you in your no use to them like Jac Products,they will let u go even if your a good worker."
good,I worked at various places for Manpower and have learned a lot about the companies that I worked at.  I learned how to process and inspect bags for different companies at Sierra Packaging.  I processed plastic ware and restocked work stations at Max Packaging and packed hospital kits for Careline.
good,"While working at manpower, it consisted of a fast-paced, hard working job. While only being able to have a 5-10 min. break everyday, it all payed off. Working hard is something that I enjoy doing in very little time!"
good,"I've always liked Manpower. I got my last job that lasted for 8 years with them. When I lost my job, I went back to them but it just seemed different to me. "
good,The work at Man Power was challenging and I had no problem with that. The schedule was very flexible. I learned how to work with team members on both their good/bad days. I only disliked the racial problems that were goingon at the time. I would be more specific but it's a sensitive subject so I rather not tell so.
good,The company i worked for was in bid for contract the manpower associate did not verify my background for company hire only temporary placement as needed for the company. i worked 6 months and 3 of orientation to have my background check comeback as not meeting company requirments the work was decent and managment was happy to have a dedicated worker. 80+ optional a week. Family knit enviorment but the comunication was terible between coworkers and people were worried about the plant closing.
good,"In Galpon's support line basicaly the job was about answering calls from angry costumer's, for reading comunication, and  give information about the service and about the invoicing."
good,Managers play favorites no room for growth no pay increase. No paid time off because they keep you as a temp for so long. It is busy with no breaks and management is horrible
good,"El pago era aceptable, las empresa como tal, Bastante legal, sin embargo el personal encargado de la supervisión no motiva a sus subordinados , no tiene interés en optimizar el equipo de trabajo ni fomentar el crecimiento personal a base de crítica constructiva, más bien ""destructiva"""
good,"Good money can be made if your willing to work 7 days a week. Otherwise it's still above average for compensation. The largest downside is the host company's management (this is a temp agency) rarely hires it's temps no matter how good a workers performance or work ethics. Nor are you allowed to apply for any open positions while employed as a temp there. All in all, if you're just looking for a job for now, it's good. I stayed there a year as a temp."
good,entreprise démontrant sa grande capacité d'écoute et d'échange auprès de ses collaborateurs
good,"É uma empresa multinacional de recursos humanos, que infelizmente as pessoas são números, e quem gere a área de recursos humanos não o faz com a visão da produtividade pessoal de cada um, ou da mais valia que pode ser reaproveitada de cada funcionário, mas sim um conjunto de interesses que visa protelar o favoritismo do fator C."
good,"Fast paced,  a lot of lifting, bending and standing.Some long periods of downtime. A good portion of employees spoke little English. Communicated thru hand gestures."
good,"The work was not hard, the people were nice. There were good days, just as there were bad days. It was a good job.I enjoyed working there. On the days that it was hot it was hard to get motivated to work in the warehouse."
good,"The on site HR person was very nice and helpful and encouraging. I will say though that the low pay and outrageous price for insurance make it much less appealing. You will have a 1 year contract, and more often than not, they'll keep you through the one year. Overall, good for someone straight out of college as beginning job experience."
good,Een mooi bedrijf. Er is sprake van dynamiek maar ook veel van politiek. Dat sprak mij minder aan.
good,I enjoy working for the company that I am placed with. When it comes to ManPower itself I think they lack in management skills.
good,"made a lot of friends, the management was little to be desired. I got along with the other employees great. I miss them even to this day."
good,La parte más difícil es que como físicamente estas en otra empresa en ocasiones te hacen a un lado por no ser parte de ellos. De allí en adelante todo lo demás está bien.
good,"Reconnue Travailleur Handicapée avec une RQTH, les postes ne sont pas tjrs adaptés malgré que les recrutements demandent des personnes handicapées"
good,"El trabajo a desempeñar muy sencillo, el ambiente muy cordial y el horario excelente, el sueldo justo conforme a las actividades a realizar."
good,"Manpower périgueux, propose peu de mission et l'accueil téléphonique n'est pas à l'écoute de l'intérimaire, une fois la cinquantaine atteint plus de mission."
good,best thing to meet new people and also to get out there and have and make a difference in the world. but its allowance pay and more volunteer work
good,did not like manpower because I was only given daily work and half the time I never worked all the hours I was told I'd get because everyone would be sent home early
good,Es una empresa de colocación. donde se me mando a laborar para la empresa Gas Natural Fenosa la cual esta ultima no paga comisiones
good,"Era muita tensão todos os dias, tive experiencia graças a empresa mais não oferece crescimento. A gerencia é super discreta, meus colegas de trabalho estavam tão acostumados com problemas que se cumprimentava o básico. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era ter coisas para entregar no dia 3 as 17:30 e te passavam as 12:00 do mesmo dia, a parte mais agradável era conseguir cumprir seus objetivos"
good,Lärt mig bemöta många människors behov med min service det var den bästa delen med jobbet
good,"Hard to rate this position, as it was a very short seasonal position. Did learn a few things in Retail industry however. Store was kept in good shape"
good,"Requests for Quote received via email daily."
good,This company provided limited resources and support to do an efficient job with assign task. Work environment was stressful due to the lack of management. Employees were uncertain of specific job duties.
good,"freneticità del lavoro, niente pause e doppi turni."
good,"I had been with Manpower for about a year before being hired on at Hamlin Electronics. The second time I went with Manpower (4.5 years later) they had found me a job quickly. However I had a medical emergency with myself and got chewed out on the phone for calling in and told ""I should have taken care of it before starting an assignment"" when it was something that came on out of nowhere. I think they need less rude people in their management system. "
good,This was my first experience with a staffing company.  It was an interesting experience. They claim to have your best interest at hand but when it came down to it it seems as though they had the companies best interest.  Some of the onsite superviors were helpful but the benefits and time off offered are lacking.
good,"Clean and effective work place  Good instuction and communication. Team meeting were not only informative, but a place to give new ideas."
good,"My career was in transition when I found my way to this company. Management was very helpful in teaching resume skills, the proper ways to approach a job search and the proper attitudes for a job search. My rep eventually found a position for me at an auto lender that I eventually went permanent with."
good,I liked the different jobs I was sent to with the exception of one.  I learned a lot working for different companies and different environments.  I was a good learning experience.
good,"Es una buena empresa  que nos ayuda a desarrollar algunas actividades que nos hacen mejorar laboralmente."
good,"This is a good place if you need to find work quickly and/or temporarily. Sometimes you can find a job through them that will lead to being hired on directly, but most job placements are temporary and short term."
good,"I had many assignments for manpower. Most of them were at Abbott. "
good,"Not sure why this is saying manpower when I put K.E.R. (Kelly Engineering Services)"
good,"Typical day consisted of repetitive work. Every one sort of stuck to themselves, including management. Near impossible to be hired on as an employee coming from a contractor position"
good,Company could be more organized. Employees need to be screened better. Thieves were working with me. Otherwise it was a good company to work for.
good,"I was assigned to a manufacturing Facility in CO. "
good,The staff will call and give you jobs and some times if it is a dirty or awful job they will leave out certain details you won't find out untill you get there.
good,"my assignment with Manpower was very busy most days. I learned lots of ways to de-escalate a situation with an  angry customer. Although , management could have used more training on everything. Over all I was happy to be employed and they gave paychecks on time."
good,this is a temp agency they can get you on a full time job but if it last is the question some times they do but not alot so if you dont mind jumping around job to job this might be for you can build skills with this because your always doing something different
good,"did not know what I would do day to day "
good,"It was hard to get in to a place through them and 98% of the time they don't send you to companies that hire you in... some of the places were nice and clean places to work, but never worked at any too long."
good,En los dos años aprendi muchas cosas nuevas y me gusto mucho el trasto con los compañeros y el travbajo en general aunque era duro
good,"une journée de travail typique. Sans grande difficulté,simple et clair . Bien qu'un peu répétitif selon les postes  comme toutes usines."
good,"Dagelijks is het spannend wat er op je afkomt en als afdeling ben je toch bezig samen het geld te innen. Ik heb in dit bedrijf geleerd dat je mee moet veren in alle veranderingen om je heen en vooral gemotiveerd blijven in wat je doet en je kennis/kunde te delen met je collega's. Directie is niet zichtbaar maar houdt de medewerkers aangesloten over alles via calls waar we staan en waar we heen willen en wat ervoor moet gedaan worden. Is dat je zoveel systemen met een dezelfde info moet invoeren en dat is erg tijdrovend niet moeilijk maar vind het niet echt efficient. Het moeilijkste is dat je als afdeling een doel krijgt vanuit hogere lijnen die toch soms niet als afdeling behaald kunnen worden ,omdat er andere factoren zijn die het beinvloeden om het haalbaar te maken. De contact met de interne en externe klanten en het oplossen en meedenken in het oplossen van problemen. Betrokkenheid heb ik als leukst ervaren van deze baan"
good,"I didn't really care for the management, the office culture, or the way employees were treated. I'm really glad I'm no longer at this company."
good,"Working wit Motorola technology, programming radios, inventory for rentals, shipping and receiving for rentals department. Connected radios to computer scanned barcodes to program radios with the program customers requested."
good,I have been working for manpower for two years now. They have a strong partnership with some of their companies. The company I work for is flexible and always have assignments for me when one is ending.  I like the steady work flow. The management gets things done when you need them and have always made sure my pay checks were right.
good,A typical day with Manpower is interviewing and building client relationships. My co-workers were easy to work with. Management should have been available more often. The hardest part of my job was ensuring that all job orders were filled in a timely manner.
good,"Não há instabilidade, colegas de trabalho com um difícil acesso de relacionamento de trabalho."
good,"Setting up ride and breaking it down for travel. Safty inspections regularly daily mandates and long hours.The work was hard but it seemed to be worth it in the childrens appreciation and ""SMILES"".........It was all worth it."
good,"4 ans en intérim, pas d'embauche en vue sur le site de brétigny, je cherche une situation stable."
good,"My assignment was at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center in Mount Crawford, VA.  It was a great place to work, good atmosphere, helpful coworkers."
good,Great place to work. Assembly steady time went by fast good people and managers.
good,"This is a good position.  The job is very important and much need in our society today.  We provide Enteral Nutrition to patients.  We work alongside government and commercial insurance companies, nutritionist, and physicians to ensure that our patients are serviced."
good,"Onde me deram a oportunidade de voltar a ativa. Me abrindo portas e oportunidades."
good,"positive place to work, learned to work together to accomplish assignment. kept busy all the time."
good,"Manpower is a great place to help you find a job when you are in desperate need of work. I have done warehousing most of my working life and that is what I really wanted, so this job wasn't really the right one for me. I did appreciate them giving me something so I had some income."
good,didn't like the fact that the companies they work with don't want you full time !!!
good,"Busy loading boxes, fun crew. Stayed busy all the time.  It was a temporay job my assignment was over."
good,"J'attends de leur nouvelle pendant deux jours, je les appelle pour demander mon horaire de la semaine et pas de nouvelle il faut les appeler 2à 3 fois par jour et encore il trouvent le moyen de demander mon horaire à leur client à 16h45 à presque l'heure de la fermeture de l'agence - - '"
good,"Moving households. I learned to work hard untill the job was finished. I liked an respected my management.got along with the hard working men, not so well with the slackers. I move very heavy items with very long days. I loved getting a big job finished quickly."
good,"i have been lied to about a job advancement, always pointed out my flaws never thanked me for the good things done when i was really needed"
good,"Very nice company to work for.  I would I have liked very much to have been a permanent job. I would have liked benefits, overall a good company."
good,"It was always hot and very cluttered, not a lot of space to walk through certain areas."
good,Manpower placed me quickly which was awesome! it would have been nice if they had notified the facility that placed me though as my appearance caused some confusion. Also I showed up to work after 3 months of employment and was told I was replaced. When I called Manpower I was not told anything because no one spoke to me!
good,"This has been a challenging role to match just the right candidates up with just the right jobs to create a harmonious pairing for the client.Plus we have to answer phones, interveiw candidates, manage a schedule, follow up on associates work performance and attaempt to do marketing to new clients. Must be a multi-tasker in this job role and like people."
good,This is a global company but offer slittle room to advance unless you live in Milwaukee
good,"On a daily basis I performed the general clerical duties of a secretary. I enjoyed being challenged to write reports from data submitted to me by engineers. The finished product was given to the manager I supported for review. As a contractor, I had to learn to adapt to working for a person that was not my supervisor and a supervisor that I rarely interacted with. The year I spent with Manpower gave me the opportunity to improve skills I use on a daily basis."
good,"see review for SSS  My title was shift coordinator, which was synonymous with supervisor as a temporary employee. All responsibilities and work load were the same both as a Manpower temporary employee and an SSS employee"
good,I have been considered as A Self Starter and been allotted Team to handle one day in which I was given Challenge. With my skills and confidence I has done it wherein I gave 8 Shortlistings of candidates from 9 interviews done in a single day.
good,The recruiting associates are very enthusiastic and wish to place everyone in a job position that best suits their needs.  Temporary Associates are able to accept or decline jobs at their discretion.  The wide range professional job lends to work experience and helps future employment quality.
good,A fast paced environment where reactive and pro-active meet. To work in this field you MUST be a people person with thick skin and a sense of humour as this will get you through difficult times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is placing the right job with the right client.
good,liked the people hours were ok but pay was bad. costumers weree great to work with
good,"Aprendi mucho aqui, me tocaron un supervision y un coordinador, que me dieron las facilidades del caso, para poder desarrollarme y adquirir la experiencia que ahora tengo."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me answering the telephone, filing, posting to accounts payable, and accounts receivable.  Also I was required to run errands for the company. In this job I learned how to use a program used for keeping account information.  Management was very nice and helpful to me.  They always helped me and answered any type of questions that I had.  I always got along with my co-workers. We were all like a little family. The hardest part of the job was sometimes finding things to do. I would ask upper management for duties and sometimes there would be noting to do.  I was very bored at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the people in the office and being appreciated by them."
good,"It is temp company, the people in office are good.. Has its flaws, not always able to find you full time work. Companies worked for thru them have seemed to be pretty good people."
good,Travaillant depuis plusieurs années chez cet employeur j'ai pu experimenter differents postes et differentes façons de travailler mais cela reste tout de meme du travail temporaire et les garanties de travail ne restent pas sures ce qui peut etre un handicap dans le developpement de la vie courante.
good,was a very hot place to work in the summer and very cold in the winter.a very fast pace work environment.
good,My overall day at work was good. Had great co-workers to work with and encourging. Hardest part of my work having client upset and not willing to listen so you can assist them in proper and expeditiously
good,a dead end job when it comes to starting a family. cold conditions and slow process.
good,Good company to work for.  Management cares about their people under them and will do what is possible to keep them.
good,"A typical day at my workplace, Safrans Morpho Trek, was different everyday. There was never an ordinary day it was always different. I loved it. My co-workers were awesome and my partner was a hard worker just like me. Going above and beyond as if the work that we produced would effect our lives personally. I loved working for Morpho Trek. It was awesome. I loved going to work on a daily basis. Although it was a bit stressful when we would find cards missing, it was always a joy to look for them and very rewarding once we have located them all."
good,"Slow no work at time"
good,"part time job at  Abbott, I've learned to use a scanner, use a stand up walker forklift, and work alone, they had a lunchroom with hot food."
good,les missions sont en générale trop courtes et parfois les contrats ne sont pas respectés jusqu'à terme car le travail est fait plus vite que prévu.
good,Clock in and start mandatory stretches the on to the production floor. I learned how to use time management better and also communicate with my higher ups better. Management were very friendly and helpful. My co-workers were fair. the hardest part of the job was the hot days. Knowing I worked hard and did a good job.
good,would of liked higher pay. liked working with people also fast paced and the time went by quick.
good,"work mostly outside but good team to work with,mostly digging equip.learned alot aboout oganizing people tools etc.management was strict but fair got along with co workers stayed profecional as most sites called for digging in desert dirt or rockes and cactus most enjoyable part of day when job was done to costomers satifaction"
good,A nice place to work not to dirty and everyone seems to get along.
good,Je suis partie de la société car pour évoluer dans la société il fallait passer par un poste de commercial et cela n'était pas dans mes objectifs de l'époque
good,"Un dia en el trabajo era el siguiente llegar a mi tienda designada ver el stock de los productos, gestionar los quiebres para que llegue la mercaderia llenar los productos en las gondolas de la tienda a  la vez colocar buenas exhibiciones para aumentar las ventas los días de recepción de mercaderia eran los mas tediosos porque el camión que transportaba la mercaderia no tenia hora de llegada, con el pasar de los dias se volvía una rutina creo que eso fue el motivo de dejar de laborar para la empresa a la vez tambien el no poder aspirar poder ascender aun puesto mas alto."
good,"Por lo general buen sueldo, en épocas buenas de trabajo, continuidad laboral de una empresa a otra"
good,"Sempre tínhamos de ver as mudanças de preços, mudá-los e abastecer as gondo-las, e atender os clientes.Trabalho em equipe rende melhor o nosso  serviço.Meus colegas de trabalho eram minha equipe um ajudava o outro, mesmo não sendo do mesmo setor.Lutar contra o cansaço físico .O reconhecimento das pessoas e trabalhar com pessoas."
good,"Worked as a team on the line making books I filled pockets , sometimes but mainly operated 3 knife trimmer. I would also pack or skid down the books sometimes. I was trained and asked to run sewing machine, shrink wrapper, glue off machine, spiral bind, and stitcher. Management was very helpful in training and giving me the opportunity to learn other things. The other employees some temps some regular staff were all very helpful and easy to get along with."
good,"I show up, Go to my work station. Ask first shift if anything I need to know and proceed to do my job. Which right now is sorting corn for Pioneer."
good,"Har haft både korta och långa uppdrag och mycket varierande arbetsuppgifter och olika branscher. Kul att lära sig nya saker, sätta sig in i nya rutiner och försöka lösa en uppkommen situation på bästa sätt. Svårt ibland när arbetsplatser är belägna så att det innebär långa resor."
good,"Assembly line worker"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  There were tons of opportunities.  The management is great, the staff is friendly, and the pay is decent.  The work loads are reasonable."
good,"I enjoyed this job. I was one of the only few females at the work site and was treated well. The company works hard with you, if you put effort in to find you a job that best fits you and your needs. polite staff in the office as well."
good,"At the time the company was big and actually cared about the employees.  Even though it was a temp agency I started with, they still made me feel like family"
good,"I work at a bank through manpower which was a job placement company in florida. I did basic teller work. I handled commercial banking at times, and work at the drive through window. "
good,"J'occupais le poste de manutentionnaire en interim."
good,"This is a temporary agency, they find you a job all the time and if you desire you will be working all the time"
good,Manpower had a job lined up quickly. Every one was nice and those on site were  very helpful.
good,It was a ok job. To much rules in the jobsite like going to school.
good,"Experience my last contract as a bank analyst and the position was in a fast pace and energetic environment.  In this position my mental stamina was tested.  I learned a great deal about the company, money management products and how to truly work under pressure.  My co-workers were very pleasant and an enjoyable bunch of folk to work with.  The hardest part of the job was working under management who at times, were misinformed and gave incorrect information and or created a redundant amount of work."
good,"I had a recruiter that was very polite and did everything he could to make sure he helped me have a smooth start to my assignment. After the assignment was over, I never heard from them again."
good,"I would work in several different factories doing several different things. as a temp worker there is no job security, there is no garuntee that you will have work the next week or even the next day. Benefits only counted when you were working and forced you into debt when you weren't working."
good,"Go into work in the morning, assembly line."
good,"A typical day for me at this job was coming in, signing into a specific job then proceed to key the necessary documents. After we had finished with one, we would then proceed to get up and sign into a different one in the time clock. The coworkers kept to theirselves and did their job. Management was alright to a certain point"
good,"Manpower is ok to work at , But they hardly have any work , when they do it may be a couple days here and there I used to work a lot with them now I just do Banquets"
good,"Everyday were given a schedule of what to do,"
good,Management lacks skill and control with unrealistic expectations
good,Manpower will find temporary assignments that will provide steady pay. However advancing to full time as an employee at the company in which you are working is tottally dependent on the Company you are a subcontractor for
good,"As I work third shift at this position it is difficult to seperate the events of single days as it seems to last perpeutally. The management and coworkers are some of the nicest I have ever met which helps when spending many hours a week together. I am glad that I was allowed to master my abilities on the forklift and become certified, giving another skill to add to the list."
good,"normal mis primeros 15 dia fue un poco dificil adatarme ya q no conocia a nadie y operaba un montacarga en mal estado,aprendi a superar barreras en cuestion de trabajo y a adatarme todo tipo de trabajo mas o menosno fueran tan buenos miraban a uno muy mal adaptarme ya q no poseia un buen equipo para demostrar mis cualidades como montacrga y depender de otros para poder realizar mi trabajo, el compartir"
good,Manpower is a worker placement agency that supplies workers for construction sights and a few permanant sights. Does not talk to workers about job opertunities before or after the corent job is completed.
good,"A day or work can be from transporting a vehicle some were or multidrop deliveries. Everyday you gain exsperiance learn better customer service skills and get better at the job you do each day. the management is ok in the company it could be better by asking you the night before the day they want you to work but always polite and understandable. The hardest part of the job can be if you get stuck in traffic because of rush hour or an acciedent and you are makeing deliveries, is the catching up on the time you lost because of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the driving and meeting new people"
good,it was a good company to work for i jsut got offered a better job and me n my wife and kids moved away.
good,a typical day at work was to come in to n assigned truck number and key the numeric data off box.
good,"I worked through Manpower for a few years. They had jobs for my talents, and even had ""fill in jobs"" when I was between assignments, so I was really never out of work."
good,"A good experience altogether however, not very reliable as far as a secure position."
good,A typical day was to come in help with mail if needed the begin to bill and invoice cases
good,worked assembly. Overtime was either mandatory or voluntary.
good,There not a bad temp service. Kind of wish i stayed. I am not writing a review because unless you experience it for yourself one persons opinion should not affect wether they look for work or not.
good,"Working with this company, I was able to learn many new things, most of which involved working with different programs on the computer."
good,Having a stable position is the hardest part of the job. I enjoyed Recruiting and On-site positions although there was to much up and down with the business itself. I was moved around a lot and couldn't find a stable location to work for.
good,they try to find jobs that fit you and you fit the job. lots of different places to go and people to work with.
good,Hot and fast paced. That I can accomplish anything that I put my mind to. Being on time and showing up for work. Everyone was friendly but had limited time to communicate. Packing out. Feeding bottles on the assembly line.
good,They like to find employers that will pay high for their services but will not pay their personnel the amount that they need.
good,"My duties included breaking down , cleaning and restocking shelves. General house keeping duties."
good,"The Manpower personnel were able to place me in a job with pay of $10.50 an hour. However, when contacting the Manpower staff the receptionist was always too busy to talk or always interrupted not giving me ample time to finish a sentence or a question. I found it more beneficial to talk with the manager."
good,-CV screening and Interview for candidates
good,great place to work go to work everyday and the work is there for you if you are coachable.
good,They have continue to find work but not possible temp to perm position.
good,it was hard work but the guys that i was working with made it fun.
good,I learned how to assemble Video King Bingo electronics together form start to finish with the exception of trouble shooting the exponents of malfunction systems to get them back into operation.
good,Many days i was left without work for weeks at a time and this company is suppose to be based on temp to hire but most projects werent as long as a month.
good,"A typical days work is based on the job that your sent to, but overall you learn soo much through each experience your given i learned computer skills that i didnt have before working a temp. job for statefarm insurance it was a wonderful experience working for them and meeting soo many new faces."
good,"Hardly any job security at all. I worked through Manpower at a factory, received my lock-out/tag-out within 6 weeks, and still was laid off after 4 months. I was never late, and had excellent performance on the job."
good,"Enjoyed working around a diverse group of people. Germans (calibrating and UT machines), Indians from India where the plant is headquartered, then the deep Mississippi and Louisiana southerns along with my North Western sound and perspective, was quite the mix."
good,Worked on assignment on Temporary basis• Determine the number of drivers and vehicles available and create a work schedule that will ensure all deliveries are made on a timely basis.
good,"Manpower was an excellent company. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that once your time was up, that was it for you. No trying to find another job placement or at least lead you in the right direction for another job."
good,Manpower did'nt make enought of an effort to find me assignments. I'm still registered with them.
good,Work place could be better it has changed a lot over the years employees could he taken care a lot better. Pay could be better. Management should work as hard as hourly and should know more in order to train..
good,"Je me suis plu dans cette société le travail était intéressant ."
good,"aprendi mucho sobre el area de recursos humanos, es un ambiente muy dinamico y versatil"
good,"Lack of communication. Three months since I left, still no P45, and no one answers my emails. "
good,The permanent employees are always right. Temp workers are cutthroat--do not trust anyone. They will smile in your face and take credit for your work. Or if you make a mistake they will make it seem 10x worse than it is. The permanent male employees harass temp workers and get away with it because Manpower doesn't want to lose their contract.
good,Manpo is ok it's a  temp service that hires mostly during the holidays. They hire who they want to hire it's an ok place. I think they could do better with there pay especially if working a 12 hour shift or plant job
good,"El clima laborar era algo friccionado, ya que con cualquier cosa te daban retroalimentación a pesar de que uno tuviese la razón"
good,"É uma empresa normal em termos de ambiente, no entanto os salários dependem bastante do cliente para quem vai trabalhar."
good,"Facilita el tema de los trabajos, la unica critica que tengo, es que por ahi tarda tiempo en regularizar la situacion con Anses. Lo que hace dificil cobrar de nuevo la AUH, y hasta periodos de 12 meses o mas tener estos problemas."
good,"Aside from the job scope itself, one factor that significantly influences how employees feel about work is the environment. By work environment, I mean everything that forms part of employees’ involvement with the work itself, such as the relationship with co-workers and supervisors, organizational culture, room for personal development, etc."
good,"In my experience, the only downside is management. Work hrs can be okay. Payment can vary on the position but they are not too bad as other agencies. Overall not a bad agency but not the best."
good,"They are very apprehensive about giving employees perminant positions, benefits and a sense of stability even if you're bringing in revenue and connections."
good,"Great place to work for but not getting the hours now that I was when I started with them, no fault of Manpower though, the docks where I was working has gone really quiet."
good,"Working with colleagues from all over Europe and beyond created a good atmosphere, but some people in charge created more stress than was needed in my opinion."
good,Work until assignment complete.I had 7 different temporary assignment over the last 3 years at different companies. they provide quick employment when i was in need of work. I learned many different set of skills and techniques through training from various companies.
good,"The experience with the Man Power group was more a result of the job assignment and may not by a representation of every job they are affiliated with, that being said, it is a staffing agency."
good,No leadership training is conducted there.  The one's in charge don't know what is going on and they never leave their offices.  The safety training is good but the rest is a joke.
good,"Its very hot and long hours. Plus the job they hooked me with was mandating overtime when it was a 48 hour week to begin with. Unfair to me and its very annoying to work the place they gave me. Plus it was their ""only option"""
good,MY task were to pred mail and scan documents i also indexed checks with 100 % correct and i open mail and and stamped mail with correct dates and departments
good,"al tratarse de un outsoursing, no tiene mucha relevancia su politica, ya que en realidad trabajas para sus clientes y ahi cambia todo, ademas te finiquitan cada año para no generar antiguedad."
good,All details about upcoming job were not shared with us ahead of time. No results when we complained about the requirements of the job. No acclimating us to the environment.
good,"I enjoy working with Manpower. We have a very relaxed office, a great team. There isn’t too much room for advancement because none of the managers ever leave."
good,I received great support and feedback from the representative at Manpower. She consistently found job for me that fit my requests and work experience.
good,I like that it's fast paced and I have options when it comes to working and a flexible schedule.  I would recommend this job for anyone looking for a flexible schedule
good,"it was very difficult working for new companies.  The permanant people always felt threaten by the temps"
good,"Good work place just need higher pay & more places as working sites or either bigger contracts for employees to work on job-sites."
good,"Každý pracovní den v této společnosti přináší něco nového. Ne zažila jsem ani jeden den, který by proběhl přesně tak, jak byl naplánovaný. Práce je velmi pestrá a různorodá a skutečně se člověk u ní nenudí. Někdy je to zábava, někdy naopak velmi těžká dřina. Jako v každé větší společnosti i tady příznivé změny jdou dost pomalu, obzvlášť pokud nemáte podporu vedení. Na druhou stranu díky Manpoweru jsem poznala spoustu nových lidí a získala tak mnoho nových přátel. Nejhorší na této práci je vidět zklamání lidí, jenž očekávali něco jiného a zase to nejlepší za dostiučinění je vděk těch, co spokojení naopak byli. Toto povolání  mě naučilo, že práce s lidmi je ta nejhorší a zároveň  ta nejzábavnější práce, jakou jsem kdy měla. I proto bych chtěla do budoucna zůstat v oboru."
good,this was only a temp job that that was at great northern corp it only lased 6 months and it was too fast pasted. I couldn't keep up never got called back after the slow season
good,"Manpower is an agency that provides temporary employment to people on different job assignments. Management didn't take the time to back their employees, they focused on more getting the numbers up at any time."
good,I have enjoyed working for ManPower but I am exploring other options. The people are friendly and supportive and they offer many tools to grow as an employee.
good,Not bad good to work if you live in Shelby Township teach you how to work fast pace teach you how to weld parts a good job to move up quick if you do your job and all about quality
good,"Extremely long process to get hired as a ""permanent"" employee.  But it is a good experience if you are new to the work force. I have been temporarily employed for over year and a half with the promise to get hired as full time on 1st shift."
good,"I worked various of positions with manpower from warehouse production to retail management. I did electronic board assembly, retail merchandising, call center, etc"
good,"Mangament was not that good, the pay was okay not enough. But wwe could work as long as we liked. The work environment was nice, I got along with all my co workers.  I learned some warehouse skills also."
good,"Bon dans l'ensemble, missions bien rémunérées, personnel agréable."
good,"joined manpower 3 years ago to work at jaguar land rover, had to take a 5year agency deal , the last year has been a nightmare. had a clean record but still lost my job at jaguar due to “brexit” “diesel tax” “china market” problems. 2018-2019 more than 1000 people at jaguar land rover solihull lost their jobs, including me, no job security, 2weeks notice been given after 3year service , what a joke. good pay and ppl working there , that’s about it, no help from manpower"
good,"When I first joined Manpower I thought I would be working in one place. I quickly learned that instead I was being hired to be contracted out to another company. If you want to start a career, this is not the place to go to but if you're just looking for work to get started on finding a job then it works very well in that regard."
good,"Prendre les ordres "
good,Aprendí el manejo de los clientes vía telefónica indicando información correcta y eficaz al momento de diagnosticar fallas o la venta de los productos promocionales de la empresa. apoyo en todo momento del supervisor del callcenter.
good,Manpower is ok as far as temp agencies go. It was decent pay with steady hours. They do not offer benefits though. They allow a few days you can miss before you are reprimanded but they’re understanding.
good,This company shows very high turn-off rate among employees. However the working hours is really flexible which is during weekddays only from 9am till 6 pm
good,"Overall the company I worked for through manpower was okay."
good,"it's a temp agency. they do provide a decent healthcare plan for more long term employees, but it still has about the same job security as any temp agency. I was fired out of the blue twice while working for them."
good,"As an employment agency it's what you would expect. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember much. I do remember always having to call to check in to see if they had any work available."
good,"would b better if the recruiters cared more about the people, if you could long term positions, benefits given working, you do meet great people working though"
good,Manpower ne se soucis pas du bien être de ses salariés.
good,"It can be a good place to "
good,"my typical day would just be conducting telephone interviews or taking inbound calls to solve the issues people may be having with an application. "
good,"Es una empresa con oportunidad laboral y colocan en referencia a tu perfil laboral, lo malo es  que los empleos son por periodos muy cortos."
good,"Bom espírito de equipa, horário não é certo, salario incerto"
good,It all depends on were they send u and they send u to good jobs but jus to far.. Some times the jobs dont last long sometimes they  do... They will work with you but they work u hard and dont pay enough...
good,never knew where you where going till you got there and if there was n o work they wouldnt call you off they made you go home if there was no work unfair
good,Taking inbound calls at a call center. The volume was high so there was always someone on the line and they were always displeased with the performance of UPS.
good,"Murray KY manpower was amazing, fast placement with work.....  2007"
good,"Ok place to work but working through manpower, they get about 7 dollars an hour of your pay from the company you actually work for. Could be a bit stressful at times with the demands of parking so many vehicles properly  in an allotted amount of time"
good,They have sent me on some good temporary jobs. Manpower is not the best paying temporary agency but they always try to fit me with what works for me and do a good job of helping me get through.
good,They train you at driving a forklift. You have to be quick at picking orders. You get to listen to music while working. Everything is fast paced in order to meet shipping standards.
good,Una empresa que brinda opciones y beneficios a sus colaboradores para hacerlos sentir comodos.
good,"I worked in manpower for a couple of days as that was all i could handle. I was told in the job description that I will be working as a indoor mail sorter, but as the job started I was hanging heavy bags, handling trolleys and moving them from one part of the building to another.  The worst thing was that I still haven't been paid properly and its been five months and I have tried so many times to get a hold of them but I end up with no response."
good,"To be fair, my role at Manpower was as a 'temp' or 'temp to hire' employee.  Basically, this review does not reflect the internal positions within Manpower as a staffing agency.  "
good,overall it was a good place to work and the staff was friendly and willing to help or work with you. always willing to place you in jobs they feel you would thrive in or get the best learning experience out of. the staff is very friendly and work with you if you need a day off or some time off
good,Manpower management is not very well trained. I loved the work and the associates. Manpower is a company that gets you ready for Walmart its only temporary.
good,The job itself was okay  but I didn't really like it there because it's not stable. You could be doing a good job and all of a sudden you get let go..
good,"This job entitled myself to work on my office skills. Answering mutliple phone lines, typing, filing, etc. although the work was on and off.It taught my useful skills I will always have under my belt."
good,"It's an alright firm, the management often leave a bit to be desired but you'll find that with most agencies anyway. the 12 week "" Parity "" pay where they near enough take a third of your wages was what eventually made me leave."
good,"Throughout my time at RBS i was part of many teams."
good,"There are a lot of good people that work at Manpower.  The Downtown Milwaukee location is fantastic.  The facilities are excellent.  There is a free, secured parking ramp with a walkway - great in the rain and snow!"
good,I like the fact that the times I have asked them to help me with employment they have found a match for me right away and i had a job within a week. The jobs I had with them I liked very much because it was exactly what I was looking for. I got another skill which was data entry it was hard at first but I am a fast learner so it became easy to me. Payday was always on time i had no issues.
good,"Allegan manpower are rude and doesn’t help everyone get a job. I rather go to zeeland manpower, they helped me get a job. I really liked how they helped me."
good,"When you find out that your pay is roughly only about 50% of what the contracted company was paying to Manpower, you get filled with a sense of indignation.  In the temp-to-hire scheme, the contracted company will generally want to keep going through Manpower in lieu of offering you a full-time position, and the pay and benefits that come with that."
good,Manpower is a temporary agency.  They give you what they have available and you work it.  They aren't responsible for what is going on at the venue.  It is what it is.  Its meant to be a layover till a more permanent place of employment can be established.
good,A typical day at the work place would be taking call all day and assisting my guest as best as i can i let my guest know what i can do for them and not what i can't do make sure to apologize to the guest and see what i can do for them to better assist them. I learned to be more confident in my voice.
good,I support many executive while employed at Manpower. I learned many skills that help in my career currently. Meeting new people was the most enjoyable part of my career at Manpower.
good,Working for Manpower was fine. They were just a go between for temporary employees and the Target Distribution Center. Working at the warehouse was stressful. Days were very fast paced and long.
good,the work experience was worth it. Was able to work for AEP as a forklift driver through Manpower and thoroughly enjoy that job. was able to work for them for a year until my services were no longer required. I was able to gain much needed and valuable  work experience.
good,je suis tomber de sur de bonne entreprise ou j'ai plus acquérir de l'expériences
good,Gostei do jeito que eles trabalham e da forma que eles nos trata.
good,It was a good temporary position for what it was worth. It bought me time to find a permanent position after a layoff from a previous career. It was what it was.

good,Basic factory work. 8 hours of doing the same thing over and over. I thought it was a little unfair because some of the Amway employees were doing the exact same jobs as us and got payed $5 more an hour. Other than that the people were awesome and it is a good place to go if you are in between jobs and need a little income.

Its very inconsistent   some weeks you work  and some you don't. its a side job. keep applying for other jobs. you will have jobs you don't like but are required to finish. you will learn new skills and  meet new people, learn to network!!! people will help you out.  pay is average."

good,Working with manpower I gained most of my work ethic it just sucks being a temp n yu get let go for pretty much anything and it's not properly investigated .Besides that I nv went too long without an assignment and the pay was very good.
good,Stressful atmosphere. Could not achieve targets. Too much pressure given on achieving targets. Very much distance from my house to the office. Not too comfortable
good,People make all the difference. During this stint with them the staffing recruiters had a habit of making employees feel like they were expendable instead of valued.
good,Of the tem agencies I've tried I found Manpower to be the most reliable. They offer training and consider what jobs you really are most suited to.They offer unique positions and are fair in their pay.
good,They gave me work. Not recommend for long term. Just work to get you by. Don't expect any rewards from certain jobs. Although I am glad I was giving an opportunity to work for them.
good,Required unrealistic numbers for production and expected more if the production was met. Learned how to put together fuel tanks. The workplace didn't treat Temp. workers fairly. Hardest part of the job was mandatory overtime. Most enjoyable part of the job was supervisors noticing the work i was putting forward.

good,"work days were typically slow with not a tremendous amount of work coming in daily. The pay was very low and there was no room for advancement. A typical day was inputting data entries until they were complete. I mastered my job and wanted to advance; however, the advancement opportunity did not exist."
good,"Both their client and myself consistently had issues getting in contact with our Manpower associate. I am assuming this was a one off occurrence, however."

good,"The company seems good. I don't get much interaction with reps from the company. I'm contracted out to a different business for work. Haven't had a review about my work performance in a long time. Generally work is 40 hours per week, some weeks are longer depending on the projects. Don't get paid time off, sick days or benefits."
good,I got to learn a lot of different things but if you weren't from there and friends with the manager then you were an outcast which made it had to fully enjoy it

good,I learned how to build walk ways and weld. The people there are  really nice and funny. They will divide us up day or night shift. It's a 7 day job.But it is really fun
good,"I was lucky, I had people fortunately, who knew I was skilled and appreciated it.  I was assigned to the same company for many years consistently.  I was treated as an equal for the most part.  The exception being the pay.  After all the years, I made less money per hour doing the same job that I did when I began.  But the work environment made it worth it."

Additionally, I have become familiar with numerous VMS tools utilized within these programs."
good,The job is different from the company itself. The job is not advancing. The company doesn't care as long as your at work so the get paid.
good,"My job is fairly easy, to me anyway.  I verify paperwork, work with computers, test product within the plant checking to make sure that everything is within the allowable range for the certain specs of that product.  I've been a temp for longer than they originally told me, they keep changing it, so its hard to trust the management in my department. I have learned quite a bit, my co workers have gotten better in the last week.  I get 12 an hour so that's pretty decent."
good,"This role required many skill sets, recruitment, vehicles, warehouse sites, tooling, training & creation of account for the ongoing of the business. This was a very hands on in setting up & recruitment of the right staff with the right skill sets for the roles was imperative. My co-workers were extremely supportive going over & above board to get the sites operational. The main draw back was miscommunication with senior staff in required tasks expected."
good,"Manpower is a great place to start out working, and or a great place to fill the gap for earning some extra income! The staff at the office are great in helping you land a position, although it may be sometimes a temporary position; if you can be patient, the time and your hard work will pay off!"

They would push you and you the same. as usual became real good at what I do. And would complete work with time to spare or asked to help out another employee until time to go. They only bad part was separating mail the mail by hand, but all else was good. And that this was a seasonal job."

good,I actually worked at Manpower. It was a fun and busy. I had a great time working there and helping others find jobs that fit them. The only thing I didn't like is it was on the verge of shutting down and no one told anyone until the very last minute that their position was going to be coning to an end. Really didn't anyone time to start preparing for their job ending. Management was nice. I loved the hours.
good,"In this job I ave learned to use several different IT systems which I hope can be useful in future jobs. My manager is excellent and very approachable, the team itself is very close knit and every one helps every one."
good,They are very helpful with finding employment.  Always ready to answer questions and eager to help.  Will work with you to find the right fit for you.

good,"Laura Vera was my job recruiter through Manpower. Go directly to her, SHE is the best. She cared and took her job serious by helping my find a place to be employed. I worked in a warehouse environment that was consistent and steady, often fast paced withing the eight hour work days. Opportunities were available to learn different skill sets in the field of electronics and communications. Co-workers varied and had fast turnover every couple months. Sometimes the expectations from management were beyond what entry level positions were trained for. At time's blame shifting took place from management at the expense of temporary hires if relationships were not established. For employee's that stayed or remained over 60 days, the relationships built and the opportunity for further training and growth were the best benefits and the most enjoyable."
good,This does not refer to manpower. Insurance Auto Auctions did not have any compassion for there employees when it came down to working in the weather
good,"Worked at an Inpatient Unit as a temporary medical secretary for a Consultant Psychiatrist, SHO and a Ward Manager whom work with patients that have severe and enduring mental illness.

good,"The pay was the best part of this job. There was a definite favoritism factor within this company. I seen it many times with many people. Your ideas are always stolen and you receive absolutely no credit for them, even if they save the company time and money. Your hours were set with plenty of overtime available, however, it was a temporary job so they terminate contracts before they are due."
good,I enjoyed working for Manpower but was forced to get done due to conflicting income allowed while drawing SSI. I did not expect to work so much overtime and normally is fine but drove my income much higher then expected on a weekly basis. SSI would have taxed me both ways if I had exceeded the maximum allowed.
good,This job helped me find a job very quickly. The consultants that I interacted with were very nice. They sent me to multiple temp jobs that were good experiences.
good,"My everyday work was spent in interviewing various applicants for different positions for our different clients. Whenever I have the time I help my co-workers by attending to employees concern and process other documents necessary in 201 file. In doing so, I have been well acquainted in the different process of HR especially in Recruitment process. My co-workers are highly competitive individuals with good sense of humor that makes them fun to work with. The biggest challenge that I have faced is finding qualified applicants for a certain job in a certain period of time but I have grown to love my job because I get to talk to different people with different experiences."

good,I worked light duty after breaking my right shoulder. I didn't enjoy this job because of lack of work. Management was not professional.
good,"Uma empresa boa, pena que a vaga era temporária sem chances de efetivação, com uma carga horaria decente, salários acima do piso, e adicional noturno ótimo, trabalhos simples de serem realizados, sem stress e com EPIs em dia, que vai em contraste com uma instabilidade que a empresa tem em sempre estar renovando os funcionários mesmo  sendo ótimos funcionários."
good,"fast paced, well organized company. Team leaders were knowledgeable and helpful, very clean, very good company if you can get hired in, even as a temp. you get regular raises (if you work hard).  Overall a very good place to work. Management was very pleasant and would periodically talk to all workers (even the temps) to find out how things were going and if there were any ideas you had to improve the job, ideas that were used were rewarded with a small cash bonus. Very good training program. HR was very helpful and pleasant to deal with regardless if you were hired in or a temp."
good,"As a temp agency there is little room for advancement and no job security. The benefits are horrible, no time off, no double time for Sunday, no affordable health care and they dont even offer vision insurance.

good,"a typical day at work would be, watching whos around me and being safe."
good,Both times I worked a IBM for Manpower were similar. They were both manufacturing jobs with training. Safety was a high priority. I worked during the year end ramp time and there was a lot of overtime. They were all jobs that I could perform well. But they were not in the area of my education. Lack of job security seemed to make working with coworkers competitive. I enjoyed the steady work while I had it.

good,lo malo de las ett es que no te aseguran un tiempo deterninado
good,"There's a lot of diversity as far as the cultures that work there, but there's a communication barrier that seems to permeate the entire plantation. you work in groups of about 3-5 and do your assigned job from the time the bell rings at the start to the time they tell you to stop. Always on a schedule, always on time, always working. of course you get time for your breaks and the pay isn't half bad for what you do, but it isn't a fun place to work at all. I know work isn't supposed to be all fun and all, but it does help to not feel miserable every time you wake up to go to work."

good,"Fue una experiencia corta pero agradable, con buen ambiente de trabajo y buenos compañeros."
good,Failed to limit their placement offering to areas of experience and knowledge. Often given manufacturing and industrial placement offers which I did not have experience within nor the required tools and uniform. They were biased against placing males in clerical positions despite my experience and proven performance in the field. Even after positive feedback from the one clerical position I was given.

International paper was a good place to work the the hardest part of the job was the swing shift 12 hours rotating. However, the best part was the 3,4 & 7 days off. I learned the entire paper makeing process and how delicate yet complicated it is. One definately had to work smarter not harder because this was a very physical job. Pushing & pulling 500 lb.

I have learned a lot of things, first off how to make the solution required to coat the tablets. I have also learned how to operate the D-3 machine to coat the tablets. I know how to do all of the proper cleaning required, how to change out the solution lines if they are broken or leaking. Most of all how to maintain and keep a safe working environment for myself and my co-workers. I too have learned how to operate the printer to print the tablets that needs to be printed. I have recently got my fork-lift licenses that was a pretty interesting task for me. As far as management goes i really don't know too much about that. Just that when there is a problem that's the only time you see them around. My co-workers are very friendly, some days are better than others having a lot of co-workers. Most are very helpful at times others are not. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is when i have to train someone and i don't have the extra help i need to do my job. So that leaves me training and doing all the work alone. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we do things right the first time and having our product shipped on time and in full."
good,"Get coffee started and kitchen ready for executive leadership, direct calls and applicants, process paperwork, scan and file, schedule travel arrangements, order office supplies, have fun!"
good,learned a new skills this job prepared me alot was hardworking job demands a lot of strength but was productive experience .
good,"Different Job assignments that consist of cleaning up construction sites, unloading supply trucks, stocking warehouse, and picking up trash around apartment complex. I didn't learn anything new but the management at these sites where okay for the most part. Co-workers got along well and worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team."
good,llegas para empesar el surtido lo acabar y lo acomodas en tarima para su embarque no aprendi mucho es lo q benia trabajando mis jefes pues no tenia el tacto para pedirte las cosas mis compañeros muy buen equipo de trabajo la parte dificil era el apoyo a otras areas por que luego no te lo pagaban ese tiempo

good,I liked working for Toyota. It was a new and challenging experience. I made some friends and I liked a pay and hours available.
good,"Working hard to do your designated jobs, only to learn that full time people where you were sent to work take credit for your work and ideas and you are let go from the company, your co-workers are scared to stand up and have your back, the hardest part is working for someone who is afraid to stand up for the employees rights at the places the are sent to work, the satisfaction of writting this review!!!"
good,"good work environment. Also enjoyable management, they try to keep working there fun."
good,Report to work site. Learn what is required for the job. Learned how to perform various jobs. The supervisors were each different in their relationship with employees. The co-workers were helpful and full of information about the job and company. The dhardest part is working at a place and then having to leave. The most enjoyable part is getting a chance to learn different jobs and making friends at each job site.
good,"libertad de decisiones, empresa con mucho enfoque humano, ambiente de trabajo, facil aplicacion de lo aprendido en otras experiencias profesionales"

good,received inbound calls for Source Gas
good,Very professional with company culture centered around quality.
good,"If you're talking about the Manpower staff, they were professional and friendly. If you're asking about assignments, the only thing they ever call me for is to work once a year at See's Candies. That is an experience in and of itself."
good,Empresa que agrega valores e fácil de se relacionar uns com os outros pelo menos da minha parte que tenho amizades até hoje.
good,Manpower was good at placing their employees to work assignments. They give assignments that will potentially hire for full time positions. Management was fairly poor. It was hard to contact an on site manager. Coworkers were optimistic and hard working. The hardest part of the job was feeling insecure about the position. Employees never knew how long their positions would last. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and meeting new people.
good,Temp agency with some work for pretty good companies.I picked up a few skills with the many jobs i had.Did not really have any long term co-workers.
good,"At this particular job I got along with my co-workers very well. The best part about this job is being able to have steady work all day with no interruptions. The here was also a huge factor, I was getting paid per week."
good,"Send to Sony Semiconductor, learned to operate the different operations of the furances, inspection in black box,microscope, FSI a wash type for wafers, sinks another acid wash of wafers, clean room environment 12 hour shifts, was hired at the end of assigment.

good,"warehouse duties, some clerical work, got me out on a few jobs then I got on with Four Seasons full time"
good,I had received a job threw manpower at Kenyon press in sherburn the job it self was productive with many breaks and good work environment. Work was taking magazines and putting them together in a machine there is also many other positions in the factory.
good,"I found the experience not too bad except for not telling me there was a hiring freeze twice. I worked two long term assignments and was pleased with how fast they placed me. I thought the lady I dealt with in conway, ar was very pleasant."
good,Manpower was good company to work for not the greatest but for a staffing company it was OK.
good,See resume for detail duties for each job I worked as a Temp for under Manpower.
good,I liked the job until the job had got a new kitchen manager who treated us badly.

good,Operatore fiscale c/o Acli Gallarate lavoro impegnativo ma interessante
good,"The office staff require a level of commitment from the laborers. Which means checking in regularly. They suffer work drop offs at the years end, which can throw your life into chaos, but the opportunity to transition to a regular job is there."
good,"trabajo rapido ala hora del surtido de sus peoductos"
good,This is not a bad place to look for a job if you need one. The employers that hire them to find workers usually take advantage of the current situation
good,"Buena empresa, bien organizada con muchas oportunidades"
good,Nothing to mention in particular that stood out to me during my experience with the company. The work days seemed much longer that the average eight hour workday. The breaks were rushed and sometimes less that what was expected from the workers and my coworkers seemed uninterested in the work that they were doing.
good,"""I really enjoy learning new things and am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities."" My prior experience in customer service has provided me with unique technical skills that I can apply to this role."
good,It’s good they work with you and try there best to make us happy they need to work on stuff like making us happy and what you want to do but it’s not hard
good,"Muy buena, recomendada solo que no genera antiguedad"
good,The recruiter was a pleasure to work with.  This is a temp company and most companies are using them as a way to screen out people who will work and will not work.
good,tres bonne agence d'interim salaire attractif disponibilité du personnel
good,"ambiente bello,dove ho trovato annunci molto carini."
good,Je trouve que cette agence et très réactif au demande quand nous allons sur place
good,It is an okay job you sometimes put in a lot more than you get out of it but I’ll say the experience is worth it. The people you work with everyday make it work it
good,"Quand Manpower ne nous trouve pas de travail nous ne somme quasiment pas rémunéré, c'est compliqué quand nous avons un loyer et des factures a payer."
good,"I was impressed they get to work very quickly. They are friendly and very helpful, just wasn’t much of a production worker or one for the factories that was my only drawback."
good,"Some more organization is needed throughout parts of this job. The people at the temp office are helpful with anything you may need, but any manager or higher up on a job you may receive has not been the best in my experience."
good,I just didn't like the way they did employees sometimes. The supervisor was disrespectful to people at times. I'm not a bad person the pay was good thats about it.
good,"I was disappointed to discover that a team of five individuals is just that- there is no team environment, and therefore no collaboration, improved learning, shared knowledge, or advancement."
good,"I worked with Manpower at Amway. A typical factory setting job working 8 hours with the 10 - 15 - 10 minute breaks at the 2 hour marks. Relatively slow on some days, faster on others. Good people there to strike conversation with to make the hours go by faster. It was a clean environment."
good,I was contracted to Illinois Mutual through Manpower. They did a good job of presenting me; however when i went to the initial interview they neglected to communicate the parking directions.
good,What ever job they give you OK jobs fair pay wouldn't recommend anyone they don't really work with you when it comes to being sick and they take forever finding new jobs for their client
good,Trato profesional y adecuado al puesto ofertado es lo que esperaba.
good,"Polyvalence, proximité du terrain, challenge, culture d'entreprise"
good,"They use you for money when they can, you're fairly compensated for your time but when you get too close to earning benefits they lay you off and call you back in a month or so."
good,It was a decent job. It was good enough for me to work at. I was able to take care and provide for my myself & the work wasn’t so hard. Especially if you focus.
good,This job is very flexible. So if you're looking for a flexible job this is it. They give great hours an always offer overtime. But if you don't like a rotating schedule/shift work I wouldn't recommend this job for you.
good,No respect has been given to me since i worked there. Very disrespectful when you have family emergencies to deal with. No smiles when you go into the office
good,"It was my job for 3 years.  Then I moved.  I am not sure why I am being forced to type 150 words but here we go.  To be or not to be, that is the question."
good,"typical placement agency, fill position according to the needs of an area. Depending on the placement nothing is hard about working for this company. Worked with many different people, learn new things."
good,"Es una empresa buena pero no manejaron bien mi caso cuando culmino mi contrato"
good,Willing to help you find a job help with the application process.Does take a while to start your job.The pay verys from job to job. Needs better pay especially for the hard workers.
good,"Workers at that particular company weren't cautious of forktruck safety & awareness . Pedestrians were given the right of way over forktruck traffic , creating a very toxic environment."
good,"Manpower has a tradition of integrity and superior service that spans more than 40 years. Our reputation has been earned by providing solutions for the most challenging staffing positions. We recognize not only the importance of competitive markets, but the employers’ need to find qualified, reliable personnel."
good,Good and bad experiences through this company. Always jobs to be had and new things to learn. Fast paced work environment. Enjoy the people I met and the things I learned
good,I work with them over a year and months and then I was called and told that my assignment has ended and they didn't give me a reason why. Which I liked working for the company.
good,The company that hired me only hired for the sake of hiring and to sort their mess out. I handed in my notice after 4 weeks as I quickly realised I could not work there
good,Var positiv oavsett vad som händer och tro på dig själv.
good,"dovevo fare un servizio in un centro, molto interessante da rifare"
good,Nothing to write home about that's for sure.  It was find people a job and it didn't matter if it was temporary or not.  Overall I was not that impressed.
good,"Manpower is a good agency company to work for, very friendly, respectful, easy to get ahold of them when need to be, other than that i don't really have anything more to say"
good,They actually try to get you a good job/ career.  But they don't have the best if selections. It's a good place to work if you're looking to be in a warehouse
good,"The hardest part of the job is having to send people home for not having enough work. I learned that if I can work until the day before I had my baby than anyone can do it. The most I enjoyed about the job is everyone is there for each other. The management was stable, a typical work day can be tired depending what you did in the warehouse. Overall I enjoyed working for this company and wouldn't mind returning plus they give you an opportunity to father your education as well."
good,"The Manpower staff seemed knowledgeable and committed. I had no issues during the short term of my contract. The pay rate was low, but that is common complaint for most contracting companies."
good,"I liked how they worked with me to fit me to the right job for me. I worked more than one job for them and once there was a miscommunication, but It was worked withe the company I was contracted through. No other complaints."
good,It is a decent company up work for. It's a temporary agency so I have tried various jobs through them. They just don't have many jobs that want to hire people. They like to keep tempory assignments and I am looking for full time work.
good,"bon suivi,  très à l écoute ... Bonne équipe , très sympahique..."

good,"Good job, good boss, and good environment. I had to relocate homes so I stopped working there, other than that I would have continued working for this company."
good,"No me agrada la idea de no hacer antigüedad, trabajar para una empresa donde te pagan un salario muy bajo y exigen nivel de estudios"
good,"Debe mejorar en el tema de sus boletas de pago, la información dada en estas es pésima. Con supuestos adelantos que nunca que se dieron y siempre variando en los sueldos de todos los compañeros. No es de extrañar que en todo el mes hallas faltado, pero aún así en tu boleta indique que si lo hiciste y por ello solo se ve el pago de 29 días más no de los 30 que debió haber sido."
good,This position is great for a person who is still in college or someone who is looking for their first job. I wouldn't suggest this position for a career with it's high turnover rate however the people are nice.
good,"I am a diligent Desktop Support Specialist with 10+ years of experience providing technical support for various computer, system and office equipment. Balances priorities while quickly solving issues to strengthen business processes and performance."
good,"Si tratta di un'esperienza di lavoro somministrata da Manpower presso un caaf cgil. Positiva, ma senza particolari sbocchi futuri."
good,"I worked for a company outside of Manpower. The place was not much fun and I felt like I was ripping off the customers in talking them into keeping very expensive items for skin care, hair care and vitamin supplements."
good,Une entreprise qui donne sa chance à de jeunes profils... Une ambiance de travail agréable et formatrice
good,this company seemed to keep me working.  They offered a lot of opportunities with temporary jobs.  Worked for them over a year though with good prospects for permeate job placements.
good,Good place too get a job at..manpower is a good too a cater at it did me good and they also help wit school if you want too go too school me I’m not going too school
good,When I was looking for work they immediately put me to work . I liked working with manpower . The office staff is very polite and professional. Always ready to help .
good,"Manpower was very hands-off throughout the duration of the temp position, only calling to follow up on complaints or issues raised by either my upper management or myself in the role.  "
good,"They farm you out to companies that treat you like second rate citizens,  doing the same work as full time but a lot less $. And they can end your assignment for whatever reason and you dont have a say in it."
good,Je trouve que cela a était une bonne première expérience en logistique à refaire.
good,i was sourced to work for a food production plant. The job was easy to learn but the pay is not the best. the company does a lot for their employees as far as company dinners and picnics. the compensation and hire on rate is very low though
good,The assignments can be interesting depending on the client.  Some clients were fun but others were very stressful.  Some mangers were good others were horrible
good,I actually enjoyed being with manpower in the beginning but now not soo much. There’s not much work anymore so this means that I don’t work all the time.
good,Me despidieron sin explicarme el motivo por el cual habían tomado esa decisión
good,Many jobs are available at this temporary employment agency.  Pay is low but will keep you busy if you are interested.  Good place to apply for poll working positions.
good,Great place to work great people to work with always friendly and inviting.  Telesales was the best place to work.  Got to learn alot about the company and helped get a full time job
good,Good company to work for if you like working at various places.  Most times they were pretty quick about finding a new position when one ended.  Downside is no permanent employment.
good,"Started early morning, worked outdoors in elements, mad ready container for releasing. Learned to use different tools and got experience on sheetrock installation plus replacing floors and door. Hardest part was the heat"
good,The staff at Manpower is friendly and courteous. They always try to place you in the best possible place depending on your skills. But in way of vacation and time off Manpower lacks severally.
good,good place to work for a short time if your looking for full-time work on the side not a reliable source of income but it does help if your in need of money.
good,Man power is a temp agency doesn't pay very well.  If you are lucky to get hired by international paper Exeter is where the money is.  That was my thing but turns out to be difficult to get hired.
good,Okay company to work for. Able to work in a demanding environment. Managers were a bit hands on. Employees were okay to work with as well. Two 15 mins breaks. Half hour lunch. Pretty cool
good,"It was cool just show do your assignment ,pretty sample just a lot labor on the the body ,never know when your assignment was gone to be over you get used to it then your assigement over."
good,"Each Manpower is different. I worked in an office with a great Manager and great team. Helping people find jobs was fulfilling. The franchise was ran well overall but they did lack a desirable culture. Many employees felt unheard and disposable. I would recommend working here if you are wanting to gain some experience with employee relations/disciplines/investigations/staffing. I think Manpower as a whole is a good company, but each franchise will be different."
good,"great work place culture, also a great work envorinment, great working experience, great social envorinment, i helped people change there lives in the commuity."
good,Upper management was always making changes that were trickled down to branches but since they didn't work in our area of expertise didn't always make sense or work. So if that didn't work they would go in another direction and most of the time get the same results. There was certainly a disconnect between upper management and the branches. Their commission structure had you fighting amongst yourselves since it wasn't a team effort and was an everyone for themselves commission based structure.
good,". Buena cultura laboral"
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at Manpower. The assignment that I was on was for a mortgage lender. I learned a lot during my tenure their. Their was room for advancement but not many opportunities due to a freeze on permanent positions. Not many benefit at that time either for contract employees. Their was an bonus opportunity but created issues when people would change others promises to pays for own gain so now your hard work to obtain promise was for nothing. Overall, gained majority of my mortgage and loan experience during my tenure there."
good,poco tiempo ya que toman por contratos de 3 meses.
good,Applied with them got a call back in a couple days for an interview. The process was great and the staff was friendly and good to work with when requesting assignments.
good,"I worked from home, which I enjoyed. Was able to be exposed to may executive levels and able to apply my expertise to their requirements. Learned how to relate to high level executive management teams and other executive administrative assistants."
good,"its a great place to go and find work the same day you apply. I would encourage anyone in need of a job ASAP to go through this temp service, they will connect you with work quickly."
good,They Find you work but that jobs are not always consistent ant long term jobs and most do not pay more than about 9-10 and they are often warehouse jobs with no benefits
good,They get you in the door it's up to you to stay in them doors! Go I  shut up and just do your job no matter what or you will be let go if your not the most popular person!
good,they quickly find work for you based on any info you give them for whatever wage they can find. mostly industrial jobs or short term assignments. had me mostly sorted early on.
good,if you are looking for something to do that is temporary then this is the company for you. things can turn into permanent but this is a good company to go to if a college student
good,I enjoyed working for them the work was understandable and effectivei just wish times didnt come to where i would have 2 be layed off..it was peacefully time flew by it was a asome place 2 work
good,I was always ready and willing to take any position that manpower would provide for me in my time off need. I would have liked to find something that I could have worked full-time
good,"Good for someone looking for a job. Not a lot of job availabilities and low pay rates. Good for someone looking for temporary work. Variety of different jobs, office jobs, warehouse, and skilled worker positions."
good,Management was horrible. I enjoyed working with my team. Getting extra time. The over night shift was awesome. I enjoyed solo projects and being the team leader.
good,"the jobs here are all temporary they have a lot of opportunity to grow ."
good,I had to go though Manpower to the job I have now. It was as if I never worked for them. I came to the same job everyday and did the same thing until the other job was ready to hire me.
good,I had to help out the president of a small company adjust to being bought out by IBM.  I really felt bad for the guy.  Why won't you take this unless it is very long?
good,"I would work there again and again if the jobs was Abit more stable "
good,"Nothing really fun, but it was great working with the people I worked with.  The hours were alright and the job was pretty easy to do.  There wasn't really any cultural diversity in the employees except for management."
good,"Im a hard worker and I put my all into my jobs try my best to make it on work in time , I could treat the costumers well and I could make sure I do my job well."

good,"buena la organización y participación, fácil desempeño"
good,Manpower is a great temp service. They help you find employment that benefits you. I definatly would go back through them again for employment. I didnt like not having a 40 hours a week but i know that through temp services nothings guaranteed
good,Für eine Bewertung ist das Arbeitsverhältnis zulange her.
good,"Over the years I've maintain a good work behavior with ability to learn and carry out instructions throughout the warehouse , I've also sustained a positive attitude while working in hostile environments.  My goal everyday is to be productive and help maintain a safe workplace while completing daily task ."
good,This is a temporary job. All the assignments are different and you have to adjust to the assignment. There is no set time frames or hours. You could work for a week or months.
good,Good job to start at the Walmart chain. Start at the bottom as a call center agent for manpower then transition to full time for Walmart. It’s hard to transfer out of the call center. Only a lucky few do.
good,Overall I didn't really like working for Manpower to pay was low and the work was hard some of the jobs are fun that they sent me on but then they were jobs at work hard and it was like hard to get to the jobs too
good,"I worked for Manpower and was sent to Backyard products, my co workers were nice and so was the enviorment.  I liked that it was a Monday-Friday day job, and not to far from home."
good,Manpower almost never allowed temps to get hired for full time employment.we were always told that manpower wouldn't let us get hired in because it would cost the hiring company too much money.
good,it was not bad work. They just had a hard time finding me work. but the atmosphere was great. i would recommend this job to others who are in need of full or part time work.
good,"Mostly temporary, lower paying jobs. Not a great engineering recruiting firm in my opinion. No benefits. Good staff + Office Management. Only one position offered since initial engagement."
good,"I am not a fan of working through a temp agency, but it that's what it took to get me in the door to a local employer, that's what I did.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone who needs insurance, timeoff, etc."
good,"Da ex dipendente.."
good,"I did not work for Manpower. This was an accident based on my resume, I'm not sure how it happened, but I'm here now and can't stop the train. Hopefully this gets fixed."
good,This was a temp service and therefore nothing was permanent. They didn't pay well either. It was hard to find consistent work. I went weeks without work.
good,"They're good about communicating openly with you with any issues or questions you have while on the job, consistent and flexible scheduling, they help you find work in the field you are looking for with great advancement if you so desire."
good,"will depend on assignment as to what benefits, dress code, hours and pay are required.  i had no issues with manpower or my assignment.  can't recommend or discourage, will be based on your needs."

good,buen ambiente el trato es muy cercano a las personas
good,They were helpful and friendly. Offered all of the testing required for the position. When contract ended I moved on to another job that was closer to where I lived.
good,Nothing to say at this particular moment I haven't worked with manpower for that long to make a review yet because I'm  on call at moment so until then
good,Es una empresa en la cual estas contratado directamente por manpower pero tus funciones son dentro de otra empresa
good,"tres bonne interim j ai travailler comme chef de partie chaud et froid "
good,A typical day is being in a fast pace environment and working on several lines meeting quotas. Quotas is more of the focus. So being flexible and able to learn different jobs is important.

good,Good company to work for. I referred several of my friends to work there. They were on top of offering open positions at all time. I highly recommend this company.
good,empresa dedicada al reclutamiento y seleccion de personal
good,"A parte mais dificil do trabalho eram os clientes menos educados e a pressão inerente a um call center."
good,A typical day varied with the job received.  I learned quite a few office skills.  The hardest part of the job was learning something new everyday which was also the best part of the job.
good,"Manpower really focuses on what your skills are and helps you finds the job that's right for you. Easy to work with, though I never called in sick or anything so im not sure how they handle situations like that, with not offering any vacation to temp employees."
good,"Over all a very respectable and descent job very flexible long hours, not a lot of possibilities for advancement, would recommend this as a good starter job"
good,"This is a temp service. You might get hired, you might not. The job you get offered are likely to be ones you have done. You can apply for other jobs. They do not look for you."
good,"It's a neutral feeling."
good,I was a contract employee working for another company.  I did not work directly for Manpower.  I cannot give an accurate description of working for the company.
good,I was very greatful for the position I got going through this agency.  It was a good experience for me.  Gave me a different avenue to go down for a different position
good,They were good at keeping a steady supply of job roles to go to even if the contracts were only short term they would have another role lined up before it finished

good,"Manpower is a staffing firm specializing in temporary, PT, and FT jobs in a variety of locations. Warehouse, labor, customer service positions are common."
good,"A Manpower trabalha terceirizando funcionários, e esquecem de oferecer outras oportunidades para os mesmo. A empresa na qual eu presto serviço, possui a mesma cultura, não gera oportunidades para o desenvolvimento profissional."
good,It's a start up.  Good company to learn a lot. It provides many different services.  I would recommend it to others. Great culture for family life balance.
good,"I was hired though the temp service in Rice Lake to work at Northern Industrial Sands. I really enjoyed my job at the sand plant, but when my wife and kids got stranded 2.5 hours away and i had to leave work they let me go."

good,Not really a bad place to work for but the jobs the provide are actually very difficult to get hired on at. They pay you on a card which sucks because everytime you take money off your constantly paying ATM fees and benefits aren't great at all . Thier management is pretty friendly and easy to get along with but some of the employees you work with are lazy and not hard working at all.
good,"Ayant fait divers missions au sein de cette entreprise , je la trouve plutôt réactive et professionnel ! ils m'ont permis de me développer dans ma recherche de travail et d'approfondir mon expérience"
good,Manpower bünyesinde yaklaşık 12 aydır çalışmaktayım. Bu çalışma suremde kendimi iyi gelistirdim. Bana sunulan iş pozisyonu düşük olsada  Manpower a teşekkür ederim.
good,"The company was a part of a larger international organization. the company was fairly well run. had a very corporate feel, most issues needed to moved up the chain for resolution."
good,"I haven't worked for manpower in quite a few years, but what I do remember is that it was rough to get from temporary to permanent. I really liked some of the companies that I worked for but the assignments did not last long enough."
good,Manpower was an ok place to work. They could improve on how often they visit their client workplaces to check on their employees and raise the pay a lil but overall they're ok.
good,I worked for Manpower during college.  They were courteous and helpful in placing me in an appropriate opportunity.  It was a great learning experience.
good,"Manpower, Inc. was my first experience working as a contracted worker. Starting pay is somewhat higher than it would be if you were onboarding directly through the company that you are being contracted out to. This is precisely why Manpower, Inc. is able to start you off with higher pay than you would be getting if you were directly hired by the company that you are being contracted out to."
good,this company was good with placing me quickly into a position. the people i worked with here treated me fairly and i have no complaints. they have a good screening system
good,"I only worked for them for a few months until I got my permanent job.  I was treated well, paid well, and they offered me a permanent position but I took another offer."
good,"I ran a air drill and mil to manufacture circuit boards, I liked my fellow employees and this was a day shift position so I had time to work a second job to increase my income"
good,I'm not saying they're the worst it's just hard to find the type of work you fit in. I mean work is work so there's nothing to complain about. But still the work is scarce and farther than where you'd like to be.
good,Manpower was a great company to work for. However they do have lay off and it is suddenly. I just wish more notice would be provided when mass layoffs is being done.
good,Overall okay if you need extra money in your pocket. Mostly temporary positions or contract to hire opportunities. Not so much long term opportunities through manpower.
good,Worked here for a few months and got several temporary assignments.  The people at Manpower were fine and the jobs were okay.  Hardest part was having to switch jobs all the time b/c they were temporary
good,Good work place . Good pay.  Good management. Had a problem at one of the warehouses the sent me too in tracy. supervisor said i was making excuses because i didn't want to work mornings
good,It’s a good experience working there meet a lot nice people good environment to work in the people was great I will a lot my friends about it I will go back anytime.
good,"Manpower was an ok place to work. It taught me how to work/ operate a forklift; however, it lacked security protocol for the company that I was assigned to work for."
good,A typical day or night at work will be going to a safety meeting before heading to the floor. Then put on all the PPE on and get to the corresponded area to start working.
good,"They offered jobs according to your skill level. Typically they were able to provide you with a long-term assignment. The agency would try to find something for you once your task ended, which was extremely helpful."
good,"Uma empresa boa para trabalhar, explicam e dão suporte nas dúvidas,"
good,"This is a very productive company, as far as finding someone a job. Family friendly company with nice benefits and opportunities for advancement. Excellent start for anyone who's having trouble finding dependable work."
good,Manpower was a job placement service. I worked there and eventually was hired on permanently at SouthTrust. I had many duties and enjoyed the position.
good,"manpower out of ottumwa, iowa is an ok place to get going into the job world. It is more focused on getting people to work for certain jobs than making sure that person is fit for the job."
good,The opportunities are very limited. The pay rate has stayed the same for many years and it takes along time to get a hire in. I have checked in multiple of times and it took almost a month to get a spot.
good,"i just do not like the lay off often. i need money and rather be at work being productive then sitting home on the phone with the unemployment company,"
good,"Temporary agency, no health benefits and not paid time off.  Were paid only part of what the company you were working for paid to Manpower for your work.  Hard to get a pay raise."
good,Bien vérifier le nombre d'heure effectué pour Manpower
good,It is a temporary workforce agency and I really don't recommend it if you have limited job experience and job skills.  I was lucky if they had something available to do.
good,"I was placed at a factory called Benteler automotive. I absolutely loved it out there, the people I worked with was great, minus a few supervisors or should I say,,, Line Coordinators, "
good,"For a temp agency, its not bad.  They work with you to find a job that suits your abilities, and the pay is better than other temp agencies I've seen."
good,I was lucky to have worked with and for Manpower when they were still contracted with Hanford.  I was lucky to get an entry level job that enabled me to move up in rank and pay.
good,"I cant really review a temp agency. but they placed me in a good place to work. having to submit a time card to a specific location was not good, but they did put me in a nice place"
good,"I've held various positions at Manpower, but usually they'll send me to work at places on an assembly line.  Usually consisting of being placed on a station where you handle whatever responsibilities there before sending the product further down the line. Manpower management is incredibly nice, and I haven't had any problems with the management at any of the companies that I was sent to.  Most of the jobs I worked were generally short term contracts, so the workplace atmosphere was usually relaxed with everyone having a casual attitude.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up at certain stations that will have you doing more than the others.  I think that the easiest part would be the opposite, of course.  Working one of the easier stations on the line. Manpower typically deals in temporary contracts, rarely have I seen a temp to hire contract being staffed at Manpower of Richmond"
good,"Gostei de trabalhar com Manpower. "

good,pas de commentaires sur cette entreprise précisement
good,Het is een gezellig team om in te werken maar je wordt binnen Manpower steeds meer een nummer.
good,Assesses skills and places applicants in jobs appropriate to their experience if possible. Working hours and duties vary depending on qualifications and placement.
good,"typical temp job, not aware if job will be there from one day to the next. overall the temp service was ok to work for. Depending the assignment as to what the job entailed"
good,"Great company, and at times, great leadership. Not the best at helping advance up and coming performers from within. Too much downsizing repetitively led to losing key human capital and industry knowledge. Best times were in the late 1990's to early 2000's as the company went from single digits in billions globally to double digits globally. Great people, good times, wonderful clients- some of all of the aforementioned, I would entirely like to forget- but- overall a great company to work for, build a career, and develop skills you can use  other places.  Note- they tend to pay far below industry and their competitors by comparison. Go into any offer eyes  wide open."
good,I would supply packaging with product to be packed. Also was in charge of a fridge and freezer to keep track off all product it the temperature needed in logbook and a barcode system.
good,Manpower was a good company to work for if you're just entering the recruiting field.  It provided you good training and tool to make sure that you were able to do your job successfully.

good,"a good day at work learned how to communicate with business partners management was awesome culture was artistic and cool"
good,I really do no recall the company I worked for as Manpower is a placement service.  I worked temporary while pregnant with my last child.  It was just something to do for the time.  The office staff at Manpower were only interested in getting bodies for their clients.  It was not a very good experience.
good,remplacement d'un congé de vacances pas trop le temps d'approfondir le poste
good,They find you work in the desired field you give them upon filling out an application with them. They try to find you work in those fields to keep you employeed and in the location you want opening the oppertuntiy for the company to hire you permanently if they like the work you put forward.
good,Algunas  campañas no deberían de durar solo un mes.
good,The company that Manpower contracted me for was to restock and pack to ship merchandise for their stores. Management was good. Through out the day you would rotate and do various jobs that had to be done. I enjoyed unpacking stock and restocking stock.
good,Its ok accept the fact that it sometimes takes so long to get hired in the company through a temp agency if they want you. I worked for Pfizer as a temp for 3 plus years before getting hired in the company. Way to long without benefits. I also transferred twice to 2 different areas before getting in. That is not acceptable to me without having benefits. there was no raises offered.
good,Nice temp agency to work for the people were very understanding and seem liked they cared about you.   The only thing is they need to pay a little more.
good,"This was a great company to work for, it was very short term as I took the position on a short term basis."

good,"Empresa que se dedica a colocar personal en diferentes empresas, bajo sueldo, pago puntual."

good,i did work from port of Houston to warehouse to washing big trucks all the jobs were temporarily but they were fun to work on management were very professional
good,"It is a temp agency. They will give you work assignments when they have them. Work assignments comes and goes, and they may last for a day, s week, or weeks, and maybe months."
good,Manpower provided me with great temporary- contractor positions. I was assigned to IBM's customer briefing center where I was able to use the skills I used when I was the Visitor Tour Program Specialist securing presenters for customer visits.
good,"Manpower is good for first-time jobbers.  Many of the jobs are temporary, but some open the door to long-term positions as well. Pay seems to be average."
good,"could have been paid better. but overall they found me decent jobs and I usually liked the people that I worked with, skyline steel was the best job they got me."
good,Working through this temp agency was not the best. There is very little communication with anyone that works there. The agent I would deal with would change so much over the time.
good,for temp jobs it is not a bad place.  Hours and positions are flexible.  work is easy to come by. Pay is good enough considering the part time temporary nature of their jobs
good,This was a pretty good gig   they had me working out at the solar plant they were building in gila bend.  Bussed to & from everyday   pay was good  no real complaints
good,"long hours on the computer"
good,Manpower is a friendly place to work for.  The company believe in finding the right job that is in your best interest.  They make sure that you are qualified before sending you out to a job assignment.
good,"Not much different about this agency than any other. You may or may not have a position this week, or next week.  I moved to many different companies and jobs."
good,",agencja pracy na rzecz firmy Kayser ,dobra agencja na polskim rynku pracy"
good,Stressful as a part time worker. Have to switch from job to job working as a temp. But a job can be found a full time employee once you find what you like.
good,would go to job site at Kinder Morgan. Work with others on duties for the day. We would turn in time sheets in on Monday. Not much interaction with Manpower besides getting paid threw them.
good,I cannot answer this because I have not worked for them in almost 15 years. it is a temp job service so I don't know anything about the CEO management etc
good,Working for Manpower was a learning experience.  It was great for temporary placement & different learning experiences.  I was able to learn a lot of the skills i still use today.

good,It has been a while since i was there.  Manpower is the temporary agency i was working through.  I enjoyed the actual company i was working for.  It is another place i would go back to.
good,"The job was fine; however, it was near impossible to become a permanent employee.  Majority of the workforce in the department were contractors.  After trying to get hired 11 times I left the company."

good,"Recruited a variety of different positions from temporary to full time."
good,There were several different things learned such as being versatile in my learning. I took whatever job I could get and made the best of it with the opportunity given.
good,manpower as a temp agency was quick to find me employment. they were helpful when needed but compensation was an issue because of lack of communication between employer and manpower ex my employer assumed i was bring home a certain amount and manpower was taking a larger portion then agreed.other than that it was a good experience
good,Manpower provided training and development if you were chosen to be in the circle of power. Everyone else is discarded and left to wilt away in a corner while trying to fill a position with a hot body.
good,"Keeping positive a positive attitude and you'll see positive results."

good,"I worked several roles for this company, and it was overall okay. The company always has a position for the employees, and will continue if strong work ethic is shown."
good,Small office environment.  Opportunity to learn and grow. Highly recommended for new professional entering the field or advanced levels.  Great client interaction.
good,Like I have said in the past temporary agency government should regulate that contract a certain percentage should become permeant full time without any negative involvement from agency.

good,"Each day I am able to dictate on how each day can be ran. "

good,"Ofrece estabilidad, con una cultura corporativa muy marcada."

good,They only provided me with one temporary job and i never heard from them again even when i tried contacting them directly over the phone and email. I went to the branch i signed up with and they had removed me off their register for further jobs even though i was deemed a fantastic employee by the company i teamed up with
good,"worked for them for about 8 months. my assignment was very hot, very loud, and very fast pace. i ran 4 machines and put out 450 parts a night from each machine. in the end it was for not. i didnt get full time at my assignment and they released me from employment."

good,Creativity is key as well as being able to handle a number of tasks in this work environment.  The positions one encounters help provide experience for the times ahead.
good,Toujours de l'emploi offert par les conseillères.  Professionnel.
good,Only worked on assignment for a few month. Learned how to open and distribute mail. How to use postage meter. Didn't get to know management very well. Hardest part was not being there long enough to master all duties. Most enjoyable part was getting to know the nice people there.
good,I loved my time while working for manpower. I met a lot of different people and learn a lot of new things. I took on hard task and task I've never imagine. It was hard at times and giving up wasn't the key. Manpower taught me determernation and speed.

good,"The typical working day has always been hectic, however bare in mind there are several departments and each department requires its own professionalism. Its always been a nice and pleasant working place. The help was always there when needed. Certainly I have learned how to deal with  technical manners and patients. It was always satisfying when a job is well done and a feedback is positive."
good,"Manpower no longer seems to have staffing contacts with the top companies in the area as they once did.  Now offering mostly warehouse/retail opportunities which are low-paying.  Very few administrative jobs.  Managers and other staff are great people, though."

The management was okay most of the time they were busy handling other concerns for the company. The hardest part about working there the amount of invoices you had to process.

good,"Manpower is an ok place to work. Communication is sometimes frustrating, the recruiter is sometimes bothered by my questions or concerns. I had a very bad issue with my paycheck and had to really go out of my way to get paid. I feel that some recruiters need to be more compassionate and concerned about their employees."

good,everyone worked together as a team and well paced. they gave us a free meal every day. they only thing that sucked was slopping buckets and sometimes no one wanted to do that a it got messy.
good,I liked it at Experis. Sometimes expectations were unclear and unrealistic at times but everyone always worked together to help fill positions.            .

good,My day started at 3 pm. Once I punched in I checked my forklift to make sure it was suitable for operation. I pulled order for different companies and staged them to be loaded. Most days were fast paced. We worked as a team and we assisted each other when needed. There wasn't a hard part of the job. The team of people I worked with was the most enjoyable part of the job. We came to work with a determined mind to get all our orders pulled and trucks loaded. If someone needed help we worked together to get the job done.

good,Typical day at work is basically confidential.  But training involved all types of scenario based drills from close care protection to prison riots to terrorist drills.
good,Having to work on Saturdays was an inconvenience. The pay was low for the amount of work. The drive to work was 20 minutes. No chance for advancement.
good,I was placed at my job and with in 3 monthes i was hired on.... I worked hard and showed up every day. so it works if you put in the effort and the time.
good,I only worked there for a very short time and have nothing bad to say about the company.   Don't want to leave a good or a bad word out her about the.
good,normal en todo solo eran ventas y no tenía mucha relación con la tienda.los supervisores cambiaban seguido.
good,The communication between the office staff and the employees needs lots of work along with the respect of privacy. When an employee comes to their contact person with an issue the contact person shouldn't go to the assignment supervisor and announce who the employee is that came in with issues. That will keep employees feeling comfortable coming forth with issues in the future.
good,"nice place to work, staff are nice help to found work.if have an issue can resolve easier. i will recommend people to look work with manpower and they are flexible."
good,"J'ai démarré la collaboration avec ManpowerGroup Maroc en Janvier 2015."

good,Overall a good place to work.  The work was interesting and fast paced.  Good PTO.  The ability to work from home was nice. Immediate management was great.
good,"Me personally, I encountered many issues while employed on assignment that were not addressed properly by management.Overall not a great place to b"
good,Manpower is a staffing agency and I had been placed at positions/assignments. I was placed at FairmountSantrol and worked the assignment 1 1/2 years before becoming permanent.
good,"Dedicated and focused Administrative Assistant who excels at prioritizing, completing multiple tasks simultaneously, and following through to achieve project goals.  Answers a high volume of incoming calls while handling in-person inquiries from clients and colleagues.   Flexible and hard working with a strong drive to succeed."
good,"This a temp agency. i have nothing bad or anything to offer for this review. Left to start a new job,and if need be i would consider reapplying again."
good,There is a lot of unknowns with this company. dont know if you will be paid or what hours will be. Very back and forth with management and their decisions.
good,Manpower was a great way to start learning about HR and meet people in the field. A great Maine based company with values. Employees were valued and appreciated.
good,"There were some jobs I would rather not have done but did them anyway. Cleaned bathrooms and mopped floors at the Post Office for three months, unloaded tires from tractor trailers for the Lafayette City events, unloaded pumpkins from a tractor trailer and swapped out pretty near 5500 fluorescent lights in the Sears store at night."
good,"A typical day at work would be different because it could be a different job everyday but most of the time it would be temp to hire,  as far as  management for manpower I never had a problem with them finding me a job."
good,"Most of the jobs were little pay. but I had to get on some where to make money. "
good,Don't really like let go for no reason. They let me people go for no reason they are respectful... they pay good but when they sent me out to ulta they were or really respectful.
good,Was good as a temporary gob to bridge until I could find permanent position. Challenging work in a professional environment.  Would have been good if it had more stability.
good,"Personalmente no respetan el contrato laboral, pero quizá sólo es mi experiencia con la empresa."
good,This was a Temporary Position had to stand around for something to do never had a desk to work at or a computer to work on.  Not a very friendly work environment.
good,"its okay and fine to work at"
good,Good pace to work.  Don't like staffing industry.  Pay was very good for this area.  Had nice benefits.  I don't know what else to day.  That's all I have to say

good,do your very best on assignment and you can become a permanent employee. ask questions and training is a must when it comes to pharmacy products and instruments
good,"•	Subcontracted though Supra, I assisted in the transition of exchanging and updating realtor keys from local realtors located throughout Monterrey County."
good,I have worked for them off and on for years.  Sadly my experiences can go from awesome to pretty bad.  I sometimes think we are looked at as an inconvenience instead of the reason they are in business.  The clients sometimes treat the temp staff horrible saying terrible slanderous things and yet they still back the client.  I have also had clients I loved to work for and would go back again.
good,manpower is a employment agency they locate and set you up jobs and job interviews to work and allow you to get into companies. they do a good job at placing you where you want.
good,Manpower as the company are disorganized in my opinion. after i got laid off at my first job i called every 3 days for 2 months to get another job and they said they had none.
good,They do not always place you with a company that hires you on very quickly. You work day in and day out and find out that the other temp to hires have been there for 2 years.
good,Good working environment. I learned a lot in this organisation.  Month end activities & year end activities help me to understand the basics of accounting and payroll.
good,"Day at work stressful"
good,"I worked in the office hiring associates, and it can be a high paced environment when we have jobs to give and get really busy. The regular general labor/manufacture jobs don't pay that great. People really only go for temporary/ quick to get jobs. So if you need fast money, this is the place to go."
good,The training was great the work culture was friendly the lack of sufficient breaks was difficult.  The job was easy and I enjoyed working with Manpower.
good,"El ambiente laboral muy bueno "
good,"Placed on multiple temporary, general labor assignments including package handler/runner (FedEx), truck unloading, stocking, and forklift operator. Worked at Horizon Ag made products and loaded and unloaded liquid products, loaded  and unloaded solids products."
good,This was a temporary position. I worked 8 hours a day 5 days a week. Management was very helpful. I was grateful to have a job and I would work for them again.
good,I do not remember to much about this company I only work with them for a couple of months. From the little bit I do I like it but got offered a better position somewhere else.
good,"No issues or complaints, would like to have more hours leading to permanent position. Other than that they provided work when it's available. But unfortunately hours are not always available."
good,"good team and leadership,respect full,working together,cleaness areas,safety work,proctect and gamble was one of the best place to learn and skills to work."
good,"Like most temp services  it depends on where you go.    The only downside is that their office isnt local (for us) anymore.   Only issue i ever had was getting my paychecks around holiday times, but that was because i got paper checks instead of having it onto one of those debit cards.    But you cxan get direct deposit to your bank now so that is a non issue."
good,The nice thing about manpower was that I had just started going back to school so I had a little more flexibility in choosing when and where I wanted to work.  I lucked out on receiving placement at Amway first because I had heard that the hourly play depended on the company looking for temps.
good,"* Facturar,  hacer pedidos y el registro de cobros."
good,Place you in jobs that you both qualify and want to work. They do give you the option to decline if it's not a position you would like. The staff could use a little customer service training.
good,"This company got me the job at Pick-N-Pull. That company was an ok place to work, as the management was not very fair. The environment and high paced work was overall great"
good,"I believe mannpower was a good alternative to no work, the reduction of $2.50 from hourly wages was definitely a strong but necessary negative."
good,"The only issue that I really had with Manpower is that the positions are not reliable. Being a temp company, all they have to do is offer the minimum.  In this economy, that is not acceptable."
good,I've had the opportunity to work for a lot of companies through Manpower.  The Manpower team seemed to do a good job of keeping me working when I needed a job.
good,Trabajo bueno pero forzado la gente ignorante pero bn
good,"It was not a bad place to work for the time. It's an average temp agent, you go where ever they send you to work. I did not have anything bad or good to about them really."
good,"Growth for fresher management Good "
good,"job was competitive, meet new people, everyday was different, finding people jobs was enjoyable, recruiting was exciting, learned alot in this position."

good,"Manpower does help a lot when you are looking for a job, was glad I started with them and then moved up into the company as full time."
good,They keep me working with jobs that was in Longview. We did general work like clean up end construction work warehouse work outside in i work for the rail road
good,This is a great company to find work if you're between jobs or if you like to travel. You can work for just temp as you are working towards new job or go through company as temp for hire.
good,They were not too organized and no advance warning how long your assignment would last. No job security. Some of the office staff was very friendly and others were not.
good,As long as you knew you were not probably going to get hired or stay at the same place and could be flexible it was good. But if you did a good job and stayed busy they would keep you working.
good,"good work, no hard work, management was good, culture was good, going to diffrent locations, easy job, learned, everything was easy easy no major work just helping"
good,ma permis de me confronter au monde du travail. et de me faire connaître au prés des employeurs

good,"Typical IT Support role."
good,"Manufacturing Environment going through procedures to produce a "
good,Fast way to find a job and easy way to get hired in. Might not be able to get 40 hours depending on what job u are placed at. Not recommended if u can get on full time.
good,"This is not the same company that I have worked for in the past. However, the work place of the previous company I worked for was filled with employees of different culture. Allowing the workers to interact and cooperate with each other in many ways."
good,They are a job placement service.  You could be doing a wide range of employment options.  They are pretty helpful with getting you into the job market.
good,Great staffing service to work for. They give good assignments whether is short term or temp to hire. And the pay is good. Staffing is helpful and courteous.
good,"um dia cansativo psicologicamente mas divertido."

good,worked at a couple company locations.  professional working environment.  8-5 job with other professionals.  data entry work is a job that I am good at.
good,Manpower was a good place to work. Listened to the description of jobs I wanted and put in the best place for me. Just wish the job I was doing could've been permanent.
good,Didn't have much experience socializing with anyone in the company. It was pretty professional I guess. I came to know about the company due to a previous coworker.
good,Great temp agency. They have helped many obtain positions that have turned into permanent secure positions. Would definitely refer other people to this agency if ever in need of employment or work.
good,"Temporary Merchandising position. Job involved stocking shelves and displays for a wine vendor. It was a seasonal position between regular full time jobs. Also involved freight unloading, and order taking from individual store in metro area."
good,"Buena en general, buen ambiente de trabajo entre compañeros, aprendí a tratar con diferentes perfiles de personas de diferentes edades en la coordinación de mis tareas profesionales. Muy buen trato con la dirección."
good,"This was a temporary assignment completed while in college. I worked for a company in their shipping/receiving department, doing whatever needed to be done."
good,Manpower is a great place to work if you're wanting to work part-time.  I was looking for more pennant work with a steady income.  I realize that I can not provide for my on a part-time salary.
good,Says it all in the title. i really can't say more because I don't feel like it and I think it's rude to make us do this review. it should be optional.
good,This was a temp company so I really don't have a clear review of the company other than I got hired on with Halliburton through them. I never had a problem with my payroll or anything.
good,"Otima empresa, mesmo sendo  um trabalho  temporário, não tenho queixas."
good,"I like the fact that Manpower gave me training before I started as a support worker. This was very helpful, unfortunately I did not stay long with the company, as I was offered a permanent position soon after I joined the company."
good,"malos para pagar, y mala informacion que brindan, mal manejo del personal."
good,"this was a great place to work. i would refer my friends and family to work for this company, they have a pretty decent pay scale with flexible hours."
good,They were a satisfactory temp agency but my agent was not great at communication and couldn't get me a second position after my first quality position of a six month position ended.
good,"it was easy to work with them, they brought me in, asked me questions and matched me with a great job for me. It was a pleasant experience and I would go back if I was ever in the area again."
good,"Il y a trop longtemps que j ai travaillé pour eux "
good,They paid me on-time. They promoted me within 3 months because I worked hard. What can I say...? I had a good experience with them. The company I was staffed at was losing contracts left and right and I moved on.
good,"For temporary work Manpower is easy. They have varied positions available, mostly labor.  They pay quickly."
good,I worked for the San Antonio location. The pay is not the best. They do their best to find a good fit for your skills. I got a chance to work in HR which was awesome!
good,Temporal reconocida con cumplimiento a los empleados.
good,Working at manpower was a pretty good introduction to me but I feel like it's time to expand an move on to bigger An better things. An at this time in my life I feel like I need a new start.
good,I was working more directly with the local client and had minimal contact with Manpower.   I was requested by and worked directly with the local Manpower client.   My interaction with Manpower was simply a protocol of the client's policies and procedures.
good,"A busy position indeed, opening 400 pieces of mail per day, distributing to various accountants on site using a chart, entering information into database as to keep track of whom received what invoice. Taking all marked mailbags to the office downstairs where it was flown to Calgary office for payment within the 30 day set term."
good,A typical day was going to different work place whenever I received a work assignment.  Enjoyed working as an office clerk on several assignments.  All the workplaces were clean and the coworkers were friendly.
good,There is a lot of paper dust so this is not a good job for someone with dust allergies or asthma. there are no mats to ease standing on concrete all day. It is a very fast paced environment so this is not a disability friendly place to work.
good,they work very hard to find you a job when you are having trouble. staff is friendly and honest and very involved after they place. very good at making sure things are being done right
good,They placed me in a temporary position at local cabinet factory. Which turned into a full time job.  This company offered training  and offered chances excel.

good,"I enjoyed working through Manpower in first part of 21 century.  But by 2009, they no longer have the type of positions or even the clients.    I would not contact Manpower if I were in search of job today."
good,Need more listing of job opportunity to help people with college degrees. They don't have enough jobs or jobs at all for graduated college students. they need more jobs
good,"Not too bad but as well as any limited contract jobs can go, training for certain job was alright could of went in more depth but by demand it wasn't needed. The support manager was above and beyond helpful."
good,Only worked for this temp service for a short time. The only down fall is not enough projects to sometimes to stay busy. I learned different jobs in a few different industries.
good,"I never get position that last very long and when a job becomes available its never very long, I do have job skills and I want to work with a company that will advance me, I'm always looking for better."
good,Its a temp service whats to say. They get you a job you do it. You can be a permenant temp with them or tried to get hired into the place they put you. For the most part the people are okay.
good,Manpower has a great staff but they need to call people more and provide salary based on experience not just what companies desire and also place employees in desired fields.
good,"Could have had better management and supervisors , but they did have some decent benefits  and bonuses.  Wages could have been better  but not bad. Ok working there."

good,"L'agence est connue et reconnue, la réputation n'est plus à faire."

good,me han tratado muy bien en todos los trabajos en los que he estado.
good,ManPower is okay. There could be some changes far as helping the workers who are good at their jobs get hired in faster rather than it being based on the ethnicity of a person. I live in the south.
good,"A place that finds you work, place does not learn about you enough, and places you in wrong places with the wrong people. Management is not good, hardest part being at the wrong company to work, most enjoyable is full time hours."
good,"- Productive and I'm please with the team spirt. "
good,"Wish they had more job in area, graduated from college for.  That would help alot of people. Give great jobs when they have them. Call and leave message when they have position."
good,Manpower suited my needs and found appropriate work for me quickly. Not sure what the company is like to work for now as my time with them was many years ago.
good,Sanitized the whole South Warehouse. As time moved on was trained to clean and spot railcars for bulk loading. Radio communication was essential. Mostly did work outdoors.

good,"During my temp employment in the mailroom at citibank as a temp mail clerk through manpower, it was a fun time and very enjoyable learning experience."
good,This was a job where it is what it is. You are looking for work while searching for a permanent job and the jobs that you work here are not the most ideal but it gives you a paycheck
good,They can do better act finding jobs long term and faster.. Working for manpwer was pretty cool.. The pay was lovely but it could have been better jobs . but other then that i love this company
good,I think that Manpower is a positive to grow with agency for temporary and temp. to perm positions with companies. I would love to have the support to keep me working.
good,Work life balance is important to this company. My experience so far shows good management and no micro mangers. Trust is given to employees and are expected to perform well.

good,"Very competitive and cut throat management team"
good,Great temp company to work with. They are great at placing you in temporary to permanent positions with reputable companies. Great pay and very flexible schedules.
good,"Na minha opinião a empresa é boa, porém deixa a desejar na organização entre os trabalhos."
good,Don't count on the management to go above and beyond.  You have to do any type of raises and any other processes yourself.  They do very little for you.  They are filling a slot and that is all they are doing.
good,"Zonder specifieke vooropleiding of werkervaring begonnen. Erg leuke afdeling. Helaas werd deze afdeling na 1,5 jaar gesloten."
good,they are good people to work. they help out with any thing and the are good teachers. and they have good management skills and the work place is clean

good,Bonne équipe mais posté souvent à l ecoute de moi quand je travaille pour eu en étant interimaire
good,"Manpower overs you a situation to prove your worth and get you a full time job. It is a great opportunity for people our looking for a job, and having troubles finding one."
good,I enjoyed working for this company they kept me busy. I gained experience and worked with a very diverse group of people which was new for me. Work became slow in my field of work.
good,They try to help you find a job. That's all they do. If your looking for a job that fits you then go here. They listen to you and try to help you as much as they can.
good,"The actual company services and the industry is an exciting and fun industry to be involved in.  Very fun sales, tenant relations, great industry officer relations. Only draw back was the owner / senior manaegment at the time that I worked  with the company"
good,Received an assignment from Manpower right before the holiday season in 2015. Was supposed to be temporary just for the rush but turned into a full-time job.  After an initial screening at the Manpower office was working a few days later. Overall good experience working with them.
good,Enjoyed working there...but you must meet requirements of 250 documents daily in order to be considered productive.  Some documents could have up to 100 or more pages and still count as one document.
good,"No two days are ever the same.  With the large number of employees and customers you deal with on a day-to-day basis, you never know what to expect.  That's not including all the new employees or customers you may develop that day."
good,it was great to work under my last supervisor. I learned how to work with a voting machine and program it.  there was no hard part of that job if you listened you could do your job well.
good,"The job assignments themselves were satisfactory, the employees at the Manpower office were not that particularly helpful in situations.  The assignments were to far apart."
good,Falta más prestaciones para el personal ya que sin ellas el personal busca otras oportunidades de empleos para su beneficios y bienestar de su familia

good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, paga corretamente nas data certas."
good,"work at hospital in Thibodaux ,la. daily jos was to clean grounds and deliver product daily ,to the customers at the hospital .."
good,I have had a good experience with Manpower in the past. It is a good tool for entry into a permanent position with a specific company or skill set. I would use them again if the opportunity came up.
good,"Temporary work, good pay but sometimes not enough hour working at that particular company. It is bad that they do not have an actual oficce in council bluffs that you can go to if you have issues with hours paid and other inquieries."
good,It was hard work but nothing too much. The lunch break was pretty short. They were very unorganized and always rushing us.
good,"Très bonne ambiance entre salarié et patron."
good,"very busy company will work again for them. their management is very good they find a job for you as soon as possible, and very friendly"

good,"work was ok pay could have been better but that is down to the role i was employeed to do, i was paid regularly and in a timely manner. so over all a resonable company to wrok for"
good,They stole my belongings out of my locker and blamed it on me even though it had just been my day off. Only paid me back when I filed a police report.
good,A long day of twelve hours grave shift that requires 120 items per hour. Floor size comparable to multiple football fields. Good safety on floor with multiple requirements.
good,"Sporadic placements, not reliable. Personnel was never present with our paychecks. I may not want to work with them at this time. This all i have to say about this company."
good,I like working for the company because at the time it had steady work. And the hiring staff was very devoted to work with your schedule
good,"No raises and no vacations, takes them a while to find you job placement after a previous temp job, the people are pretty nice but the pay and no raises or vacation is a turn off"
good,enjoyed working for the company. the staff was amazing and were pretty organized. cant really say much bad things about them. Good people to work for.
good,"They're good at problem solving and there for you when you need them to be, The staff are polite and always available. When I lost a job assignment they were able to find me something else within a couple of days."
good,"Diverses missions "
good,"The work can be difficult in production sometimes, but the money is decent and if, like me, you were looking for something temporary, this is certainly the way to go."
good,Keeps you busy at all times. If you love overtime; manpower places you at a few different spots that need workers for late shifts; as well as the weekends

good,"Nice place for short term work...friendly atmosphere, good hours, acceptable pay scale, good people, work not too difficult, willing to train, apply today!"
good,This job was okay as a stop-gap measure.  I do not recommend staying with a Temp Agency for longer than it takes to get hired into the position you are placed in.
good,These jobs are all about timing speed and preparing this helps build good coordination and team work with these jobs comes building of social skills
good,"I checked in and helped the team with any issues they may be having such as getting to or throwing away any patterns. I kept in touch with the supervisor, updated him on our progress and make sure he was satisfied with the progress for the day."

good,"Too long ago to know what they are doing any more.  It was an ok job, I learned a lot about manufacturing jobs and also corporate jobs.  I would not work there again."
good,the pace that was required was raised to an almost unmanageable level which considering a lot of judgement calls were required on the parts made it all but impossible to catch all the mistakes
good,It was a good place to work. The mangers and team members were usually friendly. I learned how to work on various machines and how to maintenance them. The hardest part of the job was working conditions and lack of breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was changing shifts.
good,Okay jobs and okay people okay pay but really wish they had more opportunities for felons and that they could work more with special needs instead of discriminating others to disabilities
good,"Me gusta mucho mi trabajo, pero mis horarios no se me acoplan a mi vida personal y no hay buena comunicación con mi gerente ya que no estamos en contacto comunmente."
good,"For the year or so I was a temp worker for them, I received 1 job and that was to help setup a small opening party. The other times you are waiting for a call that will never come. However I only worked for them for a short time and I had only 1 previous job."
good,"I had a very early typical day so everyone around me was pretty cranky. I did not learn a whole lot, management was okay, environment was way too laid back and not very serious."
good,equipe agreable mais faible rémunération. diplome non pris en compte.politique de reconduction de CDD
good,"I applied thought them and they sent me to king collage to do dishes  and I had a great time and the people there were great, everyone helped each other"
good,Decent company pay not the best. Wish the pay was better because people are always leaving for this reason. I am grateful i have a job don't get me wrong just not happy with overall pay
good,"manager was friendly to start off with but change over time, but it was nice working here, the hours was nice, co- workers was nice and nothing really hard out the place"
good,a great busy job with great people. with constant flow of cars you're always busy job security not the best. Had good working relationships with my co workers. management at jlr were great. the hardest part of my job was being laid off. i enjoyed every day as it was always a challenge
good,"The job i did was very isolated, i was alone for the most of the time everyone else was old and couldn't speak proper English or to themselves so it didnt really workout cause i am a very outgoing person."
good,Great place to work for they all ways have work for you they can work around your schedule if you need them to great pay just a wonderful place to work for.
good,"I thought Manpower would be a company that I could stay with a company to get behind based on their values - people, knowledge and innovation - but they've decided to outsource all of their back office tasks to India. There goes the customer service, the people and the knowledge. Very innovative Manpower!"
good,"staff was helpfull, workplace was inviting. i dislike how i had to call on a daily basis to find out if i was working or not, becuase there was no schedual at the factory."
good,"Por trabalhar em uma empresa terceirizada pela Manpower, não convivi de perto com a empresa. "
good,Didn't realize that Manpower also placed professionals until my former company wanted to hire me back as a temp to finish some projects. Things were well handled.
good,"They Found great work opportunities for me. Supplied adequate work for the summer. Recommend to others if needing. Positive and friendly, overal satisfied."
good,I was  responsible for building and  sterilizing  equipment for other  departments in my building. As well as training other coworkers.
good,"Was getting alot of work at one point but then no work for a while, also manpower team messed up payments a few times. I enjoyed the work i was given but would not go through manpower again."
good,It was a good experience where I was placed but the hours where longer than I expected from what they told me. You never knew when you where getting off.
good,Manpower is a great company to work for. The employees at the designated job site were wonderful to work with and the management was very helping in accompanying you to transition into the position.
good,Pretty laid back.  Fun people to work with. We made sure labels were properly placed on product bottles and also filled bottles with product.  I would say the hardest part was cleanup on filling lines.
good,"great company to start with if you're not yet sure what you want to do, flexibility allows you to try out different jobs to make sure you find something that fits."
good,"Manpower , like everyone else, does what it can with limited resources.  For older workers who may have some physical limitations, there are very few selections for jobs at Manpower.  But, there's always ALCON, which seems to be Manpower's biggest tri-state area client.  ALCON produces interocular lenses and employs hundreds of people, many through Manpower until they either have their assignments changed or get hired by ALCON."
good,"I would come in at 7 a.m. worked til 3 had my breaks alone.  Did not talk to anyone just kept working, also no one talked to me.  I was the temp and that is how I was treated.  They had a luncheon and did not make me feel welcome to join."
good,Long time ago no longer relevant. I don't really remember much at this time. it was over a decade ago. I'm sure the company has completely different people working there.
good,"it is a agency that only had one job available to me to medical assistant and it was a contract deal prn for a few months. I was able to learn more and extend my learning experience in the place I was put in. but only having one place for contract for a medical assistant, well I would say that they need to pick up more clients so work can continue to be established by the people hey hire."
good,"Regular,pois sempre temoa que procura melhorar..."
good,"Tengo un hermoso equipo de trabajo, siempre estamos dispuestas a resolver las necesidades de la sucursal, las posibilidades de crecimiento están pero a largo plazo, tengo descanso en mi hora libre y no se trabaja con mal clima ni mal humor."

good,Bom local de trabalho com boas condições e boas ofertas salariais.

good,"Jobs ranging from day labor to professional white collar. "
good,manpower is a temp agency and one of the better ones. they provide you with work when it is available but it is a temp agency and sporadic and short work assignments come with the territory.
good,"Es una empresa donde puedes adquirir mucha experiencia //"
good,Okay staff and work placements. Only problem was that the office personnel changed so often that it was hard to even make appointments or commitments.
good,This company is very pictular about the people they choose for each job that they need to fill. I mean that they want to make sure that it is a good fit for both clients.
good,They are nice people who try to locate job placements regardless of the legnth of time the job is offering. They ask if you would be interested in something outside your norm.
good,The work environment at Johnson Control was very fast paced.  I learned how to multi-task and work with people from all different walks of life.

good,"entreprise à priori intéressante mais les process de recrutements ont une décennie de retard. "
good,"Avantages"

good,Company communicates well with it's employees and welcomes feedback. There is a great internal customer service department to assist employees with various inquiries or issues.
good,"They put me in a position with a company and I very rarely heard from them again.  If I did have contact, it was because I had a question regarding my direct deposit or something of that nature."
good,"Embora seja um trabalho que tenha muito stress, tem muito bom ambiente não tem muita pressão, aprendi a trabalhar em equipa a trabalhar por objectivos, o companheirismos e a relacão com os superiores e colegas é otima."
good,A typical day as a reviewer would be to grab a stack of loans that you would be working with for that day. As a reviewer I would look through each individual document to determine if it is needed in order to purchase a loan. if in fact the document was needed I would sort every document needed in a standard order so that the group of associated who handled the loan after me would be able to locate those documents easily and continue their job.
good,The atmosphere is happy and everyone is helpful at all times. Each employee is treated like they belong. All is treated equal.
good,"The Agency is ok, they found me a job but couldn't find me anymore jobs besides that one. They placed me in nj clean energy program and that job was very stressful, they have favorites and they throw all the work on the newbies."
good,"This is a staffing agency that helps place you on any job that you have experience in. Started off in maintenance, the jobs I was placed were some bad, some decent...never good. Management was average and the co-workers didn't associate much."
good,"This job is very good for when u need an on all job,  very good hours and time is very reliable.  I would recommend it for people that really need a job, while searching for a permanent job."
good,Very helpful temp service. Will relocate you and help you find what you need. Temp to hire. and will work with your schedule.
good,"I've learned to never go into the job with ""how you think or plan the day is going to go"" Always be ready to roll with the punches. You have to be so flexible in the workplace at times that they should assume your half slinky ;)"

good,"Manpower is a good temp agency,"
good,Hardwork to prepare you for anything that comes your way in the future. I enjoy fast paced work environment so it was ok for me. Moreover I am a salesman therefore i rather work retail. I have numerous experience in customer service. I love jobs where I'm forced to enhance my brain.

good,"El trabajo es tranquilo y adaptable, se trabaja con un grupo de compañeros excelentes."
good,"Business development selling professional services within the Boston/Cambridge markets.  I learned to engage and provide solutions to C-level executives for their staffing needs.  Toughest part of the role was building your initial pipeline and contacts."
good,learned a lot about others and how to ask the right questions. The hardest part of the job and remember some computer things.
good,some staff are decent. some make way too much money to do nothing but screw you around. don't deal with issues very well nor pay very well. don't try to help out those who have records.
good,Manpower's cancellation of assignment was poor. They would call on the phone as you were walking out the door and say the client didn't need you anymore. Manpower was fairly consistent with continuous job placement. There was never much promise in an assignment turning into a permanent position.
good,"Not the best job, doidnt really like being cussed out every ho of the day by customers. but i supoose it could have been worse."
good,Prévient vraiment en avance pour une mission. pas de probleme de communication.

good,well this is a temp agency in my time of needing a job this place pulled through right away only needed them for a short time and well that is exactly what a temp worker is
good,"Good environment to work in, Help was around when needed. CO-workers were very helpful and friendly. Easy job o learn, was not a busy environment, on the phone. Appellants were very friendly over the phone, when we needed to answer calls."
good,Great job while I was pregnant with my son. I enjoyed the fact that each job was only a few weeks and different learning experiences. Had to call a lot to keep them looking for jobs.
good,data entry worked well with co workers they got me my position at the decatur police department as an entry clerk whick lead to me getting hired/ not a hard job loved making the friendships
good,Sort tax returns after opening. Part time based on employer daily need. Call daily to see if needed for that day. Most hours worked per day was four.
good,un dia entretenido con algo de presión pero ambiente laboral y infraestructura buenas
good,"Hard work fast paste"
good,"Training starts out great and creates the illusion that you will have the tools needed to make the customer happy which is not always the case. There would be lack of support, system issues and constant changes in procedures that would cause inability to resolve issues which then would cause employee scores to decline which decreased pay."
good,"i was ok with this job, i liked getting a lot of experience in a short amount of time, however, this is not a job you go to to find your career, sure, there are people who say that they found their career there, but really, they say that they are interested in you and then you go to a different place to work for a while."
good,"productive days, same thing everyday, very good money available for the job that it is. every employee is there to only help themself."
good,It is a temp agency so it depends on the assignment one gets.  They do pretty well.  I appreciate their finding me work. I would work for them again.
good,"The jobs I've been assigned were incredibly easy mentally but physically demanding, which is how I wanted it. I don't have anything more to say. They are a standard labor company."
good,Where I worked for Manpower everyone was very nice and easy to communicate with. Easy full time hours. They really value teamwork and want everyone to work together. If you need something they work hard to help accommodate you.
good,"Allstate was a great company to work for. It was demanding but fun. It was emergency roadside assistance so at the end of the day, you felt a since of satisfaction in your days work. I was hired through a Manpower Temp Agency. The onsite Manager would never respond to our emails. We would have to send many emails to get anything fixed with pay or hours. That was the only thing that most of us didn't like. Other then that the job was great"
good,This is a very small machine shop.  They don't have alot of machines and alot of their practices are 20+ years old.  I tried to update things by programming with new software but I was never allowed to try one of the programs on a CNC machine despite being asked to learn how to program with the software.
good,i learned how to put together mailers and flyers as well as various processes that are in a  bindery  i also learned how to deal with different kind of people in a different environment
good,Pretty good agency. placed me in an corporation and I was eventually hired permanently and was there for about 8 years until deciding to relocate.

good,"Mission intéressante, auprès des ressources humaines. Aimant les chiffres, j'ai été gâté"
good,"They are a good company. However you get no sick day, and it is really hard to get time off work when needed. It is a very fast pace, and can be a stressful job at times."
good,"Company placed me with a position fairly quickly. The staff at Manpower were very respectful and professional. But, did have issues with receiving paychecks on time."
good,I worked with refrigeration doors daily. The environment is fun to work in and could be very fast paced at times. You have to have the ability to multi-task on a daily basis. Occasionally given multiple projects to work on.

good,typical day was arrive at work was arrive there find out where i was going to be. my coworkers were fun. there wasn't really any hard parts
good,"if your looking to update your skills or your resume,working for Manpower is not a bad place to work.including shipping and recieving,production and Wharehousing."
good,"buena, na medida que usted haga y va donde manda no mas no hay nada que reclamar"

good,I do not want to make a comment but the system is requiring me to make a statement. I will not be making a comment in the future about this company.
good,"Pago de haberes puntual"
good,they are very helpful with finding you temporary jobs. they work very well with you in the beginning. then once you are done training you slowly drift apart but they are still a huge part of the job until you become permanent
good,"I had really good jobs , had some good hours and good pay, I really want to find another job that can work with me and give me some hours , I really want first so I can be off at a great time."

good,Ils m'ont trouvés du travail qui ne me correspondait pas mais du travail quand même .
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics.
good,"I didn't work directly with Manpower, they were my placement agency.  The people I did deal with were great and I loved working with them."
good,"Worked outside on a lot of the jobs with the shovel.  Moving dirt, filling holes and digging holes.  I have experience in fork lift and warehouse work through them. Most of the jobs were only a week at a time."

good,"Angenehmes Arbeiten bei hoher Qualitätsanforderung!"
good,I was with the downtown branch and they try their best to help you look for a job but it is not consistent. They do OK. I would recommend as long as they can find you a job
good,"I did not care for the management in the area I was in. They told me one thing in the interview to make it sound good, but when I started working there it was not true. There were a lot of changes and disorganization in the area I was in."
good,Always something to do. great jobs offered. just simple a good place to start out at. Always finding something new for people.
good,Nice people that help you find a job that matches you and the company. depending on what you are looking for you could most likely find a job you are looking for.
good,"Fazer a parte financeira da empresa como fluxo de caixa e reembolsos, aprendi muito sobre como funciona a parte financeira das empresas. Tive uma gerência que tendia mais para o lado comercial e por isso acabava sendo um pouco ausente para as necessidades da filial, principalmente no meu caso que precisava sempre da sua aprovação para os documentos financeiros e contratação de serviços. Os colegas de trabalho ajudavam quando possível. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era quando marcavam visita de orçamento e manutenção sem consultar a minha agenda, pois me atrapalhava todo por na época não ter ninguém para me ajudar. a parte mais agradável era o reconhecimento do trabalho por parte dos funcionários alocados em outras empresas, à cada necessidade deles satisfeita."
good,"I enjoyed working with Manpower, Inc.  Working within the corporate entity it was a very productive office.  We all worked hard to meet deadlines and assisted each other with deadlines, as needed.  Everyone worked together as a team to get the job done and done right.  The job and duties relocated to the New York area and I was unable to relocated."
good,Recommended for a source of employment for people just starting out and for workers who would like to try contracting. Easy place to get along with co workers
good,i work well at burger king but i couldn't find proper babysitter for my child at the time. but i enjoyed being around the environment.
good,"The company helped me find a temporary job. Once I finished my work at this company, Manpower did not contact me about anymore job offers."
good,"For a typical work for the each day would be working in the spine of the company I would have count sheet inventory, organizational skils, loads to unloading of shipment and product, and as well helpingwith company needs. and as well as ask walk-thru's to check for work productivity seeing the needs for worklines."
good,"Since this is a temporary/permanent company it's good for what it does.  The location was inconvenient for me living in Castle Rock, CO, they are in downtown Denver."
good,"I really enjoyed the time I was employed by Manpower. The minute I walked through their door, they showed such professional manners. They helped me with my application, they saw my potential immeadiatly and put me right to work the very next day."
good,Temporary agency is always a good resource. Manpower has been around a very long time and works well with both employees and employers.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, las personas de las cuentas muy  atentas y responsables"
good,everything with them is ok except for you have to constantly call in order to get a job. but they do help when you do get in contact.
good,"Un empresa con problemas financieros ya que no tenían crédito con los proveedores por falta de pago y no pagaban las quincenas a los trabajadores."
good,Some Recruiter dont  care about what job they give you. Evening knowing that a 9.00 to 12.00 per Hour job won't make ends meet.
good,"- une journée de manutention est très physique"
good,"Manpower has been a great place to work. They have been helpful to finding a placement for me when they can. They just need to find longer and more stable placement with their clients, so their employees will have a more stable work."
good,"My main objective was to Created Logistics Reports for the Traffic Managers"
good,Professional company to work for. Pleasant management staff. They really want to see you succeed. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a great temp to perm service.
good,fun atmosphere to work in. high turnover rate. employees were not very helpful. supervisors were not good communicators.
good,"etre attentif sur les notes à l'attention du vol"
good,Co workers had bad attitudes/Language.  Hardest part of the job was standing on cement floors for 10 hours per day. Most enjoyable part of the job was receiving free ice cream during breaks.

good,"i had several temporary jobs. most jobs were ok some was not. most were for only for a few weeks to a few months, it got me by untill i found a full time job"
good,"As placement/employment agencies go it was initially a very pleasant office to work out of. Receiving assignment was active and productive when on their list, and underproductive when on their other list. They give an employee the right to turn down any assignment if not thought to be conducive, and yet penalize a person when you do so by withholding assignments or only offering the lowest paying or out of you area of expertise assignments."
good,"Expérience enrichissante car j'ai appris énormément de chose. Le travail en équipe, en stresse et tout le coté commercial."
good,se trabaja muy bien muy buen compañeros lastima que no alla mucho trabajo
good,"Although this company was able to assign me to interesting jobs, they tended to last a very short time.  The companies they have a contract with expect Manpower to send employees that are perfect all the way around.  Not an easy task, but at least they try their best to deliver.  Companies can be very demanding and leave no room for average workers."
good,"A typical day of work included temp job at plastic manufacturer company.  I operated a tow moter, operated plastic manufacturer machines"
good,"This was a temporary job."
good,"The company really cares about their employees and does well to offer accommodations to each individuals needs, no matter how big or small.  Good rapport among departments, management and staff.   Only down side is the hourly rate of pay - very low for the type of work and responsibility expected from Customer Service Specialists."
good,you just go where ever they send you to work sometimes it's good sometimes it's not. sometimes you work with decent people sometimes you dont
good,Results may vary based on who one's recruiter is. They do actively call and email job seekers based on the job seeker's interest in finding employment.
good,I would be sent to where ever they need help at the time in there offices. I learned different job techniques on a daily basis. You work with different people on a daily basis so it was a great opportunity to be around all kinds of nationalities. The hardest part of the job is there was nothing to offer a permanent position so there was never enough hours.
good,"Review catering event sheets for the day. Prep, set-up, service, breakdown and cleanup after event."
good,Soy una persona responsable  el ambiente de trabajo como demostradora es agradable ya que conoces a mucha gente  y tratas tambien con ella para que se te facilite la palabra haces labor de venta
good,they found me an assignment pretty quickly. be prepared to start when they call you. good experience and many local offices.

good,not there long enough to give them a fair review. short term assignment during a time i was need to be in Akron to help family
good,They did well in placing me in a solid work environment that had pretty sound job security. I feel that the Pfizer/Zoetis Manpower representative was a poor choice however. Seldom did they get done what was needed and when issues were resolved they seemed to be at their leisure with minimal to no feedback at all.
good,"Staff various positions including light industrial, IT, management, human resources, and admin positions."
good,I was place in a factory through a temporary service. It was a third shift job and it was pretty good. Just the thought of not knowing how long I would be placed at the job haunted me.
good,"I worked in a cubicle with the P3 billing group.  I learned about team work because everyone did basically the same tasks the same way.  We were trained on the method of responding to various information requests from various agencies.  The management at Kansas Farm Bureau was outstanding.  They worked to include the manpower employees in all of the information needed to successfully complete their job assignments.  My co-workers were all a part of the same team and we worked well together.  The hardest part of the job was learning that the work never stopped.  There was no time to end the day, you just learned to stop when you were ready to leave.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the value of team work."

good,"Manpower is a temp agency, so jumping around to different factories became usual thing. I signed up with manpower looking for work and they placed me in a factory relativity quickly but that factory only needed me because they had a jump in stock so my time there was short lived and then manpower put me in another factory the next day. Which going from factory to factory is great for learning new skills, but having periods of not working doesn't help pay the bills. My co-workers were typically nice so about every other week I was meeting new people and making new friends. I actually enjoyed a lot of the time I had at the places they placed me, but I need a job I can stay at and advance in, all the while advancing my own skills."

I was a temp worker, therefore, most people didn't even acknowledge my existence. No one was rude just busy. Knowing that I did not plan to be there any longer than I had to be made it hard to build any lasting relationships with co-workers. I was brought in to clean up a big pile of over due invoices, and I was given the liberty to track down and research deliveries and claimed payments as well as contradicted contract terms.

My co-workers were always kind and respectful.  The hardest part of the job was waiting for another assignment because of bills at home.  Management had a good system for job assignments.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly people I met and the experience I obtained as a result of Manpower's diligence.

good,"A typical day for me is coming in for 7 AM and then heading to the Production Associates' desk.  I receive emails called ""pulls"" or ""pushes"" which calls for material to be moved both physically to the needed location and electronically using the SAP System.  Other than pulls and pushes I am responsible for moving material into our area, ESS.  This requires scanning material into an excel sheet and checking its location in the SAP system.  Once the location is verified, I put the material in its correct location and move on to other waiting material.  I do this all day until 3 PM (excepting break at 9:15 and lunch at 12).  From this job I've learned how to utilize the SAP System as well as had an insight into the manufacturing process.  The management is fine, my group leaders are great individuals and my direct supervisor is very easy to talk to.  Management as a whole however is a bit iffy.  There seems to be a lot of politicking and unfairness when it comes to advancement which is unfortunate for someone in my position looking for a career.  My co-workers are great.  They are very friendly and we work well as a team.  The hardest part of the job would probably be the lack of benefits and compensation which I receive.

good,"My typical day at work was like a rollercoaster one day I may come in and wouldn't need extra people the next day it might be total opposite. I learned how to manage multiple people, communication skills. Co-workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the day is having a temporary employee that would not do his/her job. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others."

good,Manpower being a temp service was ok as a employer. I gained some skills that can be used on other jobs. My co-workers were very good people and I'm glad I got to know them. The most difficult part of the job were the rotating shifts. The people were the most enjoyable part of the job.

good,Manpower is a great place to work. It is a company that has been around a long time.
good,"First I started as a Medical billing Assistant where I was suppose to be trained, unfortunately the person that was suppose to train me, left. Then the Billing department that I was sent to moved to another area. Eventually I was transferred to the Medical record Department where I stayed working for a few months. Unfortunately they made the medical record electronically, and since I was sent through a temporary agency, I was lay -off because they only needed one person in that department. The hardest part of my job was giving-up learning more to practice the medical-billing, because the supervisor quit her job. However even though I did not know that I was going to end up doing medical record, I got along well with my co-worker, and we became good friend."
good,"I do not prefer to work as a contractor, but Manpower was professional and most importantly, they found me a job when there were not any."
good,Great thing about working for a temp agency is that you get to work at jobs you never would have thought of. Gives you a taste of something different on each assignment.
good,I enjoyed the salary at the company I was placed on. I did not like the lack of cooperation from Manpower whena problem arose I was let go immediately without any ivestigation at all.
good,Working being a mail sorter making sure that all the mail get in to the right order and stamped.
good,The system with this company is flawed. They are expectant of the Staffing Specialist to both staff and do sales. It spreads the employee too thin.

good,"I learned many other trades on this job. I was relocated from my home in Georgia, but was provided with per diem and lodging."
good,I feel this was a pretty good company to work for. I would refer more people to work here. The only thing I don't like about this company is that they rarely get work in.
good,"A typical day involved suiting up in clean room attire, assembling, inspecting, and packing stents. I learned the process used to provide a quality product used for lifesaving heart surgery. Management provided support and guidance when needed.. Co-workers were kind and supportive; assisted and encouraged fellow employees on the floor daily."
good,Every morning I look forward to working with friendly and courteous staff.
good,"Basic administrative which may include reception, filing, data entry, and other various office work"
good,"As an associate, we had many miscellaneous duties. Stocking and assisting customers."
good,"This company works hard to find a position to where you could fit right away; however, after you are introduced into that job, you don't hear from them unless you have a problem. This is typical of a temporary employee service."
good,Management didnt care about what went on in the offices with office managers. Over worked but never got paid correctly. Set unacceptable expectations.
good,"Payroll perfect. Job instantly. The only is I was sent out to work at fuji, Majority hmong. The hmong temps and supervisors work together to get people fired. My first day Racial slurs. Reported to Manpower nothing was resolved. It happened again and nothing was done. So I quit"

good,Good place to work for if they use regulary sometimes slow when looking for work
good,It was a boring job but it had great weekly pay and one set schedule shift.
good,Working at a temp to hire agency is not all that but I was having a hard time finding employment without owning a vehicle at the time. But over all they were okay but I won't do it again. I have learned that I am a better employee in finding a job on my own.

good,I loved the staff and the work was pretty easy and fast to catch on to; but there weren’t any benefits and the hours are too long for the rate of pay.
good,"hoog tempo afwisselend en wisselvallig, alles door elkaar."
good,Buen ambiente laboral confortable con interes por tu trabajo como empleado.
good,"Pay could be a little better for some of their jobs. There was alot of lack of communication but overall, good company to work for. They have benefits as an option."
good,It was a good place to work just lack of manger and no help at times other then that nice people and great place to work at in grow and have very nice people
good,"Typical day at work was coming in and starting the day with unloading things off of the trucks."
good,"Fast paced and always something to do.I worked Monday-Friday 7am-3:30pm.Saturdays and Sundays off.My work days went so quickly,before I knew it.It was FRIDAY."

good,"Fast paced environment, with good staff. They taught us everything on the first day. As soon as we entered the doors it was hands on learning, with exceptional trainers."
good,Manpower was useful when extra money was needed. I just out grown the small amount of pay that was given. So I decided to take another job opportunity.
good,"Didn't last long, got laid-off after 6 days or so. People were nice, work was good, ""allowed to go home early"", do to lack of demand lack of work. Sad really."
good,"soweit war ich zufrieden mit Manpower, aber aufgrund kindkrank und selber krank (Unfall und eine notop) , bekommt man einfach eine kündigung, es gibt dinge die man einfach nicht ändern kann und dafür wird man quasi bestraft und das obwohl man sich krank zur arbeit schleppt , ebenso kids krank in schule und kita steckt und so wird es einem gedankt. fand es sehr unpersönlich die kündigung , auch wenn mein bearbeiter sonst sehr super war und immer ein offenes ohr hatte"
good,"The pay was great, the manpower team and staff were fair and willing to help wherever they could. And provide the best service possible to all clients and potential clients."
good,"Helps while seeking full time career; however,  most of their jobs are manufacturing and if you have a college education, they won't send you on those jobs and you work very little."
good,Over all i would work for them again. Great attitudes promising jobs.. They set you up with jobs that you are comfortable with working. They pay range is usually based on your ability to work.
good,I didn't like manpower because they never have long assignments and they get your hopes up. Its frustrating when your trying to have a career  and better yourself.
good,"The job was basically what the title says. Just packaging products at 3M. No benefits. If you weren't working, you weren't getting paid so no vacation or sick pay. The pay was very low compared to the full timers working beside you but it helps you get your foot in the door when you do go full time. I believe you do get paid much more now but I'm not sure how much. Wasnt the worst job in the world but its factory work so I cant say much more than that."
good,Una empresa que no se interesa en las personas solo son outsourcing
good,"The environments they put you in arent equal to pay. such as doing a type of labeor that leaves you crippled, at a wage that cant even support the average household."
good,"As I am a foreign worker here, I cant complain much about the salary, its way better from what I was earning in Philippines. I also understand that our company is new here in the country, so the benefits is not that much yet."
good,Manpower was great way for me to get hired at my temp job.it was nearly 20years ago but they still deserve a good review . Right.i always got paid every week
good,I haven't been employed through them very often. It seems like they do no have very many assignments. I have called them numerous times over the years
good,Manpower values good work performance and will acknowledge such. They will take the time to check in on their workers and evaluate their work performance with the intent to build on their employees strengths and to strengthen areas that can be stronger. Manpower does what it takes for their workers to be successful. The Management team is very down to earth which I believe brings a connection to their workers which makes their workers want to stay and be loyal to the company.
good,The company mission drives the success of the business.  There is room for growth and upward mobility while having the opportunity to make good income
good,its mostly temp work and temp to hire takes a bit but working on it all is the only way to get in anywhere good and worth your time. the benefits they offer are very good but sometimes pay isn't

good,"Manpower contacted me to work temporary for Alcoa as Financial Analyst, after that I did not have contact with the managers or staff. I do no have more information."
good,Esperienze e conoscenze nuove.
good,"I was able to move up within this company but for the management team it was a complete joke. There was a lot that occurred at Manpower that I will never expose to the public, I wish them the best and am grateful to have gained true knowledge experience through their various careered fields."
good,by close workplace I say that because we were all pretty close and tolerable. Everyone was friendly and outgoing. And on our down time we usually sit up and go over the preview.

good,"Funcionários passavam fome e as condições de trabalho não eram boas. Muitos necessitaram de atendimento médico e, muitas das vezes, ficar em observação."
good,come in do your job and get the production out. what I learned out of working for a temp. is that it take to long to get hired in the company they send you too
good,"It is a nice place to work, but was put on medical leave due to cancer and they agreed to take me back after I was released from the doctor and they refused too."
good,"A typical day at work depends on which job I've been assigned to, an example would be my previous job at Manpower during 05/2016 to12/2016, I'd come to work a few minutes early, clock in, and I would get working just like any job. What made the job the job enjoyable, was the fact that I got to work with computers, printers and lots of tools. The management was a bit sloppy, seeing as how most managers at Zodiac Aersospace were openly alcoholic, but that didn't effect their work, just their character. A-side from that, I learned about how to read blueprints and datasheets, how to record things in logs and print blueprints out according to SKU numbers."
good,"A regular job offer is all you can ask for from a temp agency, a few jobs that I had gotten were not suited for what I was looking for, but nothing to complain about"
good,"Love that Manpower allow employees volunteer hours. Also that they have a bring your child to work day.  I was hired during W-2 season to help out with Payroll on boarding, entering hours into ADP as well as re-sending W2's forms to employee."

good,"I found the experience lacked personal contact ie via phone conversations etc, so often felt unsupported.I didnt have any workplace culture experience, hardest part of the job understanding the portal for time sheet etc."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with various staffing agencies that we work with. i feel we have a great relationship and its very rewarding talking with them and getting their new hires onboarded.

good,"Long boring day, just pulling sheet out the wall, its a quiet job. I've learned to use a lo-boy and a forklift. Management is a little on the paranoid side when you first drive by yourself. Coworkers have been there for a long time, some of them are my grandfathers age. The hardest part of the job is not being bored. The most enjoyable part of the job is driving the lo-boy and forklift."
good,manpower mostly make me do labor jobs but sometime it there a missed commutation on some job sites where to go but it a temp agency so it what it is

good,"Manpower staffing is a highly rewarding job.  Working with people to find work and manage employees is very rewarding, but can be demanding/stressful. The job is flexible allowing time to be devoted to family functions within reason.  Compensation is low at first but goes up and is fair.  As a result the employees stay with the company leaving little room for new hires.  The company lays off the employees with the least amount of time first, making the first few years of job security a little unstable."
good,email specialist- answered emails from customer complaints for new program that launched.  was told that was all just emails but was later told that answering phones was included
good,tres bonne entreprise avec une vraie culture et de vrais valeurs
good,"My typical day was industrial in manner, i did learn industrial skill s that i use to this day, my management was very good, i liked my coworkers, the hardest part of the job was not knowing if you would be hired to a full time position the most enjoyable part was the flexibility."

good,"worked a very high pace"
good,This job is not for everybody. It is very strenuous. I enjoyed the challenge and would still be there if I had my license and didn't have an issue with finding a ride out to Midway from hinesville. what sucks is it is a temp agency that makes money off your work pay so you only get ten an hour whereas the target permanents receive 16 base pay for the same job if not easier because they are trained and allowed to use the equipment while temps are not.
good,"It was a Part Time work. My job here was being a usher in the emblematic Theater of Liceu in Barcelona(Spain). My duties was seating the people in their places and help them if they had any problem.

good,"Decent, very little employee to employer relation, more capital minded which made most positions available uncomfortable to want to go to, left you waiting for the day to end."
good,Getting assigned to work in various temporary positions.  On one position learned more about the IRS.  The hardest part of the job was getting people to understand that the payment center was not a place to get your IRS questions answered.  I love speaking to people across the USA.
good,Very unorganized and no caring towards employees. Sometimes I was payed late or the next week co workers were rude. Some of the assignments were like this not all of them.
good,"As Michigan's factories were struggling, temp agency was the only way to be employed. I was asked where I wanted to work. I would be assigned for a limited time.

good,"A typical day at work started with reporting to the manager and submitting reports. I was given training on live equipment's, which in turn raised the competency level. Also, communication skills got better which included communicating with the onsite customers. coordinating with the support team and working on different telecom equipment's increased the skills required to proceed in this field. The management was good as the reporting managers were liberal. I had a very good time with the colleagues as all of them were very helpful and co operative. The hardest part of the job was the working conditions were not hygienic, as some of the site location were very remote. The most i like about the job was it gave me great knowledge about it and there was an urge and anxiety to learn new things every day."

Obtaining information from the caller prior to transfer to executives. Protocol and mandatory information gathering. I've learned to have a lot of patience with demanding callers, how to handle certain situations, and having empathy towards callers who are trying to reach or have been trying to reach IBM employees for a long time. The hardest part of the job is keeping occupied while call flow is not as heavy. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the support of my co-workers and being part of a team."

good,"Unload/ load trailers, sort assorted pallets, pick orders on forklift in warehouse."

good,"Working as a technical advisor has helped me learn several things such as simple troubleshooting techniques for popular electronic devices, customer service skills, improved my empathy as well as my patience. Management at my current job is very inconsistent, however issues do get resolved eventually. I really enjoy meeting new co-workers, which I have plenty of! There are over 100 people in our building alone. The best part of the job is the satisfaction of helping customers solve problems that they may not have been able to solve without my help. The most challenging part of my job is to keep up with the constant change in policy/procedure/troubleshooting."
good,"A typical day at Manpower would be handling phone support for Funai products: televisions, dvd players, and blu-ray players. I would usually take anywhere from 15-25 calls a day, each one being around 7.5 minutes in length. These would then be recorded into a ticket database."
good,I worked for many companies as a temp.  I really enjoyed the flexibility and changes from job to job.  Meeting new people and learning new skills along the way.

good,daily work
good,"a typical day at work was everyone had a particular role for their job and we all depended on each other to get the job done. we worked hard but everyday we learned that if we worked together we could reach our production goals. My co-workers were a great team of 8 guys. One in which was our lead and we not only worked hard together, but formed a good bond and had fun doing our job. The hardest part of the job was when things broke down on the job and set us back in our job. The best part of the job once again was my co-workers, we shared alot of laughs and had really good conversations. We even took breaks together as a team, cause we bonded together and we all got along."
good,I really liked the job I was doing at that time. I learned alot about engines. The hardest part about my job was knowing it was temporary. I got along well with the people on the line I was working on.
good,Not a very good place at all. I wouldnt reconmend them to anybody
good,"A work day varies by the type of job you are assigned. I learned that most companies that are hard to work for like Coca Cola, Abbott Labs, mainly hire through temp agencies like these. Management was ok, they just want to keep you working as much as possible. The co-workers were all good kind hearted people. Hardest part of the job was the commute at the time. The most enjoyabe part of the job was the comradery."
good,"I only ever got one job from them, i was told that they would have another for me after the first one ended, but never received a follow up call."
good,"Interview, test applicants for positions open with customers, performed employment verification's/ background checks on employees prior to starting assignment."
good,It was like a workplace sampler platter. You get to work for many different places without loosing seniority.

good,This is an ongoing contract job.I went from working for Manpower to Manpower Business Solutions. This is a very large company with many professionals.
good,"journée bien remplie,"
good,After relocating to Washington the manpower office in NJatchitoches connected with the one In Lacey giving me employment oppurtunities in aout one week. I was hired to work at the target distribution center in Lacey. though seasonal the funds were greatlyt appreciated. It was similliar to when I had worked for the Natchitoches Parish School Board Warehouse. everyone was friendly helpful and courteous. There were no real difficult tasks about this job.
good,"This is a workforce/temp agency that does a good job of finding jobs sometimes but the problem is that they are very inconstant and have a bad habit of not calling to communicate whether or not someone can start work. I worked for them one summer, but they keep you on file until you get another job I have called back to try and get a job again for a second summer in a row where they get me through the first steps of getting the job but they never give me a start date and i am left hanging, but because they already started me they don't put me on the list for any other jobs. Especially if you have to go through extra drug screening for prescription drugs"
good,Will work with you on any issue and can interfene on your behalf
good,"Throughout the duration of my employment with Manpower, I worked at several different companies. I enjoyed the diversity of not only working in a variety of companies, but working in various different positions within those companies."
good,"On site management would work with you when needed, with issues of both a personal and business nature. They provided benefits."
good,There are really no steady positions everything is 3 month or less currently. You can go weeks with no work which is not a good place to be in when you have a family.
good,I love the job opportunity they offer but the background part is the part that’s gets me because I feel they should me background friendly. When you become background friendly most of the people with backgrounds won’t feel left out
good,this is a temp job finder. They are dedicated to helping people find employment that suits employee and companies. According to the needs of hours and wages. I am presently working nights but I need to find something on dayshift.
good,"No meu ponto de vista, participei de algumas seleções na Manpower e também ja fui ex-funcionário,fiz Supervisao Canal Farma Unilever. No processo de Selecao achei muito rigoroso, também tinha indicação de pessoas pelo cliente. Se torna desagradável e nao ter chance de fazer parte do time de trabalho..."
good,"Die Einsatzorte waren Klasse, die Manpower Mitarbeiter standen jederzeit zur Verfügung bei Problematischen Situationen. Die Bezahlung lief leider zweimal völlig daneben, auch auf Wunsch nach teilzeit wurde nicht eingegangen, sodass letzendlich nur die kündigung die schlussfolgerung war."
good,They really try to put you in the field of your experience to create easy transition from one job to the next. They always have availability and are looking for new employees
good,"Maschinen bedienen im 3 Schichtsystem"
good,It was really good for a student as it paid well and it was backshift so didn't clash with college timetables. The managers were very friendly and wanted to create relationships with you. It does get very stressful when peak time comes as you need to meet targets but they are very do-able.
good,Manpower helped me gain the experience I wanted in many fields. I enjoyed working for them and love the fact that I was able to gain the experience I needed to operate a forklift.

good,"I learned and read a lot of important stuff and had to be very careful when working with a lot of chemical. great place to work, meet new people, the food is great bit a little expensive, clean environment."
good,Left alone often with little to no training. Highly stressful work environment. I wound up training myself and found that other remote employees felt the same way.
good,"Esta experiência, apesar de positiva, revelou uma enorme dificuldade da parte da empresa de ver os seus funcionários como mais do que simples vendedores, mas também como responsáveis pela resolução de problemas da entidade que representei, a NOS Comunicações."
good,"The only reason for my poor rating is no paid time off except holidays. No vacation, no sick pay, no jury duty...etc. My immediate management was awesome but had to take vacation time not being paid."
good,I have worked with them 3 times and every time i had a chance to be hired on. If your a good employee you will generally be offered a position. This has been my experience. One time i was strung on for a long time and i never knew if it was the temp agency or the customer.
good,"El trabajo es un poco pesado, como empleado nuevo se recargan funciones, no hay mucho compañerismo. No pagan las horas extra cuesta mucho"
good,Manpower is a decent staffing service. This company is good for helping you get back into the workforce when you have been off work for awhile. Manpower helps you get back into the flow of working on a consistent basis again.
good,It's always hot but easy to manage all co-workers were nice and very helpful. We had to work at a fast pace but everything was easy to learn. I loved that job just wish I could go back because I was fired for something that had nothing to do with me.

good,I really do not want to say that much I just have not been back you keep telling I need to say more I do not wish to why do you keep asking me to say more
good,If you love being on the phone all day and resolving conflict while helping others in a fast paced environment this might be the job opportunity you are looking for
good,"Manpower does a good job vetting people for potential clients, however, your pay is between 35 - 45% less than what they get paid.  The percentage shouldn't be that high!!!!!"
good,"Es una empresa que apunta a mejorar su cultura y beneficios, aun le falta en gestion"
good,"All in all my experience with Manpower was a positive one. The staff sent me to assignments that I was qualified to do. I was hoping that they would find me a permanent part time position, but instead found me a full time position in a company that I could not commit to."
good,"otima empresa...em questão de trabalho nao tinha dificuldade de desenvolver o serviço ,os gerentes sempre estava nos auxiliando no trabalho e orientando"
good,"Once I got in, my local recruiter went out of her way to help me stay employed at a crucial time when I couldn't find employment in my previous career. Recruiter did try to get me back into my old career but the job market is still tight. Job assignments varied from physically demanding to more intellectual task oriented inventory/stocking or quality remediation of purchase parts."
good,"Manpower is a temp agency. They gave me an assignment at BTCO as a document specialist when I walked through their door. They weren't very accurate on how long this assignment would last for all the people they sent to work there. BTCO was a pretty nice place. The management was helpful and understanding. The people there were laid-back but helpful. Sometimes they would change procedures on how to deal with certain things, which could be a little frustrating. I didn't mind doing exceptions on the inventory sheets and folders because I am a problem solver."
good,I was contracted to work at Alcon Laboratories with I was employed with Manpower so all my experiences are based on Alcon as a company which was a great company to work for.
good,Manpower era contratada por la Empresa Teradata para administrar los recursos de personal que disponia.
good,"Everyday I came in ready with a game plan to find new business and source for new candidates. I made my most important phone calls first thing (scheduled calls, follow ups and returned calls) then I follow up with my closest to the deal situations. Then I would reach out to my target accounts and make calls for my most place able candidates. These actions resulted in about 75 calls a day and at least 3-5 interviews a week."

good,I picked up a lot of experience through Manpower such as warehousing did some carpentry and painting and one time I even worked for Amazon in Reno Nv.
good,manpower at samsung is overall a decent company. They just need a better management. Career opportunities are endless if you're hungry enough but the pay does not reflect on the level of experiences. They are a GREAT company to start off learning certain position.
good,Manpower was the temp agency I used when I first arrived to Texas. Often times you would work a job for a month or two receive lay off paperwork and have to call the recruiters office for another assignment. It rarely led to a full time permanent opportunity.
good,"Manpower is a pretty good place to work overall. There are a lot of people who work there so you are sure to find a niche and people you will get along with. Depending on the department, management can be spread out throughout the country which makes communicating about more complex issues difficult at times. Not too many opportunities for advancement, and they do not hire too many people on as staff from contracted positions."
good,I worked for Manpower for 5 years off and on while going to school.  This company offered me the flexibility that I needed to finish my nursing degree and change my career path.  I was able to work in several different locations under contract and learned various skills that aid me in my work as a nurse and make me more versatile.
good,"This was a temporary position that paid well, but the work was spotty.  You could go as long as two weeks without getting any work.  The people of manpower and the people I worked with were great."

good,I learned how to do purchase orders. The workplace was an office environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to find things to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,A Typical work day was extremely stressful.  Standing on your feet for over twelve hours a day was the hardest part of the job; along with mandatory overtime.
good,"grato ambiente laboral habia comunicacion con todo el personal ya sea ingenieros  jefe de almacen. seguridad  ect , mi dia laboral era muy bueno"
good,avis moyen sur tous les niveaux et pas très motivant
good,"Although ManPower is the company I have listed for this review, it was only the temp service that provided the referral to the actual job at Walmart.com. All call centers are a bit stressful but relaxed and this job had no exceptions. Although the pay is fair, it is hard to advance or even keep the job due to their use of temp services."
good,"Avantages sociaux attractifs ."
good,Because of Manpower being a temp service I was getting paid considerably less than the other CNC machine operators at Honeywell and had to drive twice as far.
good,I can't complain or praise Manpower. It was a paycheck in my pocket. Even though they lied about your check being mailed to you by Friday it wasn't too bad.
good,Hace falta un mejor clima laboral con mayor apoyo por parte de la gerencia
good,the job was just agency work for t.n.t so it was near same responsibilities  only  i would be inside a trailer taking consignments off of a conveyor belt 4 hours a day
good,"I've been given one assignment by them, which I loved except for the fact that it only lasted 2 weeks.  I'm not working more than I'm working.  Love the work but wish they'd keep me busier."
good,"It was a great place to work in very productive and had lots of work, although didn't like the supervisors attitude with the employees. Have very committed people working for them."

good,manpower is a nice temp to work for and they treat their  employees with respect and seem to keep them employed with nice jobs
good,The work was interesting. Employee's were able to gain experience and skills along the way. The managers helped prepare you to deal with what is expected. The co workers were helpful in showing you the proper way to perform difficult jobs. It can be stressful not knowing how long an assignment would last. I was able to meet and work with different types of environments on the jobs.
good,Manpower is a good staffing agency. I enjoyed working at the employer they provided. I was offered great pay and the hours I requested.

good,"I enjoyed the work as a Inbound call center for auto insurance claims.   I learned how to take auto insurance claims for the clients, and took claims over the phone and forwarded them to claims department.   The first couple of days on the phone I was very nervous of course, that would be the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the day would be helping customers resolved their insurance claims quickly."
good,"there was long hours but it was always busy so it made time go by fast if you are a hard worker such as myself.The only thing i didnt like was job security,sometimes you wou come to work and they send you home but it was a temp agency."
good,Co-workers are awesome. Management is horrible as well as the room for advancement. Hardest part is filling jobs at the minimum wage.
good,it was a routine job everyday. start by sorting through all cell phones by looks if they can be resold. then scan the imei numbers and start the process for phones to be cleaned and wiped free of personal data then to packaged to be sold.
good,Secrétariat classique dans des PME ou bien des entreprises ainsi que missions de secrétaire Commerciale. MANPOWER est une boîte d'intérim Leader sur le marché et qui propose des postes avec la possibilité de transformer les missions intérim en CDI ce qui ne fut pas le cas ces dernières années.
good,"Very respectful work environment. Management is supportive and positive, which encourages the employees want to succeed."
good,"Our branch was specific because we were solving new challenging projects.

But at one time I though they ware the greats place to work. You could make great pay, and was glad to be with them. Not any more.

good,"buen personal, atento, y colaborador."
good,Poor Supervision at the Factories. I got injured due to the training!

good,I learned the importance of working with others to get the job done.
good,"A typical work day at AEP Chemical Lab was very quiet and quant. I learned various amounts of details from chemical testing to electronic testing. Being the front desk receptionist I mean an array of people that would visit the lab. I was self managed, my direct supervisor worked off site and would check in from time to time with me but I built a strong trust factor with him. The hardest part of my job was looking for work to do, and the most enjoyable part was working in a stress free environment."
good,"go in a 6 turn machine on to warm up I enjoyed running the pleaders at Millipore I liked running them I was great at that job for what I was told.

good,"I would arrive and start a meeting with the other recruits, start interviewing new candidates and follow up with current employees. Learned to be in charge of the Human Resources Department and offer training to other employees. I didn't have to much contact with the managers because they lived in Israel.

good,"When I do get an assignment, I am usually working in a warehouse setting or driving a forklift.  Through all of this, I have learned how to work with others and with many diverse personalities.  Hardest part of working with ManPower is that they don't always have work for me.  I have to say the most enjoyable part has been is that they placed me with my last ""long-term"" job with Arnold Logistics (Jacobson Logistics) and I was hired as a permanent fork lift operator.  I was there over 7 years until they closed their doors due to the economic resession."
good,I worked in various warehouses for this temporary service.

good,temping service
good,"I worked at unilever through manpower and I felt that they did a great job with the employees. I never had an issue with pay or hours. I was a team leader and I felt that they trusted me and allowed me to do my job. However, since that assignment ended I've called three times and they haven't had anything. I understand the economy but I was lead to believe that there would be something. I haven't been contacted by them and I find that a bit insulting considering my reputation with my previous assignment and their praise for my work quality and ethic. I'd love to hear from them at some point because I really enjoyed their mgnt team and felt they had a good corporate structure."
good,Was just a temp agency they have a lot of different job opportunities to offer in a few different fields depending on your schedule and availability to get to and from the job

good,"not too many jobs found within daycare hours. they don't keep you informed on actively looking for work for you. if you dont have children that are in daycare i would recommend Manpower, otherwise most jobs they have are 1st (that start before 6am) 2nd and 3rd."

good,Een bedrijf dat veel ruimte biedt aan haar medewerkers voor persoonlijke invulling van een functie. Hierdoor heb ik veel kunnen leren. Dit is ook een valkuil voor de organisatie omdat medewerkers weinig richting meekrijgen. Dit maakt het soms lastiger om resultaat te boeken.
good,Empresa muito boa. U ambiente do trabalio e bom os horarios son muito bom. So que u salario e muito baixo
good,Manpower got me a job for a one year contract at UPS. At the time it was needed to provide for my family. Once the contract was over I was reassigned to another account and eventually got hired by the company.

good,"Work consisted of fabricating silicon wafer microchips for cellphone manufacturers. I learned a great deal about the wireless communications industry and participated in team building exercises. Workplace culture is relaxed, but competitive.

good,"Trabajé en desigual gracias a manpower y fue una gran experiencia, de la que aprendí mucho y salí muy contenta."
good,"Not bad to work for. You get paid weekly and on time. No issues there. Where rhw problems fall are the 1st check you receive and w-2 forms. No one told me I'd receive a paper check in the mail 2 weeks later. They also take way to long to get you your w2 forms. They wait until the 31st to send them out. Way to procrastinate. . So if you don't mind waiting to do taxes, this shouldn't be an issue for you. I'm not that way though.  "
good,When i moved to Georgia it was the beat source for.employment.  I looked everywhere on my own which is hard when your not from here.. I found a job working with Google.that allowed me to travel.
good,"It is a good place to get professional experience. You get to work a regular 9-5 type schedule with weekends off. The management is good and they are there to help and give you insight on how to propel yourself into a new career. The best thing about this place is that the CEO himself will talk to you, and he makes the place very welcoming."
good,Manpower is a good start. The down fall is the client can let you go without notice. Even if your contract says a longer time. I enjoyed meeting new people and found the work challenging.
good,"Prise de poste"
good,Cette boite d'intérim et sympa et ma permis d'evoluer dans mes domaine de travail
good,I was with Manpower for over 4 yrs. My time with them was full-filling.  I very much liked the variety of work environments and job skills training that I had received.

good,"Buen Ambiente de trabajo, bienestar laboral apoyo del fondo de empleados incentivos"
good,"Se trabaja en equipo,  muchas cosas que aprender, agradecer lo aprendido durante estos años, volveria a trabajar para ellos."
good,I was not on many assignments through them before finding a permanent job but they were very helpful in helping to find me work that fit all my needs.
good,"A strong and well established company where the work would fall into given categories and tasks to carry out throughout the day. There is a lot of involvement and support from all the team in the entire life cycle."
good,"Es una empresa muy comoda para laborar, con un sueldo suficiente para lo básico, pero, esa misma comodidad te limita para avanzar, tuve compañeros de trabajo con más de 7 años en la empresa, con mucha experiencia, que se quedaron atorados con el puesto con el que ingresaron."
good,To begin with I really enjoyed working for Manpower but even more so for British Telecom. However I really started to feel that I was working more for a recruitment agency and not so much for British Telecom and it felt as though I couldn't progress.

good,"I absolutely loved this job and would've loved to continue working there.  However, the assignment ended causing me to no longer be employed there."
good,Working for Manpower wasn't the most pleasant situation to be in. Since it is a temp agency you never knew if you were going to get a phone call telling you that the place you had been working didn't want or need you anymore. The pay was a lot less than what the hired in employees were getting. One job I worked I was getting paid $8.25/hour and the hired in employees were easily making $10 or more an hour.
good,"Operated product equipment. Responsible for manufacturing assembly of product. Followed guidelines to insure product specifics are met. Knowledge and computer based programs. Report to management any delays. My day typically required time management and teamwork. If I had to say there were any difficult tasks, the most difficult would've been predicting the accuracy of the product. The most enjoyable part of the job was the cutting and re-assembling of the product."

good,I was employed for 15 years. The benefits are not great. My assignment was at IBM. IBM was a great place to work. The employees were really great. I learned alot working there.

good,this job was good . I has good working experice there. I learned a lot of new things that will build my experinces in the work force. 
good,the job changed day to day without a consistent workplace and management does not consider your best interest as an employee

good,This company will help you get into work locations but lacks basic employee relations skills. Does not loom out for the little guy but willing to give multiple chances to employees.
good,Not much to say! Supervisor always there for what ever you need. But the only thing its that its something temporary and when it ends you dont have nothing else.
good,"Where I was placed with Manpower, I was in an office environment and while the work I did was important, I wasn't paid much and it got very tedious after awhile. Steady job though."
good,Not sure where to start. The Staff got me to work right away and I always got paid on time.They have limited job assignments meaning not very many clients in the area where I was at.
good,Very good company.  Not just a temporary agency.  They look to place you in permanent positions.  Clients provide paid training that prepares you for you position.
good,"Flexible hours "
good,"Overall Work experience great and always interesting on what job might be next. It would be really nice to keep working and not ever worry about being laid off. I really enjoyed working with them except it takes 1,800 hours just to get holiday pay and they don't currently have vacation days that you can earn."
good,Found jobs at a okay rate could have been faster honesty toke them forever to find my a job after my last job ended and definitely could have better timing. The jobs they found were okay at best but could have been more different more are warehouses jobs.

good,A day at work consist of loading machines Once theyre running you would have maybe a 20 to 30 minute grace period. I learned how to complete paperwork using different math techniques. My coworkers were friendly. The hard part of the job was getting covered in stinky oil. and a lot of heavy lifting. I enjoyed the work and the 4 day on and  off work schedule.
good,Maintaining the ball mills for hours once they start it takes 16 hrs to complete. A little boring.

good,"This is a temp agency, and if you get hired on its a lot better. Your pay starts off at minimum wage, but then bumps about three dollars if you get hired on. A typical day at work was hard. Standing on your feet for 7 and a half hours then constantly using your fingers. The work was hard but if you work hard on the work it pays. My co-workers were friendly and it made everything go by fast."

good,I was a part time intern so it was hard for me to rate the benefits and job security aspects. The culture was nice it was a very small team and the boss was very nice.
good,Great experince and intresting getting to learn how to do mutiple jobs  and networking for full time positions from temp work. outside woking specifically asisting electricians and glass ware workers helping with home installments like showers and tall front and back doors. I learned how to dig over 4ft holes for water pipelines to go underneath and to work smart. Most fun i have working there is getting the ability to branch off by working at these different jobs to choose where i want to have a job. The toughest part of a job is trying to work at something i have no experince with until i train to the hang of the job and lift very heavy objects.

good,"After I awoke from a comma, I went to search for a job.  Manpower was one of the FEW choices that was open to me.  I really was not ready to be a part of the world, yet.  So, I can't remember very much.  And even if I could, the memories would be overshadowed with the anger I felt for getting into the situation I was in.  So, I don't think I'm qualified for this review."

good,Work schedule is a bit weird but learned about actual process of making quality metal and the elements involved.
good,Not too bad working for manpower. I just wish they either paid more or had more opportunities to work. Some places don't offer a lot of hours and some offer too many hours. So it's like a coin flip as to what you're gonna get.

good,Une bonne expérience pour un premier job.Malgré des horaires difficiles.
good,"I was sent to Conagra Foods in Dothan which was great. I usually was at the back of a big roaster pushing product through and conveyer belt. Many co-workers were very helping and others no so much being that I mostly worked with other temporary workers. The supervisor of Manpower workers at the time was very uptight about a lot. Anything Conagra supervisors told us was ok to do, she would fire people for doing and it could have been the smallest thing. The hardest part of the job was just not knowing really what you will be doing the next day because you are filling spots for people who are not coming in the next day or have been fired. The most enjoyable part of the job was really just doing what i had to do which was easy, because I was by myself for 8-12 hours a day."
good,This was not the greatest job i have had but it was ok.  I learned that people think that if they call customer service and make threats they usually get want they want.  All they have to do is esculate the call to the next level.  Working in the call center environment is not always the same for all call centers.  Cell phone call centers always deal with angry customers who beleive they should be reimbersed for their bad behavior because their phone had a issue.  The hardest part of the job is have to listen you people call you foul names and after awhile it does take a toll.   The most enjoyable part of the job was going home for the weekend.
good,"Aprendi del ambiente financiero, me gusto el ramo, muchos cobros no definidos para los clientes"

good,Working at Manpower will cause you to realize what climbing the corporate ladder is all about.  This is a fast-paced highly competitive work environment that will challenge you to the core.

good,Started my shift by picking up my pick tickets for day. I learned how to use the paper chute and the machine. The manager was very helpful. The people I worked with helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was traveling at night. I really enjoyed pulling orders.
good,Bounced around to a couple different companies. Was put right to work and had opportunities for permanent employment. Benefits confusing and complicated to get.
good,They just contract you to work at places. So far as I know there is no benefits or chance of pay raise. I had to go through Manpower to get my current contracting job at Centurylink where I was promised a full time position after 6 months and then told it wasn't in the budget any more.
good,I appreciate that they give you weekends off and the diversity that I encounter during my work experience. The co-workers are very welcoming and patient when it comes to trainning and I loved that.

The owner is very nice, but he has no idea how the employees are being treated by management. People that have been with the company for years are favored even if they are wrong."
good,"Work with Abbott Labs, on the production lines. learn MGPs and much more. I did enjoy with coworkers, but I need it a permanent job."
good,"Just your typical temp job. It has its ups and downs, but you get to work hands on with the machines at the company. It is also a steady 2 year job commitment."
good,"If you looking for quick employment and aren't picky about what type of job you get, this might be the place for you. They found me a job in two days."
good,"The fundamental idea of this organisation was to introduce people who had been out of work for over 12 months to learn certain jobs and give and hopefully create a certain work ethic. I felt that the initiative to train and find employment for these people was lost due to the fact that there was a slump in the job market and the jobs that did become available were advertised as ""experience required"""
good,Always found it refreshing .  Liked the change of pace on a daily basis
good,"Worked of Indiana Department or Revenue managed form orers."
good,"Royal deals with lots of items to to be sorted and so it is really a very busy place to work and very interesting place too. because its always from an agency its not always constant."
good,Learnt about Laptops and desktops and thier configuration and maintainence. Interacted with many customers 
good,it is very challenging and always finding out more about the job and the machines.The management are ok and my co-workers are very good and helpfull. The hardest part of the job is finding the faults of the machines.The most enjoyable part of the job is when the machine is up and running.
good,I would go in and clock in go to my section and get ready .
good,Manpower provided me with a temporary job that turned into a long term assignment. (2 years+) and would have continued as such until I left for a competitor in the industry who paid me 2x more with benefits.  There should have been a point where they hired me on full time after 2+ years but that was not the case.
good,Pay skill for experience worker pay was very poor. The assignment require you to do more than one job. But receive the same amount in hourly wages. The benefits/insurance was below average.
good,"lack of benefits was biggest issue, but the did find me a decent job. everyone knows that Manpower is an employment agency. what more is there to say?"
good,un emploi polyvalent ou les journées se suivent mais ne se ressemblent pas
good,"they will have you working construction for a week, then retail for a week. A few weeks in a factory working a line. or just some kind of general labor."
good,"Manpower is the connection for businesses and employees. Manpower sends people who meet certain criteria given by clients.  Sometimes, a lack of communication exists that can a person wrongly placed on a job."
good,"Fui contratado para cobrir uma licença maternidade, apenas o período de 09 meses, findou o contrato,e  me coloquei a disposição para novas oportunidades, uma vez que disseram que cumpri as atividades de maneira satisfatória e que correspondeu as expectativas da Empresa que contratou a consultoria, porém não obtive retorno."
good,You are assigned a job can very based on you skills and abilities jobs can range from a day to months' most jobs can turn into employment oppertunities.
good,It was very had to keep up with my schedule and my children going to school. Then when I worked at steal case tv he people the were not bnb understand with me then when your assignment ended that was it.
good,meeting nice people.learning the different programs. the commute was nice. always learning about the company. fun meetings and fellowship. some nice supervisors
good,This company allowed me to get experience at a manufacturing plant that created an opportunity for me to grow and become a supervisor and grow with more opportunities.
good,"i would work for/through them again,as soon as the temporary position was over they sent me to another location.they were supportive and willing to listen to any problems  a person may have with another worker or in their personal life."
good,"Worked with various companies as a clerk, data entry positions. From working in the court house, gas company and even at the cemetery. Shipping and receiving, faxing, developed great customer service skills and telephone skills."
good,"I never had a bad experience with the staff, they always found me work."
good,when hired I was told I would be hired on full time with CIOX health after the 1500hours needed to work  but after the 6 month mark that never happened
good,"Temp service, before being hired in as a full time employee. The typical workday was based on what the factory was working. Compensation was lower then full time employees although if you were hired in by company you were back payed."
good,"Working with Manpower was definitely an experience. They aren't the absolute best at getting back in contact with you after you've requested information and depending on the job you are given (as they are a temp agency) you may or may not have any job security. "
good,"Overall fair and pay rate was average. Most assignments pay rae did not match assignment's at the time of duties. Companies temporary assignment's worked had great opportunities for growth and advancement. However, temporary assignment took to long to convert to permanent assignment."
good,Appreciate work but according to work salary hike is not good as expected.so expected salary hike quite possible in this company. Otherwise it is good
good,"vendoor and security and housekeeping and technical handling and client sanctification"
good,I worked many temp jobs for Manpower. The only thing that I disagree with is these jobs can let you go for any reason they want but it is an easy way to make money fast.
good,Sent out on jobs for short periods of time. Did not always have another job to go around. The hardest is learning about a new company and their policies.
good,"Hope that you get chosen to go to a good place, otherwise, it can be a nightmare. One job I had, I cried when I had to leave because it was such an awesome place. The other, I tried to run as fast as possible because they were insane."
good,The management was great to work with although they were a temp agency.  They were flexible in their work locations and work hours.  Management were flexible for any missed time from work.
good,"It pays the bills, not much else. Steady work when you need any job. My job was easy, even if I feel disposable. Cant complain, it's a good fallback if you're in a pinch."
good,El empleo es muy bueno dan muchas ganas de superarse y se adaptan muy bien algunos horarios
good,"I did not interact with members of Manpower on a regular basis.  I worked on site at HP. Data entry of customers computer replacements. Very nice easy going job. Never had any issues with anyone on site, or at the Manpower offices."
good,"La mejor experiencia, lindos compañeros de trabajo, buen jefe en relación a permitir crecimiento laboral, retos a diario, volumen de trabajo, fue mi escuela en relación a Recursos Humanos."
good,Manpower was fine. Just a vehicle to get a job. The job they got me turned into a permanent position I loved at Wesco. Not much else to say about a temp agency. They did their job.
good,"En Manpower tuve la oportunidad de aprender una nueva área de trabajo como son los RRHH."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and always staying busy"
good,"The management could be better than it was, and they don't handle situations like they should. besides that the company is good good temp job its guaranteed good money if you get the hours they say you will receive"
good,"My job started mid morning with new orders, that needed to be ready before the UPS truck got there so they could be shipped, this had to be on time. Management gave orders to leads who controlled the work flow as co-worker drivers pulled orders and put away freight. The most complicated part of the day was finishing the afternoon orders. Working with a good team that new what they were doing."
good,"As this was a temp-agency I  was placed on several different assignments in which my responsible varied from answering multi lined phone system, emailing, copying, scanning, emailing, faxing, creating a monthly training calendar, assisting clients in signing documents for their real estate agent, collecting rent for land lords, assistant to the office manager."
good,"It was okay, could do better. Not really any advancement, or full time positions in the end. Mostly just temp jobs."
good,"learned various sorting procedures, pleasant, friendly staff and co-workers,"
good,"tried to work with you to get you employed "
good,"This job is very easy, however there is no room for advancement. There are absolutely NO benefits and the job is not career driven."
good,its like working for any other temporary employee company u call they find you a job
good,"It was ok at least it was employment, the pay was terrible but some of the jobs I enjoyed"
good,Assisting patrons with information and transition into the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program was rewarding.
good,"I was fortunate while I was with Manpower to have two lengthy assignments.  Being placed with Dane's brought me back to my roots in retail and its energetic pace.  After Dane's closed up shop, I fretted about how quickly a could get another assignment.  Luckily, the wait for another assignment was short.  I got to take pride in helping Thermionics put out a quality product that works as advertised."
good,"This short review is not of Manpower but Oliver Rubber. I had almost no face to face interactions with Manpower Inc. Oliver Rubber is a fast and efficient production plant creating various patterns of tire tread for assembly at another plant. To review the entire plant seems fruitless, but they are practicing continious improvement and quality of outgoing rubber is paramount."
good,"•Material handlers routinely pick up and move heavy objects"
good,I loved the job assignments I learned a lot and the experience  gained was immeasurable.
good,It was hard to keep a position. Most were short term. Would use them again.
good,"Seems like a decent place to get some temporary work such as at Sears,,Eatons, or  Hudson's Bay Company"
good,Worked in a leasing office with a multiple of 100 apartment units in 15 buildings in the downtown baltimore area. Collected rent and posted it to various accounts using the residents software system. Answering various questions from residents on a daily basis. answered phones and filed important documents using a filing system.
good,"This was a very pleasurable place to work for prior to the overturn of mangaement. This was a very profitable location, with opportunity for those that wanted to grow."
good,This was temporary position but I met a lot of people and helped alot of people
good,"Manpower as an employer, is good. The place I was employed by was a good company, good co-workers but was laid off for false reasoning."
good,At Manpower i did alot of different jobs. It was nice to be able to learn different things.
good,Productive with a medium pace.I learned how to assemble high tech machines .co workers worked in different areas .job was easy i enjoyed it. Getting to work was the most enjoyable.
good,"Great place to work with, very quick at finding the righ job for every individuals work experience."
good,"Each morning I would come in at 8, go through mail as well as faxes and sorted them into separate folders. Then I would take my work and go back to my desk and do scanning, data entry and batching."
good,Set period of time at minimum wage as it is contract work. No promise it will become full time. Apparently I have to give Manpower a higher rating in order for the system to accept it.
good,Great company to work for but they are behind in how much they pay their event staff. S14 is roughly $3-$6 less an hour than the other 5 event staff business i work for..
good,This data entry job is a quarterly position.  It required punctual and daily attendance.  Your productivity and being error free was a priority.  I have made several friends.
good,Easy to get hired but didn't really have support after hiring you. Didn't really have access to supervisor after hired. But the staff was really friendly
good,"The interview process is fairly simply as are the various methods of drug testing they use. The drug testing method they use depends on the job assignment so best advice is just not to do drugs and you'll have no worries. After the drug test process is completed, which is pretty much within moments because they do it on-site, you receive an assignment to start within a day or two."
good,"Manpower is a temporary staffing agency.  I was placed on an excellent assignment and was there for over 3 years.  I did a very good job but was let go because of other employees complaining to management about me with no backup to their claims.  I don't feel Manpower was investigative enough before releasing me from this assignment.  I had worked this ""desk job"" for over 3 years and now they won't place me due to some physical limitations on lifting and walking."
good,This is a temp service.  Pay is not the best but they do work you a lot of hours.  Not a lot of factories are hiring in this area.  You have better luck if you can drive a forklift.
good,I appreciate the quality of service in finding me jobs and letting me earn little money i can. Always on top of things in the office and answering any question i had about an job.
good,Manpower trouve des missons afin de ne pas être sans travail trop longtemps.
good,"is an agency were you can seek temporary jobs, sometimes those jobs decide for you to stay with them if you work good enough. They are good, they look for a position that best works fir you."
good,a typical work day is a lot of heavy lifting i learned how to drive fork truck and work on machines used by the plant the managment wasnt terrible at al very well put together place of work the hardest part of the job was lifting 100 lbs bags all day the most enjoyable part was great management
good,"arrived on the job on time"
good,"Manpower themselves were ok. The companies they sent you to work for, thats where things got interesting. I worked at a bee farm, at waubonsee community college, so many different places. It gets interesting for sure."
good,"I worked for Manpower at IBM. Although it was a very rewarding position, Manpower supplies a temporary workforce that's disposable. You are only needed as long as there is work to do."
good,"Poca formación a los nuevos integrantes , lo bueno es que pagan bien pero no te ayudan a mejorar como asesor y vendedor ."
good,"I went to Manpower to look for a job and they ended up hiring me to work for their office directly.  Unfortunately, they already had 2 other full time employees along with the manager, and didn't have enough work to keep me on their staff.  While I was there, I learned a lot and found it to be a great place to work."
good,They were always able to find a job for me. I was under the assumption temp to hire full time but none of the jobs offered that. The pay rate is too low for the cost of living.
good,My overall experience with Manpower has been good. I gained experience and am ready to further my career. They don't have many benefits but do have free online classes to expand your knowledge
good,"For helping me get temporary work, Manpower staff were very accommodating. My recruiter listened to my concerns when site staff were difficult, but did not intervene on my behalf, including when my job description and bosses changed without notice, to me or to Manpower; I was even ""fired"" by the site's HR as a mistake, without Manpower knowing, which led to lots of weekend phonecalls and panic on my part. When I asked for the same pay I got at that job for next ones, I was told they don't get such jobs/pay ranges often and have not heard from them since. My recruiter also left in the middle of my assignment and no one told me, so when I called with questions I got a new person and really missed my first contact there."
good,Contattata giornalmente per lavoro di mensa sulla città di Bologna
good,They helped me find a job quickly and as long as I agreed to have drug test and everything they placed me at a work place. Most of the jobs they have are production line jobs.
good,"Công ty có môi trường thoải mái, nhưng vấn đề là đổi ca liên tục làm không thích ứng kịp về đồng hồ cơ học"
good,"Work was ok, but does not give a notice when assignment is over, you go to the job and see your assignment has ended without even getting a courteous call."
good,"Great for young people who want experience the work force before choosing a career. Definitely not long term by any means. Sometimes the pay is good for the work and some times it isnt. But you should not look at the money from manpower, you should look for the experience."
good,Manpower has been for a long time in the Holland area leading as on of the top staffing agencies.  However with the workforce getting more demanding Manpower will need to compensate their employees with better incentives.
good,"Good Staffing Company that goes out to help you find the job or dream job that fits you, its just hard to find the right amount of money on most of their  jobs. But they are there to help ."
good,if you need temporary work until something permanent comes along this is the place to go. They have day-to-day and up to six month positions for different job experiences.
good,"-	Managed organization and processing of up to 300 orders a day."
good,"Manpower sends you to descent low paying jobs. However, there is no room for advancement. It's an okay place if you don't want to go nowhere in your career."
good,Manpower is a temp agency that provide jobs. Most jobs are temp to hire. If you work a contract job manpower will place you with ano there job promptly
good,Le seul problème avec Manpower c'est comme au change très souvent de suite aux besoins
good,"Es una ETT, no he tenido más trato con ellos que cuando llevaba los partes de trabajo y firmaba los contratos"
good,"Good to work for if you don't live on your own and rely on a constant paycheck. "
good,Various temp positions but no real chance for advancement or chance to be hired on dull time with the companies that you work for. Competive pay but no paid sick days or vacation days
good,"it depends because its a temp agency"
good,"While working here it was really hard to balance having a wife and kids and pulling the hours required by the job. If injured you will be terminated immediately. Bit the supervisors do care, they just can't do anything to protect you."
good,"Temp job working on industrial heating elements of all sizes, some were military specs and you had to conform to heat numbers,lay out to 1000th of an inch and follow procedures."
good,I enjoyed working at Hopebridge through Manpower but the management at Hopebridge was sub-par. The pay was good and the atmosphere was great. It was really an overall good experience.
good,"The assignment I worked was good. The office people that was from Manpower were not very professional.When assignment was over could not reach office to get another assignment. It was not just me , others complained of the same, no one answered the phones or returned messages."
good,Working with them was always a very exciting challenge and I was very good paralegal because we were always very busy just to finish their work and we rested for 2 days but it was always very good work with them
good,"Manpower offers many places to work and competitive pay. You never know what you might end up doing at a job, which is exciting. The hardest part of the job would have to be that you may not get any advancement and be without a job at the end of three months."
good,"Working with Manpower I ran across a lot of different company's, some of them was hard work that I never experience before so I learned a few things with them. Then there was some company's that was easy work an fun overall."
good,"Good Company to work for. Management can be better. "
good,"Trabalhei no Período das Olimpiadas Rio 2016, foi um excelente aprendizado."
good,"Ability to find a job is simple. Just takes a phone call and you have one lined up most of the time, however they leave out information and miss answer questions concerning the job that is misleading just to get you in. They are willing to work with people on a personal level."
good,"A typical day at work was answering phones, filing, taking inventory, calling, on a regular basis, the company I was an accounts rep for. Greeting customers and cleaning."
good,"I've worked at a few temporary agencies but manpower is one of the better. They have a nice atmosphere, but it's a temporary agency so no job is ever guaranteed."
good,had an enjoyable experience on the sites I was sent to will always call when in need of employment  they keep in contact with you while working at a site
good,"Permet une véritable découverte de différents univers professionnels, des durées de missions très variables et un vrai suivi des intérimaires."
good,"Un día típico es relajado sin que nadie te moleste."
good,"je travaillé souvent"
good,"I enjoyed the people i work with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning. I felt the leader was great as well. He know all his employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections. Dealing with the unsatisfied customers are really the hardest part of the job but I handled it in a very good ways. The most enjoyable part of the job is, I resolved what could be difficult situations and I have learned to effectively understand and resolved customer issues."
good,"mi primer conocimiento a la vida laboral,,"
good,"Experiência positiva relativamente à aquisição de competências de comunicação, trabalho em equipa, capacidade de argumentação, capacidade de lidar com stress."
good,"I did light industrial work. I worked on a pack line and skid loaded. "
good,"One of the better temporary services I have worked for. They did a decent job of finding me work. Communication was clear and concise. I only worked 1 job for them. I stayed at this job (on and off) for about 3 years. Management was ok even though it changed hands during my time there. The hardest part was getting hired for a permanent position on a job. The most enjoyable part was working in an air conditioned factory, for a company that treated its temporary workers fairly close to its permanent, full-time employees."
good,"prise de poste à 7h30"
good,"Trabajo, tranquilo, no tenia mucha interacción con los demás, porque todos están concentrados en lo suyo."
good,"The work can range from easy to extremely hard. Nevertheless you can only work if you are there before the office opens. It may call for picking up trash, bottles, and digging trenches."
good,"great company to go to when you need work quick! downside is work is often temporary, temp to hire with little to no chance of being hired on or contract work so when their contract is up with the company so are you."
good,"Manpower is a temp agency that operates to place those without jobs in quick, typically simple jobs for anywhere from a day to a year. Some companies that contract with Manpower occasionally hire the temps into their company. "
good,"A parte difícil de trabalhar na Manpower é que eu sempre ficava como temporária e sendo assim havia pouca confiança em meu trabalho."
good,i worked in the freezer 35 degrees but i learned ho to make salads and my co-workers were very nice. the most difficult part of my job was working in the cold. over all it was a good job
good,Place in jobs for there fit. Looking for temp to hire and have not been placed in either position. Send out to position that pays less then qualifications.
good,"I worked extremely hard and was underappreciated and looked over when times came for promotions, despite speaking up for myself."
good,Good work environment.Reponsible for the loading and unloading of products for phizer.Also maintaing of cleaniness of warehouse floor.The management was very nice and polite to any needs of the workers. There were no hard parts of the job everybodyworked togeher as a team to help each other.The most enjoypart of th.e job was the job itself it was most enjoyable.
good,"Sempre tinha problemas No BH"
good,Manpower was a temporary job establishment and they were and okay place to work for. I worked at Toyota Motor Manufacturing. I learned about building engines and all that goes into the manufacturing of an engine. I worked very long hours and the pay was great 60 plus hours a week most weeks. I did not mind working that many hours and still do not but the working environment was horrible. Being in a temporary position was hard because there was a lot of temporary workers there and i was very cut throat. It was very hard to work with people that was always looking to get others in trouble to get a step ahead. The management was good at toyota and the pay was great but if you ask me if I would recommend somebody to go and work there I would say its not for me. The best part of the job was the pay. I would work for less to be on a work team because there it was all about yourself there was no team.
good,"bons colegas, viagens agradáveis, serviço de fácil realização, sem contato com a diretoria"
good,It is nice when they get you a position but recently I have got nothing from them and you need to keep applying on the website hoping someone will contact you.
good,6 meses en esta ett con la ke empece en outeiro de rey.pues con ellos estube contento.
good,"même si l interet des diverses missions n'etait pas toujours très intéressantes, elles m ont toutefois permises de travailler ce qui est déjà très intéressant."
good,"The position was Industrial Cleaner...it was great, but I lost my job there because my supervisors gave me bad directions to the smoking area and I was booted off site for smoking in the wrong place. They cost me my job there making $600/week and never even took responsibility for it, even though they told me to go there! I should have ratted them out because while I was getting in trouble they were siting in the vehicles smoking in the parking lot...a big no-no! I could have joined them in their vehicle and not been caught lol. BUT, I was trying to do the right thing. It definitely backfired on me!"
good,la meilleure dans son domaine bon comité d entreprise bonne renumeration
good,Not enough shifts unfortunately. A large number of temporary jobs often single day placements.
good,"I love working for manpower but because it is a temp agency. It is hard to find employment that is more perment. But working with manpower and the different companies, i have meet a lot of people and learned a lot of different kinds of job experince"
good,"Manpower has kept me working but it has been my hard work and dedication to my job that has allowed me to grow my skills as a professional.  While I have been lucky with my assignments, Manpower doesn't offer much in the way of benefits - vacation time has been taken away, health insurance offered is of low quality and expensive and while they do offer job training, it is something that is not openly offered, I had to make several phone calls and be transferred numerous time, sometimes back to the same person/office, to get the details and access to their on-line training.  However, for the most part, the Manpower employees that have managed my contract have been nice people."
good,manpower is a wonderful place to work for.I enjoy working for manpower.

good,"Uma empresa muito boa,salário razoável,sem chance nehuma de crescimento."
good,I would stuff frozen foods into boxes to be shipped out to customers. It was a good job with plenty of breaks. We would work an hour then take thirty mintues break for the whole shift no matter if it was an hour day or a 12 hour day.
good,Good company to work for if you are looking to get back into the workforce or are a student looking to make some money.
good,"They are had to work for, because it take awhile to find work with them. When you get placed in a job it will keep you busy."
good,Placed at Valspar Corporation as a Customer Service Representative.
good,I would come to work and sort through collored and white paper. I learned how to operate pretty heavy and dangerous machinery. The management was the worst part about this job. The co-workers were not any better. The hardest part was cleaning up at the end of the day. The best party was operating the shredder.
good,this company likes to hire people and then fire them just because they want to hire more. they are very in consistent on things.
good,"Bom para ganhar experiência, pois o funcionário trabalha prestando serviços à outras empresas"
good,"this was a temporary assignment, fun while it lasted and would recommend this agency"

good,"A little stressful but good company if you can enhance your skills and grow. It is fortune 500 company spread over in multiple countries. it was good experience working here. "
good,"Meet new people, have new job opportunities just need more consistency and more hours and then more money  for the jobs at least I’ve been working with  although it has been nice to have an opportunity to be with working people who have been there for me and as hard of workers as I try to be"
good,Like working with manpower they got me working pretty quick decent pay I would have liked to work a lot longer but you know Temp places they do have a lot of opportunities for everybody who's qualified
good,"They have good assignments, but don't usually last long. Think they should pay more. They send you to some great places to work and gain experience in various areas."
good,"It is a great place to work. You learn a lot about health insurance, They have a great cafeteria. Sometimes it is hard to figure out why a claim rejected."
good,Manpower is a nice job if the work was everyday the things i liked the most were the people that makes the team.I would tell friend's about this job if they're looking for work
good,Manpower was a good employer to wotk for.the work was stable and the pay not bad.they also worked with you any problems that you had.even though some of the jobs werr temporary they woild have you on another job pretty quickly.
good,Sa fait très longtemps depuis 2011 donc je me souviens pas tout
good,Working for Manpower was a temporary experience. It helped me get started with my work life when I moved to Virginia from New York. I enjoyed my time working with the company.
good,"This was a great way to gain some experience. Their wasn't always work. But when their was, it would last for about a week to a couple of weeks. I loved this job."
good,"ManpowerGroup is a recruiting agency that hires people for various jobs. I remodeled a Walmart for example. It was pretty fun, I got to work with friends and laid-back teamleads. I learned how to properly install fixtures in retail settings and glass cases and so forth. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. Some days you'll spend the majority outside throwing unused or old metal fixtures into a recycle bin. The most enjoyable part was the atmosphere and ability to be assigned different tasks from other employees if they see your potential to do more advanced tasks."
good,"werk bij cliënt van Manpower, nauwelijks contact met contacpersonen"
good,"this is a temp service so all jobs are different depending on what you want to do and currently available jobs, its not permanent but they can place you in a job that can become perm."
good,They have handled the job losses within the company very badly. Employees have had to wait weeks to find out whether they still have a job. i feel as if they havent done enough to think of peoples feelings and the reaction of being told that there jobs are on the line.
good,i was contracted through manpower for general electric building pump jacks in south texas it was such a smooth transition working for them and reporting in through GE i never had any issues
good,"Hired for part time but always worked full time. Temp to hire after 450 hours. I was only there 2 or three weeks and the temporary employees started to be reduced. Went from 5,  8 hour days to 4, 10 hour days. As a way to cut cost? There seemed to be a major efficiency  problem. I spent too much time sweeping because of the efficiency."
good,"travail varie avec la distribution du courrier, des colis et aussi de la pub"
good,Nei posti di lavoro forniti alla Manpower ho appreso le tecniche di imballaggio dell'alluminio più l'utilizzo del carroponte

I've been there three years and they have done me fair there great people to work with i'm grateful they gave me the jobs to help me stay out of trouble and to hold down a nice apartment.
good,"Working for manpower is ok, I have a good assignment, but disappointed that my assignments have been positions with no possibility of permanent placement."
good,Because there are so many companies in the Bangor area using temp agencies for labor there is a good chance you will get a job the day you walk in their door
good,I was pleased with their effort to find an assignment quickly for me. They also really made an effort to match my skills with an opening they had available. I absolutely loved the assignment and was very sad when it ended. I have continued to look for employment opportunities that may have opened with that company.
good,"* I lived in Indiana and my job was very far from where I lived."
good,Good company when looking for a job position quickly.They do look out for your best intentions. Never had a problem with being paid on time.And always check up on seeing how your doing.
good,"working for manpower at Amway you spend time on a line i.e. Putting bottles on the line, caps/plugs on bottles and placing bottles in the carton sometimes packing. As a skid loader you supply the line and put the boxes on the skid. Over all it's not a hard job, the most enjoyable part would be the people you work with."
good,Personal competente. Era la única manera de acceder al cliente.
good,"Great work schedule m-f no weekends but they pay is low and the hours are not always guareented. The call center enviornment is very basic get in, get the job done, get out. There is no culture to make the employees want to stay. It is an easy job but tends to get boring after awhile. The health insurance is the lowest insurance you can get and barely covers anything, there is dental insurance but I did check it out. that was it for benefits."
good,the culture there was nice. The real problem is the lack of benefits and pay after a year of working there you are allowed a week of unpaid vacation. The health insurance offered there is laughable.
good,"tiene buena representación de los ejecutivos de cuenta por parte de manpower, pero los supervisores no eran muy empíricos"
good,"I enjoy what I do. But Manpower is hardly involved with the employees, other than announcements. Benefits are lacking, I think they can offer better coverage."
good,"The office is always a great place to be, but is a very busy work environment. I thoroughly enjoy the work I do, but am looking for a job with advancement opportunities."
good,Usually have multiple jobs available and will place you quickly into a temp position.  Agents are very nice and knowledgeable.  Also will have you best interests in mind.
good,"all wearhouse work sanitation  platelet jack's loading and production-work shipping & receiving. Line work assembling 40 hour a week 12-10 over time work sanitation work also,"
good,I worked there as an Office Operative and worked with a number of clients including BT and Nat West Bank and I was given a number of responsibilities and projects
good,Manpower had me a job the day that I went in.  They are a great company to work through.  The location that I was placed at has very little room for advancement when placed as a temporary employee.
good,"BT was an fun company to work for. Met a lot of good people and friends i will remain in contact with."
good,I love the people at manpower but I worked at Eagle Butte mine as a temp.  I drove a 793 haul truck and I enjoyed my crew.  It was hard hours but it had a good atmosphere and I miss my coworkers.
good,"never knew where you'd work or for whom.  needed steady income with benefits. one day count inventory, next count orders & figure percentages for potato chip route driver, pack orders for different stores from main warehouse. or nothing!"
good,Did not really look at all of my experience to find me a better paying job.  Gave me the first available and when I phoned them they kept telling me they had no other open positions.
good,This location is the reason for lack of jobs. I also believe the environment not the company has a lot of discrimination issues within the community.Manpower has a great staff that is willing to place you with work if you want to work. This company also has authority to fight for you if you feel your being discriminated against.
good,"Productive work place on assignments given. Good work environments, good pay rate, and friendly staff. The job assignments I got placed on mostly were light industrial."
good,"It is a field work "
good,I have done this kind of work for several years. You have to be a self starter and multi-task very well. You have to be a people person and cannot bring anything personal into this job.  The best part of my position is to see someone better themselves and know that I helped. I love the trust that our clients and associates place in me.
good,"Temporary employment, good company to establish skills in assembly of switches for the aviation sector. Good people in training positions to help train emplpyees."
good,Good management quick job placement wish the job was temporary where they placed me they try hard to get you placed ina job quickly and offer competitive wages i liked the job i had and wish i could go back
good,Como era una compañía contratistas no Tube relación directa con ellos
good,"I like the staff. However, I didn't know much about the benefits.I enjoyed the company they set me up with as the staff was helpful and friendly and I learned a lot."
good,Great company . However needs to find more jobs for people an more money with benefits .they need to return employee phone calls as well. an they under staff
good,The assignments overall were good.  Reputable companies with great safety cultures.  Was a great way to improve my skills in different sectors without job-hopping to do it
good,"At my last assignment, there was times when the general manager would come to work two hours after everyone else. He clearly had his favorite employees and didn't hide it at all. So many time I would go to the bathroom and someone would be in there crying because of something he said."
good,"The company that I worked for was NAMECO. The workday was predictable. I was a line worker. Our job did not deviate. Whatever you were trained to do, that's what you did. Day in. Day out"
good,"Typically reported to companies to work on contracts."
good,Flexible and understanding I've worked for Manpower on and off over the past 3 years. They have kept me busy wit Eaton Corp. has much as possible.  I have been called back 4 times know and still there.
good,They helped get me a job at AIS Research. And now I have a job there and have been there for over 6 years. They paid me on Fridays which it was nice being paid every week
good,I like working with Manpower. The only thing that needs improving is communication. I never hear from my manpower supervisor even when I am trying to get in touch with her.
good,"I was able to find a job when I needed, but no other employment was found when the job I had been working ended under false circumstances, there was no support after the loss of my job."
good,"Muy buenas condiciones laborales, pero las oportunidades de estabilidad no se ven reflejadas en el esfuerzo que pone el trabajador cada día, e incluso pueden ser solo 3 días de trabajo y para la casa."
good,"The hardest part is keeping a job. Since your employer never has to tell you anything directly you can be out of work very suddenly, sometimes for weeks."
good,La verdad que si me gusto formar parte de nestle lo malo q no hay estabilidad laboral llegas a tus 3 años y te liquidan
good,Got me started with Honeywell.. started at Honeywell and it was a very clean location very close to where I live.... I would definitely work for Manpower again if I had the chance to....
good,"Working through manpower can be a great to get work when you need it. The downside is that the campaigns are very unpredictable. You can be laid off before you have acquired enough working hours to receive unemployment benefits. This happened to me right before Christmas one year and was very difficult to bounce back. Overall it still is a great option due to their commitment to employee safety, and they also pay weekly."
good,came in a pulled my orders for the day. depending on the job that was handed to me. I had various jobs for this company so there would be times were I would change positons.
good,Limited exposure over devices. Whatever the projects we used to have we follow with the guidelines which somewhere is monotonous we dont have that much of exposure what a Engineer must opt for.
good,"i always had the people and support to do my job day to day, if the customer needed me to add or remove personal i had the support from management to do it."
good,I went to school for Graphic Communications so this was on the lines of what I went to high school for.  I bindery was very physical and kept ya busy most of the day.  The hardest part of the job was it was second shift and I felt like I was alone for the most part.
good,En fonction de l'endroit où nous sommes envoyés travailler tout change
good,Manpower use to keep me working steady  but now I'm not getting any hours. This is disappointing. Wish I could be assigned to positions that have the potential for permanent placement.
good,Washed down machines that sweet potatoes came through. Easy job but I got let go because I got sick. I learned you have to work fast and stay on point with your work.
good,I would go back again general labor it was a fun place to work for nice people my surroundings very safe the very productive all as far as work
good,I usually had a good day. For me its the people that make the job. In this case the people I worked with were awesome and made the day go by quick and the work was fun. I learned how to move quickly and efficiently without mistakes. The quality from me was what was expected and a lot of times more because we were always needing to exceed the usual demand for the job and I was successful at playing me role on the team to make sure fulfilled our quota and I believe for me that was the hardest part because the quota was raised due to a bigger demand for the product.
good,I enjoyed working for Manpower. They are attentive to their employee's career goals. I learned valuable skills to apply across a diverse genre of positions. Management was sometimes challenged to be cohesive.
good,Excepto por la nueva persona que se hizo a cargo en ese entonces.
good,"Fun, energetic and great working environment. I learned a lot about the mail room process and the supervisors were very friendly and helpful."
good,"it's a temp service so i didn't really learn a lot, not good communication between temp associate, and staff , client. manpower still owes me money from my previous assignment"
good,"They are pretty good about your salary and giving raises, but they have no benefits, i.e. Vacation, sick time."
good,"No benefits at all .Because I was working for that agency for few months.What i remember ,the people I work with was amazing."
good,"Provided a great working environment no matter where help was needed. learned how to work with different personalities of people, Co workers were pretty decent people. There was nothing hard about any assigned job that was given. Most enjoyable event was taken care of the workload for the dat."
good,"adorei trabalhar como empregada de balcão para a ManPower , descobri que é das funções que nunca tinha exercido mas que passei a gostar imenso ."
good,"Staff is friendly and nice to work with, however staff does rotate quite often.  That makes it hard to establish personal relationships for the work force."
good,I worked a lot of one day jobs and temporary jobs. They always had a job for me to work and they were always understanding if I had to turn down a job.
good,Large US based company. All decisions are made in and from the US that impact Canada. Learned a lot and meet so many amazing people!
good,"show up for work , sit down  in your dept.     open mail up and sort in correct area ."
good,Working on a housing project as well as keeping track of incoming invoices and sending to the correct department for payment.
good,I think over all the temp Company was pretty good. The most enjoyable part about work was running and troubleshooting and clearing jams. My co-workers were wonderful it felt like I had a family away from home. I learned how to run a variety of different machines and I learned to run them really good and how to troubleshoot the machines well. Also the wonderful inter workings of the machines them selves. Management was great they now there job and they do it very well. The hardest part was maybe some of the change overs don't go as well as you would like at times.
good,Great company to work for as far as benefits.  On-Site manager selection was very biased and the opening was never posted so that the selection process was not fair.  Poor management of the on-site team.  Manager was very critical and negative to selected employee.
good,"Worked edge wrapping/ final assembly"
good,"mise sous plis des enveloppe électorale"
good,It was a hard job but worth it. I loved going to work everyday!
good,Responsible for overseeing all operations pertaining to receiving all incoming shipments inventory and expense.  I have learned how to better manage others by leading a group of two or more attendants under my managers encouraging leadership and knowledge.
good,"Due to the nature of Manpower Temporary Services, work was always a new adventure.  Although I provided administrative assistance at my placements, the work environments were vastly different.  All my co-workers and management were welcoming and supportive.  I always approached my assignments with the mindset that I was an active and participating employee - not just filling a space."
good,Scanning boxes and putting security tags on clothes throughout the day.   I learned how to scan boxes and also that in factory work you have to be mentally and physical tough.  The manage was horrible because they didn't really listen when you had a problem.  The hardest part about the job was being there early in the morning.  The most enjoyable part was being able to listen to your own music while working.
good,"decent job, pretty easy work. alot of hours, very busy. alot of product that needs to be done on time."
good,I typical work day I come in to my desk and take calls over the radio to help Material Handlers with parts in oracle system. I use the system to adjust floorstocks and to see how many engines take the part the Material Handler calls about. Also I drive a fork lift when need to linestock. I have learned how to use the oracle system very well and I work well with all of my co-workers. The most enjoyable thing about my job is that get to communicate with the almost every one in the plant because if a part is need to be ordered from our warehouse I am the only one on my shift that can do it.
good,manpower was a great place to work for. the hardest thing was that i never stood at one place for too long since its an agency where they have many contracts. but over all they always made sure i had work.
good,"Todo muy bien"
good,I have good co-workers. They took me under their wings and are great. My days are busy on the phone and computer satisfying our customers
good,Arrive at 7am for the start up meeting were you learn all the new posts of job openings to updated safty matters.7:30am we are all asigned to our set locations on the Proctor & Gamble site. Management comes around often to check that everything is all right and if you need any help with your particular task.We break at 9am 12pm 2pm and 4pm in break rooms or set smoke areas for all employees. The hardest part of the day happens if the line isn't running correctly then the work that is required to do is now doubled. It all pays off because the weekly check is what keeps you going.
good,"I enjoy working for this company, but there are not enough hours for me."
good,Hard to put into words because I never worked very long at any of the jobs I was placed into.
good,"Un lugar lleno de modernidad, donde se tiene contacto con todo tipo de clientes, desde las personas mas humildes, hasta las personas con mas oportunidades, un trabajo que te da la oportunidad de desenvolverte en un ambiente divertido, ya que todo te lo enseñan se una manera facil y practica, sin embargo, lo único que no era agradable era trabajar ads ourcing, ya que no te da una seguridad laboral, las prestaciones no son redituables, y aunque se agradece bastante la oportunidad, es necesario establecer metas y lo que se pretende a un largo plazo, busco un empleo con mas estabilidad laboral"
good,"travail en équipe"
good,"What can I say, they provided me a job when there was none available. "
good,"I would package product, clean, co-workers were great to work with, management was not all that great but kept me busy. Hardest part of the job was cleaning the freezer. most enjoyable was learning new things."
good,"No room for advancement. Temporary work only no chance to become a permanent employee. No vacation, sick days or vacation / sick pay."
good,"I haven't had any luck with finding permanent employment with Manpower; however, they were very professional and nice to me.  The fact that they offer insurance to part-time employees is very nice."
good,"Atendimento ao solicitante de visto, não temos função específica. Ganhei a cada dia mais experiência no atendimento ao cliente, convívio direto com pessoas, resolução de problemas. Gerência engajada em melhorar a cada dia a empresa que têm apenas 1 ano de atividade.Colegas de trabalhos em sua maioria desmotivados pela falta de oportunidade de crescimento.O trabalho em si não é difícil e o que é agradável é quando o solicitante sai satisfeito com o meu atendimento. "
good,"un lieu de travail agréable, des collègues et une ambiance studieuse"
good,Aprendi mucho de mis compañeros y de las personas con las compartia mi trabajo
good,"I did the same job, as I worked for Schindler Elevator. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. When Schindler laid me off, due to outsources to Thailand. I was called back, but as a temp. It was understood that Schindler would be the only job I would work for Manpower. When Schindler finally closed the plant down, they offered me the chance to go to school. I took that option. The hardest part of my job was having to give it up."
good,They had some good jobs but not enough on going work. Went away for work once. Good people to work for and with
good,"I had to learn that working for a Temporary Agency can have its up's and down's. Temporary Agencies are quick in job placements but what I had to learn is that although the agency is placing me at a site does not mean that its permanent. Some people rely on Temporary agencies to go out and find there job for them, NO! You have to work and be willing to show that employer, just like if you got that job on your own. That your willing, able and ready to work. Although, I feel some people go through temp services because there too lazy and not ambitious enough to find something on there own. And there are some that rely on the temp service because of a job loss or layoff and is in need of something else right then and there. Temporary Agencies does have there good and bad opportunities, but overall Temporary Agencies are there for job placements."
good,Working 60 or 38 hours weekly in rotation. I will give you quality over quantity any day.
good,work was very hard and never learned whatever job I was doing to feel comforable doing.
good,Very good. They offer all different types of training and have state of the art equipment. They are flexible with working hours.
good,"Manpower is a temp agency, they got me started with Thunderbird Mountain. I have no real complaints. I appreciated the work put out by the agency to to help me perform the jobs that i was assigned to."
good,Only down side was no decent insurance. Enjoyed department at Duke I was placed in for 3 years very much.
good,I was responsible to get material needed for production by using forklift and computer database.I learned how to deal with situations under pressure and working with my co-workers even if they werent on the same page as i was.The hardest part was that i was not properly trained and i had to figure out things on my own.I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing that production was ran smoothly.
good,"mise en boite de cartouches pour bv, etiquettages ,remplissages des cartouches d'encre"
good,"My day starts with preparing my workstation for a non-stop 10 hour day. It is necessary to have my computer ready with all needed programs running. I must have an organized work place because I do so many different tasks, multi-tasking is a must. In addition to our current client schedule, we also offer a walk-in service to those that need immediate assistance. I give instructions for paper work that needs completion and determine whether or not a fee is required. I make sure that all appointments are seen in a timely manner. I provide a first contact for service that is pleasant, helpful, courteous and professional. I feel that ""all clients are important and they need to feel important."" While attending to our clients, I process files via the proper procedures as required. I also respond to supervisor requests in a timely manner. The incoming calls are constant and I answer them with the proper professional ettiquette."
good,"I liked the job, they placed me at alcon. it was temporary so it was not always steady work. The day went by fast because you stayed busy."
good,Great management team. Worked as a contractor for IBM for a little over a year.
good,i was a laborer and machine operator...
good,waited to see if they had any jobs to do. working for different places and getting to meet different people.
good,Manpower is an excellent company to work for as a stepping stone to receive full-time employment at companies that require their employees to work as temps first.
good,"Good place to get experience. Fair pay. Interesting position. No pay for holidays. "
good,"Payroll messed my tax deductions have a letter from HMRC year later to stating manpower has under paid on all weekly wage slips there increasing my tax deductions for the next 12 months to correct manpower's mistake would of thought a organisation like this would be able to get this right first time "
good,Overall ok if you like to start your day very early. It's easy to learn and adapt to the environment. Some supervisors are very helpful and understanding.
good,"services was hired temp to end work. completing conferenced involved multiple supervisors communicated with out involment of situation, an 5 week assignments is a very fast postion during busy hours lunch @ dinner breaks not to comfusing teaching is ajustible easy learning cool humidity over time on weekends."
good,Es una agencia de empleos la cual tienen convenio con grandes empresas reconocidas.
good,"Väldigt skoj att då åka runt till olika arbetsplatser och lära sej nya saker"
good,"The schedule is hard and the hours are long for the assignment I was on. Many different opportunities available, pay depends on the contract, Work hard and get rewarded."
good,"Manpower is a good place to work if you want to try a different career path, however the assignments may not be long or they may only need you to cover for someone else."
good,"Fast paced, easy work, better than most warehouse jobs. You apply one day next day you’ll have a full time job the only thing I don’t like is it’s not a lot of Job offers to choose from. And the job I liked don’t last year round"
good,I love every position that I did through this company.  I just wish I have the ability to get hired with some of the companies I worked for.  I was call back twice to work for the same company.
good,"Honestly abgreat place to start off at! They always work with you in whatever way they can, and they'll even help you find a job that can hire you on after a while."
good,"sono professionali e competenti, ma sono intermediari e basta."
good,Manpower is a good source for temporary employment. The staff is friendly with a relaxed atmosphere. Job placement is quick and easy. Workplace placement  is a smooth transition.
good,"The company was a good company to work for, but as it was agency work, it was a little sporadic. Much of my work load was sorting through files and preparing them for scanning onto a database."
good,"it was not a bad place to work for and had no problem getting hours, plus it was a good learning experience, we were working at s.c.Johnson witch was awesome"
good,Temps get no double time on Sundays. Only time in a half after 40 hrs. Regular time on holidays. Worked 7days a week since i started there at dana. They are very strict.
good,"I have worked here for 10+ years and it is steady, enjoyable employment.  Things are always busy, and we are kept up in the flux of things.  There is never a dull moment."
good,It was a cool temp service to work for gave me some pretty good jobs overall but the one i would have liked to be permanent was only a temp position that came around every so often which paid really swell.
good,I get sent to different places. So i never know where im gonna be. They change it daily to weekly to monthly per where im needed. Its a good place to go when you are in need of work but i am looking for something permanent and with better pay and benefits.
good,"Cela n'inclut pas que des avantages."
good,I actually worked at Litehouse but it was through Manpower and thats who paid me. Only was employed for over a month because of some personal life issues that came to surface.
good,"I have learned a lot while working at Manpower.  I love that they keep me working, I have learned quite a bit with them and I really love that they keep me working"
good,War sehr postitiv überrascht hab eine schöne Zeit dort gehabt.
good,There are many different positions provided by Manpower some are fast-paced and others are slower but it really comes down to where your assigned and what that assignment has you doing.
good,I think they could have helped me out by contacting other Manpower offices to help find me a job.  They did not seem real interested in helping me out.  They seemed more busy trying to find people to work in factories.
good,"I was hired in by an old co-worker of mine, so I felt at the time pretty good about it, but once I got in, I did shift my opinion a little. I like the work, loved the people, my manager was the bomb, but time off sucks, as it's unpaid, and if you run out, say if you get sick, etc. Then you are out the door. Also, the pay is kinda iffy, you tap out at $12/hr if your lucky. The last thing that bugged me a bit, is the policy on errors......it's not very forgiving......"
good,"Arrive at 6am everyday . Start work right  away  and move product to station to station .  Labeling , packaging and stacking.  End work day at 3:00pm."
good,Road side assistance relies on Tow Providers being on time to the customer which I had no control over so I did not like relying on others to assist the customer. Some were stranded much longer than the tow provider quoted. Sometimes they did not want to assist due to claims that they were not paid.
good,"bonne expérience"
good,les salaires sont bas pour les compétences et les savoirs- faire exigées
good,They found me a job fairly quick. they stood behind there employees. always available to answer questions. pay was reasonable for a temp agency and if u needed time off you just had to ask in advance unless emergency.
good,"They provided what I need at the time. Helpful. This was a temporary agency that handled my payroll when I came to them with a job.I worked for another company, as a temp, through them."
good,"They have lots different jobs pending on the market. The handlers work hard with you. They friendly and you can get different types of jobs. I did sales , paperwork , installing , and meter reading."
good,Es un ambiente q se puede trabajar tranquilo muy estable. Las personas muy amables
good,"Overall it was a nice place to work. They found a job for you quickly and the pay was decent. The warehouse hours were long, but the atmosphere was very warm and welcoming."
good,My time at each establishment was educational and inspiring and at times rewarding but sometimes stressful especially the care roles in acute situations
good,"Since this is for multiple instances of working Preventative Maintenance at varying hospitals, the real oomph of the experience varies based on the location you end up working at."
good,A typical temp agency. Manpower brought in people from outside to work as a temp. It usually hard to get converted to full time. The benefits of a temp agency are not good.
good,"All the positions I maintained with Manpower were temp positions in warehouses and factories so I'm not sure about other types of positions but my experiences were pretty good. Any issues I had at those jobs had more to do with the company I was contracted under than anything Manpower itself did wrong."
good,"It's been a great job with great co-workers"
good,I was placed on several long term government assignments with Manpower while in and after graduating undergrad. It was great exposure! They Kept me working!
good,Prestaba mi servicio en Afore Banco era y ahí el trato con el cliente era lo más importante como cierre de metas
good,"Working for a different companies, and very flexible hours.  The only drawback was the assignments were short term and  the pay was barely minimum wage."
good,Overall a great place to have a jump start in the work force. Would highly recommend for anybody that needs a job. The coworkers at times can be annoying and the management can be a bit sloppy at times but other than that it was pretty ok
good,There was no typical day. One day I could be assembling packets. Another day would include packaging and fulfillment. Management gave brief instructions and allowed me to work at my pace. The haradest part of the job was the boredom from repetition.
good,"It was a great learning experience.  I made some friends, but didn't ultimately find a permanent job.   I decided to go back to school to get a better degree."
good,"This is a temp agency I work for, I am just trying to find full time employment. They do there best at placing you with a good company, the company Merck that I was placed in happened to put a,cap on their hiring, so I had no chance of getting hired on."
good,It has room for improvement but not a bad place to find work. They listen to you as a person to find jobs that fit your abilities. I believe they lack on the pay scale for today's bills and necessities but they can only pay according to the job they are hiring for. All and all it isn't a bad place to find work.
good,"Buen sueldo, más sin embargo desglose de nóminas no claros."
good,I do not like to disparage the place I am working. But it was better than being drug by a nuclear submarine. the job was very casual mostly what did monitor tickets for ATT
good,"I worked for Manpower at the Proctor & Gamble Diaper, Paper towel plant in Jackson, MO."
good,"Would recommend to someone seeking employment, it's possible to become permanent at the job site that you're placed on. I would recommend better placement options."
good,Fun place to work great staffing and good for gaining work experience for future employment opportunities. Good work environment and even better for learning as you go.
good,"They where nice and easy to work for, always placed you in a work environment you would be successful in. The hardest part is that there are no guarantees in temp agencies."
good,Manpower had been good to me for years. My family structure and need have changed and I need steady employment and more security and structure. It's great for people who aren't looking for a specific shift and doesn't mind traveling to different assignments and working under different mangers often.
good,Entreprise très agréable avec une très bonne équipe
good,working for manpower as a forklift operator is fun you get to drive for eight hours and learn new thing on a forklift like how to pick up a mess of boxes with out getting off the lift
good,u could be called out to do some movers jobs or heavy lifting maybe help some big boys wit some worm work  around the site or be part of a clean up crew
good,As Manpower is a temp agency I didn't work at their office. They found me a long term assignment with fair pay that was a good fit and conveniently located.
good,The employment specialists were very professional and knowledge about jobs that were available to me. They spent a lot of time talking with me about the type of work I was seeking.
good,I enjoy working for manpower they just don't have enough work I learned that in order to get along with co-workers is to be quiet and never tell your personal business management is ok the hardest part of the job is when your supervisor don't like women workers and the most enjoyable part of the job is when it's time to go home
good,Was only temporary work. The assignments were good. The management was good. The work was stressful and the personnel at the clients provided minimal training.
good,I enjoyed working on there third shift assignments . They were very helpful and nice in the office. Very professional as a company. I would work with them again
good,"It was very fast paced and difficult sometimes but it's guaranteed hours, steady pay and weekends off mostly. I spent many nights tired and wore out but if you need a job I would recommend it."
good,"Foi uma experiencia fantastica, aprendi muito a cerca de telecomunicaçoes e de interaçao com terceiros."
good,my typical at would include going to work learning what i'm supposed to do and doing it to the best of my ability.the haresst part of the job is when you don't know how long the assignment is.
good,I would not like to give a review of this company because I was employed with Walmart.com. This was a temporary position that provided through Manpower.
good,I've had a great experience working for ManpowerGroup. I have experience working on 3 different sides of the business; learning and gaining lots of experience and knowledge from each different line.
good,There is not much actual contact with the company. This is just a temp. service that finds sometime temporary jobs for clients. Some times the companies will hire you on but for the most part the jobs end after a couple months. They do not have good benefits for insurance but most do offer some for or other.
good,I had little experience with this company because i was only placed at one job. The staff always provided me with friendly service. Easy job placement.
good,Manpower was there when I needed it.  The recruiter was great.  But the actual environment I worked in was very cut throat and nasty.  The permanent employees definitely let you know that you were temporary and tried to intimidate.
good,"Out of the temp agencies I ave been affiliated with, MANPOWER was one of the better. They worked with CORA and myself on making sure I got my 40hrs in even with my kids."
good,"Det var lite olika system för hur man fick reda på var man skulle och vad man skulle utföra. På de arbetsplatser jag var så var det alltid trevligt att vara men det var lite rörigt med att pussla ihop allt samtidigt som jag studerade och familjen.

good,I had a few good jobs from here but one was awful. It was a box factory in marion. The boss had a employee who he let do whatever she wanted. She treated her fellow employees horribly.
good,"Company has industry longevity. Economic strife in the corporate world, there are more candidates than jobs - no one is to blame. Workday is different each day. Teaches you to be adaptable.

The staff and workers at my job placement were friendly and, although played favorites, still treated me fairly. The staff I was representing as an employee, had friendly attitudes in the beginning. I saw a change when I had a change in my life. my worker would have attitudes and not answer my calls. When I needed information, she was not there."

I was placed in positions where I could lead on projects and learn from my superiors. I developed a better direction of personal growth. The individuals that I worked with had a positive attitude."
good,"Manpower is an excellent place to learn almost any office skill you may need in the future.  You definitely deal with a little bit of everything- sales, customer service, accounts receivable/payable, payroll, staffing, recruiting, compliance, etc, but the work life balance is near non existent.  There is a pattern in corporate of understaffing all of the local branches, so you are generally saddled with intense workload, as well as associates out on jobs all hours of the day, night, and weekends.  If a customer needs someone on a Saturday, you're expected to jump.  Corporate also does not make it easy to obtain the information you need to fix problems, and sometimes makes it near impossible to get from point a to point b without losing your mind."

I also entered disposition in the computer and packed and shipped product to existing customers. During my tenure at Knoll, I experienced the importance of team work and dedication to the accuracy of taking inventory. Other shops I worked for through ManPower was Port City Metals and Port City Arc.  Both of these shops were a little dirtier than Knoll.  Here, I poured liquid aluminum and trimmed die cast.  The work at Port City was done in very hot conditions and I sometimes suffered from heat exhaustion."

They provide insurance after a number of hours worked on contracts through them. They have done an excellent job placing me in jobs/contracts that make use of my listed skills, rather than just try to employ me for the purpose of collecting off my hard work."
good,"Depending on the assignment, I mainly did assembly work from making parts to putting them together. Management was very well put together. The people I was placed with were very friendly, but there were a few who didn't quite sit well with me based on there attitude.

Most of the people were nice people to work with, Besides some of the Team Leaders. But over all it was not a bad place to work. I worked from 7am/pm to 7:30pm/am and I had four breaks a shift. Unless i was busy and behind. Then I would only take one to two breaks a shift. I learned how to drive a forklift and a clamp truck and a tugger. I drove one everyday that I worked. I also learned how to work according to the time. Unless something went wrong. My co-workers were pretty good. Most of the people were nice, except the people that were half asleep.

Trabalhava com mais uma funcionária. No começo a relação foi um pouco difícil, mas no decorrer do tempo aprendemos juntos a lidar com as dificuldades do dia a dia de trabalho. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era quando precisava resolver algum problema ou alguma questão com a empresa, e demorava um tempo sempre a mais do que imaginava.

A empresa com suas obrigações trabalhistas sempre respeitou o funcionário, cumprindo com datas, prazos, entre outros."

The shift leaders dont stick around and supervise and when they see someone not helping (floaters) they dont care because they chose the floaters, whom are their friends. The floaters are supposed to be in our work area non-stop helping us but instead they roam around the facility in different departments talking to people. In Kelloggs factory the people that actually work, we are highly underpaid expecially compared to the higher rates temps get at steelcase, amway global, etc. The machine operators are overpaid especially on holidays. Why are temps the ones screwed over? They kept taking hours away and sending people home, the hours were so inconsistent. employees did not care about the product they are producing, just completely careless that they are there to do a JOB, and the people there hiring them are depending on them. They think they deserve a free paycheck."

good,A typical day at work would be trying to meet production in whatever ice cream that the line you are working on is making. You will learn how to correctly hand pack the ice cream and send it down the line. All the bad and open ice cream you have to break down in a bucket. The management in the company is well managed. You will catch on to the culture and how things are ran quickly. The hardest part of the job is working with others that either don’t want to learn or move slower then you.

Manpower does get some pretty good opportunities & I'm not trying to discourage people from working with them.I just want other jobseekers to be  aware that if you are interested in an assignment with M.P.,  you really need to stay on them to get you what you need (payroll PIN #'s etc) or they might not get it to you in a timely fashion or at all!"

good,ManpowerGroup cares about and is forerunner in putting people to work!
good,"It is temporary work, it is what it is. Employers no longer hire after 60 days, more like a year or even 2. No benefits in the mean time.

good,They help you find jobs when your out of a job. They send you too different job sites for temp work.
good,"The company itself seems very successful and I am sure that the corp ofc has a better communication system. the Branch of Manpower in Amarillo is not always so consistent. Infact there have been job assignments I have accepted only to learn when I went to the job location that the job was not what was described to me. ie., I was told a certain job would be data entry, it turned out to be some light manual labor instead there was no data entry. I do enjoy going on different job assignments, I do enjoy meeting new people, some jobs have been sorting mail, answering phones, some manual labor, Data Entry, clerical, I like the variety in working in a Temp job."

I learned how to handle a high volume of phone calls and make sure that there issue was taken care of in a timely manner. the management was okay they seemed like they where out for them selves and not so much the workers. My co-workers were great they always new how to have fun and stay positive when things were crazy. I would say the hardest part of the job was not interacting with people face to face. what was most enjoyable about this job was the satisfaction of being able to help someone out.
good,They had a lot of job placements and i was never without work.

good,I really enjoyed working at guidant through manpower. There was great opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"The hardest thing about manpower is that there is nothing in this area at this time for my pefered job preference. Also, it seems like the office does not look at my personal file before calling."
good,I would be contacted by this company when they would get word of an opportunity of employment.
good,"It is a good experience for me to work at Manpower. I work among a very friendly and dynmic team. I feel myself well integrated, I do my job, I learn everyday and I feel myself useful in my everyday work."
good,"I very much enjoy assisting people seeking employment, both temporary and long-term/permanent. I find it rewarding to be the facilitator of that important process."

A empresa é muito boa para se trabalhar, um ambiente agradavel qualquer duvida ou dificuldade tem sempre um companheiro de trabalho desposto a te ajudar, a parte mais dificil geralmente é no inicio para conhecer cada peça e codigo de cada componente solicitado. O que aprendi foi companheirismo tanto dos que entram quanto dos que já estão lá é uma pena a empresa só trabalhar com contratos temporários."

good,"I was assigned to work at a major insurance company's call center on a special project. While I was there, I learned so much about auto, home, boat, and umbrella policies. What was really nice was that even though I was a contractor, I had my own desk that I could bring personal stuff to and leave at so that it was ""my home away from home"" while I was working. The company that I was assigned to really treated the contractors just like fellow employees, and not as temps. Unless you really violated a major rule, you were given a verbal then written warning before let go. The project was on hiatus and they didn't know when it would resume, so I was let go."
good,"Employer offered many fun incentives, but, again, this review is not relevant because this location is under new ownership."

good,Company places persons in positions ranging from day to day or temp to hire.
good,"I liked all the jobs they picked for me and was happy when I got on at Eurest due to a temp from Manpower leading me to that job. The Macon County Board office jump ended up being temporary but I also enjoyed working there as well. I had another temp job with a local bank which lasted VERY briefly and is why it is not listed, but it was a Manpower job as well. I suspect Manpower might have stopped looking for me just because I may have become a bit too picky. But anyhow I did like them. As for the actual Macon Co Board office job, it was a nice challenge for me to learn, although did not last."
good,"Many different jobs rolled into one. Even though I was promoted, it was a tight nit group who loved to have fun."

good,"great experience working with manpower, they have great benefits"
good,"The job was great. It was a pilot program that did not make it. The people that were in charge did not have their minds in the right place. I do not think they were there to help the actual people, they were there for the money and that is why it got shut down."
good,"Trabajando con manpower me senti muy comoda, conoci lugares y personas increibles."
good,This was an excellent introduction to recruiting and human resources. Very high volume of calling and candidate screening.

good,"Lavoro abbastanza impegnativo sotto il punto di vista delle sicurezza personale e del pubblico."
good,Great place to work at when you do receive an assignment.  Could us better Management at various sites.  But over all the staffing agency works hard for all it's employees.
good,"l'accueil de l'entreprise est parfaite , l'écoute est au rendez-vous , prise de poste en autonomie rapide , les horaires sont compatible avec la vie personnel , bon contact avec la clientèle. cependant il faut faire face à l'humeur des client et autres personnes et faire en sorte de garder le sourire et répondre le mieux possible aux attentes des clients"

good,Overall when jobs can be hard to find this company can assist you with getting work. At leased it's something while you seek out your goals. There's always good and bad! It's what you make of it that matters.
good,"Need more company like this to find jobs for people. get paid every week, earn vacation time and paid time off.  Work with top corp in the world.  many position."
good,The support was overall good.  However since it was a staffing agency sometimes communication wasn't immediate.  Any issues at the job site would get filtered through the supervisor.  If the supervisor was unavailable issues would not get resolved until the supervisor returned.   The office was closed on the weekends so sometimes issues would not get forwarded until the following Monday.
good,Igualdad buen ambient laboral horarios flexibles..
good,Better job security! Work is not gareenteed but the pay and positions are available good. I would recommend someone to this agency. Benefits for job must be completed after 90 days.

good,Good job source for those who my have trouble finding a job. It quick and pays every week. It is perfect for anyone looking for a steady income and to get stable

good,Pas de commentaire sur cette entreprise qui utilise des intérimaires.
good,i Work on a assembly line that lines up books. Take this books off a pallet and put it in it’s proper position for the next assembler. Place stickers on packaging boxes with shipping code. Stack packages on a pallet for the fork lift driver to pick up. It’s a good environment. But machine gets clogged a lot which slows down the process

good,The contracted employer I was with was lacking severely in communication but I overall enjoyed the job. Manpower was of course blamed however I had great communication within manpower.

good,"Manpower is a great recruiter to work with."
good,"During the 8 months experience working with  Manpower Temporary Services I found it to be a challenge when it came to communication  between management.  Follow-up to questions, concerns or problems were not handled in a timely manner.  The time-frame was some what longer than expected.   "
good,"Apesar de ter sido terceirizado, a Manpower forneceu todo suporte que precisei durante o processo. Nada demais, mas tudo nos conformes."
good,They were always able to find me a job immediately. If I was not happy with the job I could transfer to another place. They would test me for the position to make sure that I qualified for the position. They're willing to work with you. It was real nice to be able to call them to see if they have a job after I did the initial paperwork. I didn't have to come in person. You had insurance while you are doing temp work. What was nice is that working temp work if you're not satisfied with the job you could transfer to another company. Not be committed. It also gives you some experience. Get a taste of it. To see if it is the right job for you.
good,"Manpower is a Temp agency, so far they take care of their people better then most of the other ones in Temecula just from talking with other people. There are not benifits in terms of health insurance or paid time off or sick pay which is really the only major downside. Aside from that there are a wide variety of work options to chose from if you're not sure what you want to do"

good,Manpower provided me the opportunity to to temporary work until I could find permanent employment.  I was happy with the opportunities they offered. I enjoyed the job assignments and companies that I worked with.
good,"The Manpower Reps. were great. However, since it was contracted labor for ExxonMobil, they did not have a lot of power. They pretty much did what their EM Reps requested. Not a lot of room or ability to negotiate on behalf of the the employees. That said, I would work for Manpower again."
good,"My days started by reviewing job boards and posted job ads, using the solution selling method I called on my assigned verticals to set meetings with H.R. personal for my outside sales executive to close. At that time from 2009 to 2010 the job market in America had tanked and we were in a recession, commissions were low."
good,"As long as you do your job, you hear very little from management. Opportunities to change assignments. Different work environments to choose from. Very long continuous work requirements to receive paid holidays."
good,Working on the line taught me about hard work and attention detail as I really had to check myself to make sure all the orders I was working on were complete and correct.
good,"Bra arbetsgivare, men när ett uppdrag skulle förlängas fick man reda på det väldigt sent."

good,I enjoyed my time at Manpower and the people are great to work with. My only negative was that the business strategy seemed to change dramatically each year with new leadership so it was difficult to keep my team members focused as Q1 of each year was all about which direction we were going in now.
good,"A typical day at work includes filing mail, correcting the errors of automated/electronic processor, manually keying in sensitive information, and assisting in miscellaneous requests of your supervisor."
good,"I loved being at the heart of the business as an employment lawyer.  Our ""product"" is people - in all 50 states.  We place our employees on our clients' worksites and our clients' supervisors manage our managers.  Let the the employment law fun begin!"
good,I personally enjoyed working for manpower. I just wish the pay was better and I got a full time job out of it. I also wish there were more options instead of mostly factory work
good,Comfortable work environment.  Pay was low.  Managerial feedback was given but  usually required follow-up by the manager for them to get clarification on the questions I would ask.
good,"trabajo en una tienda departamento que es liverpool el dorado "
good,This is a temp service and it just depends on what company you are sent to work with.. I was sent to work at Packaging Corporation of America where I worked there for 6 months and was then hired on with company.

I learned the way how a mortgage works after a mortgage has been funded up into the end of the cycle.  When the contract ended I was hired into another department, whereby my role transitioned into a CIBC migration officer- which transitioned into a dual role- CIBC migration officer plus IQ representative for the French agents of Firstline mortgages- assisting them with their queries and transactions, while being completing my job as a migration officer.  As a result, I was eventually hired on by CIBC as a mortgage service representative, full time."
good,good place to work when you can't find work some people there are good to find you work when needed sometimes it takes awhile to find cause the pay factor
good,"I consider this company nothing more than a temp agency with the possibilities to find full time employment.  So long as you report to your assignments on time and complete the days needed. As well as being available for work with transportation, manpower will always have work available on any given day."
good,"Recruiters at Manpower explain well the opportunities. Due to the recruiters being very busy, contractor needs to be proactive in keeping in contact with Manpower."
good,"Empresa muito organizada, com grandes colaboradores, gostei muito de passar mesmo que por muito pouco tempo  ser  colaborador  se um dia puder retornar meu entusiasmo e dedicação será ainda maior pois desejo ficar por muito tempo na empresa."

good,good company to work for if you like a fast pace environment and willing to move objects daily. Nice way to get in exercise and have a great career in the warehousing lifestyle.
good,Existe un compañerismo y ayuda en los temas laborales

good,"Good people to work with, will help you work around a shift that fits your work schedule. Understands if an emergency comes up with family. I’d recommend this to someone"
good,"Manpower doesn't usually look for IT people in this area. The needs and requirements are going to be different anywhere you could be sent (Manpower is a temp agency). When a company requests a temp in a special field that they don't typically request, expect the company to be in dire need of that role for reasons that they could and should have prevented."
good,"It is a very busy company. I'm handling almost 1,700 employees all over the country. But I am grateful that I have given the opportunity to be part of that prestigious company."

good,They really take care of those employees that take care of them. They are very informative about the assignments that you are contacted to perform. I would recommend them to anyone...
good,Man Power has provided me with a few temporary opportunities. The agent is dedicated and works hard to find a good match. The Job market in RI however is tough so opportunities may not always be present.
good,It was good experience working the ManPower assignment.  I recently graduated high school and attend college part time so it fit my schedule at the time well.

good,"journee dificile"
good,"They pay a competitive pay rate, they have temp to perm jobs. They all so offer health coverage, as well as 401k plans. Over all I would say it's a good place to start in any local work place."
good,"A typical day at work was comprised mainly of customer service to job seekers and sales accounts including hiring procedures, e-verify confirmation, payroll, and recruiting. My manager was very helpful. The workplace culture was sympathetic to the work-life balance. The most difficult part of the job was recruiting the right person for the job and having to make decisions based on limited information from the job seeker and sometimes the hiring customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to tell a job seeker they were accepted for a position. I truly believe we changed lives for the positive."

good,"Great place to work."
good,"lo unico es que no trabajas directamente con ellos, trabajas para otras empresas y por eso nos descontaban semanalmente una cuota"

good,I am very grateful to Manpower.   I was given an opportunity for employment immediately after my move to the area.   They were just not able to keep me employed full-time .  I believe that is only due to the region.
good,Even though I have learned a lot from these companies I am still willing to learn more. I know I can be a great asset to any company willing to hire me. I have learned to use everything from brushes to paint sprayers.
good,If you are just needing a temporary job or looking to find a permanent job this is a great temporary hiring agency. They had me a job within 2 weeks of applying bab

Take new counterparts off trucks and assemble them as a team. If we don't have anything to do at the time we all scatter over a certain place or area and straightened up products such as clothes"
good,Good to work for with the exception of no guarantee of permanent placement.  Lack of access to actual time sheet once week ends.  Lack of access to affordable benefits such as health insurance.
good,"Not their fault, they placed me in a temp to hire position replacing a supervisor the company expected to retire.  When he didn't, I was out of a position, and Manpower was caught completely unprepared, even though I had told them it looked like the situation was not as they had presented it, and put forth little effort in finding a suitable replacement position."

good,"Job security is little to none if you are a contractor. Not much advice from management, contracts can be open ended with no end in sight (until its over of course)"
good,"Starting pay is not great, but it beats nothing. Ability to gain knowledge and experience on different assignments. For me, when my assignment ended, didn't have anything lined up for me so i'll be continually employed. Usually given a week off before starting a new assignment unless otherwise."
good,"Working with Manpower in the past, they did really well with finding the job, even if it's temporary, that fit your skills, along with the salary that you're looking for."

The onsite team periodically checked on their workers to ensure hardships weren't a issue. Management shown appreciation with appraisals to individuals and group They kept us informed about upcoming changes that they were aware of. Unfortunately Alcon having communication issues even Manpower was in the dark about sudden changes but allowed their workers to mutually communicate in meetings.

good,This was the temporary agency I went through for my first job. I did not have any problem working with them and they were always willing to answer any questions I may have had.
good,During busy times management is hard to get a hold of. The jobs they find are good pay and hard work. More organization would be nice but with only 2 people in the office I can see it being hard.
good,"Everyday had to unload boxes out of containers. If they needed me I would put labels on boxes in another department which was very easy. The management was fine they wouldn't push you to work too hard especially during the summer. Everyone was friendly whether it was a lead, supervisor, manager, or co-worker. Hardest part of the job was unloading containers during the summer because it can get to about 120 degrees in a container on a 100 degree day so you have to stay hydrated. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting labels on boxes because it was so easy."

good,"I have the opportunity to work with the local manpower office as a Recruitment Specialist for 6 months on site.  I felt that overall the job requirements were standard, the staff and employee were all under Manpower, so it was fair across the board.  I was able to step or of my normal customer service skill set and learn something new.  The on-site HR representative was very kind and approachable.  She made anything seem possible. The hardest part of the job, would be the long hours on the phone, but the payoff was the contacts made. The pay was great and the bonus even better, if you could stick it out to the end of the campaign. I would recommend Manpower to anyone, that likes to work and is flexible to learn new skills."

good,"All I had to do is pull weeds and trim hedges. It was a relaxing job and the people in the office are very nice and care about their employees. When it got to hot in the sun they would let me come in and cool off, gave me plenty of water to drink and a jell wrap to put on my neck to keep me cool. They gave me everything that I needed for the job, certain tools and garbage bags to put weeds and garbage that I picked up along the way. I enjoyed working for them just for the summer."
good,I enjoyed working with the manpower company they were very professional and patient when helping me to find a job that would fit my needs as far as hours and pay.

good,"I very grateful for the opportunities the manpower has provided. I feel lucky to be contracted at my current customer."
good,"With Manpower it is hard to evaluate a typical day because this is a temp service and the jobs I work through here vary. However, the position I am currently in has to do with data entry using Excel. I work in a hospital doing a time study for the emergency department. I have enjoyed the people and the hospital I work with and totally enjoy the job."
good,"The Staff is very kind and helpful, and once work is found, they are communicative as need be. The set up for finding employment is also basically good."

good,I really did have much to do with Man Power. They placed me at Bell Hellicopter which I truely enjoyed this company.The people were great. I enjoyed working there.
good,I like that I learnt how to work in an environment that is under pressure at all times of the day. I also learnt new tasks along side the job. There was no current errors or faults I had within the site I was working on besides hanging of the building I was working on.

good,"I ran a register at the Vera Bradley sale at the coliseum. It was busy but fun and met a lot of really nice and funny people. Most of the people I worked with were nice, there were a few lazy taggers and baggers. The hardest part?? I don't think there was anything hard about it. It would have been nice to have some softer ergonomic mats to stand on."

good,good fun place to work easy going people breaks could be longer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,"Manpower is an excellent company to work for.  They staff their branch offices with talent that truly cares about the associate and their task-based structure is clean and efficient.  However, the chain of command with regard to corporate reporting is confusing.  At any given time, a staff member will report to multiple people in upper management with no clear idea as to who their direct corporate supervisor is.  Communication needs work."
good,I took the position at Manpower as I need an income and at the time they gave me the work experience and know how of positions I did enjoy.
good,"Though I haven't been with Manpower long, the recruiting staff is very helpful and easy to work with. I am searching for a full-time permanent position which unfortunately a staffing agency can't guarantee."
good,"It was a temp service so I learned how to do a lot of jobs why I was there. I learned how to put  floors for basketball and hockey games down called floor conversion. I worked at Home Depot as a order selector , I also did forklift operations."

good,"Buen clima laboral en ambas compañías, trabajo en equipo, algunos problemas de parte de algunos supervisores que por trabajar en las instalaciones de cada empresa algunas veces fallan como tales, la experiencia es buena, pero si vienes de otro lugar y sabes como solucionar un problema, algunas veces hay que recapacitar y no ser tan cerrado en los aspectos laborales."

good,Je suis arrivée en Mars et j'ai tout de suite trouve du travail quasiment sans interruption entre les missions
good,a typical day at work would be having a tray of mail to extract and process per customers instructions. I learned every aspect of our operating procedures from extracting to data entry. Management was ok they don't communicate daily task well. Co-workers are very goal oriented and the hardest part of the job is low work flow. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people.
good,I learned that you really have to apply yourself here because there are agencies looking to get their people in and good place to work
good,"A very clean, friendly factory environment. I had the privilege of learning several roles that are standard to the factory floor environment, while simultaniously observing how the supervisors and management responded to different situations.

good,Good place to work and strive to give employees a chance at a new career opportunity. Good rates of pay and holiday entitlement and always on hand to help staff.
good,After I was laid off they were there to help me get a position to stay on my feet. I began working on a temp-to-hire position and am hoping they will hire. The financial forecast of the company may prove to differ.
good,"Good place to work a basic warehouse environment using pallet jacks, packaging and building pallets.  Assembly line work packing cosmetics in a timely manner.  Clean environment including training new associates."
good,"Friendly environment, when I was hired the person who was supposed to train me didn't help at all, luckily I knew others who worked there to tell me what I needed to know. That person was terminated shortly after and then other departments helped each other when done with their own work."
good,"It is challenging to work everyday."
good,Man Power is a good place to work. Management is easy going and they place me in a job that is fun and I have learned a lot. the pay is a little low for the job.
good,Staff was very conscientious in following up with answers to questions I'd had.  Turn-around time was negligible.  Everyone was completely professional.
good,I would definitely refer others to Manpower.  It is a company that has a lot to offer and I believe that anyone that takes a position with the company would be pleased.
good,"Travailler dans le froid , bon esprit d’équipes"
good,"The customer comes first,! If they need help, we are here to provide it. Very fast paced. Must be able to multi-task and  not get stressed out easy. Stay focused and SMILE.  "
good,I learned how to communicate with our foreign employer and I learned some office works related to manpower. when it comes to my co-workers we're  working as a team and we always maintain the harmonious relationship with each other. the hardest part of the job is finding more applicants to comply the number of categories needed by our foreign employer. the most enjoyable part of the job is when we deploy the complete number of categories needed by our employer because afterwards we have a celebration for the job well done.
good,"Bajos sueldos, pocos beneficios, lentitud en los procesos internos."
good,I found at  Manpower the WHS Co-Ordinator a very rewarding and sometimes challenging position. All Branches of the Company were very keen to learn and adopt new ideas.

good,takes time for them to find you work but they are friendly and will help find you work that you could get too on a daily basis if you dont have a vehicle of your own. They have nice and helpful staff to assist you when its needed.
good,"Manpower itself in my experience is a good place to kick off a new job or to use when you're in between work and need the income while looking for something more substantial. Amway is a great place to work with the exception that they refuse to hire anyone past the temp level. meaning if you didnt start there in the 90's youre probably going to be a temp for the entirety of your employment there that means no benefits and a fixed rate income. The work is easy and the people are awesome, would be great work for a kid out of high school to use while trying to find a higher paying long term job but not substantial enough to use for an adult income with a family to cover in insurance."
good,easy. great co workers. getting laid off. you get raises but manpower takes a cut of your raise which isn't good. if you get injured on the job they still make you work instead of letting you recuperate and they take points off as if you took off willingly.
good,"as long as you put forth an effort they will find a position for you"

good,"Unfortunately this was ""contract"" work so no benefits. The hours were 24x7 so no life around the crazy shifts we were expected to work. The clients were million dollar clients so they did get what ever they wanted. Company cared more about them even when they were wrong than the dedicated staff."
good,"Typical day at work is simple and very relax; but very hard work with fun time when there is down time.  Great people to work with, and great work environment!!!!"
good,Lo bueno del trabajo fue el conocimiento adquirido sobre distintas maquinarias utilizadas en mi puesto de trabajo

good,mainly doing just temp agency working for wharehouses. so never really stayed long in many places.

good,very fast paced environment working on the latest CDMA  phone technology. Lots of overtime before the holidays
good,Great Company. They've been in business for years. Helped a lot of future employees to find employment. I wish that the job market was as great as it was in the past. Manpower had a larger base of employees applying for employment with their agency. However they were not at fault due to the fall in the economy 5 to 6 years ago or maybe more. I do respect the fact that Manpower stayed in business and tried to help those who needed employment and tried to keep people employed as best that they could.
good,"I liked it...because, I had various projects. And, if I had various projects with deadlines. I either met the deadline...or exceeded the deadline. And, the people I worked with were nice."

good,Average Temporary Agency. Somewhat effective at finding me a position.
good,I really liked to do different jobs it gave me a lot of experience.  I really liked it.  The only bad thing is most the jobs were temporary and there wasn't much out there where you could actually have a full-time job.
good,Hi Have worked with IBM Daksh at MTP Nagawara it was very challenging & very nice to work with them & i have learned a lot from my job.
good,"My time at Empathia (placed through Manpower) was a pleasant experience.  I felt as though the employees functioned well together and that there was a real sense of community and teamwork.  The management was available for guidance and support, but not overbearing and welcomed new ideas and ways of performing tasks.  During my twelve month assignment, I was able to use many of the administrative skills that I had already possessed, as well as to learn new computer skills involving MAC programs.  My only negative experience during the assignment, was not having the position become permanent as I was told during the hiring process and the frequency of the assignment date changing and being extended without sufficient notice.  Over all, my time with this company was very favorable."

good,Manpower is a temp agency so I always had a different job through out the week. The good thing about that is you always learn new skills at every new job. It could be hard at times cause you don't always know when or where you will be working at.
good,"- A typical day at work consist of helping other which I dearly enjoy "
good,Just go to work do the  job and pretty much shut your mouth. Anything said you prob get fired. I did.  Management had a woman that wanted employees that wanted them to engage in her girly games and if they didnt they  possibly could be fired. Co-workers ok to be around. I personally never said much. Less drama to deal with. There was no enjoyable part of the job.

good,"entreprise en plein développement."
good,"working at NAL through manpower was definately different for me being right out of high school. i was used to the fast paced parts of it.  Though alot of the people you get to work with there are not very friendly. i understand you are on a certain time limit to meet your quota. but when you working on a line together, i think better communication skills would help. it would relieve some tension off alot of the workers, so they know.....hey they know what it takes to do their job properly.    "

good,"I would got though isles and pick stuff with an rf scannner for orders. "
good,"I worked two separated high security positions between 4/2013 and 8/2013. The typical days were about the same. Going in, locking your personal stuff up and proceeding to a locked room with computers and management on the floors to proceed as they suggested for the day (per as we were originally trained on what system to work). We really could not talk or ""co-exist"" with other co-workers as it would take away our ""data entry"" time and speed from entering data."
good,"a typical day at work for me at Manpower is assisting customers with technical issues over the phone. Management and co-workers are very nice and helpful. The hardest part of my job is making sure that I satisfy every customer that I speak to, even when they are upset and hard to console. The most enjoyable part of my day is making them happy when I resolve their issue"
good,"it was an ok place to work good hours"

I have learned how to connect electronic devices, the different inputs and outputs of the electronic devices and I learned a lot about warranty process.  My co-workers are a great bunch of people and we all worked very well together.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to help everyone with warranty issues or with older devices.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help customers with the connection of the device, having it working correctly and/or replacing the non working device.  "
good,"i really liked working at U.S. Minerals, it was the best job i had so far... got to work outside all day "
good,"High work load"
good,they are not a bad temp agency to work with. they found three jobs for me while i was working through them
good,"This company is a temperary job placement. Even though its not a permanent job, it allows me to get a lot of experience in different work settings. These of which I truely enjoy. But experience of all is not enough if the job doesnt last long. This is one of the least things that I do not like about this job."
good,"trabalhar nesta empresa é bom pois oferece-nos alguns beneficios, mas enfim queremos sempre melhorar e ela não oferece um plano de carreira por ser uma empresa terceirizada da Loreal Brasil o nosso local de trabalho- a Loreal nos fornece cursos e oportunidade de aprendizado através de palestras, o clima é agradavel e o ambiente é de equipe"

good,Interesting and challenging work. High paced. Team oriented projects.
good,Good working culture in the company. Promotes team work and efforts to look into welfare of staff.
good,It was a good place to work for. The management worked hard to keep me employed but not enough work. The hardest part of this job would be always being the new person and learning a job fast and on the go.

good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with and loved the overtime
good,"I loved all my co-workers aka my team, i liked the atmousphere and surroundings."
good,Manpower is a good place to start with in looking for work wher there is no work to be found on your own. They are always willing to help. You work for Manpower and not for the company you report to so at times there can be complications of how you can report because manpower is only open mon-fri typicaly 9am-5pm. so after hours you have to talk to an answer machine and wait to hear something back.
good,"A typical day at work performing the typical duties that is required of me. I learned skills that are needed in the workforce. Management was average, like any other employer. I worked with co-workers who did their jobs well, that were required of them. My job was not hard and I enjoyed working with people and learning new skills"

El ambiente laboral era muy bueno, ya que, nos ayudábamos mucho. Lo que mas me costo fue gestionar los cambios de nuestras herramientas y lo que mas me gusto fue la atención al publico y el trato personal con los clientes-"
good,wonderful place to learning about groceries. wonderful hours to have if really need a job
good,"I learned many things about high speed machinery as how to time, adjust, and maintain the machines. A normal day at work can be pretty crazy if all the machines go down at once. my co-workers were great to work with fun people who would take the time to teach you anything you want to know and push you to learn more and ask as many questions as possible. the hardest part of the job is knowing all of the signals and buzzers that go off on the floor. the most enjoyable part is working with my hands and machinery"
good,Productive and fun place. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,Same old thing everyday such a boring job to be in no challenge in it whatsoever this is an ok job to make some quick easy cash if you dont mind being bored but you can also get alot of shift cancelations and you shift gets moved quite a bit making it really hard to plan anything in life.
good,"Contract employment to various business sites/centers to perform exceptional Customer Service/Sales duties, as well as light warehouse production. Manpower provided me with top-quality contract employment."
good,Great working with good people. Had good jobs in timely matter. Very happy with the staff of employees.

good,It was an interesting job Iearned alot and the supervisors were respectful and made sure we all had something to do! We the co-workers all worked as a team on making sure all the work was completed. The most enjoyable part about the job was the bonuses we recieved!

good,"good job scouting. fast pace jobs, no hassle on getting payed."
good,Great!!
good,For me the best part about it was the heavy labor. It was a fast paced environment and the days were quick. Constant moving and laoding and vcleaning glass tubes. Definitely a good work out. (lost a lot of weight). People were great. Our leader was not so great. He was inexperienced at leadership and less knowledgeable of the equipment than everybody else but we managed to pull through and made him look good.
good,driving to work with positive attitude
good,"typical factory jobs,that I got to learn and skill my talents at.got to meet alot of new people some more sat in there way than others but thats ok i can get along with anyone,were all gods children and he blessed each with different talents and wisdom.It was sometimes hard leaving one job site after the other,yet it was fun to learn about each company and there product and that wow I helped make this and that."
good,my co workers is the hardest part because you dont know anyone and sometimes you arent there for very long. the best part is that they are higher paying jobs through them
good,"As a temp for Manpower assigned to Wolverine Worldwide, I have learned patience. I was used to jobs that would bring in a temp, keep them on for 45 - 90 days and decide in that time whether or not they wanted to make that person a permanent part of their company. I have been in this position 22 months now, 9 1/2 hours a day, and even though I have not received any salary increases and I do not know when I might find myself a permanent part of Wolverine, I do know that I have a steady income and I have earned my place amongst my coworkers. The hardest part is the waiting, and the most enjoyable part is the actual work. I enjoy cutting leather and trying to compete with myself for a better number than the day before."
good,Varied positions kept this job very interesting and fresh. The cons for this position is that when you get a handle on one position you are usually moved to another.
good,"Some of the co-workers I would rather not work with. I start at 6am. There are 2 different lines we work on. The work orders decide which line we run for the day. The supervisor is fun to work for, great sense of humor."
good,interesting place to work - cirque de sole; show was wonderful
good,I liked working there but it was just a temporary position. The work was easy and the employes was nice and friendly.
good,"As with any temp agency, there is a lot of uncertainty when you take a position, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Manpower. After a short, 2-day stint at a warehouse, I was placed at a position where I was really stretch my skills in computers and clerical work. Expedited Freight Systems had a nice, productive work atmosphere, but due to the decline of their profits and freight, I was the first one on the chopping block. A month later, I was given another great opportunity to work in the Admissions Office at Carthage College. What started as a fill-in opportunity for a gal on medical leave turned into a great, three and a half month experience where I felt like I was a part of the Carthage family. Once the gal I was filling in for was scheduled to come back, my co-workers threw me a pizza party to show their appreciation for my dedication and hard work on my last day. My only complaint was that I couldn't be a permanent part of that office."
good,Great company to work with if you are working along with good team where every one take pride of what they are doing.Have seen corporate america where employees change along with the job and responsibilities.Very few stays due to personal issues.

good,I had experience with the new product introduction. They renew our contract every two months.
good,"Various office duties: filing, typing, letters, accounts receivable, creating document or spreadsheets. Learned to work with business men and laborers in lumberyard. Hardest part is the job was temporary. I really like working at the lumberyard. I spent time with both sides of the business and really like the people. Was able to leave jobs that were not a match without any problem. Manpower staff was really good about listening to problems and finding jobs."
good,This was a temporary office position I was told could be 2 weeks or it could be 2 months as this customer service position was to get their work caught up.
good,I enjoyed processing medical claims for the state of Kentucky with this company. It was pleasurable having a flex schedule. I enjoyed that I was able to work independently.
good,"I thought Manpower provided me with a ""good fit"" based on my knowledge and abilities. I was also pleased with the compensation. I would use them again and recommend them as an agency."
good,"Excellent experience with the computer, paperwork, mathmetical areas"
good,"It was a nice company to work with. They had work that had to be done and we, as a team got most of the tasks completed. I enjoyed the employee incentives and sometimes the way they handled their employees. I worked with a bunch of nice workers and it was sad to be laid off due to not enough product. I am looking for work right away."
good,I have had two assignments with Manpower. The first turned out to be with a major automotive manufacturer that die casts engine blocks and transmission cases in Jackson. This assignment was terrible and I would not wish it on my worst enemy.

good,I have had 3 assignment true Manpower and my overall experience has been pleasant exciting and very educational my agent has always been pleasant and helpful hope to get more opportunity for job assignment hopefully soon a permanent job
good,A typical day at work was very competitive. I have learn a lot about the workplace culture. I learn project management and I enjoyable part of the job is to find new co worker.
good,This factory is come under near city place due more manpower attrition here and most of manpower getting from local place and their not depends on their salary they have  finance source from their own agriculture lands n other business.
good,"The Workplace Culture is fine to talk about, though a bit more professionalism is required when it comes to Communication."
good,It hard to contact manpower and pay rate can be changed as life is changing. Hard to get a permanent position after getting your 90 days on the job. Thank you
good,"Empresa dedicada a servir y prestar servicio al cliente ,con estándares competitivos !"
good,You don't get assignments consistently. Very low paying. College degree really doesn't matter. You have to call weekly just to see if they have availability.
good,"très bonne ambiance sur le plateau (open space), entraide entre collègues, quelques sorties ensemble"
good,I like working with the people there they made everything simple and easy I would definitely go back to them everything was smooth and they took a chance a on a college student who they knew was only there for a short period of time.

good,"Estoy agradecida por la oportunidad  laboral que tengo en manpower. Sin embargo,  me gustaría que mejorarán con bonos o vales."
good,This is a company that has begun cutting corners to try and reduce costs which hurts production leading to frustrating work situations where you have to work harder with no pay increase.  The work isn't very difficult and the people around you are experienced and mostly friendly.  Getting hired in is a nightmare as they don't auto hire you in after a period.  You have to complete for a full hire position against the whole world with not much consideration towards the fact you already work there
good,Had few jobs worked the time and instead of getting hired I was let go. Most places were not hiring in but dismissed after time was up. Very frustrating with no sick days or holiday pay and overly strict attendance policy.

good,I was hired for a temp job of water plants. Everyone I had contact with at Manpower was friendly and professional. Applying to fore filling requirements was very easy.
good,My assignment was at TMMWV and I absolutely loved it. I miss my job. The hours are horrendous sometimes tho. Not enough family time with kids. Other than that it's a great career path.
good,Was assigned to a company that I liked and they paid pretty good well that company did a staffing reduction so I was let go along with some others any way they wanted to send me to a job 35miles from home to replace the former assigned to but this new place wasent worth the gas since it paid less and was farther away they seemed like they didnt even care

good,"They are a good temporary service. They work with you on getting into a job and compensate better than most other temporary services. As soon as my 90 days were up at my assignment, I was hired on right away and the transition was smooth."
good,Temporary job agency. Assigned to three different locations during my search for a permanent job. All locations were suited to my skill set. I would recommend this agency.
good,Assists with short and long term job placement. Good if need something quick. Sometimes you get stuck at jobs you don't want to be at  because they have nothing available.
good,"Manpower are American owned & when I worked there, had very much a socialist attitude towards their staff. Training & development was readily available & continual coaching was encouraged."
good,"day was made up of stacking boxes 7 high all the way down the warehouse and filling them with gel packs for 8-10 hours a day, the breaks were nice but the people i was taking breaks with were foul mouthed and misogynistic to my other co workers and management was never really held accountable for getting checks or deposits done on time and they were always to busy to speak with me about my issues and the expectations for moving up in the business were extremely unreasonable unless you had just given up and decided to be a door mat."

Só  uma empresa com a qualidade e capacidade a nível de recursos técnicos e  humanos superior, como a Manpower  poderia chegar aos 75 anos com  o reconhecimento mundial que é sabido."
good,"La mia esperienza qui è stata finora la più concreta della mia carrriera: sono entrato a far parte di un ufficio molto grande (siamo arrivati ad essere quasi 80 persone) e ho imparato molto sull'amministrazione del personale in un contesto abbastanza sfidante, dove la qualità deve necessariamente abbinarsi alla quantità. "
good,"I learned how to deal with unhappy  customers and to take control and turn the situation to a positive one, "
good,Factory jobs are not my cup of tea. But when I needed a job this company was there for me. It is a staffing agency. Management is friendly. Pay is ok.

good,"I enjoyed my work experience at Manpower for the most part. I was there for over 11 years, and the last year became somewhat difficult because of some of the temporary employees poor work ethics. The inter-office staff was always awesome, but some of the temp staff became very difficult to tolerate on a daily basis. Overall, I can not complain about Manpower as a company, and my reason for leaving was primarily based on my need to work a more flexible schedule (from home), to accommodate the special needs of my autistic child."
good,Go work in whichever factory they assign you. Make sure you are on time and have the appropriate protective gear and are wearing clothes that match dress code. As well as have good attendance.

good,"The advancement is great, you can advance as long as you are willing to put the work in. The only thing is at the location I am at it is ran mostly by men so it seems management opportunities were limited. Also promised I would be working a set number of hours once given permanent but it seems that Im required to work an additional 8-10 hour a week which sucks because im only paid for 40. They should look at the associates as real people and not just treat them like numbers, it puts people with real ethics in morals in situations that they don't always wont to be in."

One of the major disadvantages to Manpower is, I was never sent their insurance package, as a result they say that i denied the service and no longer can apply for coverage."

good,"I have worked for MGS for almost 3 years and have thoroughly enjoyed working with the people and clients. Training is usually very extensive and educational. However, it is very hard to move up within the company due to the large number of employees that do the same job.

Overall, I have enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to another recruiter looking for a virtual opportunity."
good,"A typical day at work: When i got to my desk, i would first check the assessment scores from the candidates i interviewed the day before and update that information into Avature/ Success Factors. If they did not complete the assessment, I would give them a call to inform them that they need to complete it so I can move them onto the next step to set them up for a face to face interview with Comcast. After that, I would check my job ads that i posted from the day(s) before to see who applied for the position i was hiring for. Then, i would give them a call to see if they were still interested and if they had time to complete a 15-20 minute phone interview with me. Our ""goal"" for a day was to get at least 5 people to pass the phone interview. Once I finished the phone interview, I would inform them how they did and if I would be moving forward with them. If I moved forward with them, I would then update their profile, inform them that i would be sending them a assessment that they needed to complete. I learned how to speak professionally over the phone with candidates and management over the phone. I also learned a lot about time management, multi-tasking and communication. My co-workers were great, We all helped each other out with our projects and problems we were having. Management was an issue with Comcast, I found that my direct Manager had ""favorite employees"". The hardest part of the job was if you were working in a tough location in the USA that didn't have many people applying for your position, but I always tried my hardest to find candidates that were qualified for"

I learned how much work those ladies put into their jobs and how much dedication you must put in to have all that food done on time. Manger was a nice woman and she worked her hardest to communicate well to us. Co-workers all had opposing personalities but they all still had to work together to get the job done therefore I did not have much of a problem with them. It was hard being thrown in the kitchen and not knowing how to work the ovens or how to make certain foods and sometimes I struggled getting answers at times. However I did enjoy working in a fast pace and cleaning."
good,"new environment, new experiences, new people to interact with."

good,work is very different between a company owned and franchised owned service area.  The nature of temporary staffing is a small and unique niche of the overall HR function.
good,"No micromanaging! That was the best part. You would come in, check your emails, call back whoever you needed to call back, and source for candidates. Management was okay, checking in if you needed it and making sure you were able to do your job well. Hardest part of the job was the quotas and being on the phone a lot....I just personally do not like talking on the phone much. Working for ManpowerGroup is sales without being sales."

good,I really enjoyed my time at Manpower. I overall think that they got great jobs.......Great place to work..............I would recommend this job to others....
good,"I like the varied work and different work environments. The hardest part is the first day on a new assignment, learning the new rules, etc. The pay was good, and reliable."
good,"The people I work with are very helpful and we get along very well, which helps us all to learn and retain new information. "
good,as a temp you must walk a fine line I feel as they hire almost anyone that they should consider rehiring people after much time away from the company though. just because a person messed up when young don't mean that should stick with them forever
good,I worked with a  great team that valued teamwork and sharing knowledge.  Supportive environment that allows for doing things in a new way.  They try to build a culture of teamwork.
good,"Very nice people to work with and for. I miss them a lot, I was disappointed when they made me redundant as I had put my all in to the job, and felt I was chosen for redundancy  because of my age, not because of last in first out."
good,That was a while ago but I believe they were a good company to work for. I had a few jobs through them. I don't remember any problems with management.
good,they offered great placements. Allows you to see what a company is like and gives you great work experiences.Most of the employers they have are looking to hire and it simply allows you and the employer to kinda feel each other out. I feel at times this is a great way to research employers.
good,"Great assignments, Manpower staff polite and courteous.   Able to choose hours and times I work.  Very flexible.  Very professional."
good,"No benefits if you're pt, they will not automatically find you full time work either even if you start pt.  You will have to seek it out actively on your own.  I did not receive a single pay raise while working for them."

good,"Busy job, lots of interaction with employees and clients, face to face and over the phone. Never a dull moment, staff always professional."
good,I enjoyed working with Manpower. I only wished they offered insurance like a regular job does. When I got hurt on the job at Valley Health Manpower made sure I didn't lose work. I worked in the office of Manpower answering phone until I was able to go back to work. I am a single mom so it helped to not be out of work.
good,"I like the fact that you are not required to stay if the assignment is not a good fit for you, unlike the traditional job. They provide great scheduling flexibility."

You always have the chance to be hired by a company that you are sent to temp for, which happened with me and led to one of my most fulfilling and enjoyable job that I've had.  Contact and experience with the company itself was minimal, so can't really comment too much on that aspect.  Very helpful place to work for a time if you are looking to get your foot in the door with a job that might otherwise have been harder to get into otherwise."
good,"I  would be assigned for a day, week, a month of work, or longer."

good,Var uthyrd åt HCL Technologies (Metsä och Metso service desk) som hade en helt annan företagskultur än vad som jag kommit i kontakt med i Finland och Nederländerna. Lärde mig att hjälpa och sköta kundernas datorer med fjärrkontroll av deras datorer. Ledningen i Finland hade ingen beslutsrätt utan alla beslut sker i Indien. Arbetskollegerna var bra. Svåraste delen var i slutet att bemanningen inte var tillräckligt stor. Bästya delen var att det inte var frågan om skiftesarbete.
good,This is a perfect starter job. The pay is decent and the hours aren't at all grueling.

Many of their jobs are general labor positions & employment is not guaranteed once your assignment ends. This job has given me experience in a work setting that I would not have normally explored otherwise.

good,"Es agradable trabajar en Manpower, pero no existe oportunidad de promoción y superación como desarrollo profesional."
good,"Days are fairly busy at the office. Between the numerous resident requests, walk-ins, phone calls, interviews and work order requests, the days go by rapidly due to the need to constantly multi-task.   I learned to always give 100% and to learn something new everyday. Always be amendable to necessary change."

good,"Good place to work. Great company ethics."
good,"a typical day at work at Baxter's Healthcare consists of repetitive movements while you fill/pack I.V. bags. I've learned that team work is a must in an environment like this. My co-workers were mostly helpful but there's always going to be the ones who are not. The hardest part of my job was being sent to a different area and being expected to keep up with others when I didn't have enough training. Also, the hardest part, was to have to ""prove"" my competence for so long and not be able to get hired on permanently while they hired others straight through and they had no idea what they were doing. (which is the reason I left ) The most enjoyable part is knowing my hard work always paid off and I was helping people to live their lives and get the supplies the needed."

good,"Manpower has been a good option for me. I haven't yet been ""hired-in"", and that's frustrating, but I'm also fussy about where I want to commit to long-term, so that's more my fault not theirs. If you're a good worker and they have openings, you should be working soon!"

good,"days go by fast,learned fast, supervisor was cool, everyone treated me like one of the team."
good,"On a typical day, you would get into your uniform that would be there waiting for you and then join your shifts Bid level 10 or floor Manager to review the previous day and whats going on that day. The rest of the day is more of a work, listen, and follow routine and you have to always be on your toes for any accidents or events that might happen."
good,Very fast paced
good,"I was places at Lincare a Billing office for durable medical equipment. A typical day would consist of filing, faxing, scanning, coping answering phones, sorting mail and other general administrative/ clerical work. I learned a lot about office work specifically what was listed above. The management was okay within Lincare they did have a lot of communication issues but Manpowers management is great. The co-workers were amazing always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was managerial communication. The most enjoyable part had to be the work itself and the co-workers."
good,"Same as teller at Wilber, minus the counting of the ATM and safe."
good,It is like a typical work day. 7-3:30. but minus the job stability of security. you could get laid off at anytime being a Temp.
good,For the most part Manpower is a good company to work for. I was lucky to have great co-workers. This is a good stepping stone company where you will learn all the ins and outs of recruiting.
good,"We ususally receive calls from existing clients to follow up their account balance and to do more transactions we have to assist them since most of the account we handle are all business accounts. What I really learned from this job, since everything should kept confidential you need a double care especially the fax numbers you are sending out. Clients have differenet personalities so I learned to get along with clients to manage their differences even just talking over the phone you should know how to manage their needs in order to satisfy them. My co-workers are very helpful, they try their best to help you, and they consider the team as one family. I really enjoyed this job you just know how to discipline yourself on how to be positive despite of difficulties you get from customers."
good,Manpower is a contracting agency. The employees that work for Manpower are very nice and reliable. They are always willing to help.
good,"Recruiters are supportive of recruits. They retain good employees. Some co-workers were a bit nosy, but others were kind. Hardest part of the job was maintaining 100% accuracy. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work in other areas of the company."
good,I am only in training I have learned a whole lot of information in 3 days about Tech Support and the companies computer system. I have only met the two trainers and my supervisor once I go out onto the floor. All of my co workers are great I am a people person so I enjoy everyone. The hardest part of the job now is gathering and learning all of the information in a 3 week period however I know once I get out on the floor and start to take calls it will all come together. I always enjoy new challenges and learning new things so everyday I can do that is a good day for me.
good,I believe they place you appropriately. They provided interesting work that was temporary clerical support for employees on vacation.

good,"A Fortune 500 company, I do owe most of my Adminstrative experience to this international company. I've met good people who've worked there for the nine years I've been with them on and off, and the talent on the company and those running it never stop trying. Attempting to move with the times, Manpower stands by the Associates and other staff they employ as they search the public and private sectors for future long-standing clients, as well as their own policies, including a conducive Ethics policy."
good,I loved working for Manpower and i did different things when working for them.

good,"Red Cedar Clinic is a great place to work, my co-workers are always willing to help should I have a question and the supervisors make themselves available at all times also. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the different programs to use to get the claims to pay. I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I can get the medical claims to pay instead of deny payment."
good,I enjoyed working at A/O Smith as a punch press operater. While some times demanding it provide satifaction of doing a good job done on a production run.
good,"The position I was in as a Temporary Team Leader was like a rollercoaster, because you never know how many people will show up, or if they need extra people on a line. I learned better communication skills and how to multitask very well. Co-workers were easy to get along with, the hardest part of the day was having a temporary that was not cooperating with you. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting along well with others."
good,"Les personnes travaillant là bàs, m'ont toujours trouver du travaille"

good,"Manpower is a temp agencies that was very pleasant to work under. Always looked for feedback on what they need to improve on. They were also available for any question you had concerns on. The environment was always upbeat, never felt awkward or like you were being pushed away. I would definitely recommend this agencies to others."
good,Working her I learned how to work with others and be a productive team player
good,For a temporary service Manpower is pretty decent. They are able to find you pretty good jobs and they will make sure that you are satisfied with the work you are doing. I was being treated unfairly at a job and my rep made sure that she took care of me and got me a new job. But the rep at the next job was unavailable and not helpful at all. I was then banned from there unfairly. I was at a job that the person I was working with was not teaching me the job and said I couldn't catch on. So I have mixed feelings on that one. Would I work for them again..Sure...Would I complain quicker you betcha!
good,"It is a great way to get your foot in the door with companies,to enhance my skills, management is good, the people i go to work with were nice,the hardest part of the job is sometimes learning the new materials or the training offered does not match the job requirements,the most enjoyable part is learning new skills and meeting new people"

good,"Just love the assignments and the people that I worked with.I would refer others to this company,only thing is there is no stability in this temporary company. The communication here is great! Money is great as well. I basically was in control over insurance needs of the customer's."

good,Continuar el desarrollo de perfiles profesionales y impulsarlos para otros clientes
good,Manpower is a job agency that helps you get jobs that are more suitable within your job qualifications and or abilities to do the various job task. If you are open to any job manpower calls you up and tells you everything you need to know about the job. What I like about manpower you get to go and do different job task it can be for 3days in one place and 1wk in another  place it’s always different and you get to learn different things in each job placement
good,"Gostei de trabalhar na empresa fácil comunicação com RH, pagamento em dia e corretos, se preocupa com bem estar do funcionário."

good,The people there are very nice and helpful. They offer great benefits as in Medical and so forth.  Always available for you when needed. I would go through them again if needed.
good,My review of this position was not what I expected to come across. The time an patient that's needed for this job can be very aggressive. It could change your characteristic of who you are. I believe one the reason this job stays open is because of the many complaints in phone calls you receive. The tasks that required for this job is self sufficient.
good,"Na Manpower groupsolutions , existe uma diversidade de tarefas a serem efetuadas durante um dia tipico de trabalho o que, e optimo porque estimula o trabalhador, contudo em termos de opurtunidades de ascensão na carreira nem sempre os critérios são os melhores utilzados."

good,I Wish it would of stayed on public transit route so I could of stayed working for them really liked working for Manpower they promissed 40 hours and gave it to you pay was on time was alwasy correct if you had any questions they was always there to answer them
good,"For a temp agency it was great, it was a very quick place to find a job, if you just needed quick cash, and although its a bit of a struggle at first, once you developed a good work ethic which did not take long through the agency employee reviews, you could pretty much go anywhere from there. The opportunities provided were great and got me started in the workforce."
good,"Good training and employee friendly environment.  The position description was excellent for each role and allowed synergy within our group.  The responsibilities were clear and not more than one could accomplish in a given week."
good,"Trabaje como perosnal rotativo, muy comprnesible en todo, lo unico malo es que no tenia linea de carrera"
good,Manpower is a temp agency that sends workers out to various companies.   They are very good about finding you assignments if your willing to work.   The do have benefits after 90 days.   They have education assurance program if your with them long enough.  If you want to work and need a job now they will find you an assignment.    However; because it’s a temp agency there is very little long term security.
good,They were good at finding me job assignments. The pay was okay. But assignments were to short. Need long term or more permanent assignments. Good places they sent me
good,75% prestaciones bien y salario en tiempo y forma solo falta más retroalimentación
good,Manpower will help you to keep working but the benefits are poor.and the jobs do not pay enough to excel in the way that I would like to.grow so I am looking for full time continuous work that pays  more.
good,El trabajo con mucho aprendizaje y te dan mucha confianza para que puedas desarrollarte.
good,Working through Manpower was a good experience. I have worked with another staffing company and it was about the same. I had more contact with my representative at Manpower than I did with the other. The job assignment was also fine.
good,"This was the better temp service I have worked for.  They cared about me and how I was doing.  They placed me at a good hour job, and let me take all the time I needed off."
good,While working in this particular warehouse environment and position you weren't just working in one spot you were able to do different things through out the day
good,I thought The working environment varied from my temp positins At manpower I was Every where in carlisle doing jobs some didnt want to do. i still like to work for them yet they have yet to find A new position for me in many years.
good,cold environment yet unorganized overall i really enjoyed working for manpower just wish they went another way about ending my assignment i really didnt like the department they just suck me in
good,Was well managed and will to train to be able to complete needed tasks. The hours were unusual but compensated for it. Easy to talk to management to handle any problems.

good,I love the job it is really easy and laid back. People are very friendly and outgoing. One of the thing most people don't like is liftingng 50 pounds of glass. But I didn't mind not at all.
good,"Good days at work, learned experience, good management, great place to work, difficult was the learning and it took about a couple of weeks to adjust."
good,I enjoyed working remote and working with individuals seeking employment.  Very interesting work.  I learned to always listen first before making any comments.  I sourced 40-100 resumes daily to find the right candidate.  For each job I would find five if possible that fit the role
good,"My typical day for my job role included interviewing candidates, answering calls and vetting applicants. It also included updating applicant details on the database and updating the payroll system. Also I did basic office administration. I learned how to interview a candidate, and how to manage more than 10 files at a time. The workplace that i was in was a friendly environment. The hardest part of my job was processing the files to the system. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people that came from all different backgrounds."
good,I get a call and sow up at the job site they have set for me. I learned a lot of different jobs because it was a temp agency. Managers were always different but mostly good. the only thing hard about the job was not knowing what you would be doing that day until you showed up. I really enjoyed on choosing what jobs i was going to take that day.
good,Manpower itself is a great organization. They helped me get into a permanent job. The job itself was very stressful though so I ended up leaving. I would recommend Manpower to anyone looking to get into a permanent job.

I learned it is crucial to be honest about your self so you're placed where both parties are a good fit.MP reps were always on top of things which made it enjoyable for the most part.

The most enjoyable part was the people, from Manpower to their clients and associates."

It's fun to learn new things at each different job."

good,Kept me working most days. For some places there wasn't enough work because they would hold it until the employee returned.It was hard not knowing if you would be working every day.
good,Manpower has proven to be a stand up company. They see needs for change and adjust to the ever changing markets. The only thing that could improve is communication from Corporate and benefits.
good,Its alright if you really need a job. Great customer service but they put you in jobs with low pay even with your experience. If you just got laid off and need work asap go apply.

good,"I have been with this campaign for 3 and a half years with the chance to change department once. That one opportunity was offered to me when Manpower came on site a little over a year ago. Since that change I have been stuck without the chance to make that next step within the company. Not only are we getting a cut in pay from what the job is asking for but we are also not in a position to even get raises. The benefits are out of this world to purchase, which makes if hard for the working man/woman. If you need a stepping stone, then this is the job.

I have to be completely honest and tell you that if you can't handle people who will more or less always complain then this isn't the job for you. I can only base this on the company I am employed within and not Manpower as an agency as Manpower is excellent. Has to depend where and what you are employed to do as a job but mine is very hard. Management very good. All my co-workers are great. Hardest part is trying to navigate around a computer system that is around 10 years out of date. Most enjoyable part is the excellent training."

About trouble shooting certain office problems in the office whether it was the distribution of mail or how to more effectively do a certain task needed each day* I would then proceed to do it and more often than not I was soo efficient that I got many free lunches etc. Due to my efficiency doing everything from light construction to general office work to some accounting work later on*

good,"i worked 12 hour shifts it was physical and lots of fun. i learned that safety comes first. and when you work so many hours you must take care of your body. co-workers were great, the hardest part of the job was my 60 mile commute everyday. the best part was seeing that check after a 72 hour hard working week."
good,they kept me very busy working with proffesional employees
good,"Not a bad place to work at all. I heard a lot of complaints about this place before I started working there, but it wasn't bad at all. The management is amazing and they really work around your schedule. The only problem I had was with the way the business it represents conducts itself."

good,"Job descriptions varied but overall, I've learned a lot of hands on expierence and worked with many different type of people."
good,Within the 5 years I worked for Manpower I was promoted and have to say Manpower did treat me well. They offer 18 PTO days when you start your employment and once you have been there for 5 years you get 24 days of PTO.
good,I worked for this company as a temp and the experience was great because never had to worry about not enough hours or sent home for lack of work. The employees respect the temps because for the operation to flow they relied on them as we did them so it was a team work. I learned many new things working for them and also got the placement as a full time hire.
good,I would go to work and not have to worry about bad behavior. I learn to be a team member. the management was great. I enjoyed coming to work everyday.
good,I really enjoyed the flexibility of doing this job. Great experiences.
good,"Considero que esta experiencia laboral me permitio aprender tanto a un nivel profesional como personal, tuve la oportunidad de participar en todas las actividades realizadas por la empresa; ya que constantemente realizan actividades de entretenimiento y buscan trabajar en el clima laboral."
good,typical days are not typical because assignments vary
good,Empresa com bom atendimento.
good,con respento a esta empresa de dico lo mismo puesto que es una empresa contratista que me abrio las puertas a weatherford
good,Manpower is a great place to work. I was placed in a long term assignment at a major utility company.
good,"did the job on the line productive crew management fair hardest part was job not long enough, had a good work crew."
good,Es un departamento de quejas y eso no lo dicen en la platica del empleo ni en la entrevista
good,Manegment was great and very helpfull in finding the right job for me at the time.
good,Manpower provides temporary workers to various types of employers. If they offered temp jobs in the IT field I would take another assignment from them. While I worked with them they mostly offered me assignments in factories such as Graham Manufacturing in Mason City. The lack of benefits and improbability of being hired by a client company were the major drawbacks.
good,Working as a contractor for Manpower was a rewarding experience that allowed me to gain professional experience as a help desk analyst which can be added to my resume.
good,"I love working with agencies because you get a variety of assignments. I like learning new things and meeting people. the people, i worked with were always wonderful. Getting over the nervousness of going to a new job. Helping someone solve their issue is the best part to me."
good,"The day starts with a safety meeting to be sure that any safety concerns are delt with, and so every one is aware of the current production schedules. We are also given our work assignments at this time. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. We are given a different line to work on nearly everyday so each person can work safely, efficiently and comfortably in every job in the production area. We rotate hourly to help prevent ergonomic isues and prevent boredom. The people I work with and management are all very helpful and willing to answer questions or give a hand when ever needed. The hardest part of my day is standing for long periods of time in a cold environment."
good,Manpower is a very good temporary staffing agency to work for.
good,"I learned to get a job done well is to be a team player and always have a good attitude. The most important part of this job is the people you work with. Without working as a team with your co workers, the day will move slower."
good,"The people, hours, and pay at this place was all good. Eorking here was very nice and relaxing"
good,Manpower is a very good company to be associated with. I find the placement of jobs have not always been there for my skills. Management is always courteous.
good,"Manpower does have quite a few good jobs which pass through. Manual labour work is what they usually gain which is fine with me. I have learned that work may be available at any place, for any fixed period and if I want to work I must be prepared to put myself out. Everybody that they have put me to work with have good attitudes and the people at Manpower are extremely polite. I have always enjoyed working alongside other people."
good,"Trabalho era rotineiro, sendo que sempre fazia o mesmo serviço, que era repor as mercadorias nas gôndolas dos supermercados, e realizar a promoção dos produtos para os clientes. Aprendi que esse ramo de promoção é bastante lucrativo, porém, muito competitivo. Por ser uma empresa terceirizada, não houve relação com a gerência, só com o representante local. Meu serviço era individual, apesar de a empresa contar com 30 funcionários, cada um era responsável por um supermercado. A parte mais difícil era ter que sempre se adaptar aos supermercados novos que eu não estava acostumado. A parte mais agradável era o convívio com os colegas de função das outras empresas."
good,I did various summer jobs from general assembly to being a supply runner at a renaissance fair requiring proper attire.
good,"Es una empresa de selleccion de pesonal, trabaje para intel especificamente"
good,"Good place to work at. Nice staff. Staff access control, card entry and building alarm control. The most enjoyable part was meeting the staff .There was no hard part. 07.00 to 19.00 , monday to friday. I got laid off because manpower lost the contract to UKBPS. They got there own security in at lower wages. Thank you."
good,"While on assignment, I enjoyed being a training coordinator, however, there were never enough hours in the day. I enjoyed the scheduling and logistical aspects of the position, but there was so much more to the job than that. The difficult part of the job was trying to keep track of every email that was sent in to the general mailbox and getting the customers to fill out the request forms properly. I would end up completing the forms for the customers, but that took up too much time. Management at Manpower was wonderful. RPS was between management when my assignment started, and that was okay, but when the new manager was hired and we were essentially learning together there were issues, which in turn led to my termination."
good,early morning in coming calls giving helpful information to people who ask and help keeping up with the everyday office work.
good,"I have worked as a Medical Secretary both in the NHS and private sector for the last 10 years+. At present I work as a temporary Medical Secretary Band 4 for Manpower UK Ltd based in Swansea and have recently worked at both Morriston and Singleton Hospitals, Swansea. I enjoy the job immensely. Every day is different, though you do have to sustain a certain amount of routine, but this is a job with which you can never have nothing to do. Always meeting different people from all cultures, members of the public and staff members. There is always something new to learn. Working as a medical secretary, you also need to maintain a certain amount of empathy, discretion and also to be flexible and adapt to situations as they present themselves. Sometimes you have to work under extreme pressure, other times you can be working alone. Working in the medical profession can certainly have its highs and lows, and you learn to work in this environment. The job can certainly have its rewards, especially when you have helped patients/relatives and they are reassured. Working to deadlines can be stressful, but I have always enjoyed this part of the job, and to know you have achieved all that is quite satisfying at the end of a very busy and stressful day."

good,"Depending on where I was sent & what type of job I was assigned, my typical day lasted 8 hours. Sometimes it was less. I learned to do various types of jobs, including supervisory, electronic repair/maintenance, machine operation and retail/warehouse operation. I often worked by myself but on occasion worked with other workers on the same type projects. Most of the work was not hard at all, but all jobs required being punctual & thourough in completion."
good,"We would work on a machine and pull tire treads out a hudge heater and roll them up and place them on pallets. I learned how to work long hours, my co-workers were ok and the hard part was to work long hours under very hot conditions."
good,"It's really hard to get hours in and is a really repetitive job. However, the hours are really flexible and you get paid breaks."
good,"The work here is kind of hectic and the hours are demanding but the pay is worth it. Most of the people are friendly, as well as most of the management. the best part is making friends that can keep you entertained and upbeat for 12 hours."
good,Overall I really enjoyed working for this company. My recruiter kept in touch with me. I received a $100 referral bonus for referring a friend of mine. Manpower and the company I was working for had poor communication.

It is to everyone's benefit that the right people are chosen for a job, and CSR has always worked hard to facilitate that kind of quality experience for me.  I take responsibility for myself and my work, and CSR respects me for respecting myself.  When I see a review on here that is so drastically different than the experiences I continue to have with this company, I cannot help but wonder if people are taking responsibility for themselves and their work ethics, or simply expecting the world to hand them everything they want, wrapped up with a bow.

good,"you swipe your card to get in the door and you go change your close and you walk on to the floor and clock in. you go to your station they assign you for the first part of your shift. and you work as a team to get the required number of parts out that are needed. when you go to break you come in and you switch stations. that is a good part of the job I worked that way you didn't get to tired on the same machine for the whole 8-12 hr shifts you work. I learn to work better as a team and I learn to learn new tools and learned how the parts are made. The co-workers I met and worked with you very friendly and helped out when needed and explained everything very well and let you do hands on training instead of just making you stand and watch to learn. the hardest part of my job was speed at first but the longer you are there the faster and easier it gets also the hard part was not knowing if they are going to make you stay over some days, if they tell us in the morning it was ok or told us the day before but some days they would tell us half an hr before our shift was suppose to end. the most enjoyable part of my job was the people I got to work with, the team leaders and the co-works were very nice and help you when you need it,"
