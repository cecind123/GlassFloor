rating,review
bad,"Péssima administração e salários baixos, não possui foco, muito atrasado para uma empresa de TI"
bad,"Hp is one of the worst companies i have worked for. No work life balance, no hikes in salary. Overall experience is just worst and i wish i could give -1 rating"
bad,Terrible company. Terrible management. Terrible owner. Terrible work environment. Terrible boss leader and owner. I would never work for hp contractors again
bad,"Was a Tier 2 tech support specialist at HP Pontiac, supporting dozens of high-volume companies across the world."
bad,Great place to start off with for wasted time. HP has lost the focus and has some sort of cheer squad only. A LOT of experience and knowledge downsizing in the past few years is what will probably be the demise of HP. Sadly
bad,"Wrote software and tests for a large, multi-group software project. I worked with developers in India so I have to work outside of normal hours. Minimal documentation to learn the internal workings of the software. Some HP developers were really friendly, but a few would take every opportunity to stab you in the back, so be careful. One female developer in particular thought she knows how to write perfect code, but she always asked for help installing and launching python."
bad,Culture is awful.  Toxic environment. Terrible management. No communication. Team is dysfunctional. Lack of any kind of recognition.  Management takes credit for your work.
bad,I worked on the Guthy Renker account for HP. It was a scam and HP should be ashamed of itself. They push customer retention extremely hard for products that are complete garbage. I'm ashamed I ever worked there.
bad,"Managment is clueless"
bad,I worked at the new building in Spring as a Data Analyst.  It was just busy work.  Making spreadsheets with pivot tables and vlookups that no one ever looked at.
bad,"Working for HP was tough. No matter what you did to help and grow the company, it wasn't enough. Have a profitable year and still no bonus because the forecast for the next year was bad."
bad,"At the time when I worked at HP it was a terrible time.  HP over paid for the purchase of EDS as they wanted to compete in the IT service industry.  Instead of growing that business, they constantly cut costs and people."
bad,Company just need to pair of arms to do the job. A constant change of supervisor and managers contributed to a lower impact culture affection the overall performance.
bad,"Weak technical and business management -- risk-averse, and locked-into ineffective problem solving methods and techniques. Poor supplier vetting, and extremely vulnerable to marginal outsource vendors."
bad,"Al ser una multinacional americana, esperaba que sea igual a la que trabajé , como IBM , su política interna y el "
bad,Cut throat environment....was never trained thoroughly....14 hr shifts 6 days a week very tiresome job stressful no home life very lazy management unfriendly
bad,"Its the worse place ever to work for, they don't care about their employee, in fact, most of who worked there we made a pack that we never purchase HP product ever again. "
bad,"Very bad company to work for. The pay was extremely low. There was no room to grow, no raises. many lay offs so no job security. Poor management. Would not recommend."
bad,"All work no pay. HP cut pay across the board multiple times. Also , changed workers job titles so they could pay them less upon acquisition. I would avoid HP if possible.."
bad,The management is very attentive and helpful. They are constantly promoting some fun activities.  They have a great culture and listen to new ideas no matter the position.
bad,my actual job was really easy. replace parts. troubleshoot issues. order more parts and communicate with the customers. The only real issue is that HP claims they are a leader in the IT field however they pay like they are at the bottom rung of the IT sector. Also my manager likes to micromanage as much as possible.
bad,HP Enterprise Services is great if all you care about doing is patching systems and marking incident tickets as fixed with out providing appropriate RCA. There's no interest in research and implementing quality solutions using great technology. Avoid at all costs.
bad,"Days are busy"
bad,Not worth the hassle. Overworked underpaid and managemet was the worst. They were very ureasonable with there expectations. Everyday was a disapointment
bad,"HP was not a lot fun to get up and go to everyday. "
bad,"I would not recommend working for HP they do not care how many hours you have to work or if you have a long commute management was very poor, hours were long no recognition for hard work, employee allowed to humiliate you. People laid off a lot."
bad,"Quick paced or no work at all. If no work, sent home. Takes advantage of your abilities and doesn't pay out or give any raises. No room for advancement. Unfair management."
bad,"Absolutely no opportunity for advancement. No benefits. Mandatory lay off. Income may possibly decrees as you continue renewing contract depending on temp/contract company. Flexible work force means the end of job security, certainty and keeping long term friends or relationships. It's a breakdown of the moral fabric. I would only work there if you are losing weight and are hungry...if your losing your house, you probably will anyway since the pay is so low,"
bad,"A computer maker refused to give me a larger or second monitor, they thought a 15"" is big enough was pathetic! I felt defeated everyday and HR did not take any remedial steps"
bad,"Negatives:"
bad,"Didn't work too long - not a proper management."
bad,"The management was constantly in crisis mode. There was no pushing back to senior leadership when a task was impossible, it was still pushed down to the analysts who did all the work."
bad,"Management is terrible. Favoritism runs rampant."
bad,The warehouse itself is very small in size. Very quiet. It is a lonely job . working alone most of the time. No team work. used a rf scanner  and documented inventory
bad,"Split company into HPE and HP Inc, wasted tons of money on transition and still performing poorly.  Told employees HP Inc was going to be a startup...yet funding wasn't there to continue endeavor"
bad,"As was the case with DXC, the companies primary objective was to reduce operating expense by shifting jobs to low cost offshore locations. The environment was stressful due to the cost threat of workforce reduction."
bad,I was laid-off 2 months after being awarded for being one of the highest billing employees by HP upper management.  Upper management and HR would not help.  I am a single parent and take care of my 74-year-old mother.
bad,Very stressful and cut-throat once you reach an age close to retirement they lay you off. I seen this happen to many co workers over several years. BEWARE!!!
bad,Wasn't enough man power. managers had problems with other managers nobody works together unorganized just a poor company to work for wouldn't recommend at all
bad,"HP gets a good reputation somehow. If you like being tortured by customers then be sure to work here. If you like gossiping managers and unfair pay and bonuses, be sure to work here. Do not come here with a genuine personality, put on your fake enthusiasm and be prepared to pretend for the rest of your employment."
bad,"this is the most stressful work environment I have ever been in. I experienced a senior team member who had more than 10 years with EDS and ""HP"" go off during a regular project meeting and just meltdown mentally due to stress she was feeling"
bad,"Super slow paced and boring. Management breathes down your neck and their claim for ""work-life balance"" is not even close to accurate. They're doing mass lay-off right now too."
bad,"Not a bad place to work if you like working for 5 different companies at once. So many different accounts to memorize, lots of reading and scripts. Hours are not that bad though and pay was decent."
bad,the company down sized sending all its work to mexico and let go all of their manufacturing departments. but not before hanging us by a thread giving us hope that we would have jobs. and slowly taking all of our hours away. you had to show up every day but after driving there 50% of the time telling you there was not enough work so you have to go home. and if you didn't show up they gave you points to determine if you were worth keeping.
bad,"I uses to like HP, the first time i worked there, it wasnt to bad, decent pay, good hours, no advancement, but the job culture was ok. Now, its trash, complete trash, they pay you well below what they should be, no chances for advancement, no benefits, at all. Do Not go work for them, unless you have no other options!"
bad,"Each and every day you will get to know different type of people as you work with different people to resolve issues "
bad,"Expand your idea of value. To stand out in today's market, define your value in human terms, not in business terms. ..."
bad,"I was very happy with my job, they sold it to overseas contractor for lower wages. I was very upset, but they did give me the push I needed to return to school."
bad,"Not enough pay for the work you do, there was a lot of work and the closers where making the money but they would not let you close, even though it said sales rep."
bad,"HP is not a good organisation to work with. Lots of work pressure and lie they will say while joining and do not have a growth path. "
bad,Assist managing and storage of IT equipment. Repaired IT equipment when required and also gave out loaner laptops to company employees when their laptop was being repaired by the companies onsite IT support technicians.
bad,"Worst Company i've worked for. Lied about salary and working hours and even the actual job role. "
bad,Bad politics not good to work ; culture is pathetic and is s very slow company to work with. Huge loss to mental health and physical health prior to this i was happy
bad,The front line managers typically had 22-25 direct reports with unrealistic expectations for management oversight.  The working hours were long and the upper level management ruled using fear tactics.
bad,hp products ferguson has to be the worst job I've had so far they are very unsafe they don't train they workers and the operating equipment is horrible
bad,poor leadership team. every other week the company sold the contracts and all employees became contractors. i gave my two weeks and the manager was so upset with it he lost his temper and told me i would never work for hp again
bad,"First and foremost, the main reason is the pay."
bad,"Taking calls from people who ordered makeup on a subscription plan regarding their issues with the plan. Originally taking calls for tech support on smartphones before that department was outsourced. Bids for schedules were ignored. The makeup office ""drafted"" people for overtime, even whilst they were on vacation that they had requested, like I had."
bad,"Not valid."
bad,By far the worst job ever! I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. The managers are all about favoritism and if your a minority goodluck because they will layoff in a heartbeat.
bad,I like the people I work with; average work day is 8 to 5pm; good place to work if you don't want to work hard and just collect a paycheck; don't recommend working here
bad,Job is stressful. Management is uneducated. Bunch of young folks who doesn't have a clue of their jobs. Butt kissers and will stab each others to get ahead.
bad,"Moved into HP when EDS was taken over, having really enjoyed my career and roles with EDS and ITSA previously the continual rounds of redundancies and cuts was scarring"
bad,"Was one of the best company when I started & now its just another PC manufacturer . Not great product been designed now . With PC & Printer market so crowded, not sue how long they can survive"
bad,"Very bad organization where false promises are given.Big mistake I joined the organization."
bad,I start work in good atmosphere. I learnt how to prioritize the work according to Turn around time finish the work. Management is good and supportive. Co-workers support a lot to help when there is a need.
bad,High stress and long hours without compensation. No job security with this company. they moved our jobs to Mexico to take advantage of the slave labor. A good place only for newly college graduates to receive some experience and then move on.
bad,There are many reasons to say this but it's true because you will not get the recognition based on your work here but you will get it for all the useless stuffs.
bad,"Initial training period was cut in half and ongoing training was even worse. For example, a course that normally takes one week to complete was cut down to four hours!  The corporate trainer admitted this and he was disgusted too. HP is just another greedy corporation that has unrealistic expectations for their employees, and they pay peanuts compared to their competition. It's no wonder that half of the desks at the ""Sales Center"" are empty, and they're always looking for new suckers ... uh, I mean employees. Good riddance!"
bad,"poor management poor supervision "
bad,"on an average I worked from 8am to 8pm and some time with no lunch, so when the opportunity came for me to get laid off, I did not argue against my manager when he asked me to pack my stuff and hit the door; stress level in the work place were too high!"
bad,"Management is poor at best, they do not promote a team envirnoment, they do not want employees to advance. I would not recommend HP as a place to work."
bad,management was very unfair they showed favoritism to certain employees. They would tell you to do things one way and than change and tell you to do it different.
bad,stay away and don't touch with 10 feet pole. HP is in process of laying off all experienced workers and moving all work offshore with major impact on enterprise customers. Cutting corners at every opportunity. Middle management jumping ships in a bid to leave before being fired.
bad,It was a learning experience. Had to deal with a lot of drama amongst the supervisor and some employees. A lot of unfairness going on
bad,"If you see ""CPL"" associated with any job offer - steer clear."
bad,The company always bring in external managers who are just there to have their employees support the process but are never capable of introducing new capabilities or enhancing existing ones.  No sense of innovation at all.
bad,"Terrible - do not join this sinking ship. No progression, no prospects, poor salary. The Graduate program is awful, management is unprofessional"
bad,not good managment. Thats probably why they went under. Wouldnt recommend. Have you work and not pay overtime. management has no clue how to manage unless your friends with them
bad,"Overall experience is good in HP. The work environment comparing to my previous company is good"
bad,Confidential - This information would be reserved for an interview setting and will not be generally shared here. This is the more appropriate forum.
bad,"It is none of your business, what my Opinions is of this company. So do not ask me about it. the company will be out od business in the next 3 to five years."
bad,Product of Workplace Reduction.  So I need a job.  I worked for EDS for over 20 years before HP took over.  HP did not have the EDS culture.  I missed that.
bad,"Hp was a dynamic company. it has gone through its struggles. However, the people who make up the company with carry it through"
bad,"I would not recommend working for HP.  Constant lay-offs mean many-many workers fear layoffs, and the forced distribution performance reviews make it worse...  Many workers make their co-workers look bad (steal credit for their work, etc.) so that they will look good...  So that they can keep their jobs.  Cut-throat workplace politics, is what I am saying!"
bad,"Its good & very learning to everyone."
bad,"constant fear of losing your job, 60 hour work weeks, no raises or bonuses.  even the one perk of working from home is going away."
bad,"Em 2014 a HP anunciou o projeto de divisão em duas empresas, para separar a atividade de material de informática (computadores e impressoras) do setor de serviços para as empresas."
bad,I was hired for a Contract for eight months. About 90% of us were let go within five weeks. They were very unorganized............
bad,"Very little innovation combined with situational ethics. If you do not document everything you do someone else will surely take credit for it. To actually do anything requires getting approval from all kinds of people who have nothing to do with the finished product. It is hard to imagine a more dysfunctional place on earth. there is so little money invested in R&D the products are repackaged each year with minor improvements. The minor improvements come from business partners who also provide the same technology to HP's competition. There is no room for advancement unless you are part of the old crowd in Houston where the cult of cronies climb on top of the work pile just as it works to completion. This way they can look like they are doing something. "
bad,"They did not have a budget plan for their project.  The team was scattered across the globe and can not get anything done.  While working there, they misspelled my name and I tried calling support and could not get anything done."
bad,this job is too far out and the pay is not worth it  all you are making is gas money. i wouldnt refer anyone to this place short breaks and lunches
bad,"Regular corporate enviroment only amplified. Management never knows how the real product is acheived. No appreciation for a job well done, but exceptional attention paid to political correctness."
bad,"Upper management needs to spend more time working and less time looking to see if staff are working and looking at metrics.  "
bad,"Terrible,. Give me a job i didnt even apply for. for a wage that was alot less than i had left my previous role for."
bad,"My exposure with HP is with one particular state government project, so I cannot judge other projects.  However, from what I have experienced, HP as a company does not support it's employees from a training or advancement perspective.  It's solution for growth is to encourage taking early retirement, layoff workers, divide itself into two parts so the undesirable part can be sold. It is a company in decline and I would avoid it should you have other options."
bad,"It was Nice to work in Reputed company like Hewlett Packard, i have learnt a lot about accounting process ."
bad,Ride was to long and money was too short. Good benefits and the schedule was good
bad,HP Storage environment is a very toxic environment with no value for contribution. I would not recommend this environment to anyone.
bad,"Hard work is never awarded, unless you know someone who is a permanent employee then you're not going to move up in the company, When your getting on floor training, they don't train you on the important things you need to know you basically learn the hard way which could cost you your job. most of your co-workers can be very competitive and will stab you in the back to get ahead even though your supervisor will lecture you about teamwork. The best part of being there is clocking out to go home."
bad,I may off been to old for that type of work. But it was basically low wages and getting yelled out 8 hours a day. Perfect job for an 18 year old not somebody in their 30s.
bad,But people who are working or talented they are least bothered of there carrer
bad,Worked there 6 years and received 1 minimal raise even though I received high ratings at all my reviews.  Always looking over your shoulder for Work Force Reductions(layoffs).
bad,I worked on a federal contract that HP took over in 2012. I was forced to take a 12K pay cut in conjunction of HP taking over. I lost all benefits as well. They eventually got rid of every person that had been with the previous company with exception of two people. I trained 4 people and once the last person was up to speed they let me go.
bad,"I worked for HP for 5 years. I had 5 managers in that time and never met any of them face to face. I worked on a major account for them and then was let go as part of their Work force Reduction plan. "
bad,"No work-life balance.  No vision.  People keep getting laid off so more work goes to those who remain, but there are no pay increases."
bad,Mucho tiempo de pie sin tener posibilidades de hacer nada. No dan compesación económica por las ventas realizadas.
bad,"Failed to mention went from 200 Investigators to 30."
bad,A great company to work with. Learning in a culturally comfortable environment.
bad,"One star it’s too much, they deserve 0 star! Almost all employees are contractors and they don’t want full or part time to employ they use system and avoid benefits! H P and staffing agency take advantage or worker both of them uses workers. Some employees work in H P ten or more years without any benefits, that is in sane."
bad,"Company closed"
bad,"extinction level event just waiting to happen "
bad,Tough job with little pay. Not much time or chance for advancement. Most people in my dept. were let go within a year of starting.
bad,hp is a good place to work. Looking for Job in Hyderabad due to relocating to my permanent address.
bad,"no direction, poor management, no job security, poor compensation"
bad,When the company was owned by Digital Equipment and then by Compaq it was the best company to work for.  They took care and cared about the employees.  Once HP took over the culture and management alienated everyone.  Will never even entertain a position with HP EVER again.  Even if it makes me homeless
bad,"Première expérience de travail, pas d'évolution professionnelle, et aucune possibilité de progresser."
bad,"This is a dead end job.  If you are desperate, take it until you can find something better.  Read the 1000 reviews, they don't like.  If you can make it to a Management position your set.  Anything else you will hate your life here.  My job is easy as pie and still just being here sometimes makes me want to self-com-bust. The morale is absolute miserable.  The turnover causes a new class to be started of new hires ever other month.  It's just not a good place to work.  Again, management on Salary your set, Hourly you will never move up unless your EXTREMELY lucky.  I know people who have been here for over 10 years still making 12$ an hour, and they are great people, just don't know any better.  Good luck!"
bad,"I worked for HP Enterprises for 4 years as Kelly Service contingency staff."
bad,"Was a prior authorization utilization review nurse for HP through a temp agency.  The whole account was started without being properly set up, and, employees were not properly trained.  Horrible management that expected you to work OT daily due to their own short sightedness.  They place incompetent people as your lead and do nothing about them when everyone complains about how inappropriate they are. Listened to all of the regular employees complain about a multitude of issues on a daily basis.  Typical caddy bunch of people stuck in an office and have nothing better to do than worry about what everyone else is doing.  I witnessed a few brown noser's pounce on their leader as soon as something bad happened in their personal life, and had them demoted so they would quit.  The motto there was, once you are hired, it takes an act of God to get rid of you.  So, you know what kind of ridiculous group of people you end up with!!!!  I eventually could take no more.  If you want to be absolutely miserable and work with a bunch of ""little"" people who think that they somehow have way more power than you, then this would be the dream job for you.  "
bad,The management is not willing to change and they are not willing to allow their people to grow. Micromanagement is not the way to handle adults.
bad,Micromanaged.  No opportunities for advancement and/or learn.  Very bad practices like blackmailing the employees in order to make them work more.
bad,"This place is dysfunctional, management is very incompetent, Furthermore they bring you in & place you in positions that have nothing to do with your work experience, they do promotions based on sexual preference mostly of the female persuasion, & cross training is frowned upon heavily, it is not a place for a Male to try & advance if it is not based on nepotism. The only good thing was, that I did learn some thing's do to the fact I new someone there who trained me on building servers. Finally as a contractor you will not get a fair shake & everyday you come to work, they will remind you that you can be fired & are expendable. "
bad,A typical day at work
bad,Not a very good place to work if you are expecting to be treated like a human. very poor management and no job future even if you are at the top in stats.
bad,"They suffer from a lot of problems that occur when a company gets too darn big. I think life is hard as it is awesome if you are a director, but if not it is simply hard."
bad,"It was pretty much a sweat shop with no benefits,long hours ,and no oppertunity for advancement,no vacation time"
bad,"payroll issues, no pay raises, good customer service not important to the company"
bad,order picker scan the parts then did the paper work then loaded to the trucks with
bad,"Dead end job, low pay.....bad employer"
bad,"It is very hard to describe my experience with HP: everything, but absolutely everything was awful, particularly management."
bad,this is one of the worst places to work at - the dept supervisor's dont care anything about your life. your like a working horse and they just want to whip you until you drop! if you dont meet their numbers after training your out the door! that is why they have such a huge turn around and always hiring! its not about the employees and training them to be more efficient its about trying to make them look good with their numbers and if you dont YOUR out the door!!
bad,"It is not very structured, rules change all of the time. supervisors are of no help because they have no idea what they are doing. The pay is not very competitive for the work we are required to do"
bad,"Promised jobs, worked for them for 1 1/2 years and then no job! Managers and supervisors conspired to fire employees only to hire their family members."
bad,uptight and low paid temps workers.This company has temp workers that out number the perm staff by a ratio of 10 to one
bad,"Yes, the company in Frankfort is called HP (was EDS), which is a very respectable company that normally recruits well-educated, business-minded individuals in its operations, but in Frankfort, KY, the company has let its ""leadership"" recruit farmers, warehouse workers, et al., to do even technical work that should be done by at LEAST college-educated, somewhat intelligent workers. Personnel who represent the company are an embarrassment, and I wish HP actually knew what they have. They should never have a ""liaison"" or any other type of representative (i.e., for healthcare providers) of the company make presentations in front of state government and say things like ""We done did this..."" or ""They wasn't..."" How embarrassing to HP!"
bad,"working for the NMCI contract will ensure that management will not look out for you, will not help you advance and will not continue any education or training."
bad,I did not like the position but I need a paycheck. Don't care to share the duites.
bad,"Did not enjoy my experience, always restructuring and hire you in at one salary and it never changes, they will always find an excuse"
bad,Not a good place to work...no advancement...promotion are from the outside
bad,Paid minimum wage no chance of training or advancement despite the usual broken promise. Management was largely unhelpful  and rigid . Poor communication from top to bottom
bad,Working environment was unsafe an not clean. Insufficient resources and equipment to do you job. the management was not flexible and managed by intimidation
bad,I found working at HP to be a disappointing experience communication was very poor work areas never set up properly orders not there for you to start work there's a lot of time wasted due to poor supervision and bad planning
bad,"I worked there for almost 5 years. If you're going to get good at fixing computers, you better network with people that know how. Training is a run down so they'll just throw you on a phone and make you figure it out. Again, network for your answers. I couldn't get an hour off work. The ""management"" is insane. It's all politics. Buddy/buddy stuff and a middle school mentality. I was told not to go to the bathroom unless it was my scheduled break. Then they assigned a woman manager to me that would threaten me, yell at me, and even spank me. When I was forced to report it to HR, they fired me for reporting it. If you work for HP in RR, you will be a knot of stress until the day they fire you. If you can't fix a computer, you'll be ""manager"" quickly. They fire good people and keep the lazy ones. Each desk has a ball and chain under it."
bad,"A empresa não da oportunidade de crescimento"
bad,"This was years ago between 2008 and 2013. I really enjoyed my job first as a Senior Support Coordinator until HP bought out the company I was working for."
bad,"HP is controlled by, and run for the benefit of large investors. They manage only the cost side of the balance sheet, and figure that's good enough. There is zero job security, and no accountability. Run; save yourself."
bad,"I was hired in September, 2014 to re-engineer their dashboards and business intelligence. I was constantly fighting for my job from day one. The negative atmosphere is all over due to the screw ups they made by acquiring bad performing companies. They let go the entire software organization in June, 2015. It is sad when companies like these hire and layoff people due to their bad business judgement decisions.There is no accountability in the Senior leadership."
bad,"EDS was a great company to work for they understood what outsourcing IT managed services was all about."
bad,In working for HP you are a number not an individual.  It is all about the bottom line for this company.  Very immoral and unethical behavior by management.
bad,Too many worforce reductions to be a reliable job. Very stressfull and high turn over rate. Shorthanded and not much support from anyone. The hardest part is having a support team that is overseas and you cant understand them.
bad,"HP believes in off shoring all U.S. technical jobs. Drastically Reduced employee benefits. No raises unless super performer."
bad,"Day at HP will be always a stress less day and we get to contact many people from different team and different regions so you can explore yourselves."
bad,If you want to be hacked to pieces you can work for this company. Its a dying dinosaur with little to offer. its a total waste of time. Stay away from this company only reason to work here is last resort.
bad,"Empresa que não valoriza o trabalho do profissional, eu trabalhei em escala 6x2 e com salário de míseros 730,00, tinha que trazer comida de casa, 12 horas por dia. Trabalhando revesadamente entre diurno e noturno. Foi um período que aprendi muito sobre portaria, como tratar as pessoas, como manter a segurança da empresa e dos funcionários. Porém na primeira oportunidade de um novo emprego eu abracei e saí da HP."
bad,"Management sucked. Job was tedious, hard to get hours. Had to travel an obscene amount for someone who did not live in the area. Stopped taking out taxes without telling me."
bad,"The last 3 years with HP was not pleasant, long hours no rewards either professionally or financial, constant layoffs with no regards to the clients we are contracted to support."
bad,"Customer is number one with all are techs. "
bad,"A typical work day is 15 days, when we started New Transition (New Business for HP Servers from US ). Days consist of meeting, calls, training, Presentation, project review and office activities."
bad,Everything is now focused on getting rid of the PC business as quickly as possible and simply branding someone else's product with an HP logo.
bad,"•	Configuring IP address, subnet mask and gateway address on routers and hosts install equipment and test it"
bad,I worked in a team which had an unachievable high target set by management
bad,"ok ....."
bad,"The leadership at HP is horrible, at least in the junior executive and mid-management ranks. They hire mostly overseas employees to come to America and be managers at cut-rate salaries. Most of these managers don't know any of HP's corporate policies to include policies around sensitive HR policies (HIPPA, use of Corporate Card, etc.). While HP has started to look better on their Balance Sheet, I still think they have a long way to go with culture and with consistency in leadership."
bad,"The absolute worse corporate culture with the most blatant disregard for both employees and customers out of all the companies I've worked for. HP encourages sub-standard behavior among its leadership. "
bad,HP looks good on the resume. Not many good things to say about HP. Constant layoffs.
bad,"A typical day would be be read the latest updates on the products and solutions following with customer meetings to understand the requirements and propose solutions that meet the customers with HP portfolio of products. It is exciting and fulfilling to know that customer places the trust and belief to buy your solution. It only should live that way with total customer satisfaction."
bad,"I was thier as a temp. I was not treated with the utmost respect. The people and company were not great to work for. This was a  assisgnment. This was the first assignment I felt uncomfortable "
bad,(Invent ) what a joke ! They seem to buy the technology they neded.
bad,Lots of room for improvement in management and board of directors.
bad,No day is the same. Even though the work is easy you are always on the move which is great and coworkers are awesome too.
bad,A typical day at hp would contain the following:
bad,Most of my days I would attend meetings with my region teams and meet with my partners on upcoming training events.
bad,hp es buena empresa los canales son malos mas dycs soporte
bad,"Management op afstand internationaal bepaald zonder consensus in basis land."
bad,"poor management, stressful environment, lack of career perspective, long hours of work not fairly compensated, work reduction program layoffs discriminated against older employees."
bad,"Became an HP employee via acquisition.  Poor merger, poor planning, no idea on how to integrate.  After 4 years, the division was spun off in the HP\HPE split and was jettisoned to HPE.  Again no raises, multiple & continual layoffs, followed by being spun off in the HPE\CSC spin\merge that created DXC Tecnhology, where the no raise and continual layoffs are occurring once again"
bad,"Fui iludido... a empresa realmente tem uma teoria muito boa, mas para quem é da linha de frente é esquecido e barrado pelos gestores mal preparados para liderar."
bad,My experience (dates back to 2010) was a horrible culture.   Company had people convinced they were fortunate to have a job.  Top performers were not recognized.  Management was terrified of the changes coming from executives.   Survival mode was prevalent.
bad,Good work culture and benefits. most enjoyable part of my job is meeting customer and HP gives lot of opportunities for customer facing and technical job
bad,"Management controlled internationally with positions transferred back and forth with the management control, which causes strife and the lack of job security."
bad,Una experiencia buena  pero no muy satisfecha con el salario y horario.
bad,"dont work for DXC unless you want to be under threat of redundancies and no cost of living payrise"
bad,I would not recommend that anyone work for this company.  They do not consider employee's input and do whatever they want.  My position was off-shored without me ever being told about it until a week before they let me go.
bad,I was apparently hired by Mercury Interactive to increase the body count before being acquired by Hewlett-Packard. I was almost immediately laid off after the acquisition.
bad,"No basic level of interaction or guidance from team members"
bad,Management is horrible at this place and its all a matter of time before this company will be in the record books as a has been.
bad,Management more concerned with the appearance of quality than actually making improvements and delivering real customer value.  Entire quality department resigned due to inept management at all levels.  Innovation is nonexistent.
bad,"""Contract side of things"""
bad,"Una empresa buena, pero sin chances de crecimiento, falta mucha organizacion de la gerencia."
bad,The company has been completely dysfunctional in recent years.  The constant changes make job security a challenge and job continue to move off shore.  The company is only focused on quarterly results and lacks the long term direction to ensure stability and growth.
bad,"Most of the time if you are in the know of the management coterie, you will get an opportunity to advance or else you are relegated to tasks which will not help you advance. Politics between teams plays a big role. Such a large number of temp H1 holders, without much of ability are inserted in the company that, including for some lower to middle management positions, that their inability to  appreciate and retain talent, has made working at HP a joke. Quite often these temp workers tend to bring in their relatives and friends in the company through political means, irrespective of  their abilities, and hence the employees who really can contribute get pushed out. "
bad,just terrible. management did not back us up against abusive customers calling in for help. no training was provided at all even though all of us begged for training at every meeting. No raises for anyone. Almost no bonuses to speak of. Moral is in the toilet.
bad,"When having a  team meeting, I always set everything up,and after the meeting. everyone would able to keep on moving. It's give everyone a change to have a good productive day."
bad,"I don't know much about this company. I didn't work their long at all. I know that I was treated unfairly and I would never recommend anyone to work their. One of my friends has worked their for several years with no raises, promotions, etc, she really dislikes it."
bad,"Employees were rude and unhelpful. Some areas had great employees and managers. Unfortunately, I did not work in those areas."
bad,The United States citizens should stop supporting HP products and services.  Typical day is like going to a Morgue.  Management are clueless and have no direction.  Coworker that are left are good people to work with.  Training my replacements before being terminated.  I enjoyed everything about my job.
bad,"Badly managed and very unorganized.  No money for training and staff left to train themselves on complex systems.  No staff morale and most people are unhappy and looking for work elsewhere.  Also, all new starters are started off on low wages compared to competitors with the promise of pay rises that never materialize."
bad,Al hacer evaluaciones no eran tomados en cuenta los comentarios de los analistas
bad,"I can understand why they are no longer in business, no structure, were not honest with employees. The actual coworkers were very knowledgeable and great to work with"
bad,"If you want to be trapped in a role you don't like, work with people you don't like, people that bully and make you feel useless, with no salary increase and expected to do the role of 3 people for years and then get made redundant then this is the place for you!"
bad,"For a big company, they pay only minimum wage and don't promote within no matter how hard you work they don't appreciate you."
bad,"In review of E-Strategies, which was a small staffing agency located in Texas, management was extremely poor. Raises were held back until Hewlett Packard caught wind and released the contract agency/holder. Hewlett Packard graciously kept the contracted agents on board. I also appreciate the knowledge I gained in this position."
bad,"I spent 3 years working for HP as a contractor. This company has zero tolerance policy for contractors, which results in a revolving door of employees. Unless you are a full-time worker, any and everything can result in termination."
bad,Very stressful environment. Overworked average of 60-70 weeks.  worked just about every weekend for 3 years. To many Chiefs not enough Indians!
bad,Managers do not back you up. You are required to buy office supplies out of your own pocket. Even though IT will offer to purchase monitors etc the manager will not approve the purchase.
bad,It's not too bad working here but it could be better. The contractors are not appreciated and we do a lot of work. This company is not too good. I don't like coming to work wondering if I'm going to be fired next. Some of the management is poor.
bad,"These is scenario for Travel group at EDS, from Director to senior developers.. crazy seniors(egoist people) feel bad and react very loudly about Junior's tiny matter Even do not provide feedback to junior and directy complained related Manager.(Just because somebody complained for them)"
bad,"The most hostile management, everyone covering their own back. Always a turf war. I was told ""contractors are like shoes, if I don't like them I throw them away""."
bad,"HP (formerly EDS in this location) is far separated from HP headquarters. They hire farmers as managers and liaisons to the government who probably barely have GEDs. One manager, ""Bernice,"" is supposed to represent the company, with their $200 million account, but when she speaks to groups, even state government, she talks about how ""we done did it like they was..."" I'm only in it for the salary, and even that is pitiful now that HP cut salaries by ~40%"
bad,"Bad management that make you feel useless as much as they can to justify not paying you. Out dated projects. Worst place I worked."
bad,Really disorganised place to work. Team leader was a bully and all in all a really dreadful place to work. The canteen was reasonable but took about 10 minutes to walk there.
bad,"There is not sync between top and mid management. Policies are formulated at top, and with good intent. Mid level management is not able to deliver result. The Mid management is not at all competent. and since employee has to deal day to day with mid level management, so employee life is pathetic."
bad,The company hired a slice and dice person who came in and tore hpe apart at the seams. Used to be a great company and now it will be lucky to survive another year.
bad,"at Director and VP level. bad processes, very outdated. older employees horde data for job security. HR is not there to help you. can't trust what management promises."
bad,no work life balance - horrible work culture - horrible pressure put on work leads and work teams - wasn't necessary. The constant downsizing was horrible for morale and something should be done to fix the constant downsizing like right sizing to begin with.
bad,Terrible - the worst job  I ever had.  Leadership during my time was out to line their pockets with money at the expense of the employees.  Much restructuring since I was employed so tings hopefully have changed.
bad,In my opinion there are far better organisations to work for that value their staff and treat them in a fair way.  Most of the people that I worked with no longer work at HPE and have moved on.
bad,no employee loyalty.  Focus on staff reduction at all costs.  I would not recommend HP as the work life is high stress on big layoffs all the time.  Everyone is thinking when will they be next.  Leadership does not shield the team.
bad,"Low engagement/lack of culture"
bad,"I was originally very excited when working at this company.  It quickly soured when I had become overworked and was forced to work mornings and nights with no help."
bad,"HP was an amazing company to work fro back in the day.   Now it's a shell of it's former self.   Between bad M&A's, CEO scandals, proxy fights, spin offs and the general employee morale that was awful when myself and 55K employees were laid off.   They use you, chew you up and spit you out and make sure the door doesn't kick you in the butt on the way out.  Layoffs are a dime a dozen to HP."
bad,"Not worth going here. Skip it. Toxic culture."
bad,"I loved working at Hewlett Packard (digital, Compaq, HP, HPe) until about 5 years ago.   I LOVE logistics and LOVE my immediate managers and the people I work with.   I love all of the collaboration and support of co-workers.   The work has always been challenging and fun. "
bad,Hewlett Packard lost its old culture through the years having removed benefits that impacted the financial stability affecting the employees  retirement benefits.
bad,Schedule always beats quality so the managers can get their bonuses and move along. Quality work is not appreciated or encouraged by the business leadership.
bad,"This company doesn`t know how to keep their employees. If you don`t  do as they say you`re gonna get fired. That`s what I have to say. And you better apply a job there through the company, don`t accept any help from HR companies"
bad,Buenos compañeros y buena predisposición para trabajar
bad,An environment where all your management up to executive levels are quitting or retiring as fast as possible and the new management doesn't take the time to learn your name.  It doesn't matter though because raises get suspended for years across the board.  Lucky to have left when I did.
bad,Always plenty to do to keep busy.  I mostly worked from home and created my own schedule.  There wasn't any chance for promotion or  any increase to salary.
bad,"- Conducting Product Audit."
bad,work is hectic everyday. compensation does not match the amount of work that is being handled daily. employees doesn't really have work life balance
bad,"HP is an international company, We are currently  doing the invoicing for our client Procter & Gamble."
bad,"HP is going through a large transition.  It is in the news, such activity is always difficult.  I hope they are successful in the split of the corporation."
bad,"Love the work, the pay and ability to advance is very poor.  Management are all very close friends allowing for no chance of advancement."
bad,"Management does not know how different segments work and refuses to meet customer needs as they are blinded by the ""need"" for metrics."
bad,"In the midst of a turnaround, but it's not turning around as expected."
bad,"I am here as contractor and having worst work life ever."
bad,"from 7.00am till midnight work continues. A lot of work, plus phone calls. No one knows whats happening. People that needs to be fired will stay in the job. I learned one thing when I was at HP. DO not work hard they will fire you! Management does not know whats happening and do not have desire to understand whats going on. HP should not be in software business. they are the ones who paid 13 billion for Autonomy and then found out it does not worth more than 2-3 billion. and no one got fired but they will play with the bread money of poor people who work. There is age and gender discrimination. I do not have any enjoyable part of the job I will ever remember. hardest part is dealing with incompetent people all the time."
bad,"HP was like a huge high school.  Very unprofessional.  My supervisor always told us and made it very clear that ""he doesn't give anyone raises"" which meant no room for advancement; that's very discouraging. There was no enjoyable part about the job."
bad,"When the company was EDS it was a good company, however poeple at the facility were nasty to each other and were extremely"" two faced"". The leader of the facility is not capable of running that faclity and should be immediately let go because he has ran the facility into the ground. Clients are lied to on a daily basis and they preach accountability, however they do not hold anyone accountable. That was a waste of 10 years of my life that i wont get back."
bad,"HP is still trying to figure out who they are. Overall they are too big, and management is out of touch. I would not advise anyone to accept a position with this company unless you want to feel like a number, not a person. I did not have the tools to do my job to the best of my ability. Was without a computer for nearly two weeks because my hard drive crashed. Need I say more?"
bad,"Worst place to work, everyone is competing with each other and the competition is about who spends more time at work. One never ending project."
bad,Horrible company stay away there is no future and low pay.  Dead end job exploiting the less fortunate.  Came here right outta  college had limited options then
bad,Level of expectation regarding job was completely misleading.  Management was not engaged.  Workplace culture was not inclusive.  Just a bad experience all around.
bad,"Several layers of management. Management unsure of the requirements of staff members. Receive way too much corporate emails from all over the organization which you expected to read and or respond to. "
bad,"The HP way made HP great, and then it was abandoned. Why? If a principle or principles helped make a company great, why would new leadership think that they could do better once the mantle of leadership was handed to them?"
bad,EDS employees were treated badly after HP bought EDS. The selections on the 401 k plan never made money. They cut our salaries and had layoffs just about every year. They refreshed hardware and software only when they had to.
bad,Management lacks leadership abilities. No sense of leadership or career development . Politics and very clique like atmosphere. No idea who HR is or where they sit. Just not a good place in my opinion
bad,"My job experience at HP was often frustrating and, at the end, my contract ended due to my position being off-shored. I would not recommend anyone with serious career objectives to apply at HP."
bad,"Worst Place to work.  You are just a resource like a laptop or a door stop.  There is no employee Development .  When Management makes a bad decision the Team pays the price. Mass  Layoffs, due to  HP Leadership bad decisions. Leadership continues with impunity and the Employee who actually is the product suffers in layoff.  HP is a terrible place to work and poorly lead corporation in my opinion.  Armatures in Sr Leadership that get the benefit of the doubt  and immunity to their mistakes  while throwing their employees under the bus."
bad,"If you don't mind being employed for only a year or less, then this is the place for you. Every year they ""eliminate"" thousands of positions. Just doesn't make any sense. They spend way too much time and money hiring new people, only to let them go. Terrible business practice."
bad,"There was no work to be done, but they kept hiring a new 100 people every week for a tax break. I was the only skilled IT professional & wound up doing any work that was ever available while working with felons that had absolutely no interest in the jobs they were hired for. There was no work to be done 90% of the time & we stood there losing our minds. HP does not hire people. They only hire through a select list of contractors. There are very few actual employees. One man had been there for 10 years & was still denied his request to be an employee & called it quits. You have to walk in & out of metal detectors to use the restroom. It was a 5 month prison sentence, but at least they feed their captives in prison."
bad,"Devido algumas ações realizadas, não posso comentar essas informações."
bad,there is no job security... they can and will send people away if it benefits them. rumors always present. management is decent and the pay is average. if you want to advance you have to move far far away from where you live.
bad,I had a terrible experience at HP. I don't know how a company that big can treat there employees so badly.  Our Director had us working 16 to 18 hr days and if we complained or needed time with family he always threatened to terminate our contracts. His rule was we work 24hrs a day. Called my personal cell phone any time day or night requesting work to be done immediately.  When they laid my team off he didn't have the spine to talk to the team. He made me the contractor tell them. One contractor was laid off by email. I was laid off after many promises to keep my contract. None of his team members have never lasted more then 5 months before he lets them go or they quit.
bad,"I'm not even sure where to start so i will start from the beginning"
bad,I Search a New Work Place with new challange to increase my growth and personality.
bad,Not enough challenge or IT related work. I feel this is more an administrative job than an IT related job
bad,"Administrative managers promote teamwork, but they do not lead by example. As a result, people are not happy or inspired."
bad,Not a pleasant place to work. Creativity and outside the box thinking are not valued or encouraged.
bad,"This is a tough review for me to write. When I first went to work for Hewlett Packard in early 2000, it was terrific. It was TOUGH work but at the end of the day you felt good about the job you did and the people who worked with you. We were a team that was going to solve your issue. Hewlett Packard rewarded you for hard work. They trained you to give quality service to the customer. But now? The principle and qualities that made Hewlett Packard great are gone. There is no more team work. It is every person for themselves. Even though you did a great job, you still can make a meets expectation because others have a closer relationship with management."
bad,"Good health insurance and vacation time, but they have a constant stream of new bosses taking over and trying to learn things they've never done and guide a ship they're not sure where. They're smart and try hard, but they're incompetent from an experience point of view."
bad,Poor management and cut-throat employees. The benefits are short and the days are long. There is quite a lot of infighting and no supervision. This is a results-based company.
bad,A very misleading company. Poor management lousy training bad instructors. Poor attitudes. No advancement in the company. I really did not learn a lot while I was there.
bad,It truly is dependent on the department you work. The FAIT group was considered to be the most challenging and stressful in the company. We had an average of 83% turnover per year in that department.
bad,"After about 10 years of CEO changes and senior level managers' inability to fund R&D, there is nothing left of the company and it is being sold of piece by piece. There is no future for the company of the employees that are left."
bad,"In HP (Inc) Management is not good in terms of providing growth and they expect a Boot Licking from people. Promotion is given only based on that and not on performance."
bad,"HP is a dieing dinosaur.  It has been driven into the ground by the worst executive management ever.  Because the executives were there to fill their pockets full of cash, the company lost it's roots of innovation and the ability to innovate.  The company is generally the last resort for the young employees and the old, smart employees have already left or are retiring.  "
bad,HP could be a much better place if senior management listened to the people working on the ground. Too much politics in the company for the company to make profit.
bad,"I have extensive experience of Java (Core), JavaScript, Java web development, Java/J2EE code, Oracle SQL, HTML, XML and Eclipse. I consider myself an expert at resolving application defects, and at testing, debugging, and refining software to produce the required product."
bad,"Over my time working with Hewlett Packard I have had the opportunity to learn quite a bit.  I have been able to learn how their test process works.  I developed my troubleshooting capabilities within a short time due to the variety of failures I was allowed to come across spanning several server designs.  I have been fortunate enough to gain some leadership experience in terms of supporting some coworkers through certain issues.  While under my leadership work flow was maximized and productivity through my test area increased.  However I was not always the lead so this was something notable that was left unnoticed.  Management doesn't exactly give credit where credit is due.  A person who solves an issue isn't exactly rewarded for doing so.  Though I remain one of the best technicians, I am rarely kept in an area to exercise my skills.  I am often asked to train the new kids they bring onto the line, audit the work of others, and pretty much work with any situation that arrives on the go.  I am rarely challenged at work anymore so it isn't exactly an environment where you can face new obstacles on a whim.  "
bad,The direction of HP is not bright as key resources are forced out and no appreciation for those that routinely work above and beyond.
bad,Its a great company to work. structured and well planned training program. well organized and co-operative management and colleagues.
bad,needs better defined hiring and training processes. for a large company this is really poor and un-implemented. I cannot stress managment and staff relationship enough.
bad,"Was lied to from the beginning.  HP promises work/life balance, but it does not exist.  The morale in USPS Finance is horrible.  Management essentially bullies people into working a lot of hours with threats of poor reviews.  There is zero regard for family commitments or having a life outside of work.  This behavior is also backed by HR, as it is described as a ""heavily passionate"" management style.  Our workday essentially began at 5pm every day, which was the fault of an incompetent manager.  Mgmt also tends to keep the usual pets, while talking down to seasoned analysts as if they were children.  "
bad,"HP sales manager in Erskine Scotland, managing the public sector team with in education and its it infrastructure  I have no more information to provide at this time."
bad,HP is not the place it was 15 years ago. Poor planning and clickish culture has taken over and contributed to the steady downhill slide for this once great company.
bad,Company is building out capabilities in areas that are not yet developed. We are asked to come up solutions that are cutting edge. Typically working with customers to understand their needs and match with HP's capabilities.
bad,"L'entreprise demande beaucoup à ses employés mais apporte beaucoup, il faut être autonome et foncer"
bad,"Working from home (which I prefer because there are less interruptions which means more productivity), I edit/format several documents in 1 day. I am known for my accuracy, dedication, attention to detail skills, and ability to multitask. In my 37+ years, I have learned to be a part of a team working together to produce many types of documentation (proposals, training, user's manuals, monthly reports, and presentation slides, to name a few). The hardest part of my job and to ensure that documents are delivered on time (which I do 90% of the time). The most enjoyable part of my job is making documents read clearly and formatted for consistency."
bad,"After 15 years of working, I got laid off.  I was one of the workers with the most knowledge and experience working with Canada Savings Bonds.  My typical day consisted of answering client letters, calls and e-mails, updating client info, redeeming funds, creating new client plans, updating training manuals, requesting duplicate T5 slips, redeeming RSP funds, assisting the Call Centre, training new employees and refreshing my existing co-workers on case work as required and attending meetings when required.  I was also the Direct Deposit Expert and Subject Matter Expert for various case types.  I miss the work and my fellow co-workers; they were a fun great bunch!  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the most recent  Supervisor and Manager because they put people where they want them to be...using favouritism. The company as a whole doesn't know anything about our services and seems to think that in order to save money, they must get rid of their workers, but this will soon get them in trouble because the experienced ones are all retiring or being laid off and the new workers don't have the same knowledge that took years to learn; therefore, customer service will not exist and all the clients will suffer.  I've worked in small and big companies and I've learned that the bigger the company, the less they care about their employees...which is too bad because without good employees, you have no company."
bad,"job lacking, very little training excellent personell however everyone is so busy trying to complete these deadlines"
bad,"The place is filled with lifers, those guys who have been there 20 years, that do nothing but roadblock progress. The power structure lies with the old guys and no good idea or product can come from anyone but them."
bad,"HP treats their temp employees like expendable dogs. Most of the time, you can't finish out your contract because they love to lay off and rehire their temps before their contract is up. There is no getting hired on because if you are a temp, you aren't educated and therefore arent worth hiring."
bad,"The company culture is very political.  If one were judged based on work quality, certain individuals wouldn't have lasted as long as they have at HP.  Sustained employment has very much to do with WHO you know.  Individuals who have been stuck in entry level positions for several decades are given highly visible projects to manage and can't cut it manage to keep their position at HP by deflecting blame to contractors at lower positions.  Management is well aware of who is truly accountable but yet play the game."
bad,"HP first opened in Arkansas with the intent to raise the standards of customer service for regular customer.  We exceeded those standards.  At that point, the focus became about income and what we could sell.  Most of the time a  client would call in, would be to fix a computer, be it customer induced or manufacturer flawed.  The ability to make a sale should have been a bonus, not the focus.  Lastly, we were taken off campus with the assumption we were meeting the CEO of HP.  We went there to find out 500 of were being laid off, with half not able to return to the site to gather their personal belongings.  HPE and DXC have followed the same suit in producing an environment not conducive to stability.  It was however, a great place to start and learn new things.  A great place for a fresh college student to earn job experience."
bad,"Management need to developed , also not  job safety , average salary, not a place to grow on other technologies but ok to work for while . and learn some ITIL based working style"
bad,Very Disorganized they lack communication very badly they don't communicate anything and are distrustful they say things and don't fall through.
bad,"The day I started, I realized that there was a group of women there who were obviously friends.  I was not going to be easily accepted into this group.  My supervisor was conceited and very hard to talk to and/or get along with.  The job itself wasn't bad.  The work was fairly simple to learn.  It was just that working with this group of people, I was not going to do anything right.  On my last day, they didn't even tell me the truth about why they were letting me go.  I had to go to the contractor to find out the real reasons.  Overall, this was an aweful experience that I wouldn't care to repeat."
bad,I work very hard and have learned everything i possibly could beyond my job with no raise or advancement. I do work that my supervisor does making the least amount at my job.
bad,Wonderful place to work but zero job security.  People who are working for HP will tell you that they don't buy property or anything of that nature because they don't know if they will have a job the next day.  What you will learn is that though they have a somewhat good culture though they usually retire those who are affective for their staff due to a executive culture that believes in money over provided skills and services of employees.  All retirement contracts carry a 1 year waiting for forced company retires.  Be warned though you may enjoy working for them at the time you will not be with them forever and they are damaging to future career choices.
bad,"I Worked at HP Labs as a contingent worker who was laid off as part of 16k staff reduction in only 4 months."
bad,"It's not a problem with direct supervisors. Head of HR sue tubbs is drunk with power, and screws hard workers over, so she can get her fwb's jobs. If she's not there anymore, then it'd be a good place to work."
bad,"Work force reductions were always looming. , People are overall friendly and supportive. All about Aruba, and Servers..  Complex org structure. Your a number, HR, all about protocol, process, procedure."
bad,HP has been on a downward spiral since the 2000. It has lost its touch and innovative spirit. The merger with Compaq and Tandem and Digital Computers was a disaster.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at HPE/H-P, however I do not think anyone in the 1,000 person Cloud Products division that I was in enjoyed getting pink-slipped and watching our 5+ years effort sold off to the highest bidder - hardly anyone at all was brought on board by the new company. It was really too bad. I liked most of the people I worked with, think that their upper Sr. management is in it for themselves, and let's face it: the company really has not been the H-P that built Silicon Valley for well over a decade."
bad,"No one works together, and their's a lot of politics involved. They act as if they have computers building computers rather than people building computers."
bad,"My typical work day would begin between 9 AM and 9:30 AM and most of the team would leave work between 3-4 PM every day.  Many people would work from home when they were allowed. "
bad,CEO makes decisions without understanding the impact to the accounts on the ground.  Due to a lack of understanding in services it would appear.
bad,Ambiente agradável para trabalhar porém funcionários poucos valorizados fazendo que os mesmo fiquem desmotivados para exercer suas funções com melhor qualidade. Desenvolvi a parte de relação com o cliente; lidava diretamente com diretores de empresas. Direção importava somente com os resultados da equipe. Colegas de trabalho com alto nível de conhecimento das ferramentas utilizadas. Parte mais difícil era conciliar o atendimento para diversas empresas de uma vez já que cada uma tinha um processo diferente de atendimento. Parte mais agradável; todos se davam muito bem isso faz uma grande diferença.
bad,"Company only cares about the EC and their wallets... they want you to drink their kool-aid and buy into their ""success"" all while making decisions that negatively affect their employees.... had pay cut twice and when HP did have a successful QTR or year the EC and decision makers always had a reason as to why they couldn't give bonuses and or pay raises."
bad,"undervalued, underpaid, overworked. Culture was so bad. DO NOT APPLY TO WORK HERE. Started being promised the world, only to quickly discover that this was management lies."
bad,"excess group politics, no hike no growth"
bad,"Company was always looking for head to cut to try and meet their quarter numberers."
bad,"they will let people go after promising not to. they cant get a clear "
bad,"meet different customer daily, went to a different site daily, love to deal with a different issue, travel one place to another, help the customer to result in their concern."
bad,No review I do not feel comfortable giving a review of this company I have no feelings either way and would rather not make any opinions of the company or management
bad,You counted the days as to when your job would end because they were moving all of their jobs oversees. It just wasn't a good place to work any longer.
bad,I dont have anything more to say This is not a good overall job in any way.Not everyone in the world can have his or her perfect job. But no human being should have to spend most of their only life doing something for a job that will never let you advance.
bad,"I did not like this job, infact I hated it. I wish I never worked here. pay was good though. Hardest part of the job was everything very stressful...."
bad,"You never know from one day to the next if you have a job. EVERYONE from the senior exec down to the lowest paid contract laborer is subject to getting laid off at any moment. While working there, it is a good environment. However, I count on my paycheck to take care of my family and pay my bills. Regardless to how good you are or how much experience you have, you don't even have some of the most basic job security!"
bad,It was very frustrating and complicated it was a good environment and it was some helpful people at all times it was just the customer when you have to call there business.
bad,"I was hired at HP right out of college, and got to move to California!  HP was still a very highly respected company at the time, and it was an absolute honor to work for Bill and Dave, even though they had passed on a few years earlier.  It still felt like THEIR company they started in the garage in Palo Alto so many years earlier.  In fact, the FIRST thing they did was enroll me in an ""HP Way"" indoctrination class, where they taught us the HP Way, taught us about the old garage, and about how we were expected to remember these things and be proud of working for Bill and Dave.  Then Carly Fiorina came in and ran it into the ground.  First she presided over a HIGHLY unpopular and VERY ill-advised merger with Compaq, against the huge backlash from the employees who knew this was a terrible idea and would destroy the company.  This along with extreme micro-management alienated her from the employee base to such an extent that when she was finally let go, there were literally people dancing in the aisles between cubicles singing ""ding dong the witch is dead!""  Unfortunately it only got worse with the next few CEO's.  I and my whole team was told directly by upper management that there would be no layoff's for a one year period at the very least.  So, I took a week vacation, and when I came back, found that I'd been laid off!  Somehow, a re-structuring had occurred in the interim and our team was placed under a different group, and that group WAS having layoff's, and so we fell under that umbrella.  Somehow I managed to be re-hired, and only lasted two more years before that team"
bad,Was a good experience unless the management changes were made the opportunities to grow the ladder and get challenging roles narrowed down to a great extent
bad,"Awesome job.  Great pay, very fun people to work with. "
bad,"great product offering but poor business management.strong marketing, and brand awareness but entire organization lacks team work to follow through on changes required for business growth, channel optimization, internal organization transformation."
bad,I didn't like this job. all you did was try to educate people when they had no idea at all about a computer. the time was different though because it was when computers were first on the market
bad,"Very mundane day to day operations. No benefits, no advancements, not even a chance to go full time.  Very quick to overwork high performance employees, and not discipline low performance ones."
bad,"Manager was horrible, worked exceptionally hard, no praise at all and was very difficult to approach. He was like this with all of his team."
bad,"This company is growing too much, and they are not paying attention to their core business and products."
bad,Working at Hewlett packard is a great place to work. I have obtained tons of knowledge and experience during the 4 years I have been employed.

bad,"They fired the entire team.  They were nice enough, ha ha, to let us keep doing the same job for less pay and no more benefits through a temp agency.  "
bad,Since HP is my first company so i start with my career in HP but i faced so many work pressure butt i managed and served there for 4 years.
bad,"""The best part is the people, the staff and the customers. We would not be here without our customers and in these difficult times I am so happy to be in a position where I can help others."
bad,"Respect for individual"
bad,Manage day to day running of the Mediaroom Ensure all jobs for current day has shipped Lot of experience working with equipment and ways to work around errors I work well with management and complete all tasks the is required for the running of the Mediaroom I work well together with my co workers and when we are under stress to make a dead line we talk to each other a lot I enjoy my job and do love challenges.
bad,HPE is the great opportunity for graduate to enable the career and lot of chances to grow technically and learn new technologies at this center and people are friendly and supportive at requested and politics is norm and thus we worked for project goals.
bad,HPe is the good and friendly environment. the data center is fully confidential and secure block. the delivery teams are good and supportive at requested and we have lot of fun for relax at auditorium and friend circles
bad,"aucun respecter entre équipier. salaire pour un débutant."
bad,Management and pay is not very good. Long hours for very little pay and bosses are difficult to work for. Would not recommend this company to anyone!!
bad,Definitely not a place where you can see a future. Work/life balance is does not exist. Long hours and hard work with no advancement in sight...........................................
bad,"go to the office nothing else"
bad,"The staff is very friendly, but knows nothing about the time needed to make a program for the department. This was a great first programming job, and help me pave a way to bigger and better things."
bad,"Typical day was was building server racks for online companies. Great for learning how to network and route cables. The hardest part was balancing life with their attendance point system, not having a livable wage and no insurance. The managers we young and power hungry and cronyism ran rampant."
bad,"When the agency told me, ""We're pretty much hiring anyone"" that should have been my first clue. The management is run by young people with huge egos that enjoy rubbing your contract status in your face. Thus, there's hardly any upward mobility. You're always threatened with being let go and the point system that prevents virtually any personal time off make work and life impossible to balance."
bad,"Zero opportunities to advance. "
bad,It is hard to provide a typical work day because I was most of the time I was there I did not have work.  The little we were able to work was spent trying to keep busy so you were not sent home.  This was a very easy job for a person that  had any type of electronics training.  When there was work I was responsible for verifying the quality control measures were in place for all the equipment test racks that were built.  I would train personnel on how to use the proper build procedures and what the equipment they were trying to wire up.
bad,"a typical day at work would be , clocking in checking the esd station to make sure im grounded. Arrive at my area , sign into e-link , check the que to see what kind of work where having that day."
bad,HP allows their supervisors to rate the employees on there personality instead of their job performance.
bad,"Hp logistics 2man delivery is a self employed company who fired me for having a dental appointment there is no job security there, the boss who runs the company is fairly arrogant"
bad,"Mid management completely ignorant business-wise & technically about the product in development. Use politics and false narrative to explain to upper management their lack of achievements. Take decisions  by consensus not even caring  to listen to true SMEs if not part of their political followers. Fired the ""brains"" because they were conveying realistic observations and directions based on reality and the truth..."
bad,"Met a lot of good people while working there. Management overall wasn't so great due to lack of communication and the ""buddy system"". Interviewed for a position while an employee, received ""Congratulations"" email from HR. The reason I left HP is because my immediate management team withheld my pay increase for over a year."
bad,"If you are just starting out in the I.T. industry, this is not the company you want to start with. There is constant micromanagement, very strict requirements, and virtually no help or support for issues you're unfamiliar with. Even as an entry level position, you are expected to know far more than an entry level position should require."
bad,Hp is no longer worth working for they are a huge company that has lost sight of what matters the people and the people taking care of the people. I don’t believe Hewlett-Packard is doing right by it’s people or customers anymore
bad,"HP Autonomy - my manager was awful, the company had no clear direction or software quality standards."
bad,Poorly paid wages and expected to run round like a slave at 100mph. Management are based off site and do not visit the staff - all communication seems to be via email. There is a major disconnect between the employer and employees.
bad,"Great place to work, but just got too big and bogged down.  Size and structure of company made it near impossible to get things done."
bad,"While at HP/HPE the company worked closely with the PM's who were seeking their PMP to attend classes offered by HP peers to assist with the under PM's before taking the PM Exam. Very Helpful."
bad,I would not recommend to anyone to be employed by HPE. Management does not take accountability for anything and the old saying of stuff runs down hill is the motto of upper management. pay is not even compatible to the market and benefits and bonus are the worst int he industry.
bad,"Lugar ideal para recien graduados, donde el salario es bajo con respecto a la competencia, si bien tuve 3 ascenso en mi sector, en otros es nulo, ingresas al puesto y sueldo, te vas con mismo sueldo y puesto"
bad,"My recruiter said they ""basically hire anyone down on their luck."" When I walked onto the floor for the first time, I could tell. This place is run by a 2% permanent employees and 98% contract, which makes it practically a plantation. A day never went by without your job being threatened by one of the perms. Favorites were hired on to perm and when it was hiring time, the back stabbing was rampant, but the straw that broke that camel's back: The attendance point system. You had a total of 5 points and for every absence, you received a point. After 5 points, you're fired. This meant being punished for time off, sick days, school, flat tires; even injuries on the job! The hardest part about this job was knowing I needed it just to survive."
bad,"i work with computer parts such as motherboards,cpus,power supply i responsible to put them together and make sure they work fine .i send emails to technicians and let them know if the computer parts are ok or not , i also supervises 3 other co-worker and tell them what they need to do and if they need any help with computer information i help,i also do inspection on computer part making sure that the part are in good conditions "
bad,"I do not recommend this place of employment. It is micromanaged at a disgraceful level. You are expected to be robotic and never sick. High turn over rate, constantly threaten with job security and recognition in not in the job culture."
bad,"people were rude, crew not helpful, very messy, low pay ,no hours and the managers are very ugly to the workers."
bad,"This position had timed phone calls, and untrained agents."
bad,"Their number one goal for years, has been to eliminate American   workers in favor of H1B visas, green card holders, and outsourcing.  What goes around, comes around."
bad,"•	Manage a team of more than 20 people"
bad,"I would not recommend working here, but if you do:"
bad,I was contracted to HP and was told it was a two year contract.  The contract ended after 6 months and over 17 people were laid off.  During the 6 months the working environment was stressful.  Answering call after call while your team leader would be instant messing about taking too long on a call.  There was a chance to get hired directly but after seeing how they treated their contract staff who worked hard for them I didn't want any part of HP.
bad,"There are absolutely better companies in the market. HP lacks growth opportunities for many without serving significant periods of time to move forward."
bad,Worked closely with team-members and level II & Engineering teams to diagnose and improve product and support. Company was professional. I enjoyed working there.
bad,EDS was great before HP takeover.  The managers are not committed and throw you under the bus the first chance they can to save their job.  Lack of respect in the culture.
bad,The company only hired their friends for inside jobs. They were very bias. They picked and chose the favorites. Overall it was not a friendly place to work.I felt like it was a cult.
bad,"Was not paid on a few large deals that I created and closed. Took my concerns to the VP, however, they elected not to change their decision. Excellent benefits including a car to use, gas and health benefits."
bad,Work tended to get very slow at times. Management would sometimes ask people to go home volontarily whever workload was low. I was a contractor and never felt secure working there.
bad,If I didn't have the invisible carrot of being hired in by GM hanging over me my time at HP was worthless. Management were rats and the work environment stressful
bad,"I was screamed at, Told i did not hire you so i don't want you etc. The GM's are all absent and when anything is said your to blame not them, im happy that job is over."
bad,"With another round of redundancies it doesn't feel like a safe place to be.  They are not very flexible with the hours, management is very poor with very little communication"
bad,Typical work day included working with very difficult management team. Little understanding by supporting groups of data required for compliance and internal reporting.
bad,"DXC offers less pay than the fair market compensation, Should be ready to work without pay hike for many years, No Fun at work always company worried about cost, No opportunities for lateral or vertical movement, forget word promotion, overall DXC is a sick organisation."
bad,"Bad management and organization . Interview process is very weird and unorganized. Hire you and let you go because they had some miss calculations, so very unprofessional. Work there at your own risk"
bad,"HP has the potential to be a great company. But unfortunately, the company has adapted a strategy not to invest on its own employees. Hence the employees are not encouraged to upgrade their skills."
bad,"Some very interesting projects, but staff feel undervalued and unwanted. The constant threat of redundancy and the ongoing pay-freeze has destroyed morale."
bad,"worked employees hard with little reward once owners retired"
bad,"Full of politics - Do not work for this company"
bad,"The company has been off track for a long time and every CEO has no clue how to do anything other than make cutbacks, layoffs and outsource intellectual property."
bad,"The perception given is that of alienation of outsiders. With all companies it is understood that you take care of your employees first, however when bringing in outside contractors alienation should not be their first thought."
bad,"Although the job hasn't changed in 10 years, management has multiple times each with their own direction making it difficult to get any type of training or advancement."
bad,Overworked underpaid undertrained high stress due to inconsiderate leads/supervisors in the work place. Very easy job if the proper training was given hp needs to due a re-evaluation a clean sweep and start over beginning from the top
bad,Future is uncertain because of the upcoming split into 2 separate companies.
bad,Too many cooks in the kitchen.  EDS management was more family oriented and cared more about the employees work-life.  The people manager really cared about the employees concerns and did something about it.  When HP purchased EDS everything went downhill; now the people managers don't care about anything but billable hours.
bad,This place was not a good place to work   low wages and little vacation time
bad,"Wages poor. Promotion prospects non-existent. Generally speaking, a total career dead-end."
bad,"Cadre suffisamment appréciable, mais toute activité de cette société a fermé à la vaux en velin"
bad,"Excellent protfolio of products and a very smart and seasoned workforce. However, mismanaged strategy, inability to step off shareholder pressure to follow through on strategic development endeavors, continuos reorgs & management changes have drained it of employee values and sales force morale."
bad,"The Data Entry position (captivia) in the Madison office has the worst supervisor. She will spend a half hour in a meeting with the team going on and on about how what a great job she is doing. She is unfair and has her favorites. Not many men on the team, mainly because she treats them like meat. Awful awful department."
bad,"A empresa poderia ter ferramentas de gestão, visando facilitar o acompanhamento profissional por parte dos gestores."
bad,Always stretch
bad,just learned how to stack printers a certain way on a pallet.
bad,"Hewlett Packard doesn't care about anything but the bottom line. If you were an EDS employee prior to HP acquiring EDS, you are in worse shape. This company is terribly managed and has been for years. Just waiting for another company to buy it out and put it under."
bad,This company was not for me. I'm not a cubicle type person. Management and employees spent too much time on facebook and the internet.
bad,Overseeing production floor.
bad,Run from this company.  Awful management and culture.  Benefits should be better for a company this size.  Always a layoff.  No sense of security so you can actually do your job.
bad,Not a lot of connection with the company mission for most employees.  HP seems to have done a shift where employees  are overhead vice assets.  I would personally not recommend HP.
bad,"What used to be considered the egalitarian culture at HP, the ""HP Way,"" is completely dead. Lack of integrity and respect, lying and political infighting have become the norm. Toxic environment, with extremely long hours and ineffective, inept management. This is in reference to the PC side of the business."
bad,"Many good people at HP.  However costs are being cut at every corner.  Desk trash collection was stopped.  Travel is always on the chopping block.  Lots of people are being let go across the company."
bad,"It's impressive and great working environment."
bad,"No work life balance"
bad,"Late in my HP career a drive from customers and a drive for profit increase forced hp to push to ""off shore"" employees.    That resulted in unrealistic requirements and pressure for most US based employees."
bad,"At first it seemed legit but it wasn't. My first week there, training wasn't exactly what i thought it to be because everything was read off a powerpoint, there was no hands on training, & no one showed us how to test any of the units properly. I would say hardest part about the job was finding a lead to help with any problems & knowing which test to use (since no one showed us). The environment was very disrespectful; others would bump into you w/o excusing themselves, they would steal & take things off my station, so when i told a lead and they did nothing about the situation, they told me since they weren't from here they don't understand how we do things, or if you're speaking with a lead they would interrupt whomever is talking to a lead just so they could get their question(s) answered. Also, management fabricated about paying us triple pay for the holidays, they didn't want anyone talking to each other just wanted us to sit at our stations like children and not speak so they wouldn't get chewed out about them not doing their job, and will also make false accusations on you if they want to let you. I do not recommend this job to anyone who's well mannered & educated because they will feel some type of way about you questioning the things that are happening around you."
bad,"Have been very disappointed in the people who call themselves professionals. It's not the company !! It's the people causing the company to deteriorate, low standards of professionalism, greed. I will say no more."
bad,A typical work day is extremely Fast Past. Must be able to muli-task and know problem resolution. Knowing different work areas is a plus in the Print Operations environment.
bad,La valutazione è molto variabile i funzione del gruppo di lavoro. Può capitare di avere a capo delle persone molto capaci con tecnici mediocri o peggio se vi capita di lavorare con alcuni team di Roma la gestione è assolutamente inesistente se non per temi politici o commerciali con l'organizzazione del gruppo tecnico allo sbando.
bad,"Not to take our jobs to Bulgaria and too many managers in 4 yrs\"
bad,"I have been working for years without advancement options or raises. Opportunities for permanent hire are slim to none. No new skills are provided. Once you learn the job requirements, nothing else is learned. Most of the tasks are a bit mundane and non-challenging."
bad,HP culture was crumbled due to acquiring of companies with corrupt management. Job opportunities were given to management friends relatives or certain culture driven by the white house.
bad,"No training provided, always same excuse no budget. Management keep changing, no stability. No job security, Company always looking for cheaper alternative, the day they found your replacement, you are WFR on hours notice."
bad,"The Enterprise Services swears by EDS club membership, nepotism, sexism as in reverse discrimination are rampant, favoritism, cover-up, simple incompetence, rotten to the core management from the old times."
bad,Org keep changing and job security is always a concern. Leadership have no clear direction. Good on job training but cant stay for too long if any one wished for career advancement.
bad,"Não há uma estrutura clara para crescimento dentro da empresa, remuneração muito baixa e funcionários muito mal preparados."
bad,"I have spent almost 20 years. HP/HPE treated me nice but the last couple of years were rather difficult and everything was outsourced."
bad,Poor management and greedy upper management only enriching themselves.  Too much outsourcing without considering the ramifications.  Has a history of buying good companies only to be mismanaged after purchase.
bad,"Overall, the company provides good opportunities for those willing to reach for them, but the work/life balance (especially adding the commute as a factor) is a significant struggle if you do not work for an ""Americas Region"" specific area and/or do not reside on the outskirts of North Houston."
bad,"Heavy workload, no training, the way most learn system or policy is error's recieved.  Management is all friends.  No promotion within this office, no pay raise and lots and lots and lots of overtime.  Even though this is a technology company they are very far behind the times in this office.  Still have paper EVERYWHERE."
bad,CoWorkers maintained a great work environment in working together and helping each other always.  Great learning experience for this environment.
bad,"In early 2000s HP still had a good front in the market in several areas."
bad,The management staff is not technical and some cant run there own staff. the company it starting to be filled with family members and not qualified employees. The focus is on numbers and not on the customer. The company is understaffed and overworked.
bad,The environment was not conducive to staying with the company.  You feel very much like a number and are treated as such. Good place to learn as they take almost anyone who can hold a security clearance.
bad,"HP has declined in its treatment of staff , overall they are looking to outsource every job to the cheapest location on the planet. Loyal hard working people have been axed after many years service"
bad,"There is no clear strategy or long term success plans for HP Inc. after the company split at the end of 2015. Executive management is just hoping to survive long enough for some Asian company to buy out HP Inc. or pieces of HP Inc."
bad,Challenging and stressful place to work.  The many changes due to reorganizations made it hard to understand goals and to stay focus. Less personnel and bigger workloads stretched you to the limit.
bad,"I don't think it will be long before HP is out of the mix.  They do the same thing again and again without improvement."
bad,"The pay is good, but the management structure and managers are absolutely terrible. HP used t be a special company that cared about it's employees.  Not it's just another big corporation that views employees as a cost and a number."
bad,"HPE (Hewlett-Package Enterprise) has recently spilt from greater HP, Inc., with objective of enabling solution accelerating in areas of cloud, networking, security, hybrid computing and data analytics which should help lead client transformation and defies business as usual."
bad,"The building was dirty and mostly empty. "
bad,"an up and coming new company."
bad,"Contractor only environment, not very welcoming or much trust in employees, not many food options for overnight shift, no room for advancement, no job security."
bad,"The management did nothing about a situation that was very unprofessional. Thus far, the reason I had left the job. But when I first had started working, it seemed like it would have been a great job. Unfortunately, it had ended bad."
bad,"Much has changed through the years.  While many companies are transitioning to more flexible work environments, HP is doing just the opposite and losing good people in the process.  It's a shame to lose excellent, top-performing employees just because of geography."
bad,"Stressful place to work at, legacy systems, focus on cost cutting, not on delivery, Outsourcing has become the norm, less responsive infrastructure teams."
bad,"The job was actually pretty fun, I liked that people could talk and converse from team to team without any issues. This actually made us more efficient at Exel, the work site, in which we would complete hundreds of orders with a much smaller team than other shifts. The work environment wasn't a bad one until the management changed on our shift. The manager tried implementing rules that were proven ineffective and slowed our production, as well as he had a passive aggressive form of management. He would never bring the issue up with the employee, he would send a messenger and act as if he didn't send anyone when confronted about the issue. He began cutting hours and firing individuals one by one, so in the long run, it was better to just move on."
bad,Little to no raises or bonuses. No advancement or training. Management style is weak and as a people care management style they were not there for there employees.
bad,"Working among co-workers was enjoyable. Everything else wasn't"
bad,"Ha great work culture, job security and good management but it is not a great paymaster in the industry."
bad,"Typical day at work starts at 08:00 and ends at 17:00 includes mostly taking calls (main focus area), taking care of emails and web tickets."
bad,"The Madison office is pretty terrible. The benefits barely pass as acceptable and getting time off in certain positions is nearly impossible. If you are looking to move up in the company or even sideways expect to wait a very long time. Even when accepted for a new position they won't let you move for at minimum of 6 months up to a year. "
bad,Overwhelmed with email... Unrealistic deliverable and project dates.
bad,"I work in the call center for HP. It is high volume & very stressful. I've been here for two years & have not been able to move to another position yet. All movements, however, are lateral which is not what I'd think of as improvement."
bad,"Hewlett Packard is great for management, but not employee's.  Since 2002 HP has constantly laid off employee's regardless of how important your job maybe.  It is difficult to work in constant fear.  I do not recommend it as a place to work.  You can look at the trend, since 2002 HP has laid off almost 100,000 employee's.  In some cases they have been replaced with positions outside the US."
bad,"I worked at HP for 9 years, I was a highly successful individual contributor and was promoted 4 times, unfortunately I did so under the guise that ""during focal point reviews we'll make the comp adjustments"".  That never happened.  As a result, I was working next to external hires, that had lower levels of responsibilities who were compensated as much as 25-50% more than I was.  Literally a common joke was that the only way to get a raise was to leave the company.  That is the biggest complaint.  We worked hard and had to be very vocal to get help to cover the work load, but did so after a year or so of neglect.  I liked the majority of people I worked with but had zero faith in the abilities of senior management.  Work from home privileges were nice, but have since been reeled in.  I think everything I've mentioned is driving the very public demise that we're seeing both in HP value in the market place and stock price.  It's sad, used to be a great employer."
bad,"My typical day at work is to monitor calls and tickets of each agent in every account."
bad,"Continuous downsizing, causes the work environment to be volatile"
bad,"Devido atender diversos seguimentos no mercado e ser a ""estrela"" mundial acaba deixando diversas brechas em qualidade de serviço."
bad,"Very long hours with very little opportunity for advancement. "
bad,HP is confused on what HP is as a brand.  Has way too much middle management. Unwilling to invest in the individual.  Cost prohibitive to customers
bad,"Managing and developing market strategies for 21 countries in South East Africa, reporting to manager in London . "
bad,"Empresa que genera expectativas que no pueden llenar aquí en Argentina (cultura de trabajo diferente a la americana). Mandos medios/Supervisores con tendencias misóginas evidentes. No responden a la política de diversidad que la empresa intenta inculcar. Ambiente laboral muy similar al de una institución pública, cargada de ruidos, chismes y juicios además de mucha gente que pierde el tiempo. Existe diversidad pero aún así se observa discriminación por edad o género aunque si es muy respetada la orientación sexual de los empleados. Prometen en la entrevista laboral sueldo y función que no son reales (quizás terminás haciendo cualquier otra cosa)."
bad,Scanning documents properly coding each paper. I learned how to move gracefully through out my day and pritorize my work. Co-workers are amazing and always helpful.
bad,Good for freshers and who is new to the corporate team. But very poor management and no job satisfaction.
bad,"Let me start off by saying that HP could be so much better. It's not a hard job and I really hate to say its a bad place to work because when I first started it was a great job. Over the past couple years there has been pay cuts, layoffs, and poor corporate decisions. Every day I come in I see that someone else has either left or has disappeared. Yet those spots arent being replaced. Our area alone has gone from around 40 people to about 18-20. This is making it a very stressful day having to pick up the work of those that have ""left"". Sure its managable as with any job with increase of workload but when my day is done I just want to go home and sleep. ""Promotions"" arent really promotions at all and take on average 4 months to a year for it to go into effect. Most ""promotions"" don't come with a pay raise and I've seen people wait up to about 13 months for them to actually get into the position because they don't allow people to move to different jobs unless they find someone to replace you which when they arent hiring people makes it really hard. The pay here isnt bad considering its a cubicle job but after being here for about 2 years i've barely seen any increase in pay. Overall it has potential if corporate made the right decisions, but sadly they arent making this job depressing and work days draining. I do not recommend ever applying here and i myself have been actively seeking other employement."
bad,"Non stop interruption, firedrills, and constant view that we are not doing enough or getting things done that leadership wants"
bad,"Overall HP is a good company to work for - stay away from the ""sales"" call center in Conway AR."
bad,No life / work balance. Employees (especially EDS legacy) are being terminated. Not enough employees to support projects.
bad,Big wig facing management challenges. Has potential of making a come back but needs to get its act together.
bad,Managers need more training on running a huge company especially a newly built one
bad,This company does not seem to get the notion that their employees should get more than some kind words and a metaphorical pat on the back for a job well done.  NO RAISES in 9 YEARS!
bad,"Poor work life balance: poor, weak, condescending management.  poor communications and expectations from management. Nice campus and work environment. Fair pay and benefits."
bad,I was made redundant after giving nearly 9 years of good service.  Promotion opportunities were few and far between and there were lots of redundancies during the whole 9 years I worked there.
bad,I was tupe into HP so I never really had a say working for HP. They are good at some things but pretty bad at recognising talent. They are not prepared to retain good Technical stall. When you work for them you are just a number. They ethics and culture can be contracdictory to what they teach. There integrity as a company is questionable. They insist you do due diligence when their senior managers don’t and when they make big mistakes the staff gets the blunt of the criticism and are blamed for their mistakes. They never  contribute to your training although they do encourage training they never have the money to get you through any certifications even though you would need for your job.
bad,"As a recent college graduate I was not given any advice or guidance on career advancement, my manager was two time zones away and met them in person maybe 3 times a year."
bad,"HPE is constantly downsizing and has lost its direction in the marketplace in the face of cloud IT and it is fighting for the on premise infrastructure."
bad,Not a positive work environment for anyone. Unrealistic expectations. Vert ordinary leadership. Quite a lot of friction between departments with conflicting goals and objectives.
bad,"Not a bad job for someone that is working a second job. The amount of hours offered start out slowly but may increase due to your availability and willingness to show up, simply put, management appreciates someone they know they can count on because they are rarely if ever there to observe you."
bad,"Basically the same things as I said about working for GM - dead end job, doing the same thing day after day, etc.  The big thing here was we never felt part of GM."
bad,"HP kann man als Arbeitgeber leider nicht mehr empfehlen."
bad,"Extremely stressful and job security at the lowest possible with all the changes in the company - being taken apart and sold to various other companies."
bad,"HP was filled with ppl lamenting the glory days of the past while being miserable in the present. Endless bureaucracy, poor communication, ever-changing direction, and a general sense of misery all pervaded this workplace."
bad,"meh, not impressed."
bad,"Not a position for a career or long term employment."
bad,"consisted of many meetings but was a ""boys club"" with little to no advancement for women.  Culture supported advancement for men, recognition for work performed by men."
bad,"Very political. Networking was more important then product focus. Merit based rewards were non-existent. The more talent you had the more others resented you and tried to undermine your credibility. the CEO was more interested in pleasing wall street then creating innovation. CEO missed every major technology: cell phones; fitness tracking, Linux, public cloud etc."
bad,"Poorly managed company. Not a people friendly company. Not a pay for performance company. Most HP employees felt under appreciated, overworked and under paid."
bad,"A typical day of work at Hewlett-Packard usually included very stressful conference calls with corporate managers that felt it necessary to be abrasive and rude to lower-level employees, along with trying to figure out how to accomplish supremely large tasks with minimal staff that have little to no experience.  But the job would have been decent if it wasn't just a terrible work environment.  Guidelines and rules would be set up and established firmly by management, only to be bent and then broken just days later by the same management.  If you weren't willing to ""play ball"", you would become the office pariah."
bad,"OK if you do not expect to get recognized for your contributions."
bad,"This company has gone through so many changes it's hard to even look at this company as HP anymore. They are always trying to change without fixing what is broken. People have spoken up and management are attempting to fix the problems but instead of fixing the spokes on the wheel they are reinventing the wheel, and the wheel is now square and now management is telling you a square wheel will roll correctly. Lay-offs are certain to come in the near future as they consolidate every technical person they can and force everyone to do more for less from lower managers to field techs.  Assigning managers that have no experience in a certain technical field to the field techs, it's a failure waiting to happen. HP stock prices are looking wonderful but don't let that fool you on what is going on behind closed doors."
bad,Everyday all day stay with your laptop and be on green status. No respect for your personal time or family life. The best thing is that everyone can work from home if needed too!
bad,"My day is an On-Site technician. Minimal supervision. Do my calls, handle logistics, deliver on-site service."
bad,"I was thrown into a very mismanaged environment.   I saw people not going home after work and sleeping at their desks for the night."
bad,"Recent management directioin is to relocate 80% of all jobs out of the  United States. No raises in the last 5 years. Monthly reduction of forces. In the last 5 years, tens of thousands of layoffs."
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone that is starting off their technology career, because you will not learn what you need for later expansion."
bad,This was a terrible place to work. Constantly seeing people being scape-goated and thrown under the bus so their supervisors/managers could cover their own butts. Hard work/quality results = no pay raises. It can easily take 3 - 5 years to go from contractor to direct hire.
bad,"HPE seems to be in a permanent job cutting mode. I left before I would have been laid off like many of my coworkers have been. "
bad,"Company is in  too much flux trying to boost profits by reducing work force, mentoring, and innovation. Professionalism has degraded between peers and internal customers and are starting to take there toll internal with moral and work ethics etc."
bad,"I've been with HP/HPE/DXC for almost 5 years now.  The layoffs have been consistent my entire tenure.  Every day more work is required from the rest of the employees who still have healthcare knowledge.  There is no real program/resource management by upper management to allow the success of new business.  The people you work with are great, including the global delivery folks, but there is just not enough knowledge to go around.  12 hour + days are the norm.  The new company just got rid of our guaranteed vacation for 'unlimited' vacation that has a lot of restrictions and requires specific approvals.  Very sad to see people leaving every month.  The last 2 I know of didn't even have another job to move to.  They were just fed up.  There is no work-life balance.  Very sad.  No raises for the past 3-5 years and bonuses are $2K or less for the top 1%.  Promises of promotions and raises are dished out but never followed through."
bad,"Once great company destroyed by greed.   Good people, great culture destroyed by turmoil of leadership whose only desire was to work for the street.  Lack of focus on clients and employees."
bad,I found many very smart people who worked hard for this company.  Good teams and hard work combined for large complex IT enterprise projects.  Specialization was in datacenters.
bad,"I learned people management"
bad,"I one position, I really enjoyed working as an Admini Asst. in the Procurement Department for HPE.  After the split I worked at HP, Inc. and the culture was work, work, work.  Even on the weekends at home I had to be on call for the 5 Directors I worked under.  I had Directors in Houston as well as California.  I had to be available from 7am to 9pm.  The culture was quite different from when I worked at Compaq."
bad,"- The job is a shift job."
bad,"Too much middle layer and Lack of Transparency"
bad,"i will re-iterate the fact that hb1-visa incoming staff are hoarding positions and pushing folks like myself out.   "
bad,The Company is continually going through transitional phases and are totally concerned with financial gain.  They say that they are people orientated but treat their staff terribly - the company that I have had the displeasure of working for
bad,Work life balance can be good at times when not overloaded due to lack of resources.  Plenty of work to do.  College hires are highly valued.  Mid to long term career folks are of little value and are wfr fodder
bad,"This job offered very little in the area of career development. This contract division of HP dealt mostly with Medicaid billing and processing, as well as enrollment and medical review. Management was very hands-off in their approach and offered little feedback regarding job performance. The call center was very busy which left little time for any interaction or relationship or team building."
bad,"poor management"
bad,"Performed indepth maintenance on laptops, desktops and printers in a rapid work environment setting.  The pay wasnt that great for the type of work expected of me.  But, overall it was an okay place to work."
bad,"used to be a great place to work for where people are the greatest assets. "
bad,no work balance.no certain process and lot of politics.we need to work 15-16 hours per day.there is no shift allowence paid and no noght shift allowence paid and teh CAB facility is also not there.
bad,"HP is a great company to begin a career in as there are many opportunities to learn a variety of skills.  Progression is possible, but not always easy.  The company split occurring is resulting in a lot of employees being converted to agency contractors or being part of the Workforce Reduction program.  The people that work at HP are nice, good people for the most part.  HP will work you to death, though, if you let them."
bad,"On a day to day basis you will be running a certain number of tests for a single printer bank. The work consists of making sure the paper is stocked and the tests are running. If there are any errors, you have to fix them and then notate them on an excel document and on paper. The shifts are 8 hours and can be busy if you are alone. If Lionbridge decides to move people to your section, then you may have really slow days because the work is too easy."
bad,I started as a telecommuter and then moved into a local office.  As a telecommuter the hours were very demanding because I technically never left the office.  I moved into a local office and felt more a part of the HP culture.  The accounting systems were not very supportive and caused a great deal of problems.  The people I worked with were very top notch.
bad,"HP is changing everything and inflicting pain on employees that have given years of valuable service and on the ones not being let go. The people allowed to stay because they live in the right state are calling themselves the ""Left Behind"" because they can't possibly learn and take on all the work and knowledge HP is dumping. The company split makes no sense to the teams and is adding to the tension and adding more hours to the already overburdened employees. Example: I trained my replacement for hundreds of hours for over 4 months. In less than a month HP offered my replacement a different position basically throwing away all the money spent on mine and his behalf. Most of the changes are wasteful of time and money."
bad,"I work at HP as a software developer in their Public Sector department.  Specifically, we do consultant work for retirement systems in the public sector.  The project team I am apart of is very unorganized caused by poor leadership and planning.  Leadership agreed to deliver a product to our client in an impossible amount of time.  Therefore, the team has to work hard constantly to meet tight deadlines. This creates pressure and long work hours.  Management also does not allow people on the team to take vacation longer than 2 days without approval as a result of the insane deadlines.  Management will tell you one thing, but do something completely different.  They are also the exact opposite of transparency.  They don't communicate anything to the team unless we do something wrong.  They treat employees like kids (micro-managing).  The ""team"" is also made up mostly of people who look after themselves for job security purposes.  This is by far the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"very number driven, very low salaries work about 12 hours a day covering about 300 plus miles a day"
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with diverse customers on challenging and interesting issues.   The challenging part of the job is the high value placed on metrics that can sometimes cause stress in the workplace
bad,Typical day you are working on an assembly line and have set daily goals to meet. The hardest part of the job was being over worked because of being short staffed. The most enjoyable part of my job was my fellow co-workers on my assembly line; we worked together as a family.
bad,"Company hires good employees, but leaves them with way too much work to do after others are laid off.  Frequent reorgs, inconsistent management."
bad,"The culture that once made HP such a fantastic place to work has been slowing ebbing out from the many self inflicted wounds HP has caused itself."
bad,"Just a factory worker job....building, loading, testing, and kitting server units... poor management and advancement opportunities."
bad,"Working for Hewlett-Packard used to something I would brag about.  I was really proud to work there and couldn't imagine working anywhere else.  But a lot has changed in the 15 years I've been with the company.  "
bad,"Pay was OK, Management was a joke, Long hpurs and expectations were incredibly difficult to achieve.  DId not enjoy my time at HP."
bad,"A typical work day is composed of engaging with a variety of well-known corporate customers such as AT&T, VMware, Sony, Verizon, etc., and aid them with common configurations and hardware troubleshooting assistance with anything related with to HP Blade Systems, to specially, HP Virtual Connect and other interconnect networking devices pluggable to HP Blade Systems."
bad,"There was no official training provided, a lot of favoritism in the company, the pay was not competitive, there are not retention programs so a lot of the talent goes out the door very quickly."
bad,"The job was an awesome environment when I first arrived there in 2012. Adequate training, somewhat good professionalism, great work ethic out of most employees. Then in early 2013, a lot of things started changing when one supervisor left and another one came in. Moral started going down, people got let go because of minute things around the workplace, a lot of favoritism was handed out. It wore on a lot of people there, including the permanent employees at the job. When I left there, about 75% of the workforce was basically getting tired of being there."
bad,I was told the first day i could be the same place i was then in 30 yrs for 50% more pay 
bad,"Work directly with several large channel partners, and all their great sales representatives."
bad,Summary says it all.
bad,"During my time at Hewlett Packard, I honed my Leadership and Project implementation skills, as well as my Security Management and Technical Knowledge in Application Development and support while providing a stable infrastructure for multiple Software Application suites to run on. I successfully lead several teams that provided reliable Information Services allowing the end user customers to achieve success in their business. We accomplished this primarily by developing and implementing projects aimed at proactive performance trending and automating event detection, notification, and correction within existing and new applications and infrastructure implementations. In short we improved reliability and reduced business outages and incidents by 50% through building in stability with performance management mechanisms in existing and new applications and infrastructure. Utilizing this methodology allowed my teams and I to receive above average performance ratings in Information Technology focused on Commercial Customer engagements. I have the capability to make a measured difference in your organization. I am an excellent people leader and understand how to transform organizational goals into plans that can be executed to deliver the desired result. That is what I do."
bad,"Worked a great deal by myself over half of N.C., managed calls daily by priority on various products, I was the stand in lead tech for several years during the period when HP aquired Compaq. While I was the stand in Lead Tech I was responsible for making the work schedule, giving management input for evals, working with the other engineers to resolve any issues, & working with High Availabilty customers to ensure service commitments where kept! On several occassions other areas requested my assistance in which I might have to travel several states away to help out other areas."
bad,"My job was to sale computers to customers via the phone. I enjoyed my coworkers, and my trainers. Management was less than desirable and treated you more like a number than a person. The hardest part of this job was trying to sell a computer to someone who could not afford it, and then getting into trouble when you didn't make the sale. This company makes sure you are aware that you are expendable, and that you can and will be replaced."
bad,Make the organisation across APJ more resilient to disruptive events..
bad,"Hard worker,very reliable, very punctual, and never told numerous of times to do a certain task."
bad,"There's nothing special about HP so if you need a job go ahead and apply otherwise the ""HP"" you know from the 80s is long gone. Now is management who doesn't give a crank, spends 50% of their time visiting customers (even non sales) and then wonders why the business is falling apart on the inside. They tease you with more work means better ratings so better chance of promition / bigger bonus but rarely have I seen that true."
bad,"- learn about different markets/cultures"
bad,Trabalhei em varios clientes lideres de mercado onde tive oportunidade de aprender novas tecnologias  e crescer profissionalmente.
bad,"weekly lays offs, bad environment, sold to 4 different companies while I worked the Management only cared for shareholder approval, did not care for customers, work environment or employees"
bad,"Strong leadership, but downsizing creates resource gap. Lack of prioritization at lower levels.  It often depends upon the group you work in or your direct manager how happy you are at work.  Opportunities for travel and international experience."
bad,"These is per account based. My review is only to the account that has been joined."
bad,"El sueldo es un 30% menos que en el resto del mercado, desorganizacion total interna, te regalan muchos productos de merchandise pero no mejoran el sueldo luego de un impacto del 30% en el dolar.... tardan mucho en asignar tareas y solo se dedican a ""tapar baches"" en lugar de manejarse de forma más proactiva."
bad,this was just a job to fill in until I got my real job. I worked as a temp and didn't stay long. to much stuff for a real job I would not recommend this to anyone
bad,"My time with HP was a long time ago and best forgotten.  I've never seen so much middle management anywhere in all my life. I learned more from news and twitter about HP than from any corporate communications.  I dealt with less bureaucracy in the DoD with a top secret clearance..  "
bad,"it has been too long to write this fairly."
bad,"I worked there during the Carly Fiorina years.  It was terrible.  We were never provided adequate training or resources, and told to just work harder."
bad,"The company was in transition, and wasnt sure where it was going. Looking for an identity while not sure it wanted employees and eventually pulled out of Ireland."
bad,"Lots of incompetence, no management and leadership growth. Toxic environment. Management to not read or seek personal or professional growth. The norm was nepotism, very dangerous for a company in a competitive space."
bad,"You learn really a lot, despite that this could be on the expense of the pay. Customer oriented, and results driven organization with deep focus on costs. A typical work day was really a very busy day."
bad,"I have never been in an organization where I saw management in a specific organization look at their employees and peers and lie to them with a straight face.  Management does not give clear expectations and can't make decisions.  Lots of hierarchy and bureaucracy like government employment.  Also seen them do mass FTE hiring, and then lay them off year later.  Avoid HP."
bad,"Didn't like it. It was not a good place to work at, People do not help you out to go in place in life. The mangers will not help out their co-worker or support them."
bad,"For the first 5 years at HP it was good. Was able to learn my job well, got great reviews. But when we moved offices it went down hill. New management, new contract caused a lot of lay offs. Watched many co workers get laid off with no clue it was going to happen. They started out sourcing a lot of positions. Sad really. I wanted to spend my career there but had to leave, no job security."
bad,"Working as a consultant there were very Long hours, but there was no opportunity for advancement."
bad,Very unstable company at the time. You would come to work and they would ask for employees to go home because there was not enough work. I believe this was right before the Compaq merger.
bad,"it was a contract job and only hire contract workers, without benefits"
bad,HP can be a great place of employment depending on which department you work for. Management varies so it all depends. As far as my own personal experience I felt HP was just a stepping stone to bigger and better things.
bad,Ok to work for a temp position.  If you like the good old boy type of work environment that doesn't allow for promotion if your not in the good ole boy group by the management
bad,"There is no room for improvement or advancement or I should say management talks about it but does not deliver."
bad,workplace culture - HPE seems to have lost its indentity.  Doesn't seem to know what piece of the market to go after.  Lots of layoffs and instability in the executive level
bad,Staff are always made to do with less resources and constantly looking to lay people off.  Sr. management is looking to help shareholders instead of doing the right thing of building the business.
bad,"Typical workdays at HP were very stressful and most of the time un-productive do to overbearing management.  Countless useless internal conference calls, forecasting multiple times per week, tons of office work.  At HP you spend about 80% of your time in some sort of training, spreadsheet work, forecasting work, planning work, etc and only about 20% (or less) selling to a customer.  Just think how great HP would be if the Sales Teams spent 80% of their time engaging customers!!!"
bad,not bad for most part your left alone and allowed to work how you want as long as you meet deadlines and other expectations. They were very Flexible..
bad,"Everything is done reactively.  No processes or best practices in place for dealing with issues.  Three different, often conflicting, layers of management.  Typical work day consists of service related cases opened for support with minimal training on the equipment to help on technical issues.  Many have little to no experience in additive manufacturing/printing.  The workplace culture differs between divisions and products.  All are treated as start ups and some seem to reinvent the wheel instead of studying and Implementing best practice processes from successful groups."
bad,"Mogelijkheden binnen dit bedrijf in Nederland is zeer beperkt tot verkoop functies. De rest zijn allemaal off-shored naar laagloon landen."
bad,Terrible company; cost cutting is a higher priority than retaining talent.  Forced large number of work force to a contract house in order to take away benefits.
bad,"This job was doomed from the beginning. I didn't receive a laptop for the first 3 months, was never sent to the boot camp training I was told others had attended, and needed to attend, and basically just felt like I'd been hired as firing fodder when the layoffs came around in January of 2014. "
bad,"Taking care of Logistics:"
bad,"I have been working at DXC Technology full-time (More than 1 year)"
bad,Dysfunctional and unprofessional.  I have NEVER heard so much profanity and yelling in the workplace.  Lack of communication and information needed to do my job is what is prompting me to leave.  New to HP and there are NO mentors to go to learn how things work.  HP Inc continues to have growing pains since the separation from HPE.  There is a huge difference between a leader and a Boss.  I have a boss who barks.  Not leads.
bad,Support 3 different contracts at once and expected to get all work done in a timely manner. Have learned fully about computers and printers.  There is no chance of a raise.
bad,"Hard to come into this place, which people still referred to as the former Compag straight out of college. Employees had very low moral and not much incentive to work harder or smarter."
bad,"When we had a lot of work, I had to work over the weekends but if we have less work, we have to worry about the lay-offs.  No peaceful time at all, while I work for HP Enterprise, now DXC.technology.  That is all my exact opinion."
bad,Working at HPE/DXC was like working with a black cloud over one's head for the last few years. Always wondering when your job was going to be off-shored until it finally happened.
bad,"Company makes a decent PC but has no loyalty to staff.  Cutting staff, moving work offshore and then cutting those jobs.  Not sure if they know what direction they are trying to go in but seems to be the wrong one."
bad,"Nao tive oportunidade de trenamento , pois a empresa existe um preconceito a pcd , a empresa nao obdece a lei de cota ,imposto no nosso territorio. Muito gerentes nao sabe li da com essa pessoas e nao ajuda na tarefa de trabalho ."
bad,"The company seems to have lost its vision after he exit of M Hurd its visionary CEO. They were a company that boasted of innovation, fun, amazing etc. Bt all that seems to zero out with a head thats not in the right place."
bad,"Stressful job. Management lacks future vision. Cost cutting was common place, not a great team spirit. Future is unpredictable. Not many career opportunities"
bad,La actitud de la mayor parte de su personal es desgastante y el grueso de sus empleados son subcontratados.
bad,Working at the company for more than 5 years is a big achievement for me as employee because they let me to contribute my skills most especially on the IT environment. I will always feel comfortable at the office and the management is very approachable.
bad,"When I was in this company I did my job well done , I was enjoy my days working with my co workers but everytime that our project was almost done our supervisor need to talk to us and tell us that they need to lay off some people due to no more project or test to do."
bad,"Marketed Desk Top Computers & Educational purpose pre-programmed Computers"
bad,When HP took over - it began a day to day issue - that you never knew if you would be tapped on the shoulder that day to say you were done - pack your box.  Very stressful environment.  I worked with great people - learned alot - but the way the company is managed leaves much to be desired.
bad,"Management is losing focus and to many layers of it, not enough workers in the trenches.  I enjoy the work I do and the coworkers that I have, however the open door policy will lead to your demise."
bad,"Good flexible working environment.   "
bad,"Terrible Place to Work For, no focus on career development, salary was below average, not a good overall work environment.."
bad,Very poorly managed. No job security or advancement. Temp workers will not be hired in. Some permanent workers where forced to become temp workers
bad,Process/Tools need huge improvements. Many changes going on all over the world but those changes are more conventional than innovative
bad,"Used to be one of the best companies to work for, now there is too much overseas moving, and guessing on what managements next steps will be to cut costs - getting rid of top talent for cheaper labor. Management stays - workers go."
bad,people are very invested into their coworkers personal lives and it just isn't ran as professionally as it should be without ties outside the work place
bad,"Same routine day of work throughout the year since the day I started"
bad,The company I started first. I was a fresher and being a fresher expectation was quite high. I was an contractor so at any point they gonna ask me to leave. Even after working hard and giving 100% in the job no appreciation. Risk of losing the job was there
bad,Poor management. never enough work.co-workers was cool.co-workers brings in lunches on holidays. Not all jobs are organized the way they should be
bad,"Corporate management is very poor.  Their review process of employees is laughable as someone you've never met and knows nothing of your job tasks manages your performance reviews.  Required training  often has nothing at all to do with the employees role.  They treat their onshore employees horrible - an example would be what they did to their HPE employees that they sold to Ciber, which made national news."
bad,"I went into Hp with no experience in computers and now i have 5 years in Building, testing and repairing servers. Management is horrible it seems like they dont care about the blue collar employees that actually Manufacture the servers but only the upstairs people. Now the company is splitting in 2 different companies and estimated layoff is 10,000 so no job security. I like the work that i do but i would rather do it somewhere else."
bad,"Beats a blank if you can't find a job elsewhere. Don't expect competitive pay, and pension is gone too."
bad,until HP bought Compaq. It has been a downward spiral ever since.  Management isn't consistent with the 5 year plan. I don't even think they have one because it changes every quarter.  They have created a cut throat environment due to Work Force Reductions.  If you're not in your bosses pocket there is no hope for you.
bad,"HP has good work life balance, flexible WFH policy for years and then they are trying to remove it. But it's getting too big, hard to link my job to the company's strategy."
bad,"This used to be a good company to work for.  There once was a great work/life balance, great health benefits package and good management. Happy employees=great work production.  "
bad,"Typical workday at office is generally healthy because of good colleagues. Overall system is bulky and there are too many dependencies for getting regular work done. Conference calls with more than 10-15 members are very common, therefore lot of time is spent in conference calls without much contribution."
bad,"I am just looking for a place where I can be given the chance to learn more and advance my carrer. The work there was good and sometimes a adventure, sometimes it would challenge you and that I liked."
bad,"1. Helped customers with billing,orders,payments,credits."
bad,"- Political atmosphere makes getting even simple tasks done."
bad,"It lacked diversity and culture. I did not like working for this company. what more do you want me to say, I was not happy there management had favorites and to me it wasn't a fair place to work. I'm happy I no longer work there."
bad,One of the most unorganized sub-contractors i have ever worked for.
bad,I am not willing to particiapte in desicrating this company.  Very high turn over ratio.  I am still employed with this company so I am thankful that I have a check coming in.
bad,"Work varies from day-to-day. Sometimes there is a lot to do while others there is no work at all. We don't know until we get to work. Management does not share information with workers regarding plans, short or long-term, which creates an extensive rumor mill. It seems there is no job security for anyone, but no one is sure. The worst part is that management doesn't care about growing their employees and there is no room or support for advancement."
bad,This company is constantly shifting leadership and lacks clear direction in where it is headed
bad,"Por se tratar de uma multinacional com diversos segmentos, a divisão de tecnologia de informação por ser oriunda de uma aquisição da EDS Electronic Data Systems a HP acabou se tornando uma gigante em pouco tempo, porem ainda esta no processo de assimilar todo o legado absorvido."
bad,"Worked approximately 5 years, in the first stage, the first 3 years, the work was wonderful, good companions, good manager, the last two years many things had changed at work (like companions, managers and tasks )and ended up being a place where it is not pleasant work there"
bad,"Under HP Enterprise Services, compensation is low due to the fact that the company is in a turnaround. Close to no chance for a promotion or career advancement, raises, bonuses. This company also doesn't aid or promote self-progression such as attaining a masters degree. Seems like a dead end to me."
bad,People are hard working but the company acquired the people and didn't know how to manage people vs. hardware. Not structured for growth.
bad,Upper management and the board's greed has lost touch with employee's needs. Almost impossible to advance or get pay raises.
bad,"I worked on Sharepoint ,html and java script to design webPortals for BAS portal."
bad,"There is very less fun at work"
bad,The best part of Hp was the collegues and the fun we had at work place
bad,"The company has been struggling to get back on track for years. Management constantly asks employees to ""do more for the good of the company"" while job security, benefits, etc., are reduced. The company is way too big to effectively communicate its message to employees. Managers spend time trying to figure out solutions on their own, so employees get many mixed messages. On the plus side, many employees truly want to do a good job and make things better."
bad,good place for freshers to start the carrier and help to learn more about business
bad,"No teamwork, little if any esprit de corps!  Not a technology innovator any longer.  Poorly trained managers and an HR system that does not value diversity or performance.  "
bad,"Working for HP was a very good experience for me and a challenge. I learn how to build servers from scratch, and learn how to pretest and repair them as well. I also learn how to troubleshoot, and cable these servers as well. The management at HP was not so well at all. My co-workers we keep a close bond on the assignments that we had. We often help each other to get the job done. The most hardest part of the job was to keep work flowing, because sometime we wouldn't have any work. The enjoyable part about HP was having work through out the hold day."
bad,"HP is a company that offers a wide range of career oppurtunities. In my instance, the career required a significant amount of time from my my personal life to be successful and the sacrifice was not recognize by management."
bad,I went to HP looking for a good position in which I could advance. I moved from my first position to take a software engineer position in R&D thinking that this would be good for my career. I found that there environment is a slave shop and newcomers are not treated nicely due to the yearly layoffs. Everyone is uptight and at each others throat. The company underpays and undervalues employees. Engineers are treated as second class citizens while business people take all of the credit.
bad,"As a contract employee at HP there is no opportunity for advancement and the pay is below average for the skill-set required to do this job. I was well-matched to the the skills required for the position, but the lack of potential for advancement was very disappointing."
bad,- Poor coordination with customer
bad,"Never knew when you came to work if it was going to be your last. HP know nothing about rewarding hard work, dependability, all they care about is that the work gets done........no regard for employees."
bad,Very specific culture
bad,"Company has great products, but working there in services is no longer desirable. HP has lost its way in terms of direction because of former CEO Mark Hurd, and may never recover from his tenure."
bad,"I found that as a contract employee, I often felt like a second class citizen.  My security badge was a different color than the HP employees, making me stand out.  HP employees did not seem to care much about the contract employees.  As a contract employee, you either strictly perform to standards, or you will be let go."
bad,"I liked the work and didn't actually mind the long extra hours I had to put in just to keep up. However when it became expected of me to work  those very long hours, I felt taken for granted. When I left the project they spread out my responsibilities amount 3 people."
bad,Great Management team for most part.  The culture is strong and salaries have become increasingly more competitive.  I learned a lot of new technology.
bad,Trabajé como outsourcing y jamás volvería a trabajar en HP en mi vida.
bad,HP was great a long time ago but the HP way is no longer followed.  Management has become very short term focused which restricts long term growth. Benefits have been reduced.  It used to be special but is now just another valley company
bad,"as with all things HP they had no interest in the companies they acquired, just the intellectual assets and the short term profits they could acquire from selling off the assets of the acquired entity."
bad,"job culture is good, Salary decent with good benefits, Its a good company for startup carrier. but lot of changes happened after joining the company its get separated and"
bad,"HP Inc has been making a push away from software solutions since the split from Enterprise, and steering into their hardware offerings. I participated in more code reviews and software training/collaboration on best practices as an intern than as a full-time employee. Structures are setup to send as much software work overseas as possible, while shrinking the remaining software teams located in the U.S. Multiple teams, including some outside of software, were completely erased practically overnight, with less than 48 hours notice given in some cases before shutting down."
bad,"HPI choose a strategy to outsource their development teams to cut their cost. Cost-quality went down, and their employees don't have chances to gain new skills. Very bad, and sad strategy."
bad,"I worked for HP fr approximately 2 years. In those 2 years, I learned very little and was not able to go above and beyond to help customers. I hope they have straightened this out by now."
bad,"You work with some great people and make some good connects for future opportunities. They pay low but have good benefits and have little concern for personal matters. "
bad,"hmm Great job to kill time, but it was like boring you always had to figure out what to do in down time you couldnt like check your phone or chill in your down time"
bad,"Company was in its infancy, but they did not seem to care for employees as much as they should. The bottom dollar was always more important. Customer satisfaction was a point they were good with."
bad,"Most employees were stressed, very competitive and employees were overloaded with assignments."
bad,"Only way to grow@HP is to transfer out of your job and work you are good at, to find some other parallel group that would provide a career advancement opportunity, without little experience in the workings of that group, somehow hoping that this would magically fall into place with relationships build over time."
bad,"A empresa é boa no quesito autonomia, porém não tem uma boa estrutura de cargos e salários, benefício de Vale refeição não condiz com valores das regiões onde os funcionários estão alocados. Funcionário registrado como auxiliar administrativo faz função de analista de recursos humanos e não tem salário compatível a área, mesmo registro faz função de MIS, de analista de trafego, funcionários com cargos diferentes fazem a mesma função com salários diferentes."
bad,"HP ""used"" to be the place to work, like Apple, Facebook or Google are today. And it was just as difficult to get hired there. Somewhere along the way, they lost their mojo and then came a revolving door of leaders, reorgs and upheaval. It was a once proud and thriving brand that lost it's way and that grew too big for its own good. Now it is a bit of a punchline. Bureaucratic and stodgy, with more time spent developing powerpoint than developing products."

bad,"A stressful environment that was primarily focused on production. Compensation was poor and environment was not a good one."
bad,"Call center environment which consisted of working in a small cube type space sharing it with a co-worker. Consistently measured on number of calls taken, length of call, first call resolution etc. NO  had certain call center agents assigned as 2nd level support agents whom had the title ""engineer"" and they presented themselves to the UP customer base without ever having an engineering degree or background. Very mis-leading and deceitful business practice."
bad,"Too many company splits, no loyalty, no compensation or packages, no raises, many layoffs, no job security, flexible hours for the most part and work from home for the most part."
bad,The company really worries more about their client than their employees. Not all that hard of a job to do but company needs to work on employee relations.
bad,"I worked in Fort Collins, Co on a six year ""temporary "" assignment.."
bad,"The job was not difficult but the pay was low, had no opportunity to advance after 3 years, and high expectations with no additional money and additional responsibilities"
bad,"Job nature is good, but Company may not survive for long. Great opportunity to work with cross culture teams. Work culture is inclusive. Growth opportunities are limited and job security doesn't exist"
bad,"The work hours are great, you only work monday - thursday 10 hr shifts. You get 2 paid breaks not including 30 min lunch. The bosses are something else tho. they think they can treat you however they deem. They don't pay good unless you are one of the chosen ones. They give you vacation days but you can't use them until they tell you. For some reason you can't directly speak to the president not even a hello or good morning."
bad,"Very stressful place to work, always worrying about layoffs. Very hard to get promotion if you are not part of the 'good old boy' click. Some good people work here but their futures are not secure."

bad,"I was working at EDS, when they were bought by HP.  I will never forget the email sent out by the CEO on a Tuesday evening (i.e., after work hours) that first praised the value provided by EDS and then announced that everyone would be getting a 5% paycut.  The then-CEO tried to soften this announcement by stating that he would be getting a 10% paycut, but since an overwhelming percentage of his compensation was stock, this 10% paycut was a mere pittance.  A few months later, the company then told me that I would be getting an additional 30% paycut but stated (as an act of humanity?!) that it would be 20% in a few weeks, and then another 10% one year later (Nice incentive to over-perform for the upcoming year, eh?).  The company was then shocked, shocked, shocked, that I left HP immediately to join a company that would pay my market value."
bad,"HP operates on a forced ranking system, meaning if you have 5 people on your team and they are all great employees. you have to rank them from best to worst, and somebody has to get the worst rating, which is usually the least politically protected one out of the group. i had 4 different managers in the 3 years i was there and they were all horrible and could care less about career advancement."
bad,"Good stable position if you are comfortable with entry level pay. Favoritist advancement, not based on initiative or performance. Many benefits and perks (free products, mandatory shutdowns and time off) for sales/revenue positions, customer service gets nothing except longer hours and lower pay with less opportunity to advance."

bad,"In order to be lean after the split with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc has decided to outsource many of the core functions.  Overall this is a fine company to work in, but it is not exceptional."
bad,HP use to be a great company.  When I first started it was still a great place to work.  Over the years it bent to product cost pressures and watered down it culture through acquisitions.  By the time I left I had three project managers managing my one engineering piece.  Due the heavy outsourcing HP management felt they needed to add layers of project managers to monitor and track everything.  It became a bad place to be a technical employee.  My day often started early in the morning and didn't end until late at night due to all the meetings during the day and the need to get work done that was then done at night.
bad,"Team Leaders are rude. No training classes they just through you in and expect you to know what to do. Poor customer relations.The hardest part of the job is that the team leaders or not organized. Also once you go to lunch around 3 am you get real sleepy and its hard to stay awake. The pay rate is decent. I learned about computer serial numbers,and how to enter codes into the computer."
bad,"It was a pretty good place to work, but in this economic climate or with the current Management is shrinking rapidly."
bad,This was a great place to gain professional experience HP is a huge company with plenty of growth opportunities. however the compensation is poor and expectation and demand is very high.

bad,"I am not willing to disclose more than my ratings above have shown. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the work, I am unable to write much more about the company."
bad,"The role was new and had not been done previously. It was severely under scoped... The work required for the role and additional responsibilities continuously added were commensurate with someone making 2-3 times what the position was scoped at. "
bad,"I got the job right out of school. I chose it over another offer with a lower salary. Big mistake. I was part of one HP's huge layoff's that has happened in the last decade or so. Something to the tune of 35,000 or so lives were arbitrarily chosen to be ruined that year. But to a company like HP, with more than 200,000 employees, that's just a drop in the ocean. I had just been thrown out of college in to the world and that was the first taste what I was to expect from the companies for which I was to work. Amazon has recently received some bad press for treating their employees like dirt and expecting ever more from them; not letting them have a life outside of work. Well, HP was like that, but with far less reason to do so. An up and coming company like Amazon or Apple can at least have SOME expectation from its employees that they could be working for the best company in the world, or at least the industry. HP? HP has been sliding for some time, and shows no signs of stopping."

Prior to this change the work was challenging, interesting, and the culture was okay.  Now all three have dramatically changed for the worse.  Maybe once the company split actions have settled things will be fine but for now it isn't a fun place to be employed."
bad,"At HP, we don't just believe in the power of Technology. We believe in the power of people when technology works for you. If we are going to do something, Make it Matter !"
bad,"I don't see any appreciation for the hard and smart workers, the company fully relies on the peoples who relay on buttering. If you know how to praise the management with a blind eye, then there is always a scope your growth."

My manager was new to the company and was learning as I was learning the functions of the department.  He was 20 years out of the military and was abusive verbally.  There was a tremendous amount of turn around in this company.  The benefits were awesome.  I was a temp to hire and got hired after the hours I completed due to my impeccable performance and attendance and willingness to show up for all volunteer and mandatory overtime.  I was told I would have a review after 60 days and this did not happen.  I should have also been compensated for the certifications I completed for forklift, order picker, walk rider."
bad,"My stay was brief so it's hard to say but in my short stay at HP, the management was not fun to work for. The call center staff was fun, the culture could have been a great place. I loved that they had a softball team and a bowling league."

bad,"Not a great place to work, services is going down. Management do not have clue about services."
bad,"I gained valuable experience at HP Products just because it was a larger company and there was a lot to do. Unfortunately if you're not liked by the leaders, you won't last. "
bad,"HP has been a sad story. In the nutshell: an iconoclastic founder of the Silicon Valley, that for 60 years was a venerated company, a leader in high tech innovation, with unique corporate culture, with motivated and loyal employees which in the last 10 years has been reduced to a struggling behemoth with no innovation, with the lowest employee moral in the industry, continuous mass layoffs, non-stop board intrigues and board squabbles, strategic decisions that - every one of them - turned out to be a major disaster for the company, employees, and stockholders. A sad story indeed..."
bad,"This position was highly unorganized, from the start there is no training period, they give you a bunch of electronic paperwork and tell you to review it, it took me 4 days to actually touch any equipment. This company has huge communication issues between the technicians, and the actual clients, you would written up daily by clients because they don't have software they had before there refresh, and somehow that is your fault. The pay for entry level was ok, but could have been better, no overtime whatsoever, if you went over 40, you didn't get it, they company was very shady in that regard."
bad,"The only good thing I have to say about working at HP is about the people. Every person I have worked with so far have been a joy to work with. I would list all of the good and bad things about working here, but basically every aspect of the company is bad. Career advancement, compensation, benefits, culture, management, are all practically non-existent to the average employee. There is too much work needed to be done at HP to bring morale back to comfortable levels. Everyone sees it and now the company is losing a LOT of good people."
bad,"Co- Workers were fine and some of the supervisors were genuinely willing to help you acheive your goals, but you had people yelling at you all day every day. DO NOT WORK HERE AS A CONTRACTOR THROUGH ANOTHER COMPANY! you are treated as a second class citizen and it is known and rubbed in your face that you are not as good as the other reps who are hp direct."
bad,"It's a call center for the worst computer company in the world, besides Dell. I wouldn't be on Indeed looking for a job if it were great..."
bad,"Managed by people off-site who don't contact you unless they really really have to, don't tell you when they are visiting the office (expect you to know when they are going to be there) and don't introduce themselves or otherwise talk to you when they are in the office."
bad,Co-workers are awesome. Primary job function is being GM's scapegoat. Constant negative and complaint calls. Management does very little to ease matters. Pay does not match the work and is not up to par with other company's call centers. No union. If you can take being surrounded by extreme negativity from customers and management 8 hours a day this job is for you.
bad,"My experience with HP has been short but memorable. Our managers are not in touch with HP cultures or proceedures. My team seems to be a bit isolated and confused. We work hard, but there is no recognition for hard work. I would not recommend HP if you want to build a satisfying and long career in this industry."
bad,"At first I was excited to be learning new things, work for a big company, maybe work my way up the food chain."
bad,"It was an ok company, they didn't back up there reps there nor had much benefits for certain places. I would not work there again"
bad,"17 years later and I still miss this place, even after all the bad things. 4am start on the road was not unusual, 10pm finish was not unusual either. Really long days, driving all over creation."

bad,"A typical day at work consist of fielding phone calls, working tickets/ resolving customer tickets via Windows remote desktop/ assist. There is frequent break/fix of laptops and desktops."
bad,Very good company to work with with excellent benefits and a great working environment. The negative point is the management that often does not comply with the agreements made with the employees.
bad,"Best place, best people and unlimited learning, combination of skills and technology at its best, what i like most is seemless growth opportunity one can see."
bad,"sitting too long, not able to get assistance when needed, not able to take breaks long enough to stretch your legs or eat a good lunch and enjoy it. not really able to collaborate with coworkers. Overall good work experience with the company. For the most part the management was approachable and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job is siting for long periods at a time and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people all over the world."
bad,Tough to see a career in a product company when you are a consultant providing services.  Company did provide the opportunity to have a work balance which I appreciated.
bad,Working at HP was stressful and cut throat the job culture was survival of the fittest management was horrible the hardest part of the job was receiving customer criticism about the errors and attitude of HP remote support and calming down the customer. The most enjoyable part was getting away on vacation.
bad,HP has a fun working environment but lacks challenge and growth for employees. Salary is okay but no salary growth for employees for more than 3 years
bad,"Over load you with work - but pay little. Work long hours. But this also depended on what department you work for. When I first started it was a great company, but over time different changes with management."
bad,"You have to monitor the work load with lots of Screens to follow."
bad,I have worked for HP for almost 7 years and they were not a forward thinking company at all. The company split and the had a spin off to DXC Technology. I have not received a pay raise for 5 years. They are now hiring new agents for 3 dollar more an hour than I make. This is breeding a contentious attitude between tenured employees and new hires. Not a comfortable work environment any longer.
bad,HP is a turbulent place to work.  They have changed their strategy often in the last 6 years and had so many layoffs.  Their strategy to focus on hardware is misguided in my opinion.
bad,"HP is filled with bright hard working employees and work hours are long but flexible.  On the down side, management doesn't seem to have the ability to innovate or produce quality products."
bad,"From the top leadership does not care about employees based in the USA.  They are constantly letting American workers go so they can utilize lower-cost employees in other countries."
bad,"Compañeros de trabajo, tenga en cuenta 10, pero los ejecutivos y vendedores de contrato, son como un mono tocando el piano. Se rompió HP Inc en Brasil."
bad,"There may be work and there may not be work, line operators are impatient and rude, no one seems to take the job serious other than management"
bad,There is disconnect between employee and manager's expectation.Lot of regional politics and you are rated based on that.
bad,The work environment and culture was no always on the positive side.  Several co-workers made the work day/week very enjoyable.
bad,"Since it's been such a long established company, HP could use a little culture change to fit more in with today's growing society. This will help retain employees and urge others that aren't already in the company to work here."
bad,Strong company but continuous change. I had 5 bosses in less than 3 years.  Empowered the employees. Good people to work with.
bad,"Good flexibility to work from home, as long as work is done. However, Management is poor, Strategy for growing the business is missing, most decisions are tops-down without discussion with people doing the work, and talent is not recognized. People aren't placed in the right positions by Management, and not given opportunity to advance to align their skills to where they can add greatest value to HP. As a result, HP suffers due to poor talent management. Also, longer you've been with the company, the more highly regarded you are for future roles, whether or not there are other more qualified candidates."
bad,The job requirements were misleading. 8 hour days M-F turned into 12+ hours daily plus some weekend work. I loved the work I did.
bad,"Management has increased their communication to employees over the last few years. Employees have a clear understanding what HP is attempting to accomplish and how we are going to make that happen.    "
bad,No plan to bring new employees into the fold.  Very hap-hazard.
bad,"Am working since 2011 at present ."
bad,"HP was once considered a national treasure, a true engine for innovation. Over the years, its become more of a follower, perhaps due to the commodity nature of IT in general, and a typical corporate aversion to risk."
bad,"A divisão de prestação de serviços da HP infelizmente vem acabando com tudo que os funcionários da EDS construíram. "
bad,"* Learnt client management, Technical troubleshooting"
bad,"The culture has faltered, you are overworked and underpaid. You advance if you are in the right group or friends with the right people otherwise you are stuck. Management does not care about you, they only care about themselves, so don't expect much help."
bad,"horarios muy largos, pero divertido asesores clientes todo el dia y vender"
bad,"While HP has a tremendous history, it is currently experiencing an identity crisis which has yet to do its worst damage. Join this ship at your own risk; although it will probably not entirely sink, it has not finished taking on water yet. There is more trouble on the horizon for Hewlett-Packard."
bad,"HP acquired EDS and there was a major culture change. Local management was focused on client delivery. Personnel managers were offsite, usually in a different city/state. I learned many new application support and programming skills while working for EDS - HP. I worked with some of the best in the IT industry. Hardest part of my job was training myself on how to create installation scripts. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my customer."
bad,The main issue I had with working at HP is whenever there were campus events and team building events they were usually strictly for employees and not contractors.
bad,"There are great people who work for the company, but many were lost to staff reductions.  Repetitive staff reductions was a drain on employee engagement."
bad,"Initially hired as a Manager - Work force Reduced"
bad,Lots of different partners and teams to deal with so made job interesting and your immediate team could be good but the culture of the company slowly degenerated and that was being felt company wide
bad,"HP's new mantra says it all, Re-invent. Many of the most innovative people in the company have left due to the lack of support for innovative ideas. Everyone likes to be safe and comfortable doing what they have always done. Not great for being world class like HP once was. New culture is to buy way into markets and not invent organically. Who wants to re-invent the wheel?"
bad,"loved my job, hated that I always worried about being laid off.  When they let me go after 16 years, I called it involuntarily retirement.  Miss the culture of the team i was on"
bad,"Salary is average, job security is ok during my engagement, however management is acting slowly to keep up the market trend. job culture is so so and company did not any innovation."
bad,"I spent 33+ years with HP and was released by one of the poorest excuses for a leader I have ever experienced. The culture was poor and constantly focused on nothing but metrics and the quarterly financials. While those are both important the old culture of quality, customer service, great products and individual creativity and achievement that can affect the entire team are gone. Such a shame to see a great company begin to crumble because its culture and heart have been ripped from its chest by management that serves itself above all else."
bad,"I had two different positions at HP. My first position was great, but the pay (for what I did) was low. In addition, my position was due to be ""best shored""."
bad,"Annual layoffs every year create a uneasy, cut-throat, paranoid working environment. Poor Management creates unsatisfied customers and employees. Excellent work life balance if you have a family but if you like fast pace, innovative, ambitious environments, you'll be miserable at HP."
bad,"Nearly everything and everyone good about HP has been slowly drained away over the last fifteen years. The slogans and stated values are the same, but they have no influence over the decisions that get made."
bad,Very nice place to work and diversified work place flexible working hours fast paced environment and good work related achievements and reliable company to work
bad,Service delivery just wasn't in the cards for HP. After the EDS acquisition HP started to loose its identity in the market place. Slowly M&A after M&A  No one knew if there were still a manufacturing organization or a service delivery tech org trying to compete with big blue.

bad,"instead of maximizing service revenues, cutting cost despite long term impact to clients.  Whereas there will likely be a boost to the overall stock value, the ability to serve the real needs of the company and the talent by which to sustain market share, will be greatly diminished."
bad,"En un inicio cuando ingresé a HP Perú, me dijeron que el horario era de 9am a 6pm. L-V, pero luego la cosa cambió, empezaron a haber amanecidas y trabajos en fin de semana, sin que sea remunerado de acorde a ley, pero HP cobra bien rico."
bad,"as a customer service engineer I had a great deal of freedom.  I was responsible for arranging my work day.  Being independent was a must for the job.  You do need to have good communication skills.  to work with remote engineers, project managers, managers and customers."

Too much red tape, legal training, over-communication, etc. Seemed they were always concerned about covering their butts than their employees."
bad,the best part of my time at HP was the onboarding process where you were educated on the HP history and culture....really had me amped! All down hill from there!
bad,The company is good if you are in the right team. Some organizations can be very helpful for your career and some can be very toxic and stressful. Be thorough when asking them about their culture.
bad,"Working for HP was stressful because day by day, you didn't know if you would have a job or not.  HP was always doing alot of workforce reduction."
bad,The company bottom line seems more important than the people.  I love the people that are still there but the business side of things has changed to the point that the people are just a commodity.
bad,I am going to sell LCD in this company this is a famous company this company is very hard working and have good things. I like to do work here.This is the company of technology
bad,"Overall the HP building near my location showed what a lack of care there is of new coming staff, a trainning wich included a  lot tof trainning material to remember and as they mention""quick to get by"" and all landed on ink on a whiteboard, since there was never real live equipment for tutoring or guidance, nor shadowing with tenured agents on site, making it really difficult for anyone to feel encouraged to come the next day for more of the same trainning quality. On that very note, the trainning staff seemed very little concerned for people whose english in the same training class weren´t as fluent as his/hers was, making it look very much like  ""those who wont make it in the trainning will be later replaced with an upcoming wave of staff"", while this wasnt my case, trainning wasnt the very nest experience neither socially nor professionally speaking. "
bad,They never really make you an employee so they can come in and layoff entire departments at once which is what happen to my group. That being said I enjoyed my time there love working with the Group I worked with and the campus is amazing
bad,I would only recommend working at HP if pay increases were given more frequently and mandatory OT was eliminated. They were very good about giving away products that we sold as incentives.
bad,"Must love travel, must be self motivated, must be a self starter. Must be willing to solve your own problems.  Not a great deal of support provided must find your own solutions"
bad,"HP are a great employer for contract employees but I'd never recommend working for them as a permanent employee.  Though the rates weren't great, the balance between job and life was exceptional."
bad,"Lack of continuity.  Bad people management in regards to hours and benefits.  Lack of advancement opportunity.  Great direct manager and schedule flexibility, bad upper management."
bad,The management gave direction to build solutions and approach the market with a flexible model that saw good growth in the business. The focus on specific solutions helped growing the business.
bad,"Independent Work lifestyle. "
bad,"Nothing more about specific PROS or CONS, if we work well we can grow up very well. Transport Facility is there, Team Dinner or Team Outing there etc.,"
bad,"Trabalho operacional, com muita competitividade e cobranças, pouca possibilidade de crescimento."
bad,HP has gone thru significant change over the last few years and as  result has become a very challenging work environment.
bad,HP is in the middle of a change. It has been focused on selling for too long and lost pace of the industry pioneers. It is now building up a new strategy to find a better place in the IT industry map.
bad,"Its a good company with decent work life balance the Job culture is also good. over all its a good company. i have learned a lot in this company. the hardest part is the increment, the most enjoyable part is the work life balance"
bad,"I was hired on as new college graduate to work on back log projects. I thought it was a great opportunity and was so excited to work for HP! During the company changes, management assured me that I will have plenty of work and will not be affected by the work force reduction. "
bad,"Loved the job, my peers and interfacing with the customer. Management above me had no idea about anything I did day to day. The were paper pushers and had no technical experience at all."
bad,HP is good company to shine ourselves in our work and personal activities disciplines.
bad,No learning and career advancement opportunities exist. Job rotation policy is just not working
bad,pay not good

bad,"In the beginning when I started as a Junior Engineer, I grew a lot within the team. But at this point of time, I feel my growth is stagnant, I constantly look for opportunities within the team to get more projects and do code development but it seems the whole team is being pushed to just do maintenance work. HP has friendly and laid back environment to work at but overall employees are underpaid and to add up the employees had to take a pay cut just 2 years ago."
bad,Management did not treat me fairly during training. Petty reasons given for terming my contract.
bad,good staff at the time contracted work through Medicare company no longer has contract that is what caused me to leave the company. Other than that it was a good group of people
bad,"Don't bother if you're a temp, they will just let you go after your first 6 months. Unless you're a permanent employee you have no future there what so ever."
bad,Its a temp to hire...so I hope I can get hired on full time. It starts as a contract. Working on developing my skills in the network admin field to be better and more marketable.
bad,I do not wish to provide reviews of companies and their stuff.  I really do not have an opinion at this time but  seem to be forced to complete these reviews to continue.
bad,"Formely an EDS delivery center in El Paso, TX Hewlett Packard purchased with the official mission statement being that they offered ""off shore"" costs for an ""on shore"" location."
bad,"Realizava a configuração e instalação de sistemas operacionais, hardware, software e redes."
bad,"I used to love working for this company but lately the company has been laying off workers and this has had a negative effect on the workload on the the existing employees. The company expects to the workload with less personnel and will not compensate with additional pay in salary. The company does not care about who they hire anymore, they will hire anyone now without a degree as long as they save a buck."
bad,"Lot of good people left the company in early 2010s. Company still going through layoffs frequently. Must not be very good for employee morale. Salaries also not that high, I hear."
bad,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the classic example of how dysfunctional a bloated company can get.  Too many managers, and too many internal corporate meetings makes it difficult to get your individual work done."
bad,"I heard about HP before I started there but boy were they right!!!  HP has a high turnover rate, they tell you that you can always approach management if you have an issue or something that you need to address to them but that is not the case and you have those few that do care but most of them don't and they can care less about the job as well as the employee's and god forbid don't get sick or need surgery they will find a way to show you the door very quickly."
bad,"El responsable de proyecto apenas aparecía una vez al año por el proyecto, y sólo para hablar de algo que ignoraba casi por completo."
bad,"Ever since the company split, it looks like a death march at HP.  There is minimal innovation and everything is driven by cost, so if something costs anything more than free, forget about it."
bad,"Services division has been in cost cutting mode for more than a decade.  Revenues shrinking and no career growth opportunities here.  If they turn it around, could be a good place to work."
bad,Many issues while working here. Favoritism is rampant. They lost many good people due to internal processes. Not much more to say.
bad,"Duties include: Operate forklift equipment, handheld scanner, ensure the delivery of shipments, inspect all items prior to shipment, perform inventory and quality control."
bad,working on a military base. expected you to come in early everyday. very tight security and clicky management. if they liked you the job was easy. if they didn't like you work was difficault
bad,"Most of my co-workers were great to work with. I learned a lot from them. Management puts everything on the Production workers, while Managers are not held accountable for quality issues. Lots of playing favorites."
bad,"Ambiente e colegas de trabalho tranquilo, cliente sempre dava as melhores ferramentas para fazer o melhor trabalho."
bad,"Learnt a lot while on the job, visited various customers across the globe and various cultures. Worst part was the management and no pat on the back or encouragement or anything."
bad,HO as a company is a good company but unfortunately due to bad management and management structure the engineering side is loosing a lot of business.
bad,"Did not like this company at all."
bad,This company is not ran very well from the top levels of management.  I learned a lot from my direct lead whom I've built a close relationship with as well as our client Eli Lilly.
bad,"HP pays really low compared to competitors. So, come in as high as possible if you take a job there. Raises are very low, 1-3% every year and bonuses are low too.  Even when you get a promotion, it's hard to get more than 5%.  Benefits are great. They used to allow telecommuting but have recently forced all WFH employees to return to an office, regardless of how far of a drive they have."
bad,I worked for Hewlett Packard clearing cheques initially starting in out clearing working in the central unpaids department then moving onto working in sending out cheques and bank statemenmts to the high value accounts customers. Every day was a new day and no two days were the same.
bad,I have worked at HP for many years and had a chance to work in many business groups and learn about several areas
bad,"A lot of learning opportunities, there is a lot of change which could be a good and bad thing"
bad,Working environment is really very good but in terms of monetary benefits its too bad.
bad,big company with meetings upon meetings and little or no leadership/guidance
bad,"Sicherlich nicht schriftlich, jedoch in einem"
bad,Packed up the merchandise and prepared the merchandised to be shipped to stores.
bad,"I was only with them briefly and was brought over through the merger with EDS but I had no direction from leadership, was expected to do a job that had no description, and ultimately was let go as part of their massive furloughs."
bad,The most enjoyable part was HP's partnership.  I was involved in Executive support.    
bad,"I worked with customers to help them solve current and future business needs through the use of technology. I enjoyed the varied environment as I worked with customers from MANY different industries. I enjoyed making presentations, solving business problems, and managing projects."
bad,"One of the biggest complaints I have of the company is the quality of the people that I work with. In the past, I've worked with intelligent people at large Fortune 500 companies but am quite dissatisfied with the quality of workers at HP. People continue doing work the way ""it was done in the past"" and don't try to make things more efficient. For a finance team, the fact that none of the analysts knew how to use basic Excel functions like Vlookups, If/Then statements, etc was mind boggling to me. The company is big on working remotely which means not many people are in the office. Lastly, the pace of promotions to a manager position at this company is very slow with 3 different financial analyst levels & 2 sr. financial analysts levels"
bad,"Again, when a large company buys a smaller one their are always changes that effect the little guy."
bad,A typical day at HP consists managing competing deadlines for global IT projects' billing documentaion. I have learned about the many billing elements of Information Technology. My co-workers are hard working and make the work environment pleasurable. The hardest part of the job is keeping track of the changes in the client's organzational assets. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that this career path will open the door for other job opportunities in the IT field.
bad,Working at HP as a contractor on one of their projects and found little team work and cohesiveness among the HP staff and other contractors.
bad,No room for growth in the Westerville office
bad,Spent many years in Purchasing. Manufacturing is very high pressure and I was glad to finally get out of it.
bad,"Lots of good people and friends, too many years managing contracts - which is not related to market share or revenue and hard to quantify or gain much satisfaction from."
bad,working as a Financial Associate in Hewlett Packard India Pvt.Ltd. Generate revenue for HP.
bad,I learned a lot about manufacturing. I worked in all areas of manufacturing and quality. The LVO Audit was the last area that I worked in. LVO is the  final inspection before the product goes out the door.
bad,They layoff too much. the pay is not great.  They offer a lot of onetime. they cut a lot of their benefits.  they offer a lot of courses
bad,"> least scope of professional development in ITO."
bad,"From the day one I was into pricing projects, helps me to learn about the transition of project, how to interact with customers, help to understand the customer requirements and get back or solve the critical scenarios in time."
bad,Management is constantly changing things. A lot of overhead work in everything you do. 
bad,"Large organization requiring hard work to accomplish goals. It was the feeling during my tenuar that management was losing touch with the staff. Senior management addressed issues, but little improvements were achieved."
bad,"I was recruited to work as a chemical technician at HP in Corvallis this spring, and then I was laid off three days after I started because a big ink order was canceled. I was not given any notice at all, and the manager did not tell anyone on the team I was working with. This happened even considering that they had me leave my job in Portland, and move down to Corvallis for them. "
bad,Easy going - relaxed work environment. Lack of work discipline. Could use more controls and more senior management and organizational structure. Good pay.
bad,"Best place to work for women employees."
bad,"You get in, sign in to your computer and all your programs and sit and wait for a call. The CSR's who only speak English get a higher volume of calls than the bilingual employees, but they get a higher wage. The calls themselves don't vary greatly, mostly redemption calls (people taking money out of their accounts), address changes, and sometimes odd things like the passing of a bond owner or transferal of money from one account to another. The calls are short, they are only inbound and you are not pressed to reach any certain number, which is good. There is a lot of time for reading or talking with co-workers between calls. The co-workers are all nice and easy to get along with and the management is the same. The hardest part of the job would be the days when you don't get a respite from all the calls but they are few and far between and not all that bad anyway. The most enjoyable part would be the downtime between calls."
bad,Not a fulfilling job because there is not much room for creativity and there is no sense of ownership of what you're working on since you are so far detached from the actual end product.
bad,"Lo q tenia este trabajo es q era un bar y tenia una sala de juegos entonces habia dias que se cimplicaba,porque llegaba y se encontraba gente de mal humos porque perdian,entonces uno tenia q aguantarse y ser simpatico.."
bad,"work is hectic, and more"
bad,"Over the history of HP (Hewlett Packard),  it has been a it has been a top company and the envy of many to work there."
bad,"HP has become a nightmare of a result due to numerous acquisitions without the proper integration of back office processes and resources. I've never worked for a company with so much red tape and processes. New hire training was laughable at best with 14 days of 7 hour virtual class work training and team conference calls. I walked away due to the daily frustrations and qrtly changes of my account sets. As a territory rep, my account set of 20 changed a total of 4 times in 18 months! You can't conduct business this way."
bad,Hp is very good company.i learnt many thing in process regarding process.i will suggest people to join HP because you will learn manything after joining hp.
bad,HP Inc. is the best company to work for during inital career of an individual. I worked on the UAM project that is used to onboard assets onto the HP Inc. Platform.
bad,"I was the owner for this small company. It was a great experience, however, the pay was low and the energy invested was a lot."
bad,HP is really an awesome company to work with.But salary hikes are not that much good.
bad,"Good place to work and important is employee engagement is very good, but cannot expect more salary in Finance and Accounts field"
good,"In order to get hired on as a full time employee you'd have to related to a person working within the company, they hardly ever seemed to hire someone from outside the family connection there."
good,"Overall good place to work"
good,"Providing support to HP consumers on printers. Troubleshooting complex issues related to the software, hardware and Networking related issues while setting up the printer or any functionality issues with the unit with high level of consumer satisfaction. Escalating the cases to the higher level regarding the customer’s issues and queries."
good,I found it too overloaded and non co-operative atmosphare.
good,"It's an O.K., place to work. It's a little out of control, when it come's to employee need's and benefit's, but it's o.k!"
good,"Basically, the contractors lie to you saying that you'll be a technician, but in reality, you're just an operator on broken machines."
good,Very unorganized.  I was in the first training group for the department that I worked in.  Micro-managed daily. Wouldn't recommend applying for this--.
good,High hours per week; I averaged over 80 hrs per week for 5 years. Considerable time spent off-shoring resources from US to India and other low cost centers .
good,Work culture is not good. All Managers are depending on TL's. They take feed back from them only. If they give negative they believe on them trust them innocent will become scapegoat.
good,"After Receiving instructions from Supervisor to which line/section your working for the day, you follow the orders of the operator throughout the day."
good,"No way to grow, enforced pay cuts, layoffs by the thousands have been going on for 5+ years.  More layoffs coming after the first of the year.  No one is safe unless you are the CEO or a direct report of the CEO."
good,"New management style at HP seems to be not letting the group to know who just joined and who left the team.   Also, they are no longer communicating down to the 1st line people anything related to the state of the business either good or bad."
good,Not a very happy place to work at. Low morale amoung the current employee's.
good,"fast pace work environment"
good,"Great Place and Great co-workers, Sadly, the old HP way of conducting work environment is gone."
good,Maintaing Customers Tier 1 Infrastructure with hardware and firmware updates on a regular basis.
good,I was able to advance my work experince and build more knowledge.
good,"Includes but not limited to administrating: Microsoft Active Directory, SAP ECC-PRD (System Analysis and Program Development), Command, APEX, Kronos, Lotus Notes, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator, Windows 7/Vista/XP, Remedy."
good,"A software developer should not be used as an SCM Admin just to earn a contract."
good,"It used to feel like family, now its all numbers and metrics driven. They have forgotten that humans work there and managers care only for their bonuses and not others welfare. You are putting out fires most of the time and the customers are not the priority any longer."
good,"I'm afraid my experience of HP was that it got worse as time went on...swingeing cuts, little support, weren't able to travel to meet clients, continual pressure to reduce overheads whilst delivering more...not a good place"
good,joined as a fresher but was taken on contract . lost benefits as a full time employee and hence future jobs got impacted. otherwise was a good place to work
good,"Executive council actively working to reduce overhead (read salaries).   Moving jobs off-source as much as possible, braining in foreign (Indian, Latin America) workers on temporary work visas, and WFR of older workers (high salary, high medication costs)"
good,"They were grandiose in speaking and talking about themselves, yet the contractors and tenants did not see the same value. Many large mistakes made yet the one at the bottom of the ladder was the one to catch it."
good,"Offshoring of employees results in few jobs available for US based employees."
good,Worked several hours of over time without being paid. Long hours including weekends and nights. Management was always passing projects that they should supervise to employees and wondering why they werent done. when projects were just given on the day of completion. There was no job security nor advancement even when employees went far and beyond to get the job done within time constraints. Worked for the company for over two years and never advanced when all of my employee reviews were above average. The Job culture here is to make sure the customer is happy but Not the employee.
good,"Work/life balance is not great. There is no balance here. Co-workers are great, any issues that need attention, co-workers are always ready to help. What I learned has been time management, more proficient in resolving issues that a user has."
good,the first 5 years working there were good and the relationship with most of the people was great but the new administration in that facility should be selling shoes.
good,"HP has its cons just as any other place of work, but management at HP in the Supply chain area are unfair. They have their picks and if you make that list then your good. Going above and beyond is not enough alone."
good,The good thing about HP is that even DCO's have enough rights on   Network Devices. But salary is the issue. They don't provide good salary to fresher as well as to experience holder.
good,"Hewlett Packard is an extremely large organization that focuses on all aspects of IT. "
good,"working for three years in HP (Contract employee) and still feel unsecure, No job security"
good,"Horrible experience, every leader and their own policy and you were required to do what they say regardless of company requirements. wasted 10 years of my life and terrible compensation. Advancement was all about your friend status or other things I care not to mention. Over all actual job was interesting working with mobile technology, PC hardware and Software. However I just happened to be very passionate about technology, new products, and creating solutions using technology in creative ways. "
good,"HP was a great place to work and fun with all the events. Management was all politics, without the opportunity of moving up with your actual job performance. I was told my management several times my job was secure. One week after my manager told me this being the top performer I was laid off during the major lay off accruing now."
good,"24/7 help desk support, without comprehensive training before being put to work, I had to learn the ticketing system from other co-workers which means cutting into there work time/calls. shift managers frustrated there employees with how to solve problems while knowing training has been provided to the fullest."
good,Advice to Senior Management – A very good company with great culture.
good,"excellent teem , the co- worker  was excellent nice place to learning have a lot of equipment to learn and practice multi task activity , HP have everything do tou need to parctice in the fiel of mechanic ,electricity engineer"
good,"Hired to fill in mgt gap for takeover and major lay offs. A lot of in-fighting with some team members and the two supervisor/leads."
good,"Not recommended. As the work life balance of the company is all work and will be replaced asap.  More for the advancement of the company and will reduce job position, relocate work to existing team members."
good,"high anxiety cutthroat work environment with everyone, including bosses, waiting to be told to clear out their desks and turn in their id badge. Difficult work environment for American workers because of language/culture gap with Indians"
good,"If you take a contractor position they will tell you there's a big chance you will become a full time employee but it will never happen. As a contractor you work as much as anyone else, but with no benefits and no growth opportunities."
good,"not a happy place.  most of the people I worked with are gone, either by their own volition, or laid off (like me).  I was able to work from home so that helped but maybe that contributed to my being let go."
good,They treat the Hispanic line workers poorly. They do not do a good job at securing line worker tenure. Too many temps with little option for job stability. Employ too many people at floor level that do not have proper paperwork to be hired. This  creates high turnover and makes for nearly impossible improvements on the floor. They can not keep floor supervision. They must work harder to retain good floor supervision.
good,"thank ful for great job /picnic areas a lot of great people to work with."
good,Management could be more organized.  My job was a contract so no job security.  It was not a fun place to work.  The hardest part was dealing with all the rules and regulations.
good,"Poor Management, no job security and favoritism. I did not like it they were not helpful. Poor training, management never available to answer questions"
good,tyipical day is just sitting around because there is absolutely nthing there to do because its so slow. lack of growth and management is absolutely terrible .
good,"Boa empresa, porém coordenadores e supervisores esquecem que seus subordinados existem."
good,There was no work life balance in this company.but there were good learning opportunity as you will be facing the customer directly and dealing with customer .Salary structure is very low as compared to market .
good,"Worked as phone support to schedule a time for the Wal-Mart store and the HP service tech to be on site to change out the main store server.  Needed to make sure the equipment arrived with all the parts in good condition and was available for the HP tech to install. Helped with packing, shipping and tracking of equipment. Enjoyed the physical part of the job the best. Assisted with Project Manager with getting project done in time as needed."
good,"Worked as a temp in their Sales dept in Boise, Idaho campus. Six weeks of training crammed into two weeks. And then on the sales floor you go, taking inbound calls and selling ink, computers and printers. Sounded like a great 90 day temp job and it pretty much was a good temp job."
good,"Everyday was busy which was great and no two days were the same making the position exciting. Use of various applications (SAP, concur, GetThere travel tool) however, no training provided. Co-workers a pleasure to work with."
good,"Os colegas de trabalho são pessoas maravilhosas."
good,We had an excellent team who worked well together and created a stress-free environment which was important when working to difficult timescales or when things were difficult with the company. I had a lot of friends there and have found that keeping in touch with them was one of the best aspects of leaving
good,"Being a contractor for the company I can only speak on it from the outside. pay and benefits I am not sure of how great or bad they are, but the HP team seems to be very professional and have vast experience in their respective fields"
good,very unorganized.  Management is not aware of 90% of what is going on and they don't seem to care.  Would not work at this location again.  very upsetting because I enjoyed the position
good,"Unless you are part of the ""core"" group of hp people, unless you know someone, you will not be hired or advance at hp. Good products and employees are very loyal, until they are let go."
good,Allways looking for the next layoff.  Management is general are no different from employees.  Co-workers are great.  Job is not hard but the most enjoyable part of the job is gettingt off at the end of the day.
good,"Worked on the MST group for a few months after getting promoted from PLO level 1 service desk agent. as with anything at HP its a nightmare and the managers are terrible. what you have to do there is not in the job descriptions. a typical day was coming into the desk, i only had 1 co worker we were a 2 person team, she never did anything no matter how many times you told her how many tickets were in the queue. management didn't care ever and half the time you could turn around to see him on indeed.com looking at jobs I'm self. HP is a sinking ship and i strongly encourage you to avoid working here until our CEO sells the company."
good,"Does lay-offs all the time, so you will have to worry about your job. Management never communicated unless it was necessary. Salary was great."
good,"Unless you network at VP level. Otherwise, be prepared to get stuck with on position for 5-9 years with about 0-3% hike."
good,"I feel HP has not moved along with the times in giving people training opportunities.   It is important that when people advance to management positions, they need management training.   "
good,"The hardest part of the job is balancing a Job Work/ Life Balance. A typical day would consist of ~6 conference calls between Business Unit Leaders, Country Leaders, Learning and Development Leaders, and Event Company counterparts. The purpose is to ensure we all stay consistent and deliver a unified training and communication of upcoming products and selling skills."
good,The work force tended to be a lot of young college graduates so the day was lively.
good,"I have spent my last years across Europe trying always to minimize expenses and maximize the results. I have worked without any vacation for months and then as a result HP as decided to reduce people without looking to their performance but just to the cost. I don't recommend to work for HP if you want to be treated like a human. For sure you have the opportunity to make good money, but every 6 months HP reduces people."
good,Siempre he trabajado dando servicio al cliente. Mi relacción y el desarrollo de mi trabajo excepcional.
good,"-Management is flexible with working hours."
good,Its a job that pays the bills. There is no room for career growth if you are expecting it.
good,"Just Friendly Environment, Good Platform to learn and gain knowledge"
good,"clock in ,an then get to our assigned assembly line.after everyone got there i would stand there and put product in a box an pass it down to there next etc."
good,"Gostei de trabalhar na HP, contudo apesar de ser uma multinacional a filial de Porto Alegre não tem autonomia. Os funcionários são meros prestadores de serviço para a HP nos Estados Unidos, visto que aqui praticamente não há desenvolvimento tecnológico e os salários são mais baixos. "
good,"very creative, good team work, fun, very little pressure...each day is fun day and the opportunity to meet someone famous"
good,"Leadership can sometimes drop the ball, usually leads to missing/incomplete requirements."
good,Many levels of technical engineers.
good,I was contracted to work for HP for a few months. While working there I was not impressed by management. It was a cast system and was told there was no way of moving up. The hardest part of the job was the minimal training.
good,Contingent Tier 2 Help Desk Analyst for Eli Lilly Sales Support via Hewlett Packard while other Help Desk Analyst were attending national conferences
good,I like it but alot of things are not done fair when it comes to hiring directly to the company. They are very pety with the point system that they put in place to cause people to get fire.
good,"Good product are created, but overall strategy is too short sighted and numbers oriented."
good,"Senior management were totally out of sync with not only staff but customers  the strategy of consistent workforce reductions with zero salary increases resulted in a totally demoralised workforce"
good,HP really didn't really care about the call center agents. I stayed because I liked the contract companies I worked for. Raises/bonuses were non existent.
good,Would not recommend HP for career growth. It is and has been in a constant downsizing mode for a number of years. Downsizing is their approach to achieving profitability even at the expense of customer satisfaction.
good,HP is becoming a training ground for new workers and is not structing itself for long term employment.  Good place to get experience and move on.  For experience workers plan on training the younger crowd being treated like your outdated and then when the new workers leave training the next batch.  Not stable for the long term.
good,Ridiculously women were not appreciated or respected by the Sales center leadership.  If you dont party and drink with other management you are viewed as not a team player.  I tried to speak with HR about it and then quickly I was terminated.
good,Was hired as an account escalation manager to handle roughly 11 accounts per day but was misinformed and found out the job was no more than an inbound call center for escalated customers.  Non stop abuse.
good,"It's a flexible working place.  they allow you to do you job without being micro manage.  However, the owners is something else.   Once you get to know the gentleman you'll find out that he is a joy to work for.  however, the lady is a fire ball and doesn't hold her tongue for nothing.  she has money and she know money talk and bs walks - truly."
good,"as an employee you are simply a number on a page, the culture driven by this company is one of use to exhaustion then abandon. There is no training (other than internal online non certified) or investment in career even for resources with proven ability and continued success. Investment in people is certainly not a goal in this company"
good,Rehire the employees that were laid off and offer them theit jobs back . I dont really want to put more about this company in this review . So I’d like to stop writing
good,"While at HP I was given the tools and tech to be successful designing and implementing Enterprise HP products (BSM, uCMDB, RUM, OMi, SiteScope, Diagnostics, etc). After Microfocus acquired these divisions, I was unable to get the support necessary to be successful in the Professional Service Orginization."
good,"Gran Empresa dónde su continuo cambio hace que tu aprendizaje sea muy amplio."
good,"After EDS acquisition, the culture of tolerance for diversity, innovative ideas and delivery of best customer experience has been replaced by management ruthlessness, extreme focus on making profit"
good,"Coming from the founding culture of Silicon Valley HP has morphed so much over the past decades and struggles to find its place. It has gone from being a a place with a strong, achievement and people oriented culture to an also-ran in the computer hardware market"
good,"It was a fun working place, learned different types of job and working with other departments. Had great time working with my colleagues. There are times when our company will organised event for us and our family."
good,"The overall job itself is very easy. The workload can be a bit much with all of the phone calls, emails, and daily reports, but if pay was better, this job would be ideal."
good,Too many workloads owned by one owner. Unreasonable schedules asked by management sometimes. Some teams' members are scheming against other teams' members. I only see all the above happened in some departments in Taiwan branch.
good,"Empresa com ótima estrutura para trabalhar, espaço para eventos e áreas de lazer."
good,the employees at HP (now DXC) are great.  The constant cost reduction measures required (workforce reductions) make this a tough company to work for long term.  If they could get back to delivering services of value it would be a great place to work.
good,Was an ok place to work. Was promoted to remote worker I enjoyed working from home much more comfortable and quite. We earned free products on a regular basis.
good,Company to big and they did not care about employees.  Would lay off in a heart beat.  No job security.  
good,Difficult to navigate as a new person. The HR system is very cumbersome and onboarding is a huge challenge. The employees are very very nice but in my experience the management is difficult to deal with.
good,"An open door policy -(announced) but not really enforced--Management did not keep up with up- to -date working equipment.  The sad spirit of Employees not trusting Team Leaders, Supervisors. Otherwise the job was workable."
good,Started as a big company buying other companies.  No specific goals or direction.  Now it is down sizing by spinning out certain areas.  Most work is being done in other countries.
good,"May have been the team I was in, but no one worked more than 5-6 hours a day.  This is great if you're content with not advancing or learning anything, but it wasn't for me. I want to know that I'm earning my salary, and helping the company grow and be successful."
good,"since the merge with CSC, HPE has been in decline. more redundancies and a lack of vision or direction. "
good,Not working in normal HP environment.  Working for Enterprise division in client's space.California Dept. of Correction and Rehabilitation.  Disorganized implementation of software.  Very poor treatment of support team.   Job title/function changed 3 times in 5 Yrs.  This occurred without any employee notification or input.
good,"great benefits"
good,"Company has the potential to advance the industry, however much of the direction is stuck in the old slow ways of doing business. Information is slow to travel from top level down."
good,it was difficult to get a team environment as only 1% of our team was in the same location.    Management was always monitoring if you were online or not Always felt that I never worked enough even though my average day was at a minimum of 12 hours a day.
good,"good company with proper standard of process, teamwork across all teams, good colleagues. however, welfare were reduced and retrenchment happened out of the sudden"
good,"Salary increment not as per industry standards"
good,12 hours shift. More off days. learn to be independent and work as a team. Meet a lot of good human beings. Most enjoyable time was travelling for business trips.
good,"Maintained a job as a barista in which I make drinks, maintain the establishment, provide good customer service all in a fast paced environment."
good,HP is a decent work place to work with great work life balance.  The pay is reasonable.  But the culture within HP is not that great.
good,HP is going through a company split. They are now Hewlett Packard Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. There are a lot of changes being made in the company.
good,The R&D crossfunctional team across the globe are great.  Very professional and thorough.  Management is struggling to find their way.
good,"I have worked way too many years ago at HP to provide a qualified review, but by experience has helped me gain the jobs I have had since, which is a good thing."
good,"They are a good company, but the pay and the travel required to be an acct executive is poor. But management is fair and they are understanding."
good,learn something every day we were learning more and more about this for ever growing world of computers. I find it very exciting that I've had this change to grow with confidence and more on the job experience

good,It is difficult to grow as there is not much opportunity to learn and grow within the organisation. It is good for freshers.
good,"It is unfortunate that HP bought EDS, morphed it to focus on HP Product integration vice best-of-breed.  It is now splitting to HPE, and seems to be morphing back to an original EDS model."
good,one of the good companies to work with in India. Great experience overall with good employee culture and cross functional growth opportunities
good,"Local management is very poor here in Montgomery, AL. because they cannot and will not retain their most valuable agents."
good,"You may have work when coming in that day or may not. When there is work your very busy, Some good people to work with. The job can be hard to do because of the way tests have been written when trying to interpreting them. Poorly written. Its nice to be able to have a company that is flexible where needed."
good,"I really liked my job and what I did, but over time it  slowly become more rigid and rote with much time spent on procedures and administrative. "
good,"All stateside jobs are being exported to off-shore cheap labor. Management only cares about the bottom line. There is no Customer Retention effort, SLA breeches daily."
good,HP is in distress.  They are laying people off right and left in preparation for the company split.  Not many people are feeling confident about the position they currently hold.
good,"One extreme comes from the old legendary HP of highly skilled and technical employees who value quality over speed to market.  However, a sense of arrogance comes from this and sometimes the technical team loses sight on what customer wants ""feature set"".  Instead, we tell them this is what they want."
good,"Not a very good employer, does not offer good incentives and makes illogical and rash decisions on the contract that I help fulfill"
good,"My comments are relevant for the year 2007 "
good,I worked for HP as a Proxy Engineer in support of the Bank of America network. The position required me to be up and on call 24x7 and to oversee ALL proxy implementations and project calls. I also was on call to troubleshoot any proxy issues.
good,"Work life balance is good, but if things dont work out in the team or deal, be prepared to get beaten up"
good,"HP is a good place to grow your skills, and to network yourself.  Those are the two, of the three (pay), main advantages to working at HP."
good,Poorly defined objectives.  Bad attitude.  No development tools.
good,"HP was a wonderful company who did not follow the pack, had great ingenuity and genius is R&D, then along came Carly Fiorina and the Compaq merger."
good,"Internal and external building patrols. Controlling access to and egress from high security corporate site including delivery personnel, visitors and their accompanying vehicles. Control of CCTV for both static and PTZ cameras. Reception duties, all elements of physical and electronic access control including baggage searches to confirm security guidelines initiated or for denying access of unauthorised items."
good,Sadly times have changed and so to has the management style at HP
good,"A good company with extensive resources; very bright and creative people; many divisions with overlapping business goals that sometimes conflict with each other. A very large company which makes it difficult sometimes to stay aware of developments, products, and offerings in different divisions."
good,HP is a very challenging job I learned quite a bit while there a typical day is going in taking a roll call making sure associates have what they need to get started. hardest part of the job is dealing with different attitudes especially those of upper management they were not very helpful in a lot of areas where there were issues to be resolved you had to basically find out information on your own they were always too busy I should say some of the manager. I enjoyed the job because it made you be more responsible it made you more focused and more self motivated you cant wait on others to handle your job you had to jump in there and go for what you know.
good,"This was not very well managed when i left, can not comment now."
good,"Management does a poor job of providing advancement for their employees. While the work life balance is great, the pay and the lack of management has employees always seeking elsewhere."
good,"HP is not a great company to work for.  There is no room for advancement, limited salary increases, and the culture is no very friendly."
good,"The employees at HP make it worth going to work everyday. The work itself is incredibly rewarding. The senior leadership is in a constant state of chaos with no sustained vision. This causes excessive amounts of distraction and stress that is not necessary or conducive to supporting customers. The customer relationships are truly partnerships, that is not just sales spin."
good,"HP is a big company, but with big company you get corporate issue.  It is very hard to move/advance in the company."
good,"Hewlett-Packard is not the great company it used to be.  That sounds cliche, but they used to promote employees and encourage employee development.  Technical products dwindled to nothing as most engineers became task masters managing overseas vendors and always on the phone. They have done nothing but freeze wages, cut benefits, and restructure for the last ten years.  The HP way is dead."
good,I have learned many things as part of my Job profile and Management.
good,"Asignacion de presupuestos y progamacion de campañas de marketing para el mercado institucional de EEUU y Canadá."
good,"Enjoyable part - meeting new people"
good,"Company environment was unstable as technology research seemed to evolve quickly during the 1980 and 1990 decades. And what began as a family atmosphere focusing on customers and personal attention ended in a focus on money and impersonal calls to 800 number call centers. The hardest part of the job was the internal politics. The enjoyable part was the internal training and having fun with the technology changes, i.e. going from type writers to personal computers and printers to accomplish the tasks of document handling and all the software changes too. I matured in learning great work ethics; how to serve customers; and am grateful that what hurt me the most is what makes me so strong now."
good,"Good place to work overall, learning new products is free you just have to find time to take the online classes. for the most part every day is over 8hrs and at least two weekends a month you will be working."
good,HP is een bedrijf wat sterk in verandering is. Sterke en strakke aansturing van (ook senior) medewerkers. Veel nadruk op verkopen van hardware met een dunne schil van diensten.
good,"Verified HP computer standards and uploaded OS , software and installed hardware."
good,Very good place for work/life balance. Being able to work remotely definitively a plus
good,"I felt that Hp set their standards high thats why their always hiring new people. They set these rules and go by points, Its just wrong."
good,"I worked at HP for 2 years and was a contractor the entire time. Only until the end did the company try to make me a hired in employee but this did not happen. I was laid off. I worked one the Service desks. I did receive a lot of experience with IE, MS office and outlook, network connectivity issues, software license issues, VPN issues and software installation. But there was no advancement and I did feel all the appreciated. Plus there was not the best relationship with with management as they did not seem to interact all that much with employees. I did have a good relationship with all my fellow employees. The pay could have been better and after 2 years received no benefits."
good,Answering Inbound Calls and solving printer problems the hardest part of the job was when I had to stay on a call for 3 hrs or more
good,"I asked one thing at my interview and that was ""Is there room for advancement?"" The interviewer told me ""yes"". I found that to be untrue. In 2 years I saw 1 person advance and she was living with another supervisor."
good,I was not impressed with HP lately as they had lots of good people to go due to their cost cutting affected loosing their good talent and assets to HP working from long time.. Company changed in their culture and management affecting badly
good,"I worked with a great group of people, all remote, that made my job enjoyable. The company was in a period of major transition, which made long term employment less of an option, even though I was promised a full time position."
good,"HP has gone through many dramatic culture changes in the past decades. Pick your group wisely. Remember that you work for the manager, not for the company."
good,"I love the people I worked with but I didn't like management painting bullseyes at the back of my head even though I worked hard didn't cause any trouble. When ""WFR"" is a daily occurrence it's very debilitating."
good,"I think I talked to my manager maybe 5 times in my year there. Walking through the offices made you realize how small and insignificant you are. They also treat you this way. Worked there for a year as ana assistant to my manager and was then moved to lead a team. They called it a horizontal move and I was not offered any additional benefits despite the vastly increased responsibility and skills required."
good,The team can be the best in the world but if Management and Leadership are lacking then that flows right through the organisation. HP is an Enterprise Company trying to create a Channel go to Market....that can be very tricky without a clear plan.
good,"It's very prestige company to work for.The atmosphere at work was great.As long as you could achieve your targets you were fine. If you didn't it was very stressful."
good,"Firma ma kłopoty ze strategią, wiec tną koszty tam, gdzie się tylko da."
good,"The job was OJT, and they expected us to know what the Tier One people knew which meant we had to wing it on many occasions. which failed the OK test about 70% of the time, so we got grilled as to why we made a command decision vs referring it to our managers, which oddly we were hired to take the workload off of, Hardly made sense to reload them, but"
good,"Have to use my own car to travel to location working on computers and printers.  Been a contractor for over 2 years with no benefits, no paid vacation or days off with pay.  Getting frustrated waiting for HP to switch me from contract."
good,I worked in the HP commercial desktop space providing support for large organizations around the clock. The role helped me map the entire hardware layout of HP workstations.
good,"I enjoyed working at HP, the culture is very welcoming and friendly.  however, the favoritism was very vivid and very noticeable. Training is made available to you right away.  But once hired it takes about one month to finish the onboarding to the company."
good,"you were just a number nothing more, I really have nothing good to say about HP because they took all the employees with many years knowledge and tossed them in the ditch"
good,Would log in an take calls for my work shift and assist the user with issues on their work pc or their cell phones. Lots of password resets and syncing email back up.
good,"If you fit into the right crowd,  25 or under, cute and a size 0... seems that they seem to only hire the under 30 cute crowd ant's going over the current employees for promotions"
good,"Coming to the work spot starting the PC and screening the requests shown in the queue. Requests are being given to each member by the supervisor. "
good,"1 - Contractors - although making up the vast majority of the work force in the office - are consistently treated differently, as ""less than"" and disposable. "
good,"Since the New CEO took over the company she split the company into two divisions  This took away some of the benefits that we had and after awhile she sold the division that we were working in.  Most employees were let go and had to find other work."
good,Opportunities to redirect or reinvent HP.  Ongoing process.  HP has found new ways to grow and some great new technology to keep people printing in the SMB and home office.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Toxic work environment. Your opinion or suggestions are not taking in consideration. No incentives, no bonus, no 401K, no vacations, no benefits, no GYM,etc."
good,"Oferta por addeco, a los tres meses nos echaron a todas las que habían contratado. Poco formal y serio."
good,Bedrijfscultuur sterk gericht op maximaliseren van de shareholder value.
good,HP IT services is a difficult industry and it seems the leadership of HP didn't know how to navigate it very well.  This resulted in a lot of cost cutting measure which killed growth potential.   I would not recommend working for HP unless you can influence senior management to make good decisions.
good,El trabajo es sencillo pero tedioso cuando se trata de atender quejas.
good,Working at HP requires that you work independently without supervisor or manager by your side. They expect you to do your job without any help. You should be able to read and follow special instructions to perform your job.
good,Typisch Amerikaanse organisatie cultuur waarbij stakeholder satisfaction  primair staat.
good,Worked for HP for a long time and it's changed over the years  - it's just like any other company unfortunately.  They're focused on hiring millennials and getting the older workers out.
good,"Worked with great team and colleagues during a very tough time for company.  The consolidation of businesses under several CEOs was challenging.   Vision,  mission and pure focus on customer was a challenge back then."
good,"hp was a great place for innovation, but the shift in culture and leadership took it away from innovation, and that's why it's struggling for a decade."
good,"Consultor de Vendas na área de Informática (Notebooks e Desktops) Na Fnac, Barra Shopping."
good,My time with HP was one of ups and downs due to the environment of the company and the department. I wish to only thank the people that I worked with for allowing me to grow as a person and as a professional. The lessons that I were able to learn have helped me become a better professional.
good,"Company needs to invest in their Human Resources and stop laying off experienced people.  Need to spend $$ in IT to support their Supply Chain systems.  Too many gaps and holes that require experienced people to patch.  When those people are laid off, issues ensue."
good,"Working in my current position has afforded me the opportunity to realize that compensation and greed from a multi billion dollar company has been overcome with an improper state of mind while trying to keep those that have been dedicated individuals, get little to no pay increases over their entire time at the company."
good,"It was close to home for me so the travel to and from HP was great.  The area where I worked was mainly men, so it was competitive in this area. I worked in giving network support."
good,"I went around to several retail locations being an HP demo guy. The pay was good for a Student, but part timers get shafted in terms of lame 1 hour shifts at several locations throughout the day. I tried to contact my boss and she never responded to my emails. It was frustrating. It was like I didn't really even have a boss which is both good and bad."
good,"les manager occupent une position très enviée"
good,"Performing multiple levels of work with minimal employees. Underappreciated employees and minimum level of recognition."
good,HP acquired the company that I worked for and we transitioned into their work culture over time.  In the beginning we took pay cuts to keep your jobs.  Its a continue revolving door with layoffs occurring on a regular basis globally to meet business financial objectives and keep the share holders profitable.
good,Developing and building new web store was exciting educational and demanding. We used an agile methodology with up to 30 developers in several location and it introduced new programming tools and concepts.  It was a very positive experience until company split and application was outsourced.
good,"stressful place to work at, I learned a lot about the HP equipment hardware and how it's been designed, I thought it was pretty fascinating, the hardest part of the job we had a manager every 2 months and every manager brings a  new rules, so we had to change the work rules every 2 to 3 months"
good,HPI outsourced the entire shop to Mexico. HPI management is more concerned about moving up the ladder then developing their work-centers. A huge amount of politics at HPI.
good,"Due to the confidentiality clause in my severance package, I am unable to comment on the company in any way. I thoroughly enjoyed my 18 years of service."
good,Positions were often moved to employee in El Paso where employee could be paid less.  I was left to find a project to work on on my own without manager support.
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar, embora o departamento ao qual pertencia não tinha contato direto com a empresa pois o serviço era tercerizado para outra empresa."
good,"My time with HP was characterized by leadership turnover and poorly thought out, expensive acquisitions which heralded the downfall of HPQ.  I did learn a large amount of Big Data skills."
good,"Assist students apply for their federal financial aid. Helped them through the process of the application, let the know if they need anything else and explain hot to correct it. It was a very fast paced environment and I like it when I was able to assist students/parents not only through phone calls but also through chats and emails."
good,"Good, good with respect to work environment, mostly re organization happens which creates a need to revamp your team structure, number of meetings should be minimised"
good,I packed boxes and moved boxes. I learned to label and ship boxes from the company to people. The hours were very long and tiring. You receive extra hours. You work from day to night.
good,"Não possui um plano de carreira que funciona, baixa valorização e reconhecimentos dos funcionarios. Instabilidade, fraca gerência."
good,"Lots of great, capable people, high burnout rate for managers. Organization structure left many gaps in responsibilities that ended up being filled in on evenings and weekends"
good,"HP is no longer the company it used to be. The new direction and vision has resulted in a loss of job security, enthusiasm, and loyalty. I wish things wouldve been better."
good,"Demanding yet rewarding place to work.  Employees are engaged and want to make a difference.  Given the right incentive, opportunities, recognition & rewards will only improve the ability of the teams to deliver."
good,"This job has a large amount of responsibility. Cold Calling, Meeting with Old and New Customers/Partners. The team I am on is phenomenal and I enjoy learning from some of our leadership."
good,I enjoyed my years there for most of my career.  The new directions the company has chosen is why thousand of us no longer work there in the USA
good,Good place to work in. Work culture is good and have the values of trust and respect. I learnt a lot of things including professionalism and team work
good,You will get lot of opportunity to learn and develop yourself. But too much of workload and poor production planning. It's not a right place for long run.
good,"I was there at the worst of times so it could only get better. However, when I was recruited they told me that there was no stock the first year, that you were in a calibration year and then they would determine how much you would get. I will not fall for that again."
good,Very fast paced work environment and always hectic.  Management in my opinion needs some sensitivity training to be an effective leader.
good,The culture of HP's management has changed over the last several years. There are a lot of fun opportunities happening but the opportunities are restricted to only certain locations.
good,"Pros: People, access to cutting-edge technologies "
good,"Como jefe de turno cada día era único. Diferentes tareas con el calendario y distribución de trabajo."
good,"I have been working in HPE for almost 6 years now and the only reason why I am staying is because of my colleagues as we work well together as a team."
good,"When it was EDS, it used to be a better company to work for. Not any more, with bigger HP's manufacturing mentality, it has become a mess."
good,Working environment not good.management process is not well.leave management not well.Low salary.wok over load.not hike in salary.
good,It was really very difficult at the very begining of the journey as i was just out from my college days. But was really very challenging to learn many accounting operations with a expereinced Chartered accountant.
good,I started working for HP 8 years and 10months ago and it was a dream come true. Employee's were actually treated like human beings rather than just a dollar sign. I wouldn't begin to bad mouth HP but also wouldn't recommend working / consulting for them either.
good,Major restructuring/reorg makes being stable difficult for employees. Typical work date is work overload. Individual employees doing the work of several employees. Co-workers are not as ethical and committed. Most enjoyable part of the day is lunch! :-)
good,"It's an okay job. You have to provide your on car to work. No gas cards, no compensation for the wear and tear on your car. There is no room for advancement in the company coming from my job."
good,"Though, I did not spend much time in this organization, but learnt a lot in a short span of time. I worked closely with Accounting Team regarding booking of invoices against purchase orders and ensured on time payment to vendors. I used to ensure timely approval of HP Purchase Orders from procurement system called Smart buy."
good,I have worked for HP for many years. HP changed greatly. HP has split into two companies. I have enjoyed working for this company.
good,"I have worked as a Provider Enrollment Specialist for HP Enterprise Services where I was given the opportunity to work as a Provider Correspondence Processor with the confidence of gaining the experience and knowledge of service on health care and Medicaid. Every day, by helping others understand and obtain knowledge through my ability to counsel brings me great joy and satisfaction. It has been a great experience to be a part of the HP Provider Enrollment team. It has allowed me to look forward on elevating my experience with health care and build team support within the business and medical field."
good,"Positiva, buen clima laboral, trabajo bajo presión, team leader accesible."
good,"Hectic work"
good,Can't say much regarding HP when they WFR over 500 employees and months later hire 200 more.  Very pro management structure and absolutely on the job training for their task at hand. You job can become a career but you'll experience or suffer through a series of ups and downs of emotional job security.  Wouldn't work here again!
good,"Management decision about salary hike was false promise, They had promised some percentage but at the end they told in smart way that it will apply by end of this year."
good,Job was not much challenging. Work-life balance is good. But lot of politics by management. Made some real good friends. Cultural programs held were good.
good,Good benefits.The best part of the organization is the people. Cooperative and committed co-workers make coming to work easy. Strong individual contributors make the world go around.
good,"As my management is so fond of saying: HP is a great 1st job and 3rd job.  As my first job back into the field of IT, this company was great in getting me back up to speed with certain technologies. The ability to move forward with this company, though, is impossible.  They do not offer competitive pay or fulfilling promotion opportunities at my level.  The job I am currently performing feels like a dead end job."
good,Typical day at work is receiving user call on technical issue the arises throughout the day. This company help you build on the knowledge you learned at school.
good,big company but bad place to work if you are a contractor you are treated like second -class citizen.the regular get all the first class .
good,"This position was in a shambles upon my starting work in Dec. 2012."
good,It was a great company to work for however HP is undergoing significant change.  My hunch is that layoffs will continue until the company completes its split into two new entities.
good,This company is like most other large companies in the US.  They are looking to off-shore a lot of the jobs to cut costs. There is no longer a loyalty to the hard working employees.
good,"Good place to work, but constant lay offs always going on. A lot of great people to work with."
good,"Really fun people to work with, poor management. Agents really had each other's backs when working with scheduling, training was fun, very educational. Extremely poor management."
good,"I believe in team building, helping out each other. I also try to get along with others. I also enjoy having some fun at work, as long as the work gets done. I have learned a lot at my current job, that I believe will help me in future employement."
good,"HP is a awesome company ,But i was through contract basis ,so i just wanna come out of contract"
good,Co-workers are the best part of the job.  Very talented folks.
good,"A typical day at work for me was loading computer equipment for shipment,I also developed good customer services skills because I worked with varies amount of peolple,the hardest part of the job was working the gravyard shift,the most enjoyable part was my co  workers"
good,"HP is facing an existential crisis: Do you focus on improving your stock price by offshoring resources, restructuring sales compensation plans in ways that don't fairly pay employees, and send mixed messages to customers by changing the responsibilities of customer facing personnel every 6 months; or do you innovate and lead the IT industry in a new direction? HP has chosen the former."
good,"The following is a reflection on the last seven years of HP only. Prior to that the environment was best in class!"
good,HP Advanced Solutions is likely the best and largest IT employer on Vancouver Island.
good,Busy lots to do. Both hardware and software support. Setting up new printer and configure printer setting remotely.
good,"I liked the people and the work, unfortunately can't agree with the management. Perhaps it's just the way the Bank of America contract was managed and I'm sure some of the problems were actually because the customer was BoA. In general, great people to work with."
good,"De las empresas donde he estado trabajando, debo indicar que las que se podía conciliar vida laboral y familiar es Winterthur Seguros. "
good,"Company losing money and had employee pay cuts"
good,"Good working conditions, good pay and benefits.  Constantly surveying employees to hear their complaints.  Same as most very large companies.  Management is very reactive but not many will make decisions.  Should have sold off the hardware divisions long ago (like Lenovo) and focus on professional services.  Not many happy employees but they are afraid to speak up.  High turnover of skilled people. Shifting as much work as possible offshore to reduce costs. HR is almost invisible."
good,"A contract company that tends to be leaned to those who have been with the company for awhile. As a fellow coworker, I learned that you tend to be let go if you are not what they expect or try to become more knowledgeable in the field."
good,"Great company when I started.  Dedicated employees.  Innovative.  Everything you see in Google and Apple."
good,"A typical day can consist of being very busy or very dull depending upon the day of the month or how active the sales rep may be. "
good,"long hours commitment to support >$1M in monthly billings"
good,"The tipical day was cop with the daily tasks of 50 calls and a booked first meeting per day. I had always to find, new possible area of business new prospect and chase them via phone or email."
good,"Floor technicians primarily job shop contractors, with the contract company as direct employer there was no ability to seek advise or assistance for regular full time HP staff."
good,"In the sector I was employed, HP provided services to the Government to included design, deployment and management of PMO, Infrastructure, Operations, Security and 24/7 support."
good,Like any other job. It was a common normal maintence work wit a lot of stress and duties just for one man.
good,It was an interesting experience.  The workload was moderate and the work pace was very demanding.
good,"Le aziende multinazionali sono contesti operativi definiti oggi ""modernamente complessi"". Lavorare in questi contesti è molto faticoso e difficile, perché ovviamente sono molto burocratizzati, pieni di norme e regole, dove purtroppo la libera iniziativa, intraprendenza o la troppo proattività possono essere un duro scotto da pagare, in termini di tempo ed energie, con risultati non sempre garantiti. Già sai che dovrai convincere qualcuno di qualcosa di cui non conoscerà nulla, che non sarà in grado di supportarti e capirti e tantomeno di prendersi la responsabilità di qualche decisione e/o azione; insomma se nella guida aziendale non c'è scritto e/o codificato nulla delle tue azioni e del tuo operato, diventa impresa difficile realizzarlo."
good,"A typical day at work - Arrive at work, read email and discuss issues for the day. Receive several calls from general labor personnel asking for assistance and assisting them. Read some more email about management asking for technical assistance and sleesly trying to cover up their mistakes by pretending its an engineering issue. Debate with them in person and over email eventually resulting in unnecessary escalation to managers with everyone in a bad mood."
good,"Hard working and dedicated workforce.  Process paralysis and lack of a coherent strategy in the middle to upper management ranks make the daily work challenging.  Constant churn in the management ranks creates shifting allegiances and turf wars.  If the company can overcome this basic dysfunction, the rank and file work force will make it great once again."
good,"I hated the small R&D wireless group which only has a few people but most of them were not friendly and insecure about their jobs, so they were not willing to help out new employees. Also they projected hostile and prejudicial towards non-native English speaking employees. And the worst of all were incompetent direct supervisor and manager who were too busy with useless meetings and company politics. Hell with that group!"
good,"This company is okay, but has no potential for career aspects."
good,The people that I work with are great. Management NOT so great. There is no room for growth or advancement unless you are friends with management.
good,"The company had lot to learn like complete flow of hospital as the project was of greenfield. The process flow and other aspect like documentation, hardest part of the project was the unplanned documenting to be completed in short span of time like live donation, eye bank, histopathology . Enjoyable part so convince process owner with our designed process flow and sign off satisfaction that you did achieve."
good,"Close to home"
good,"- Atender solicitações das outras áreas."
good,Hours were not very reasonable but the staff were really nice
good,"-Learned a lot of technical networking skills"
good,It is nice to have the option of working from home at hp.  HP has internal training tools to help you advance your skills.
good,"Tech company.. good products to work on."
good,Have enjoyed the company because I have learned a lot but I feel its time to move on to other adventures.
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar porém o salário era muito baixo se bem que para o meu cargo é o mínimo que se paga no mercado.Por isso pedi a conta.Trabalhei um ano e meio esperando uma promoção e nunca tive. A gerência gostava de mim. Era assíduo e pontual.
good,Alot of work did not learn much Management was poor Coworkers where good the hardest part was going every day and seeing the way it was ran the best part was working to try and make it better
good,* every day i get the opportunity to learn new things about my process.
good,Fast pace enviorment
good,"worked as a grounds keeper and also a laundry attendant. it was very fun, and i enjoyed. the thing i enjoyed the most were the residents."
good,"When I worked for Digital Equipment, I really loved going to work."
good,"First off, you will need to commit to the idea that you will be working 50 hours or more each week, and that's a minimum. Advancement is all about politics, not hard work, and when you do get promoted, it will most likely be years down the line, unles you are highly skilled at politics within the company or know someone high enough up."
good,I had a position in an agency setting to assist government offices. I worked with a couple of co-workers but really no direct supervision. A typical day was dealing with the public applying for government aid. I loved working with the public and being able to help them. I was able to use information from past jobs to assist in the service of the clients of this job. Being able to help people when they needed it most gives a great sense of satisfaction to me. The hardest part of the job was knowing that you couldn't do more due to guidelines to be followed. Either the client didn't qualify or you had to direct them to another agency that could help them.
good,"In my time at HP, which was 2 years and 9 months, the company went through four different CEOs with four different, distinct agenda. The current CEO decided to lay off approximately 9% of their workforce, or 29,000 people. I was one of them."
good,I was able to keep a roof over our head and i enjoyed the excitement of meeting the goals and to be a part of trouble shooting and problem solving.
good,good place to work but they started massive lay off 2 months after i got there and if your a second late there is another co-worker trying to back stab you to get your position.
good,"Pull and pick types of paper, to test in the printers for the day, while testing throughout the day, enter the differnt types of things that have occured into data recording systems. Very good co-workers, great management."
good,"HP is a good job for a person that is accustomed to the warehouse environment, they offer 3 shifts and the work is relativity simple. they also offer incentives and overtime regularly."
good,i worked as a network engineer for HP on a third party payroll. It immensely enhanced  my skill set  from this work.i only left this job because of low salary paid.
good,Great company BUT they have gone downhill unfortunately. Printers are going to be a thing of the past soon. HP missed the boat several times and we will witness the company crash and burn in the next 5 yrs.
good,"after all the hectic schedule it feels fun working there in HP. after 3 years and 8 months i feel that the management is a bit low there."
good,"I enjoy working at HP.  However, I'm a contractor, not a full time employee.  As such, I'm not allowed to participate in any HP activities nor do I have benefits through HP, only through my contracting employer."
good,Management makes unrealistic demands on staff and a policy of no pay rise offered on promotion lead to poor management selection and bad decision making. This equates to a very stressful and difficult working environment.
good,"Most jobs within the Global Business Units average a 50-60 hr week, with calls and meeting almost every evening due to a split in teams (the US and Asia).  Regional jobs (Americas, Europe, etc.) work a more regular 8-5 job with little expectation for nights and weekends."
good,Worked there for a year and was let go because of doctors appt.But I learned alot of computer skills. I also could work in all departments which led me to believe I was a value
good,The pay was really great but most of the employees were hired through contracts and were expendable. People were constantly hired and laid off. There wasn't a lot of proper training as the trainers themselves were just contracted workers. The pace wasn't extremely fast but you were expected to get as much done as you could. Great food but you had to pay for it.
good,HP Way惠普之道已经渐行渐远，公司让员工独立解决各种问题，back office并不提供各种支援，拒不接受电话沟通，所有一切员工自己解决，感觉非常无助。
good,"HP is great place to start a career but don't expect to go anywhere fast.  With all the layoffs and department changes over the years along with the forced rating system, getting any help from other experienced employees is limited.  So it becomes a sink or swim type environment.   If you are one of the few that is selected for advancement it can be a great experience, otherwise you are stuck on the B and C teams waiting for next round of layoffs."
good,"Good place to work on your way to something else. Job security is fickle at best. Bosses dont care. They always hire from outside, never promote from within unless management"
good,"Good place to work, large company issues.  Issues with growth advancement.  Good people to work with.  Would recommend to a friend who is looking for mid-level employment."
good,"Strong leadership at the very top"
good,almost everyone I know that was working at HP has been laid off.  I once though I would retire from HP.  Now I know few will ever get thta chance.  Please don't choose to work there.
good,HP is still in transition and needs to find its way again.  As the business goes through some hard times it is hard to say whether or not it will come out better.
good,"While the job was relatively easy and overall the position was a mismatch for me since I am far more of an educator than a salesman, I did not feel as though there was much opportunity for upward movement within HP while I was working as a sales representative.  Beyond that, the job was mildly enjoyable and I did get to learn a lot about the computers I sold."
good,Market Source provides a flexible work environment where you can schedule events within a range of times to better fit your personal schedule. They provide you with the tools necessary to do the job
good,Working as a contractor at HP was somewhat isolating. I felt that full-time employees had more say and priority. I wish I had more opportunity to become part of the company.
good,"Melo enivronment but little to no growth."
good,"Eu fiquei alocado no cliente fora da HP minhas atividades eram:"
good,"OK to work there so long as you don't want a long term career."
good,"Pros:"
good,Work was sometimes slow no advancement built nodes tested machines. When work was low or slow was asked to go home no time for advancement or work using certifications.
good,"This job was Stressful, specially during the end of months. It requires 8-12 working hrs per day and they do not pay over time. HP is a great company to work for if it's based in the US not in Mexico."
good,"Conversion to everyone in a team , freely moved on a employees don't crushes to seniors higher level authorities "
good,HP was fine until they reverted to wanting everyone in the office when it really did not make sense.  If not for the poor work lifwe balance I would have still be with HP.
good,"bottom line company. upper mgmt mostly worried about their own job security.  again, no long term experience as contract lost to lower bidder shortly after my hire."
good,"great place to work.  opportunities, but no job security"
good,"HPE/ HP schedule flexibility is the best attribute. Everything else is below average. Pay, facilities, advancements, benefits but I must say HPE new CEO i working on improving the culture so hopefully some of those improvements will help make HPE the great company it has been known to be in the past."
good,"A great place to work to gain global exposure in multiple technologies  and numerous client accounts both local, regional and global. Local teams are strong but a large offshoring exercise has the ability at times to pressure delivery of services."
good,OK: good team to work with to help solve client issues and create solutions to help clients achieve the buisness outcomes and goal with respect to their IT initiatives.
good,"It began as an exciting place to work. Unfortunately, the company has become extremely bad in terms of taking care of its employees. Would not recommend someone to work there."
good,"I enjoyed the type of work.  However, because HP had a contract with the State of Wisconsin, I reported to two different supervisors - one at HP and one at the State.  This situation occasionally caused confusion.  My HP manager's behavior was not always professional.   I knew of other people who were employed in different capacities at HP and who enjoyed their work environments."
good,"Day at work consisted of monitoring calls for  quality assurance, coaching associate, making sure calls were completed in the time allowed ending with a sale. Hardest part of the job making sure all of my administrative duties were complete leaving the time needed to train my employees to reach their full potential. The most enjoyable part was watching my employees reach and exceed their goals."
good,"Sem Contato com os dirigentes ,muitas dificuldades em resolver assuntos burocráticos."
good,"You'll work hard and there can be rewards.  Unfortunately, internal teams with conflicting metrics can lead fact based data ""off track"".  Not a lot of regard for work/life balance."
good,"Since this was a contract job, HP would not allow me to attend certain meetings and classes.  At the completion of the project, I was not allowed to attend the company sponsored appreciation dinner."
good,Just a tough and stressfull help desk just like any other. No room for advancement. Dealing with Military people that think you are military and will be combative.
good,"When I was employed at HP it was pretty cut-throat. No one wanted to get let go, so the culture was very stressful. Poor management as well. You were not rewarded for your work. There was a lot of favoritism."
good,"Nope not the Elon musk one but the opposite,no creativity no sense of advancement, a lethargic management with several thousand employees and a handful of clients."
good,"Compaq was a great company, but a buyout of Digital was the beginning of the end. Benefits kept getting pulled from Employees with tenure, and placed to attract new employees."
good,"Various  tems support other  companies technology issues and needs"
good,If you're young and bright don't work here. It's mostly for older people and people who like to take ten years or more to advance. Office manager was really nice.
good,The new HP is too interested in hiring foreigners than US citizens so I don't recommend this as a place to work. Let them hire all Chinese and Indians with H-1Bs.
good,"The split of Hewlett-Packard into 2 separate companies has done wonders for HP, Inc. HP is now much more nimble, moves faster, focuses on the right business objectives, is delivering what it promises to customers and the street, and is improving the internal culture."
good,"Unix Systems Administration and System Engineering"
good,"Some kind of fun environment  at my company  could  help me to keep stress levels down and also helped to increase productivity and client engagement. Through team activities outside of work or pub trips on a Friday afternoon, the team got chance to know each other better and employees/colleague become more confident around their peers."
good,A typical day would consist of answering inbound calls for tech support on HP products like Laptops and desktops.The hardest part of the job was getting training on products we support.
good,In my 14 years in HPs Outsourcing arm I had 17 different managers. There was no way to build a true development plan because the new manager Would have a different focus. My last manager lacked leadership skills and set unrealistic goals making it impossible to meet.
good,"Very good workplace culture, every day very challenging work life.  we need to plan the work well in advance so will be great to work on. Very balanced life."
good,Because I was a rookie when I started and my flexibility and ease of blending anywhere made my senior team transfer me to 5 different locations (stores) within just one month.
good,"The Hardest Part of the Job was work life balance.  When taking vacation it was difficult to disengage from work. Too many meetings made it difficult to complete assigned work.  "
good,"As a long time employee, the company was a great place to work before the early 2000's.  Employees then experienced negative changes in the company and workplace culture. Recognition programs were slowly decreased and became a low priority for management.  Employee feedback was also minimized as I had regularly volunteered to summarize and present results from the Voice of the Workforce (VoW) yearly survey.  In past years, results were openly discussed and actions taken.  Was disappointed by two recent managers who challenged the results rather than set a couple of improvement objectives."
good,"The company has gone through many changes and cuts in the last 5 years. This has dramatically reduced the workforce which shifts the remaining work to others. When a company is not winning in the market then there is no growth and the only promotions come when someone quits or is laid off. Not a great environment."
good,"Overall, it was an ""ok"" place to work. A lot of routine work or repetition in the duties. It was not a lot of room for mobility in this type of work. It was more of ""who"" you knew rather than ""what"" you knew."
good,"Constant layoffs. The education benefits were recently cut as well. People live in constant fear that they will lose their jobs. This company was great a long time ago, but today? Not so much."
good,"I enjoyed the company while I was there but the money once you're hired on, wasn't worth it. They became my family but again the money when hired on was not worth it."
good,"Good work/life balance available"
good,my review it is a good workplace and also iam in the role of accounts payable as a financial associate i have learnt invoice processing it is very happy
good,"HP is a good company in the technology industry, it needs to improve considerably to be competitive globally. HP's sense of work-life balance has significantly shifted away from caring for its employees."
good,Good company having a difficult time transforming many acquisitions. Many managers are transiting out of the company due to internal and executive management issues.
good,"Customer requirements / priorities not aligned with HP corporate goals or strategies "
good,"My time at HP was difficult but not because of HP as a company.  The difficulty was due to customer expectations and demands.  I felt that we as HP were a talented, hard working group of individuals.  However, the customer tied our hands to do what we thought was the best thing to do for them causing a difficult relationship.  HP was not able to do much to change the environment due to the contract with the customer."
good,"The Job doesn't have VTO and PTO"
good,"Acquired knowledge regarding new products/services"
good,"Promoções inexsistentes"
good,"This was mainly a weekend job where I would constantly learn about computer and printer products, mostly HP. I would have to train employees and promote HP products."
good,"Tax and accountant analyst. Getting part of the tax team, within my responsibilities I had to ensure that my Project were based on a fare and proper taxation."
good,Like all companies are mixtures of people..Had some good and less good times here.Big corporate with a corporate attitude
good,"Coworkers were good to work with."
good,"Reviewed all hardware and software in SAN Landscape for errors and issues.  Reviewed and planned capacity goals and levels on each array.  Reviewed software support and matrices to determine EOSL for both software and hardware.  Reviewed vendor ETAs, FCO and bugs to determine upgrade path.  Planned and coordinated vendor hardware/software upgrade and fixes with vendors and platform towers to determine best course of action. Opened, closed and represented change controls to CAB board.  Ensured day to day allocations, reclaims and storage incident tickets were opened, closed, tracked and worked to meet SLAs"
good,"My experience at HP was good but there was no room for growth in this company. In my 3 and a half years working for HP, I have learning many things. It's just that compensation for the work you doing is very disappointing."
good,"Typical day consisted of attempting to help customers on the contract via remote connection. Most customers were expecting a technician to come onsite. Metrics for the job went up while the number of tickets that were able to be pulled from the queue went down. Customers generally did not know their own company's internal policy and would want to argue, thus most tickets from the queue would be sent to a field technician to explain to them first hand. The workload and policies became even more frustrating as time progressed as the red tape involved became more cumbersome to work with, our closure numbers needed to increase and our number of tickets that were received decreased. It became a lose-lose situation rapidly."
good,"- Not very well structure"
good,Es una muy buena empresa para trabajar mas excluyen mucho a los contratistas
good,A very good company but the low salary was a con. The job work / life balance could improve since most of the employees worked long hours.
good,"The company is going though significant change, what comes with that is both opportunity and chaos. Myopic cost focus in some areas is driving some less than optimal decision making; management sometimes appears to waffle or worse flip-flop."
good,"experience has been good however, the management needs to invest in their staff a lot more."
good,"Avaliada no cargo posterior, já submetida anteriormente."
good,Falta de vida fuera del trabajo. Mucho trabajo extra fuera del horario de paga.
good,"HP provided a good work environment.  Days were long and some weekend and evening work required."
good,"Typical day involves many conference calls, emails, discussions with peers.  Increasingly, employees are required to make long commutes into HP offices, HP locations are restricted to certain markets, and management has become less flexible in work options.  Co-workers are for the most part smart, though you wonder how some have survived so many layoffs, quite frankly.  Best part of the job is, for the most part, I work with intelligent people who know their stuff."
good,"Trabalho muito segmentado, prejudicando o aprendizado, pois você desenvolve apenas alguns tipos de conhecimentos e habilidades."
good,There is no fun at work. The management is more focused on worked and targets. The employee growth is very slow and lot of politics played within the management.
good,"Disfrute trabajr en esta empresa por el ambiente de trabajo y las personas, sin embargo no hay facilidad de crecimiento y la paga es muy baja."
good,"Great opportunity to drive business from different states with many challenges against competitive companies such as Dell and IBM. Big corporations were the business best targeted when driving numbers which was exciting and challenging. Initially there were group activity functions focused around team building which proved advantageous in many areas. After the merger with Compaq, job security was a threat where it became all about numbers and little investment in people."
good,"HP was a great place to work when I started four years ago. "
good,Break fix of computer systems and printers. Also responsible of re-imaging computer systems as well as the decommissioning older systems.
good,"Working for HP was a typical day of receiving phone calls from students, parents, or other relatable parties, concerned for the students, regarding consolidating loans for those students. The primary summary of the job was to assist concerned parties, with student loan consolidation, by educating them about the processes involved in consolidation; as well as, the types of loans and the payments associated with those loans. The hardest part of the job was navigating the parents thru the website in order for them to complete the process themselves,when they chose not to disclose what they felt was private information, in order to complete the process. The most enjoyable part of the job was the help being provided to the customer, and their appreciation of the process and my ability to provide them with information which improved the life of the student,as it related to their financial freedom of moving forward with life."
good,"Ambiente de trabalho bom dentro do cliente, mas as políticas internas da HP, não sou muito favoráveis aos funcionários, mas mesmo assim gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa."
good,"HP values young employees and their ideas. HP' s pay scale is reasonable. Health benefits are good along with 401k. Co-workers are wonderful - everyone has the same work ethic. "
good,Overall it is just a job and they do not care as much for anyone working there. A lot of red tape and no way to advance. I would stay away if you want to make it a career. Not even a stepping stone in my opinion.
good,"the 5 yearsI Ive been at HP Iv'e learned and experienced so much with my customers/engineers , we do a lot of testing and data entry and reports/inventory and working with large printing webpress as well as small format and large format printing services and kiosk."
good,I thoroughly enjoy my job and what I do but because of the company split and defined need to layoff workers it has become an extremely difficult place to work  Employee morale is the lowest I have ever seen.
good,"The culture for 15+ years at HP was to promote working remotely, however, this year, the rules changed.  As more jobs were sent offshore the requirement was changed that U.S. Domestic employees must commute into the nearest workplace. (40+ miles for me, longer for others).  For those of us living in suburban or rural areas this has increased our costs in fuel, tolls, lost time, and stress, without any increase in compensation.  Effectively forcing many employees to seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Com a Cultura de confiar nos funcionários, aqui ninguém te cobra horário trabalho, saídas mais cedo ou chegadas mais tarde... Se você realizar o seu trabalho no tempo que deve, sem atrasar entregas, está perfeito! O ambiente é tranquilo e todos estão de portas abertas para conversar."
good,The management micro- manage too much  but overall the culture was changing when I left but enjoyed the time I was there OT was available often
good,"Like any company, it really depends on the team, manager and customer account."
good,Management is worst and suppress growth. But flexible work . opportunities are very less and don't expect promotions and onsite opportunities.
good,Direction for a company is utmost important to ensure that employees and people of the organization would be able to ensure that the whole company gets there successfully.
good,"HP is a large corporate structure that does not allow for growth.  Long hours little recognition, management does not provide direction to employees."
good,The leadership team knew what they wanted to do but did not know how to get it done. Flexible schedule which was a great benefit. Benefits were ok. There was no unity on the team.
good,"Extremely large and complex company. Veteran employees are dedicated, smart and tough but opportunities exist for new employees to contribute on multiple levels. "
good,"HP has seen many changes in the management and in the culture, usually not for the better. Looking for new opportunities and a more positive work environment."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"normal 8 hour work days "
good,"Working as a contractor is simply NOT a career. Actual HP employees seemed to be happy, but contractors were constantly looking for something else and leaving."
good,"Co-workers are difficult, with some exceptions."
good,"muitas coisa mudaram e não sei como anda a empresa pois ja tem muito tempo que sai de lá. Mas uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, sálario em dia sem atraso."
good,"Learn different kind of skills. Build unilts . Like air condition,heating  painting panels ,coils it was just one of the good qualitly about working with goodman. Never a dual monent."
good,"While HP was a national treasure of innovation and quality for over 50 years, it has unfortunately devolved into a me-too follower in the industry...no longer a leader providing new and unique ideas and solutions to their customers. The old HP-Way has given way to a corporate culture of profit and share-holder value first, customers and employees last."
good,Working on the assigned account was organized chaos.  Everyday was a new challenge.  The workload was very demanding with no room for error.  Most people on the team were working between 60 and 70 hours a week just to keep the projects on schedule.
good,"Worked on a data migration project.  Coworkers were great. Remote work made the job easier to things done.  "
good,"Great place to work for, but left little time to spend with family. travel is consistent, but there would be weeks where you don't work and do not get payed for."
good,"I learn from here is good knowledge on windows server 2003 & 2008."
good,"Uma empresa regular e parecida com outras similares."
good,"1. Coordinate the production line."
good,"Trabajo temporal de azafata, es únicamente una semana y la responsabilidad de llevar el equipo de azafatas era alta por lo tanto el estrés también pero acabé encantada con el trabajo, el ambiente y lo que aprendí. Alto nivel de aprendizaje."
good,Overall working environment is good. No restrictions to perform in work. Colleagues are friendly and cooperation take place whenever problem solving required for any issue happened.
good,"Expect to support multiple clients both taking phone calls and reviewing emails to assignment to secondary support teams as necessary. Rotating schedules. Entry level temporary position as a contract worker. Allows for college schedules and offers part time positions if work not compatible. In the call center personal is continually rotated as many move to new opportunities. A few top performing employees are promoted to new responsibilities but the pay rate remains low. "
good,"En gral es bueno trabajar para grandes empresas, solo que en HP no hay tantas oportunidades de crecimiento y el personal no es tan valorado."
good,"HP acquired Opsware Inc. which was the company I had originally worked for as a technical instructor. HP kept me as a senior delivery specialist which allowed me to travel the world. I later transitioned to a Cloud enablement specialist which gave me the change to learn and implement a cloud based solution for PaaS, Saas for some of the HP products. I enjoyed working with tools that could be integrated and work together to give the customer a single solution. My co-workers were some of the brightest people I had been able to work with and I enjoyed collaborating with them to meet certain goals for projects and customer deliveries. Hardest part of the job was not being able to get field experience when requested to enhance my skillset."
good,"Es una empresa de renombre pero las normativas de trabajo no son las mejores en cuanto al salario y clima laboral."
good,"As a Enterprise Account Manager, I gained extensive experience in C-Level relationship building, Enterprise Account management, Solution Selling, Product Marketing, Pipeline Management and Supply Chain Processes. My co-workers and I were extremely cohesive with the handling of our accounts. The hardest part of my job was telling my customer that they cant get their product because HP has it back-ordered. The most rewarding part of my job was solving business needs for my customers."
good,"Hewlett Packard was a great place for the last 25 years.  Too many layoffs the last 7 years.  I was laid off 6-18-2014.  There will be 37,000 more employees laid off this year and by the end of 2015.  Many will come back as temporary sub-contractors usually with out benefits."
good,"Typical day at work is doing whatever the customer asks."
good,"Great firm, dysfunctional management, The challenge which we faced and which the team in general succeeded at was to marry A/E services to a Hardware/Software company."
good,"It's a service desk job; You take calls, answer e-mails and fix computers. Lower management is okay but the upper management doesn't seem to want to do anything they don't have to (i.e. get specific areas cleaned in the office). Co-workers are fine, hardest part of the job is waking up in the morning. I'd have to say the most enjoyable is lunch."
good,"Aprendi muito com a empresa, me deram oportunidade de aprender coisas novas e de mostrar meu esforço e dedicação."
good,"Log and enter all relevant information about incoming media deliveries into Autonomy’s media   tracking system. Manages the organization and storage of physical media."
good,"From learning and development management to certification program management. I thoroughly enjoyed performing,with SMEs, skill gap and job task analyses."
good,"It a very good place to  explore your knowledge."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar na HP onde pude fazer de tudo um pouco,fiquei na area de vendas,arrumei estoque,fiz prospecção de novos clientes isso tudo trabalhando na loja de Shopping.Plano de carreira eficaz e oportunidades de crescimento."
good,Laid back environment. Not great for entry level positions.
good,"HP TippingPoint group is a great niche player in IPS and NGFW space, but they really do not want to change their culture to become more efficient and scalable.  The Symantec infiltration does help their situation either."
good,"Current Job Profile"
good,"Great equip, poor management. Not challenging enough but great environment to work"
good,Nice company to work with lots of learning and also fun activities other than salary aspect all is good about the company.
good,"Friendly work environment"
good,Falta plano de carreira para os colaboradores do MPS acima de 1 ano de empresa. Por esse motivo gostaria de mudar de atribuições e encarar novos desafios.
good,"Learnt how to handle things under pressure."
good,"Ótima empresa, porém com muitos problemas organizacionais devido a estrutura global"
good,"Covered the fab maintenance operations as final circuits for the HP ink jet cartridges went through the manufacturing process.  As the final chips were completed, started shutdown and decontamination procedures prior to equipment shutdown.  After shutdown commenced final decontamination and clean up of systems for transfer to Singapore or sale as was required."
good,"Job culture at HP was motivating."
good,"I was a part of  Billing team which is responsible to set up the contract (Tech/Manual) as per the agreement with the customer and generating invoices accordingly."
good,"I have been working at Hewlett-Packard full-time for more than 9 years"
good,"Although I had some incredible opportunities in the early year there is too much reorganization making it hard to focus today. I did have amazing opportunities to learn project management, working with cross functional teams, new technologies and how to manage my workload."
good,difficult to grow within company.  good oportunity to learn.
good,"HP is a good place to work , but I have been working in HP for past 7 years, so now I am looking for a change, so I get expsoure new environment , new methods of working"
good,HP is a good company to work for with good culture. However the biggest problem is the middle management. There are a lot of politics here and you can run into a lot of changes yearly or even quarterly.
good,"HP is a humongous organization. I was a third party payroll employee and that does make difference in terms of employee benefits in many ways."
good,Company as a whole was ok to work for and amendments in reward recognition meant you were rewarded for  going the extra mile. Company is in the middle of a massive restructure so unfortunately leaving a lot of good employees to seek employment elsewhere.
good,Its a good experience working with HP but there is no benifts on contract and contract expires after 2 years
good,"* Day passes along as the work progresses"
good,A typical day is busy. Learned a lot from coworkers and management. Hardest part is having to learn everything while doing it. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with smart coworkers.
good,"Decent company to work for but you will be a number and not an individual.  I wish management focused more on their workers.  Would I work for HP again, I'd say yes."
good,"IT leaders, train you well to get you started, training can last from 1-2 months. Learned SAP, Fusion, Sales force. com, Deal One, TRIM, OSS Sandy, Virtual rooms, Webcasts and company updates, professional development seminars. Management is hands on but often virtual, no micro management. Co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is working from home."
good,The hours where fantastic. I really liked working inside of HP due to the cool things they had like a gym
good,"A typical day at work consisted of daily morning SQL uploads and reporting for the business."
good,"HP is really a great company to work. HP is a company which gives freedom to work. The work culture is really great here.No huge pressure, just a sense of responsibility."
good,"I worked an 8 hour shift, with a strict no overtime policy. Brought in under a temp contract during a takeover and forced layoff of long term company employees. My job was very satisfying, and I learned as much as I could possibly ask for on a daily basis, working with the engineers and techs there was a once in a lifetime opportunity and something I am still grateful for. Amazing people work for this company, and HP employees tend to be lifetime employees, and until the forced layoffs, came across as some of the happiest, most satisfied employees I could even imagine. Working in R&D was very satisfying, and a constant learning, thinking on your feet environment, and fit my personality very well. I loved every aspect of the job besides the temporariness of it, also was laid off due to my contract being undersold to another temp agency."
good,Positives in all years
good,"HP used to be a solid and admired employer in the IT industry. Due to the turmoil in leadership, expensive acquisitions and wavering strategic direction it is hard to understand the direction in the marketplace."
good,always work available. no complaints really. Not that much office supplies provided
good,"Mainly gather and write requirements, create test plans, test cases, execute test cases, create business designs and release notes. Also work with EDI transactions, and ICD10."
good,"Very shady hiring/business practices combined with overbearing management makes for a hostile workplace. Being under contract, they can get rid of you whenever they like for whatever reason. The main boss routinely comes around and makes a round of firings for little reason other than to keep costs down."
good,My internship with HP was amazing. I learned so much and my manager was excellent. He knew how to lead and what it meant to be a true manager. After more than a year as an intern I was offered a position within the Public Sector of HP as a financial analyst (completely different organization and group than where I interned). This is where things took a 180 degree turn.
good,"I learned so much about a controlled clean room environment, particle contaminates and anything else that could harm computer wafers being processed. My responsibility was to properly vacuum and mop, specifically designed for a clean room environment. I worked along side a small group of personnel and we became an actual Team. We worked together side by side for up to 12 hrs a day, took breaks together for at least 7 years. The best part was knowing ""them"" and being able to read their eyes (due to that was the only part showing on our bodies in a clean room)."
good,"The team and people I worked with became long-time friends and were committed to helping each other. From the perspective of a contractor, I was considered an outsider and not allowed to participate in most company functions."
good,"Many great projects, good people, latest tools and practices. The negatives are Asia to Europe coverage causing many long days. Salaries are based on 40 hrs/wk when average work week was closer to 60 hrs/wk."
good,"A gestão da equipe é baseada em amigos apenas"
good,Very politically correct. Slow but thorough.Slow hiring process. Pleasant work environment. Nice cafeteria and grounds. This has a 150 character min and I'm out of things to say.
good,"All the Admin were always wondering if they would be the next to be let go. Random mass workforce reductions. "
good,"Not really a sales job, take orders via channel. Management wasn't strongest and low upward mobility at company. Good place to start but you'll need to look outside org for growth."
good,"Great Manager very people oriented and knowledgeable about his job. It was a temporary position.  Wages were very low for the current living location. "
good,Company didn't consider work life balance but established a healthy environment and workspace. Equipped with gym and other things. Company allowed difference experiences and cross training.
good,"Stressful environment with no career advancements and low salary packages."
good,"My most enjoyable part if I have good quantity of work to keep me busy 8 hours time pass good and hardest part no work or less work there, so need to search work to keep busy and to  pass 8 hours. Sometime they sent us home if no work ."
good,"Within the industry and world changes, obstacles were presented daily. Overcoming the obstacles were straining but somewhat gave one a feeling of daily accomplishment. Sales goals were many times unobtainable. Sales tools were broken. Supply chain changed and many times a scramble was daily. Culture changed over the years after the HP separation and we felt as if we were starting over as a team and company. Peers worked close together to overcome and resolve. TEAMWORK was a necessity."
good,"My first experience in the first line of the help desk. I was in charge of receiving calls, registering them and trying to solve them. If that was not possible, I had to scale them to a second support line. I supported two multinational companies at the same time."
good,"PC industry is on a down slope."
good,"Hp work environment was designed to promote ownership of its business practices. A technician had sole responsibility of their clients however, provided support in the event of difficult customer resolutions."
good,"seriously alienate contractors"
good,"Empresa bastante ampla de se trabalhar."
good,"Overall HP is a decent company.   Transformation after acquisition is difficult for all, learning the new environment, processes, requirements and culture."
good,"Support team for domestic clients and those based on site within US & UK "
good,"It was an ok company, a lot of nepotism throughout company. Seemed rewards where based off of how well connected you where with individuals rather work performance"
good,i worked for a third party barrier the -pay was good 14.34 it is just a call center calls are back to back and once summer comes around calls are shorter but so are you hours.
good,HP was a good company to work for.  I was able to acquire many management skills I use in both my personal and professional life.  I was able to utilize Project Management skills acquired in school and through training.
good,"Management was over-assertive, boarder lining intimidation in connotation and you could tell they enjoyed doing. This inadvertently demoralized the sense of team spirit, which in turn gradually eroded at our sense of confidence and belonging as employees."
good,"People are mostly great. Job  satisfaction depends on your manager, but there are executives who preach the importance or culture or empowerment, and then micro-manage and 'mean girl' there way through the day.   Most of my memories are good, but my exit and all the stress that goes with it--are directly responsible to one VP."
good,Used to be good.  A lot of negative organizational changes.  Too many silos.  Work life balance is decent enough.  This is not a forever home.  The only way to get new skills is to go to a different company.  Training budget is very very low.
good,"Una empresa magnífica para trabajar!?, si..., pero hace unos años. A día de hoy, poco queda de su sello de identidad, el empleado. En cualquier caso, no cambiaría por nada mi experiencia en HP, creces como profesional y como persona."
good,Overall upper level management couldn't care one bit about the employees. Their only goal is to keep shareholders happy. They make promises to companies that in no way could delivery keep.
good,"Interaction with DEV team teaches you a lot about processes and code. workplace culture is not quite but is bearable. Leads are nice, Management is good."
good,"Empresa so presa crescimento próprio, funcionários são so números"
good,"I work from home. I manage my own pace of work. I have had great managers and terrible managers. I enjoy working globally. HP has given me the opportunities to grown, learn and move into more challenging roles."
good,"Benefits where a little below average (satellite company), but with annual cut-downs and lay-offs it was hard to know if you would have a job 6 months down the road... I saw several (very good) people leave for this reason, while a number of under qualified people stay as they could not find work else where."
good,"Work was interesting with the chance to get experience in a number of areas.  People were generally great to work with.  However, HP was noticeably in decline and the continuing rounds of redundancies undermined morale and impacted business performance"
good,As a general agreed upon rule 6-8 calls per day is about any ones limit. These calls are usually dispatched to you the previous day. We then have a daily morning meeting to dispatch more calls even though you are technically full.
good,"Lots of autonomy and there are some great people to work with, but declining business makes job security tenuous at best and many personnel decisions are taken out of the hands of local management."
good,"Contract position through apex systems."
good,"HP is currently in transition. HPE is better, however, is very unstable at this time. Good career move if you are a software developer looking for experience."
good,"* Train associates and educated customers about Hewlett Packard computers, printers, & accessories"
good,They think the only way to cut costs is to continually layoff trained employees and high untrained employees at much cheaper rates.   This tends to cause support to suffer.
good,"Fast paced environment with a very high stress level. Good team members but at time lack of focus from upper management. Overall I had a good experience but pay or should I say lack of was an issue for me. We were routinely shorted on our paychecks with no real time line on when the problem would be fixed. As a man with a family, I couldn't wait for them to figure it out. I made the decision to pursue other options."
good,"Management was lacking, and it was clear the business was firmly grasping for the ""do more with less"" mentality as it regularly burned out its employees.  The location on Wake Forest rd.  in Raleigh has an external reputation of somewhere Network engineers do not want to work."
good,"Only worked one job for them in Branson, MO. Was ok, but paid for my own gas.The drive was not bad, Since I stay in Springfield, MO. I just thought that the position would last longer and that I would be able to advance in the company. I would have stayed longer, but the position ended."
good,"The Company was run for the stockholders. There was little to no real concern for the Customers, or the employees. The review process that was put in place promoted a cutthroat environment."
good,"As a contracted employee I found that I mostly worked with other contracted employees. Most people seemed to be working from home most days, which meant there were a lot of scheduled meetings throughout the day."
good,"Global IT was a stressful, high paced group. Large workload but with sever time constraints it was hard to innovate and truly build lasting well developed software. Culture (before the HP/HPE split) was very multi-cultural and inclusive with care to provide for events outside of our usual work environment to celebrate achievements and support team unity. Post the split, and especially for the DXC.technology spinoff, company culture was destroyed and a culture of cutting and irrelevance was introduced. HP Global IT doesn't exist anymore"
good,"Lots of senior people just waiting to take retirement.  Lots of dead weight with managers who don't have the training or backbone to coach them out of their roles, making it necessary for others to carry their weight."
good,"Good workplace but the salary is very less compare to other captive industries. Fun loving place with lot of games and activities."
good,Timely execution and plan next day and stressed work completion so work overtime for completion but play full and enjoyable team. Timing is hard shift changes. Learned a lot from the company and job culture
good,"I started working for Compaq, but HP acquired Compaq and proceeded to start laying off Compaq employees. Compaq provided a generous severance package, so I requested it from my manager and was granted it before HP stopped providing this generous package."
good,"Started fine, then every change they made was worse for employees.  They outsourced all the technical work to a less trained workforce.  And took away the only thing they had going for their contracts"
good,"Joined a well-organized company, Hewlett Packard to understand the nature of a working environment and to enhance professional skills required to work in a huge organization. The work had aided me to understand work culture, the importance of working in a team, and also to take up responsibilities and ensure their completion within time, without defects."
good,il y avait une bonne ambiance de travail avec les collègues
good,"The executive leadership and many lower end directors just simply do not have any idea what is best for the company. Just all about them. HPE, even though I was contractor, I saw this on an unimaginable level."
good,"I have been with HP for over 11 years and things have gone downhill in the last 2 years.  Between cut-backs when re-filling open positions, out-sourcing jobs to overseas locations, and asking one person to do the work of three, job satisfaction with my particular department is definitely at an all-time low.  It seems that  upper management no longer listens to the workers/associates when making changes, even when those changes are detrimental to the contract and/or the company itself."
good,"You can learn a lot from the business and its policies and practices with clients. "
good,"Very lax culture. lots of room to do what you wanted. Manglement lacked clear vision. Good career beginner, but be sure to leave after at least year or you will be hurting your professional career."
good,"I am a ""people person"" and have always enjoyed meeting and working with the various individuals within the company.  During my tenor at HP, I had the pleasure of working in various departments holding responsibility for different tasks/jobs, and building a wealth of knowledge in the field, however, as time progressed, the culture of HP changed (as expected over time), but did not change (in my opinion) for the better.  What began as an 'inclusive' culture ended as a 'coat throat' culture with every man for himself.  I also did not see room for growth anymore."
good,"Typical Call Center"
good,"HP got too big to manage & consequently it was split in 2015. 2017 brought another spinoff. They've had monthly workforce reductions going on several years now. "
good,"Due to changes in management, not so good now."
good,Great people who worked really hard but had a difficult time knowing who was in charge.  Too many layers of management.   Think of the movie Office Space.
good,No possibility for advancement as HP is cleaning house in all areas to save money and constant layoffs converting full time perm position to contract roles
good,"A typical day at work was easy to learn new things and enjoyable in work "
good,Great place to work. Government contractor made it a challenge. It was an easy contract but the government management made it difficult. Great group of HP people that worked well together.
good,"There are too many layoffs on a worldwide scale in the past 5-6 years. Company split, and spin-mergers of different business units in the recent 2 years has accelerated the implementation of workforce redundancy plans, so jobs are no longer secured in the company."
good,"I would recommend HP as a place to work."
good,"Lay offs were common and workers seem expendable. Work is monotonous and there is no room for advancement. I was laid off after one month, and it was definitely not performance related., not much more to say"
good,"Unless you have a good manager you will feel comfortable and relaxed in doing your job, otherwise, it is terrible."
good,"A typical day: Reviewing current approved security access for employees. Reviewing Email and phone messages to add tickets to the system for processing. Adjusting any security access requests or removals."
good,Nothing wrong with the job but sometimes sales quotas can be a bit high.  The call volume is a little high also and training materials can be some what missing which makes you learn on the fly.
good,Lots of ad hoc type work and good people to work with. Can be a grind with long days and sometimes weekends.  Overall a good place with lots of challenging work.
good,"Work: Monday - Friday / Field work"
good,"A lot of work, but also some down time, when we could talk, management was open to us blowing off steam by joking."
good,"The correct environment for the industry however pay scales were always an issue having one of the lowest pay to industry levels around. Comradery between fellow workers was brilliant, everyone helped everyone."
good,Very unfair compensation equity.  Indispensable employees are blocked from moving to other positions.  Some salaried employees put in minimal effort while others work long hours because they are the capable ones.  Personnel with minimal technical skills are promoted.
good,"HP was a good learning experience. Good work culture, warm people. HP had a fun work environment, good facilities like food, cab, etc"
good,HP was a great place for me work for many years but with the cost of product generation and competition HP changed its way it treated its long term employees these past few years.
good,"I had fun working for HP, they would really encourage to work as team. If we had a problem we supposed to talk as team and work trough the issue and figure out."
good,Worked there for 12 years.  Played many roles within the company.  Some jobs more enjoyable than others.  Had some awesome managers and a few not so much.  Was a great place to work until it wasn't anymore.  Job security is lacking.
good,Wonderful place to work.  Very relaxed and great management. Very inspired to work hard and a very competitive sales environment. Lots of breaks to recharge.
good,Considero que es una buena empresa con la cual uno se identifica rapidamente por su amplia presencia en el sector.
good,Always changing environment.  Co workers are awesome.  Management can be transparent. Hardest part of the job is that things always change.  Nothing ever stays the same.
good,"Moving away from work at home flexibility even in the technology space, only in strategic locations like Plano, TX; Pontiac, MI; Colorado Springs, CO; Atlanta, GA; etc."
good,"I was part of the team to support various scheduling and file transfer packages used by outsourcing clients of Hewlett Packard.  On average I worked 10 hours a day unless I was on call which was happening more frequently than expected due to staffing issues. "
good,Generally good experience. Worked with great clients. Not pleased with the fact that I was laid off. The corporation is more concerned about stockholder value that loyalty -- but I suppose that is the way of the world these days. I had extremely good co-workers and a lot of flexibility in my work arrangement. I enjoyed the travel and had excellent managers and colleagues.
good,"HP has just split into two companies.  HP Inc = consumer projects vs. HP Enterprise = IT services.   Both companies under a lot of pressure to cut costs.  This results in moving a lot of jobs offshore.  If you are in IT security or Cloud, you are ok.  All other jobs could be lost."
good,"A great company to get your feet wet. I learned the every aspect of the organization such as the operational side, sales and strategic business product placement."
good,Alot of change and opportunity at this company. HP will transform the 3D printing world through its huge access to supply and vendors worldwide.
good,"The printer division in Vancouver is fantastic, as are the people, but executive management, human resources, and legal, all located elsewhere, ruin as much as they can constantly. They are collectively either incredibly incompetent or they are competent at causing harm. It's hard to tell which. "
good,"Cheap pay. "
good,It was a good experience working with HP for several years.  I was able to develop new skills in the Information Technology industry.
good,HP is good place to work. it shows the dreams to employee. once days goes here our expectations goes wrong.hence expectation for good ratings awards and salary hike may demoralize the  employee. overall the work environment is ok.
good,HP is a pretty good place to work.  The infrastructure is built well and they're mostly organized.  The management team changes frequently which can cause some issues with recognition of employee efforts.
good,"A typical day at HP was filled with a number of tasks to attend to, the days were busy and very enjoyable."
good,Es un ambiente agradable sin mucho estres pero con pocas posibilidades de ascender.
good,"I worked as a promoter followed by HP. It was very interesting job dealing with customers, selling the highest impacted hp printer products. I had to work 6days a week, but it has fulfilled my enjoyment because I was seeking to develop my attitude with customers. And Hp prepared me to manage my management skills through the day to increase my assessment position and my personal life."
good,"Empresa procurando se redefinir no mercado de tecnologia após a separação em novembro de 2015. Não possui uma clara diferenciação frente a concorrência, tanto em Computação Pessoal como Impressão. Está apostando fortemente no lançamento de produtos de impressão 3D, buscando uma tecnologia disruptiva. O mercado de 3D está avançando rapidamente, se definindo em torno de algumas tecnologias que a HP está buscando melhorar, apesar da companhia não ter ainda um produto final a ser apresentado ao público. Tirou o foco da vendas de serviços para apostar em produtos e está pagando um alto preço em mercados emergentes como América Latina, onde sua participação no mercado de serviços de imagem e impressão vem diminuido a passos largos, perdendo participação para Lexmark e seus canais de serviços além de Samsung, Ricoh, Canon e outros participantes."
good,HP es una empresa vanguardista que debería hacer un mejor esfuerzo por conservar a sus empleados.
good,"Depend too much on your immediate manager to help support you thru any activity.  Very little engagement from HR, poor to no career advancement support and little incentive to remain employed."
good,"HP is one of the branded  Multi national  company where in  i started my journey with HP from august 18th 2015 ."
good,"Enjoyable place to work but shifts will be a great concerns"
good,"I was hired through a staffing agency and I was told that my main job location would be near my home. After a few weeks, the manager calls and tells me I will have to travel which was not relayed to me at the beginning of the job interview process. If I would have known this, I would not have taken the position. "
good,Management needs to be more involved in HP standards and be able to provide important information to others. Working for one supervisor will leave you in the dark but all others are great supervisors. Payroll and HR needs to step it up 3 notches to satisfy workers. I have  learned a lot though. Racism still exist heavy and favoritism is at a all time high. Hardest part of the job is receiving proper training for other task that you would like to indulge in such as iOS and etc. Some people get training without wanting it others have to beg
good,"It doesn't matter how hard you work for HP. They are only concerned with making money. In 2 years of employment with HP, I have yet to be evaluated by my manager. The HP Management I worked for cursed in our staff meetings, using the F word many times during the meeting. The organization I worked for had no minorities in their senior management. All senior and upper management are Caucasian. I was a part of the senior management team, but was quickly demoted because upper management felt there were too many senior managers reporting to overall manager. This demotion made the senior management team purely Caucasian as I was the only Hispanic member on the team."
good,"Como toda compañía trasnacional brinda herramientas coorporativas excelentes que ayudan al desarrollo constante y actualizado para fortalecer destrezas y funciones así como la capacitación para el cargo desempeñado."
good,The best part of the position was working with developers and project managers all over the world. I learned how hundreds of HP businesses worked together connecting the groups to a centralized SharePoint using customized tools and processes.
good,Poor decision making on the part of management often leads to excessive use of resources on simple projects. Company often invests in projects that have no long or short term relevance and often those projects get scraped mid way.
good,"I've learned a lot working for this company.  It has been very educational and a value-add to my work experience."
good,"Management very old, very little creative and with not too many ideas."
good,"HP has been an incredibly interesting experience - in the five years I have been with them, I have seen everything."
good,Typical contract work.  Our contract was different type than any other contract in company and  Pomeroy management found it difficult to relate to our situation.  Very little involvement from Pomeroy Corporate Management.  Renewals of contracts was especially frustrating as those involved did not take the time to find out about our particular program even though every month for 13 years we were profitable.  After 13 years we lost the contract with HP in large part because management could not adapt to changing environment at HP and changing needs.
good,Great place to get experience to take you to the next level. The people are willing to teach you. Its hard to get a promotion though. You have to interview to move up in the company. You have to compete with external hires for a new position. When you do move up most likely its a lateral move-no pay raise in other words. If you work in the call center the breaks are horrible-30mins.
good,"I was only at HP for two years.  After the EDS acquisition it was clear that HP (the printer company) was not prepared to run a software organization, hence the company split to become HP and HPE.  HPE is still working on defining who they are, or want to be."
good,"Good working culture with a well-balanced worklife. Management is okay, benefits are adequate too, both extended to employees and families."
good,"Not there long enough actually for a good review. I was brought over with the rest of the Citi division, doing what I did at Citi, and most of those duties were gradually removed until I was let go, along with many others, due to a change in business requirements."
good,"Customer Service and Parts Identification"
good,This is a good job. That's if you like to start off with baselevelt help desk. They school schedule so it is very easy to have it work and study balance.
good,Interacted with a team of co-workers on a daily basis. This job required little to no supervision while I did all my daily task. I always met my requirements such as tracking and maintaining of the hardware in the lab.
good,"I had great hope for a career with advancement potential and a position to grow and demonstrate my PM skills. Things started out great. Good tech team, very good manager, training opportunities and potential advancement. However after 5 years with top performance ratings(exceeded expectations) there were zero pay increases while the CEO and VP's received huge increases and stock options. Then after receiving an award for top contributor for the quarter out of 1500 PM's I was rewarded with a lay off and told my job was being out sourced over seas due to poor profit margins of the division.  HP is just another huge company looking to make it's stock holders and top level management more money with no regard for it's US. employees."
good,"Good base pay but not so good benefits but that has probably changed in my department."
good,"There is always more to learn, so make a habit of of reading, learning and listening to fresh information."
good,Was in portion of HP what was acquired (i.e. EDS) experience was not the best in terms of finances and advances. When client contract ends movement in other areas of the company appear difficult.
good,"Typical work day is filled with diagnosing issues for complex problems, data gathering and analysis with proposed solutions.  The workforce is intelligent and much can be learned, ideas and concepts are bounced in a creative environment."
good,"it is know as one of the most important firms in the IT Industry, however the culture moves based on the need of the company, which constantly causes changes that avoid the employee to have and build a career on a prestigious firm."
good,"HP are going through a major restructure hence my somewhat negative feedback, things can only get better, I have had no pay rise for 3 years, I do not get paid any additional money for working overseas"
good,"HP has great people, and is trying to meet the changing market place. This it is finding a tough challenge as its infrastructures creak."
good,The end users are pleasant to work with but coworkers are disruptive and unprofessional. Current view is unlikely to give an accurate estimate for all of the HP world.
good,"the culture of your department depends on your boss."
good,"Palm was a fun place to work with great products. But because of slow reacting to market. They could not keep up with market, and HP accrued Palm and killed all the hardware."
good,"It was okay working there. Not sure if I would go back if asked. Some of the people were great, however, it was decent atmosphere."
good,"As a IT manager at HP, you deal with constant change in a fast-paced environment.  The people and management are hard working."
good,"Day at work is split into 2 sides, remote users and on site users."
good,"Working for a big company has many advantages.  You can learn from so many people, be exposed to a wide range to techonlogies.  However the bigger they are there is always risk of downsizing.  Layoffs are a common occurrence. Every couple of years they expand then contract."
good,"12 hour shifts of high stress, requiring multi tasking and critical decision making. Demanding service level agreements and customer satisfaction.  Learn to better manage multi-national on site and off shore team in a follow the sun environment for the largest financial institution.  At times micro management presented obstacles.  Co workers when effectively, coached and mentored were apart of the most enjoyable aspect of the job.  When setting the example and leading from the front, they responded in increased production and heighten morale.  The hardest part of the job was the commute."
good,"When tooling ran fine things were smooth. When the tooling decided not to cooperate, life was not so good. Always a challenge"
good,In dieser Position habe ich gelernt grosse Kunden Territory¨s zu verwalten & mit den Partner/ Distri eine gute Business Beziehung aufzubauen  und aufrecht zu erhalten.
good,"Work environment is OK. lot of layoffs due to outsourcing..... not a healthy place to work for long term. Co-workers are friendly."
good,To much churn as the company tries to figure out what it will be in it next incarnation.  To much political infighting in mid management
good,"HP is realigning its workforce to use more resources in India and Costa Rica, so US and UK citizens will likely be turned away while the current workers are being let go.  If you can continue working there, you can find a lot to do as long as you are aggressive in pursuing it."
good,This company wasn't pleasant to work for. Management was never around. The trainer was not knowledgeable of company programs.
good,It has been many years since I worked here but it was not the greatest place to work but could have been much worse
good,"Ambiente de trabajo divertido."
good,"This is job is a good opportunity for new professionals in the area, but other than that I would stay away if you are eager for progression like myself.  You can stay in this job and have success but it is usually short lived.  There pain points to every job, but there are specific ones at this job that limit growth and creativity."
good,"Hardest part of the job:"
good,"There are so many things to do, so little time. Since the line of business I was at was still new, the management has not been able to establish concrete rules and regulations, hence the constant changing of policies. This comes confusing to everyone, Even if HP is a good and established company, these inconsistencies make it a hard place to work at. One of the good things though are the benefits that employees get such as medical reimbursement, medical insurance, leave credits, etc."
good,Troubleshooting and configure computer hardware to manufactures specifications in a production environment. Hardest part of the job is doing nothing.
good,"Very busy, fast paced environment, where customer service is key.  I learned a variety of different tasks and roles in my 6+ years with the company.  The hardest part of the job was ensuring all service levels were met each month and the most enjoyable was seeing the team achieve their goals."
good,"A Typical day at work involves  : providing technical guidance to the customer facing consultants, to review operational metrics, provide feedback, manage staffing, work on ongoing projects, manage escalations by doing internal communication and by engaging with higher management of clients, identifying areas of improving operational excellence  and cost reduction"
good,"very hard work in some areas ."
good,"The HP business model is losing ground as the world around it changes.  I have had the fortune of working for two vastly different Fortune 500 companies in my career (HP, AT&T).  And I've seen this reocrd played before.  Fortunately for AT&T their business model adapted to the consumer change from a reliance on long-distance landline phone service to cellular/mobility.  Thanks in no small part to the partnership they initally held with the iPhone.  The question is what's next for HP?  Laptop's and printers are losing their grip on consumer demand.  And their businees model shows nothing coming forth on the horizon to keep the company afloat.  Hence pay reductions and layoffs are hitting the company hard in a time when other companies around them are increasing their work staffs to meet increased demand."
good,"Senior leadership all have their own priorities which are shared with the people working for them."
good,"To many layoffs,  makes for an uneasy living. Non one is safe when it comes to job security."
good,"I have had a bad experience at this place.The work timings were very odd."
good,Job requires to set factory default and clear customer data in equipment.
good,For a first job out of college the pay and benefits are pretty good.
good,"I have been under three PMs and maybe I've just had bad luck but you need to have people skills to be a manager, and most of those I've been under or observed are very bad with people.  Good management is charismatic and people want to make them happy.  You can't beat people until morale improves."
good,"People are great, focused and professional. Immediate management is a joy to work with and are focused on cultivating talent. Difficult, at times, to comprehend upper management's direction and frequent change of direction."
good,HP took the time to develop my skills as an entry level employee and that enabled me to continually progress in my career and expand my HR skills.  The best part of the job is the people I work with and that makes even the most challenging job fun and exciting.
good,HP works with their employees to learn on the job and gain valuable hands-on experience.
good,"Working Environment Is Good"
good,"cool products, tons of weird reorgs with no direction on how to do the job you have recently been put into. Engineering has no accountability for making schedules and producing code that is made with quality. "
good,"This job is a help desk job with the army where you assisted recruiters and soldiers with differnet issues with computer software and hardware.  Hardest part of the job, was determining fixes for a lot of the off the wall issues that we had.  Most enjoyable part of the job was most of the people."
good,"Worklife balance - you must be your own advocate"
good,"Friendly environment to work with . People here are always helpful if any issue persists . "
good,"Supervisor came and worked with us, so that he could get a full understanding of all that we did for him."
good,Good company to start out career. Job uncertainty is high right now. Morale is down dude to layoffs and company transition to turn around.
good,unable to keep management in place. Very unstalable work place
good,"project implementation"
good,they treat employees like they are expendable and don't invest in their success
good,A fast paced environment with high levels of responsibility and organization required.
good,"Was a great place to start my career, but things keep getting worse (to the point where I'm here looking for another job...)"
good,"Learning new technology, new skills, Project management and client interaction."
good,HP is big and chock full of bureaucracy.  Because of the sheer size of the company it is difficult to make an impact and feel your efforts are recognized or really have any infulence.  The rank and file employees are generally fantastic and overall it is a positive environment.  During the turnaround Meg has turned to Orwellian style tactics to force change and has dampened the morale.  Currently in many jobs people feel overworked and under-appreciated.
good,Constantly being asked to learn additonal products to become more billable. While going through all of the recet changes most people are afraid of their jobs. If you can make it though this current turn aorund I suppose tings may allow for a better workplace moral. Most I speak with whince every end of quarter.
good,"Although the pay and benefits were decent the hours were brutal. It's a global company with large gaps in time zones so working all hours of the day and on weekends is required. It was great when I was younger but after having a family the benefits of the decent paycheck were not worth it. "
good,"Learned lot of things from corporate sector."
good,"we lost the Medi-cal account, I lost my job. I took early retirement."
good,"Not a bad place to work. People are friendly."
good,"Great team to work with."
good,"Empresa agradavel, possui diversas redes na baixada santista e sp."
good,"good to work, learned from the starting phase"
good,"Foi meu primeiro trabalho registrado, entrei novinha e, com todas as experiências, sinto que amadureci muito. "
good,"Co-ordinate with all IT managers, Vendors and IT engineers for PC setup."
good,"I was happy with the extension to be able to continue with the position. Most of the positions are independent but there are times you need to work with other team mates. The job required you to be accurate and timely, so you had to be very attentive to what you were doing. Each employee had their own vendors and mostly worked individually. I enjoyed working independenty and being a problem solver."
good,I work at Hewlett-Packard as part of General Motors Information Technology support staff.
good,Everyone on the team is very helpful and always willing to assist.
good,"HP is 100% goal oriented."
good,A typical day for me is to start early and be proactive. I like to get a jump on my day and resolve issues before they become issues. I have to multitask throughout the day and there is never a point in the day when there is nothing to do.
good,"A day can contain any of the following tasks:"
good,HP is a very large and diverse company that has had massive management problems.  Today the company struggles to put together a winning portfolio of products and people.  Major layoffs have been seen at HP and they continue.  There is great unrealized potential.  Will HP ever provide an environment to realize that potential?
good,Aprendi muchas cosas que no se aprenden durante la carrera que espero que sean de utilizad para trabajos del futuro.
good,"I Worked in Hewlett-Packard Service Centre as Customer Support Engineer in Bangalore (maintained by MAHA ELECTRONICS PVT LTD)"
good,"Typical day at work consist of you logging in ready to take about 80 calls or more a day. Not bad. There are many positive aspects. You learn how to increase your call volume and handle customer concerns in a timely manner. You learn a needed skill, I have been able to do back office work. With back office work there is a lot of data entry task. Your typing wpm will increase, you have to document every call. As far as management you are assigned a supervisor who can ans all your questions...with time you will know how to ans all clients questions. You will know how handle every problem that can be addressed in your department. The hardest part is the low pay. The most enjoyable part is helping people. The work place can be especially enjoyable if you get along with the coworkers around you. Enjoy...I rather do this from home and have the same benefits."
good,"-Typical day at work: e-mail, e-mail, e-mail, meetings, meetings, and then maybe some hands-on QA work.  But as the Senior QA Analyst, most of my work is coordinating with stakeholders, reviewing specs and test cases and reviewing results for progress checks and reporting to management."
good,"I had a lot of fun at hp "
good,"Aprendi que de lo que se trataba era sacar las maximas  llamadas posibles y atenderla muy rapido aunque el cliente no se quedara contento con tu ayuda, gestor de seguros  y me despidieron por intentar solucionar al cliente su problema, solo querian que se atendieran llamadas y no duraran mas de un minuto."
good,"The day actually starts  the time the cab driver calls and rushing towards office. The team discussion on the day activities to be done important tasks and meeting of the day."
good,Work Balance and Work Nature is good but  Salary wise very Less
good,"good and learned and management ok and co workers was good too "
good,"Not Much Growth Here, Management not much supportive with employee"
good,Professional Communications- verbal and written.
good,"Working at Autonomy was a great opportunity and the day to day tasks were great to work on. Each day brought something new, but limited knowledge by senior staff led to the project becoming oversaturated with low level input and little development of the core tool. The pay was just about adequate, but could not be said to be reflective of the skillset of some team members."
good,Large Company to work for. Learned alot about a state contract and have perform several larges Focus audit for several providers.
good,The work was challenging and rewarding. I was able to make a big impact on HP high end server quality that helped save the company millions in warranty costs.
good,"The working condition have been very relaxed, therefore creativity and innovation have been flourished to huge success of my ETL, Data Warehouse, and Oracle Change Data Capture (CDC) project."
good,"If your dream job is to work with co-workers who are intelligent, hardworking, and who have integrity, HP is the place for you."
good,"Uma empresa nova no mercado, porem bastante dinamica, mas mau assistida pela supervisão e gerencia."
good,"This position was temp, and I enjoyed being able to assist the customers."
good,a questão salário esta muito fora da realidade do mercado externo.
good,Open door policy with management is great.
good,"A typical workday starts at 6 am and ends around 4pm, but can sometimes stretch to 6 pm, depending on issues being dealt with."
good,HP did well at dveloping printers. High knowledge of plastic injection molding. Good engineering practices. When they wanted to reduce cost they sent the dvelopment over seas.
good,"I loved my job at HP. Everyday was an adventure learning something new. I was mentored by engineers and other technicians which gave me great mechanical skills. I also learned a lot about writing assembly documentation. My management was ok. She worked out of state so she really didn't know what my skills were. The hardest part of my job was trying to fullfill commitments at the end of my shift. Engineers would come to me for their needs at the end of my shift. HP had cost constraints so there was no overtime at the time. I loved learning new things everyday. The environment I worked in changed everyday. I got to work closley with the engineers repairing, testing, troubleshooting industrial printers, and documentation."
good,During a typical day I sit at my desk and answer calls from current customers and new customer. I explaing billing and also place new orders. I educate the customer on their options they have avaliable and also explain product usuage. I have learned to multitask between multiple computer screens also how to calm a customer down in a irate situation. The hardest part of my job is trying to stop the customer from closing their account after they are very irate. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers to get the products that best fit their needs by educating them on our products.
good,The company has done a great job acquiring the most talented people for the company. The management team was effective in communication. The hardest part of the job was job security. The most enjoyable part of the job was the travel.
good,1) We will do mismatch reconciliation to arrive at delta
good,"Excellent place to work, good culture, overall fun working and challenging working here."
good,HP is very good company to work.. I have learned how to manage the people and mangemant was good . Very good people in team. Prodution lead is a very hardest.
good,"It is a good place to work at, most employees are new. The negatives are traffic since it is located five minutes from Washington DC, we are located at the basement of the facility so no windows. Government contract will end soon and no guarantee of a secured position."
good,"HP as a whole has a great culture and has the potential to be an amazing employer; however, depending to the account you are assigned to there are limits in how you can advance. It my case there was no advancement opportunity without taking a near 10% pay cut. I was very unhappy from the time I moved onto the account, due to several pay cuts (to allow the company to avoid layoffs) and a refusal to provide pay increases."
good,"Buen compañerismo "
good,"At a company like HP, you have scale to do very big things. The products I work on are in 27+ countries, have millions of dollars behind development and promotions, etc., so that's pretty cool.  However, the scale of the projects mean there are as many as 10 teams touching any project, with layers of stakeholders requiring reviews, 18-24 months to turn anything around and an extreme emphasis on cost-cutting."
good,"Managing the structure of the database."
good,"hoher Zusammenhalt der Kollegen"
good,good working place and learning environment. But salary is not that much great us market gives. But we have work life balance and job safety. Fair i would refer my friend
good,"Great Supervisor, but company focused on wrong things. HR didn't want anyone who was a Christian, but had to honor Muslims, Witches, and Mormans. Not consistent with HR policy."
good,"Good place to work, but way too big. Poor communication. It was hard to stay synchronized since we were all in different places. Some lack of direction."
good,The job was ok.  When I worked there we sat in cubicles and just took calls all day.  There were few opportunities for advancement.  The pay wasn't that high either.
good,It was Good before split. Top management is making lot of wrong decisions which is really impacting their employees. I really had good experience before things got worst with HP
good,good place to sharpen skills but cooperate needs to not only focus on business but on its grunt workers too. let the employees grow as they get better
good,Management seems to be in constant turmoil and lacks no long term vision. There are too many people waiting to cash out with a proper retirement that they are not able to think ahead for the future and is constantly under stress of job loss
good,Job was ok but the benefits were bad health insurance payments were terrible if you need a job this will do as as a fill in job but don't figure this as a career
good,"MSI-ECS, i could say, is a perfect learning ground for me. I have learned and developed a lot of experiences and knowledge that I could still use today and in the future job."
good,"There wasn't much room, if any, for advancement in my organization.  HP has a history of underpaying their employees.  You were always expected to take on more responsibilities without being compensated.  I enjoy the people and the culture though."
good,"The last 7 years were great as I was able to work from home 5 days a week.  Salary was adequate but constantly worried about job security."
good,"HP has a good working environment where you can enjoy your work. Heavy work pressure, however Management invites to listen to your constraints."
good,I enjoyed how we were supported on the training class. but when we already started taking calls management not really making a lot of time to check on you.
good,Fun position but lacked growth. Great co-workers and was a fun environment to work. Great hours was rewarded for hard work. Potential to make good money IF you hit your quota.
good,HP Way is to be accountable for your career and learning on your own.  This was the most valuable thing I learned from HP.  Good collaboration with co workers and leaders.  Lacked of single integrated financial tools and low job security and opportunities for advancement were minus.
good,"It's been so long since I've worked there, I can't give an opinion. I've heard that the threat of layoffs are still always imminent so it's still a stressful environment"
good,It was great working at hp bassicaly a good team we always had all the goals cleared also on top of that we did the whole process of mounting the ink system
good,"They have a serious problem paying their commissioned employees. I would never take a job again at HP if it has a commission incentive. The revenue tracking system is broken and although upper management has been screaming to fix it, there are still folks who are owed thousands of dollars and although they show evidence of a sale, after months, they are still waiting to receive payment."
good,"Started at HP when it was still a company that valued it's workforce.  Over time, it whittled away at the HP Way until it just died.  So now HP is just another mediocre company with a mediocre culture.  It's not a bad company to work for, but they will treat you like a number, offering few perks, job security or opportunities for advancement and growth."
good,"Loved this job. Worked Monday to Friday.  Learned how the accounts payable department worked.  Worked with Excel for everything in my job. Paid all of the bills, companies and inventory incoming and outgoing for HP.  Loved my managers, they were so understanding and helped me learn so many new things."
good,HP's client chose to give their IT support business to IBM.  At the time of transition I was offered the chance to move to IBM.  After 5 years the same client viewed IBM performance as so poor that they chose not to renew the contact.
good,"very hard work working a 12 hour shift 1 day and 1 night per week"
good,"The environment is very hands-off by upper level management and growth potential is possible, but may not be as visible in the Houston campus.  I was a contractor, so these were not as available to contractors."
good,"Lay offs yearly prevented ability to deliver upon strategic goals."
good,Great place to work but a shell of it's former greatness.  Organization had been riddled with shrinking market and poor decision making with M&A activity.  New leadership has refocused the organization and moving forward.
good,Great place to work with flexible work hours. Little opportunity for advancement. Not much interaction with the person that creates the performance reviews.
good,"I started working at EDS, them it merged with HP."
good,"I got bad experience dealing with company management. "
good,"ok, depends on the contract you are on. I don't have much to say more than that. This forum is requiring me to write more words than what I have to say and that was everything I had to say."
good,"Typical day revolved around implementing processes developed by somebody in India.  Unfortunately they are not aware of Australian service challenges which was frustrating."
good,"Good for training and internship but not good for a long term career."
good,Worked here to support sales and marketing objectives.  Management was hands off because we worked remotely and in stores.  You were managed by technology and GPS to make sure you were on site.
good,HP in it self is a good company just the department I was working for was not great at all. Made some great friends among my immediate colleagues not to mention the amount of friends I made in other teams. Work might have been so so but the atmosphere made up for it.
good,"Worked there for 18 years and the work could be very tedious and slow. Too many layers of management meant that decisions kept being changed so the workers never really knew which way to go. Most of the workforce was over 40 when i was there so there wasn;t much socialising, which was OK because we worked long hours. The US bosses decided to cut costs on our project so they made 600 people on our site redundant and moved the work to the North East to be performed by cheaper and untrained graduates. Needless to say it didn;t end well."
good,"Exciting atmosphere with many people beginning their careers. "
good,"Better if you get hired on FT so that you feel like you're apart of the team. Once on the team, lots of collaboration is able to occur. Just getting in the door is hard though."
good,Pempresa boa sem muito chance de crescimento mais super pontual com os direitos
good,A very diverse team oriented workplace that focuses on educating their employees and clients. A company that like to promote internally and is forward thinking in product development.
good,"Warning, HP employees still read Dilbert and Slashdot.  The people are mostly reasonable, the company is stable.  But at the end of the day, they're making printers."
good,"Good place to start a professional career, but not a place to keep yourself for a lot period of time. A good thing would be that there were some parties on holidays to improve the mutual collaboration among work partners."
good,Technical Team collaboration was a standard that was very useful in completing projects. The majority of the day was spent in meetings with various teams globally.
good,"there's not enough collaboration and team work within the organization. At time, you will feel like your let on an island. Management could be better if wasn't so remote."
good,Management continually changed... had 7 managers in the last 5 years there.  Great co-workers.  Managers claimed they were forced into having only one or two top performers and made to have one or two bottom performers with everyone else in between for reviews.
good,Sometimes work life balance was hard but due to the flexibility of telecommuting I was able to work things out.  I made a lot of good professional contacts within the sales teams I supported.
good,"Working there will depend on what your long term goals are in life. I've seen many talented good people get laid-off in the organization i worked in. You can make a good living, but I'm not sure if you'll make it to retirement. I left on my on accord."
good,"HP is ok in terms of package and job roles but constant restructuring create instability. This also creates a lack of direction and management understanding and therefore the work force cannot settle and focus on tasks, projects and progression. There is also the continued redundancy threat where no one is safe in any location. There are opportunities for career progression, although minimal"
good,the enviorment was relaxed and co workers were great. the boss was a very nice kind man. I would recommend this place. pay was not so great. well balanced overall.
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, pero no adaptado al tiempo actual."
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, cultua valores morais e profissionais. Ótimo ambiente de trabalho. Fornece muitos treinamentos e ótima  base de conhecimento."
good,I was part of the major layoff of remote/telecommuter employees. It was stressful leading up to it. I'm sure the experience would be different now in a more streamlined organization.
good,"Sought new sales opportunities for the company, supported the information technology department with all technical conflicts and inquires, and coordinated with multi HP Field Representatives across the Greater Los Angeles area, New Mexico, and Arizona to unveil innovative business branding and opportunities."
good,"Scope to learn various facets of business like direct sells, channels, operations, product management and general management experience. "
good,"Gostava muito de trabalhar la,mais a equipe toda veio embora de Pelotas(RS) e acabamos sendo demitidos por uma discussao com o proprietario,,,,,,,,"
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, fun and interesting work with good people."
good,"great company before the split and merger.  Latest changes were not managed properly and focus on employees is no longer one of the main priority. Career progression and development has been stalled in the last few years. "
good,"upper management is indecisive and micro managers.  The lower management know what they are doing and will achieve the goals set forth by upper man agent with out upper management trying to tell them how to do it and it is usually wrong,"
good,"Worklife balance but salary very low when compared to other companies."
good,"a typical day-you will work till you satisfy the great customers."
good,Could be one place one day and then go learn something you've never done before the next. Sometimes it was a hastle but you got to learn something new everyday
good,"Ter uma oportunidade é essencial, e esta empresa é boa nisso, mas poucos tem carreira dentro dela."
good,Takes forever to get any kind of network changes approved.  When we were acquired we lost the speed and flexibility to respond to customer needs we had as a startup.
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, com atividades rotineiras. Os conhecimentos adqueridos na jornada de trabalho nem sempre podem ser usadas para outras empresas, pois são procedimentos específicos e ferramentas apenas para uso interno."
good,"Great place to work and amazing work culture , learned a lot at HP leadership team was also great at HP work environment was also great overall great place to work"
good,"The people are great to work with, as well as our immediate management as they seem to truly care about taking care of their teams. Overall, work/life balance is non-existent with a heavy workload due to layoffs and furloughs. Upper management is self-serving and seems more concerned with the bottom line and their bonuses rather than taking care of their people. It used to be a great place to work until the split with HP and the companies focus on acquiring other businesses/technology."
good,"communicate with clients and peersand design, configure and provide support per clients needs."
good,"When I arrived to begin working, I didn't have a machine ready to get to work on. It took months for me to gain access to systems, and I was told to sit and wait."
good,Work life balance is fairly evident in this company. But it will be hard to keep learning and oftentimes career seems stagnant. But the management tries their best.
good,"Empresa de shopping, pelo ritmo do trabalho e localidade, não dá pra fugir de certas questões. mas acredito que foi o momento ruim da época."
good,"HPE Inc now is DXC Technology Inc is a Fortune 500 company and provides opportunities in Virginia to move to different positions and learn different technical areas on the Navy Project. They provide excellent benefits and pay for a secret and a top secret clearance if required for the position. Hours are flexible and there are additional benefits such as long or short term disability and legal services etc. Normaly day is maintaining outages and worker with different departments and working to resolve server issues. The culture of this is much like that of the Military due to the variety of people in this culture. The hardest part of the job is finding out why a server went down and being extremely specific on the circumstances because we cannot always find out why everytime. The best part is working with some really good people who share knowledge of their environment that may affect yours such as Sequel or VMWare or Active Directory Team or Capacity and Planning. Server years there I have worked under various management teams, some good and some not so good. I learned that the customer is priority because without them we can do nothing."
good,my deal with HP is jaded because I was bought from Bank of America in a transition to outsource their storage management. The contract terminated but while I was there HP did a good job of taking care of their employees.  I was compensated about average of the market value.
good,"Benefits were great, scheduling was never together.  Management is never understanding or flexible when it came to work-life balance."
good,"Poor higher level management. Do not seriously take time to understand customers. The individual contributors, by and large, were very pleasant to work with."
good,"As projects Manager we were assigned projects related to Bank of America. Typically IT infrastructure projects."
good,"Its kinda Government company where job security is 100%.........."
good,"Work Life Balance is good"
good,"No proper job allocations, no job security you might be allocated one job and later moved to difference profile very frequently.  No proper management"
good,"Overall, HP is a decent place to work."
good,A true corporate company in all stereotypical regards. Was glad I was given the opportunity. They do have systems in place which helped with on-boarding.
good,"HP tem ótimoa recursos para funcionários, atende os suportes mas falta em comunicação com seus trabalhadores."
good,"A typical day at work we start from scratch to finish the product to be sold to the customer. I have learned in many areas within manufacturing. Management is more or less friendly. The culture within the work is healthy, there is companionship and work is done to achieve the goal that is to satisfy the client. The hardest part of the job is that you have to work many hours standing and not rotate people so that the work is not repetitive and in turn do not make mistakes in the workstation."
good,U just have to do the same things Everyday and every second although u will be released early or as Long as the stocks are finished
good,"HP was a great Company at one time, it has gone through many changes trying to find itself. Once HP split it is no longer a total technology provider but has bits and peices"
good,"low salary, high stress job, performance rated by customers via phone survey, low potential for advancement, healthcare is good and vacation time is good"
good,"Typical workday in this role will require early hr office meeting and late night resolution meetings. "
good,"Working in HP feel like working in big family. Although workload is heavy, There are many things to learn and many fun activities."
good,HP is a company that is has strong foundation on ethics & diversity. It's been struggling for several years with some poor acquisitions. I'm sure it will get of out these perils.
good,I have worked for hp for 13 years and I am leaving because of pending redundemcies I would recommend hp as a good place to work there's is ample scope for promotion
good,I worked for HP for many years. Politics at higher level decided to outsource business to Singapore even though US manufacturing was actually cheaper.

good,He aprendido que es muy importante dar un excelente servicio al cliente.
good,"	Extensive experience in configuration, deployment automation with various App Servers like Oracle Weblogic, Web Sphere, JBoss, Webservers like Apache, Tomcat and more modern Web Containers like Nginx etc."
good,"very good company initially, known as retirement company - but heard not anymore."
good,"HP treated me well. I would frequently travel to clients and they took care of everything. Management was approachable and generally aware, but opportunities for advancement were few and far between."
good,job wasn't too stressful. job security sucks being contract worker. Some people sign 5 year long term believing after will be full time. but never happens. Pay remains the same as first day started.
good,"Enterprise level helpdesk within a high volume call center, Troubleshooting and give guidance to high end clients as to the proper installation and configuration of their servers, warranty replacements, customer service, sometimes long technically challenging calls, high stress as complete corporations were relying on the timely repair of their servers, troubleshoot all server peripherals including printers, storage arrays, all RAID arrays, etc"
good,"Helpful colleague and fun work place, but there are a lot of sub task beside major work, and too many night conference calls. Sad to say Increment is very little due to company is not doing that good in the past few years."
good,"People are great, corporate culture at low level is nice. But it's all leftovers from the past. "
good,"No proper process and work alignment in few projects."
good,"Very good work environment but need to stay back and stretch shift timing during Year end close and month end close. "
good,"Excellent exposure for application development procedures, strong engineering repositories, standard background development provisions"
good,I use to love my job and the people I work with but we have a new site manager brought over from Dell who is only interested in pie charts and bar graphs.. Things have not been the same since the split..
good,The job environment was quite rough. People not open to sharing. Salary was appalling. Career growth was stagnant. All in all not a very good working culture.
good,"HP was an enjoyable place to work.  I was part of Digital Equipment Corp and then Compaq, and then HP via mergers.  I loved my job serving customers and found great satifaction in resolving customer satifsfaction issues."
good,"HPE continues to be very focused on ""Best""-Shoring.  Shipping jobs offshore causes employee morale to deteriorate.  Opportunity for working in a variety of technical environments is a big plus."
good,"HP is a good company to work for they try and take care of their customers and employees.  But current and previous CEO level employees have made bad decisions for the company affecting stock holders, customers, and employees"
good,Good company.  Great Management.  Nice place to work.  I was in New business developement.  It was a really fun job.  Talking to customers in a consultitive position to uncover issues and help them to put a solution in place to make them more efficient.
good,"HPE is a great company to start out with. They offer a plethora of learning opportunities and resources. They offer easy networking with co-workers worldwide. The groups often support a family style environment. They do not offer competitive salaries that keep pace with any other company. You can grow your knowledge base there, but cannot grow your budget. Job stability is also quite questionable."
good,Great work life balance but lacking in organizational structure and accountability.  People are kind and helpful for the most part.  Management can tend toward micro-managing.
good,Giornata lavorativa full time. a diretto contatto con il pubblico. Gestione clienti e informazioni relativamente ai prodotti Hp sia in fase di promozione che in fase di vendita. Ambiente di lavoro dinamico. La parte più piacevole del lavoro riuscire a soddisfare i clienti sotto il profilo informativo che di acquisto del prodotto.
good,"Company is undergoing tremendous cost pressures.  Driving mighty changes in historic HP Way culture.  Many employees still remember the ""old"" company so some of the culture remains at the employee level."
good,"Despite laying off tens of thousands of workers and splitting into two entities, HP is still too big and ungainly. There still is not a clear vision for the company or a sense of optimism for the future. This makes the company a difficult place to thrive."
good,"The company has a lot going for it, but the ""old"" mentality continues to drag it down.  Too many people afraid of change, and upsetting the apple cart, for fear that they will be fired."
good,"Have enjoyed working at HP and now HPE but the company does not invest in nurturing young talent and providing them with the exposure, training, job security and salary incentives to keep employees."
good,"My tenure with HP had been truly amazing. I was fortunate enough to always be surrounded with fair management, helpful colleagues and ample opportunities to grown inside the company."
good,Some processes are hard to control with such a huge company with teammates located in other countries. Don't expect that your Manager or IT will setup everything for you when you join.  Everything is do-it-yourself. Some racism experienced being the only foreigner in the Singapore-based team. Time in/out and lunch breaks are not monitored. Able to work from home.
good,"HP is looking for young, hungry, bright resources!  I learned the SDLC and about Sales Compensation and progressed both skills and salary alongside other hard-working bright individuals."
good,With this company I learned that you can do anything you put your mind too.  Creativity is encouraged and the opportunity for growth is endless.
good,There are great people at HP.  Collaborative work force.  Work with people worldwide.  Opportunity to make a difference.
good,"It was an awesome place to start your career, i worked for 3.2 years for HP and it was amazing journey with nice colleagues and good work environment and had been great team mates."

good,"Long work days"
good,"Atendimento em lojas sem maiores problemas, com vendedores atenciosos. Aprendizado interessante na parte de treinamento e conhecimento da marca. Nenhuma ressalva a respeito de superiores. Equipe organizada, de fácil acesso. Alguns gerentes não  permitiam o treinamento oferecido em suas lojas. Parte agradável se refere ao fato de atender vários locais, com oportunidade de conhecer inúmeros perfis de clientes, vendedores e mesmo gerentes."
good,"Overall, I had a great experience with a lot of multi-faceted functions and diverse groups. It was fun to see how everything meshed into a giant enterprise that we tried to keep afloat. I was part of various SWAT teams dispatched to either plug leaks or develop new processes to improve the overall lethargy that develops with any large organization, as it tends to entropy, per natural law. Frequent change and renewal were the keys to continued success."
good,"Providing client satisfaction with the help of very supportive management, working alongside team members willing to go the extra mile to meet customer demands"
good,The co-workers are a joy to work with but are always willing to help. There is some room for advancement. The managers are pretty fair. There are a good amount of holidays off and although the healthcare is expensive a lot is covered.
good,"You get to work from home which was a huge plus. I now have additional skills I did not have before. You never see your co-workers. All communication is done via ""IM"". Numerous meetings."
good,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services:"
good,Was able to help start off a service desk for this company until the client wanted to go in-house with their own IT employees.  Thus the job was eliminated.
good,"Splitting the company into 2 parts will be a significant opportunity for growth.  The overall business will continue to grow, especially on the enterprise side."
good,The climate within your Enterprise is different from the rest of the company.  There is little offered in terms of opportunities for growth.
good,Seems the days of a lifetime job are over. QMS processes make sense. Most everything else does not. Don't spend all your money if you work here. You may need it someday
good,"A HP é uma empresa que possibilita a construção de uma carreira nas mais diversas áreas do segmento de TI. Possui um portfolio de produtos e serviços reconhecidos no mercado e equipes técnicas extremamente competentes."
good,"HP is a good company, am really happy to working with HP environment, Am just looking for job because of the promotion and salary...."
good,"productive environment,  homeoffice was a pro. It was a place where I got a lot of experience in datacenter and many others"
good,"First level management delivered direct and understandable focus on desired work output, but upper management did not build on results produced."
good,"This job was hard because you were dealing with the public who was in need of assistance and you didn't always get to give good news to the applicant. Managment was horrible, they didn't really care about you, they cared more about themselves and the company."
good,Professional work environment and easy going colleagues. Opportunity to implement new ideas and procedures. Always learning from peers and instituting team moral.
good,Own your career and align with the right people that's how you can do well.  A job well done and pride in it does not take you far.
good,"I have had some amazing opportunities over my career.  Learnings abundant, and many wonderful people.  I appreciate all that was provided for me along the way.   With the upcoming company split, it is time to find a new niche."
good,"Technical support for HP Autonomy is a high-octane environment, where young IT professionals can build a plethora of skills.  There is constant collaboration between customers, developers, and technical support.  "
good,Employees are not motivated at all. Large majority of employees feel  they can get away with not meeting deliverables deadline.
good,"The culture in work is good, the colleagues are nice, but in my opinion the country where is situated the company is not good. I am telling this because of my international experience."
good,"Excellent hours to suit lifestyle."
good,Job is reneveling the contract of software product Management good with employes Job is a routine work which i did for whole year no improvement learn anything
good,Tested and learned new operations daily. Moved around in different departments learning new things. Meeting new people daily. Learning all about servers and how they work.
good,"En esta empresa existe la posibilidad del trabajo remoto, lo cual permite tener calidad de vida. Especialmente para aquellas personas que estamos con hijos en pleno crecimiento ."
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo pero la dirección bastante deficiente
good,"If you have the right skillset and are under 40 years old and can constantly evolve you will do OK.  Otherwise keep your resume up to date and build up your personal network of contacts.  Regardless of how well you do your job you will stand a chance of getting laid off sooner rather than later.  Reorgs are frequent and don't make any sense. HP lost what made it a special place to work, it's like any other big company now."
good,clock in and go to our assembly team lines. we put together products with computers and tools needed. anything that did not work at the end of production goes to the repair team. we troubleshoot and fix it.
good,"HP fue una de las pirmeras marcas que vi cuando empece a laboral, es una marca solida la cual te da varias oportunidades para crecer."
good,"You are Overworked, receive Low Pay, Alot of activities to be active withing the company and communities, Provide alot of training opportunities,  Alot of opportunities to move up but are limited to move to different departments, Benefits are good."
good,Great place to work to get experience during the summer. However it is required to be flexible what means no static timetables
good,"All the people from the co-workers, supervisor and management was enjoyable to work with and very helpful. I enjoy everything about the workplace"
good,"HP has some of the most highly skilled and dedicated people in the world. They are innovative and take on big problems. Unfortunately, most of the leadership is held accountable to numbers that are barely in their control and therefore odd decisions take place that may not be in the long term interest of the affected parties."
good,"Learned a lot of different things with different people.  Across the board, customers say that turnover is too great."
good,"I would come into the office and attend meetings for the majority of the day. I worked entirely remotely with the rest of my team. My coworkers were all great to work with, pleasant, and dedicated employees. Management was generally good, but changed very frequently."
good,Met lots of genuine people and worked in several positions within the company until I started to work from home.  Most of the IT jobs have moved overseas.
good,I worked for HP for 10 plus years and the only thing that remained constant is the upper management was never in touch with the people working for them. The company never seemed to have a clear direction and would sell off profitable parts to make the stock jump even if it was for a very short time. Always late to the party with products as well. Sadly the upper management seems to still be the same and I feel like the company is headed in the wrong direction. Rather then investing in the employees HP has the been letting people go and with high levels of talent and experience and using there documentation to train cheap labor from over seas. The service has suffered and there prices are just has high so repeat customers are looking else where.
good,"Like any call center environment, there are always challenges of people not working, taking extra breaks and not answering phones. Call centers are not for everyone, but is a great place to start for additional experience in the IT Field."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, se trabaja directamente con el cliente para coordinar y gestionar proyectos, clima agradable y gente con muchos valores. se viaja aveces y se aprende de las culturas"
good,"Flexible and challenging working environment"
good,EDS was the company I worked for.    EDS was a service provider not a hardware company.  Always being worried about the stock price is ridiculous.  Always Always worried about layoffs after you gave everything you had to building the organization.  Good for entry level folks
good,A lot of room to grow if you are willing to put in the work. HP is an international company so know you will be working international hours. Meaning 7 am and/or 8 PM calls.
good,"Poor management...3 managers in 2 years."
good,"I loved each day i went to work,learning was enormous helped me gain knowledge on fields like presenting before a crowd, work on tight timelines. "
good,The company recently split and is undergoing internal restructuring.
good,"Learned key skills like people management, work under timelines and work under pressure, improving qualities of assessing technicians"
good,"Worked at client location, very difficult to handle client's need. No support from Management. Resource has to struggle on invariable requirements to get things done which will strengthens the negotiation skills"
good,"Average on work life balance"
good,I am good at networking when it comes to deliverables. Feel comfortable with working with various resources whether an associate or manager. A self motivated person and always delivering the targest
good,"If you want to work for a company that is flexible in terms of work/life balance this is the place for you.  However, if you value opportunities to learn, or to progress in your career this may not be the place for you.  Performance is not rewarded/recognized very often."
good,One of the best places that offers working experience and acquiring both IT and business domain knowledge.
good,"Relaxed, laid back culture. Friendly kind co-workers. Many career move/change opportunities."
good,"There was a lot of maintenance  on desktops, laptops, all in one computers, tablets,  LaserJet, DesignJet and Latex printers and firmware  upgrades. I have to provide technical support in order to achieve a smooth run of production and driver updates. Working with all of are clients to make there problem solve in a timely manner."
good,Great experience leading large multinational distributed teams in delivering industry leading technologies and delivery systems.
good,"Catch plane to customer site to gather requirements and prepare contract, schedule and project plan.  Project manage opportunity after securing resources.

good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Dont bother. They are planning 50k layoffs this year. The team I worked with was great, and the manager was fantastic. As a whole though, the company has some major issues."
good,Work with good people.  Everyone works hard and wants to do a good job.  Lack of work/life balance makes it challenging to maintain a constant positive attitude.
good,"I enjoyed my teammates and the applications we delivered.  There is little work-life balance in the org I was part of. Past two years have been constant overtime with little downtime.  New paradigm is to shift all Development of applications to the Global teams with no Development resources in the US. Entire US team has been WFR and new project work has been reassigned to Offshore resources.  While I understand cost-cutting measures, it appears that the Management Level in the US are continuing to increase, while the Talent is being shown the Door.  Leaders are following the same road that did not work for EDS, but has been recommended by consulting firms - I feel that this same plan will not work for HP either, but the talent will have been thrown away by that time."
good,The company is well organized for project development and delivery
good,"The work in this company depends on the account that you are in. As for me, my account supports 24/5 so my team is on shifting schedule to cover this. I was able to adapt to different kind of shifts such as morning, midshift and graveyard shift. We also need to adapt to the clients working schedule which is in the US and India. So no holiday for us. The good thing about this company is that they provide work from home option. This WFH option can be availed once a week with a day of your choice. The people in my team are mostly fun to work with and the management too. I think the hardest part of the job is the shifting schedule and lack of trainings too, but nevertheless, the working environment provided makes up for it."
good,"	Administration & Maintenance 350+ Windows servers operations in London, Wynyard, Canada, Mumbai, & Bangalore datacenters."
good,Typical day at work here is pretty much show up and get it done.  I work on 3rd shift so work social life is very limited which translated to very productive with work.  The hardest part is keeping up with communications and new procedures.  But that is also a part of my job to be able to communicate well between shifts.  Most enjoyable part of my job is I do find it peaceful and very productive working on 3rd shift.
good,"too much buying companies, leads to too much re-organization."
good,"Its a good company to work in."
good,"Normally very busy work day depending on Director's schedule with travel commitments depending on the business."
good,I have learnt a lot of things here and now its times to learn more and know about the much more opportunities
good,"Ambiente de trabajo aceptable, salario deseado. Dificultad de Promoción y dificultad de gestión."
good,"Based on not creating business strategy, the available positions are getting narrow. Besides, organizational changes are made so much which is a big obstacle for meven mid-term planing"
good,"This job is always changing as you have to know a many different technologies. That is a good thing, it keeps you sharp and up to date on the latest technologies. As for co-workers their are more like family. We travel 75% of the time so we are on the road quite a bit together. We live together. It makes you a close knit group, even if you bicker, you are still close. Just like a family. We work well together and are there for each other as needed. The travel is both the hardest part and the most enjoyable part. We go all over the world, but that means we also have a quick turn around so that is not always fun. When you have to fly for two days to get somewhere and then work 10 to 12 hour days all week and fly back for two days. Just to do laundry and re-pack to fly back out. That is the hard part. But sometimes you get weekends in between if you have a two week trip somewhere. That is the nice part. Management doesn't also remember how hard traveling 75% of the time is, but that is also part of the job. We just talk it out."
good,"HP as a company is a company striving to find growth within at any cost even to the point of getting rid of personnel in the hope of saving money and having other people cover work that in most cases, incumbents or successors have little or no experience in that given area. HP's positions compared to other similar company positions pay far far less even for very technical people which is why i wish to move on."
good,"1) Its a nice place to work, good friendly environment. "
good,"contato com equipe para soluções de dados e voz "
good,"The first thing I do before starting my shift is prep my work area making sure I have everything I need. What I have learned at HP was how to properly put together and disassemble severs properly and how the warehouse functions as a whole. I have been threw several supervisor at my time at HP, I'm not exactly sure why that is, but I assume it had to so with upper management, something out of my control or understanding. I enjoy work with some of the people I have worked with at HP, it was a rocky start at first, but as time progressed we learned to understand and work together. The hardest part of my job is how sensitive the product is and how extremely. I really enjoy the people I had the chance to get to know on a professional level and some of the products I had the chance to work with in the time I was there."
good,You can achieve work life balance by working with this company. They provided a lot of training to develop new hires and existing employee so that you can keep up to the market requirement.
good,the work pressure is unreasonably high. management is changing too often creating a lot of uncertainty.training is very good.the job was never boring.
good,"HP was an awesome place to work. the Company was very focused on Career Development and the growth of their employees. I was able to make lateral moves to leverage my skill set and was also promoted to a higher position as well. Unfortunately, my biggest concern with the company was career stability as I had been laid off previously within my first year of employment with HP. I didn't feel as secure as I would have liked to even though I was rehired in a higher position after a month. The second lay off occurred after a total of 3 years with the company when the entire Conway Call Center underwent Work Force Reduction. It was a bitter sweet ending but Overall, I wouldn't trade my experience and knowledge I've gained from HP as a whole."
good,"Call customers and discuss cases"
good,"Have to be able to work on our own, Must be intelligent enough to trouble shoot electronic  surface mount technology down to comp-nit level and able to do surface mount soldering."
good,"There's a mix of full time, contract, and intern employees.  You have typical work hours, though can be flexible depending on team. People are great if you find a good group, though some people are just miserable.  There are lots of politics but it's manageable.  There's lots of bickering between product marketing and engineering teams.  It's great working on products that get used by millions of people, though there aren't many perks that standout."
good,"HP has been a good company to work for with a strong commitment to supporting clients and delivery excellence.  I developed many leadership, client management skills, and industry knowledge during my tenure with HP.  My co-workers have always been knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  The hardest part of my job has been maintaining stability for my staff as the book of business continually changed.  It was important to me that the team not only had work but that the work was challenging and rewarding for them.  The best part of my job was the exposure I received to so many clients, industries and customer needs where I was challenged to develop solutions and build the teams to delivery them efficiently and effectively."
good,"A typical day at work for me was competing to be the best. I learned how to test, build, and wip computer units. Some of the managers didn't recognize the good employees they only recognized who talked to them the most. My co worker were great to work around I enjoyed working with these people, and i didn't meet anyone who I disliked. The hardest part of my job was learning how to build the next generation servers. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to work, and knowing that I was going to be at the top of the list by the end of the shift."
good,"OK place to work at, just wasn't for me. They talk a lot about career development, but I was never given the opportunity to advance my career, despite other contracts wanting me on their teams."
good,"If you are in Global Service Delivery - than it is good. If you aspire to be a better person, this company will teach you many new things and give you the opportunity to learn. "
good,"There is always work to be done and taking on more work and responsibility is always available. Many of the business units still function very independently, such as Enterprise Services (formerly EDS). Great work environment and corporate culture, but don't expect to get your foot in the door and get a raise later. Negotiate your salary up front and get what you need or don't bother."
good,"There are good and things about every company. I cannot say too many bad things about HP, though if you ask the right person, they have more than a few things to be upset about. I have been with the company for over four years now and am just looking for something new. I am not one for doing the same thing for more than a few years because I believe that you become stale mentally without change. "
good,"A typicalday at work is sitting in a chair taking phone calls all day from educated professionals all over the New York area. I learned how to use new programs and software, that enabled me to help the business professionals. Management was rarely seen by the employees, but were there if anything went wrong. If you needed help on a call, sometimes there werent any managers on the floor, which made work a little difficult. My co-workers were awesome, though. I got along very well with others, even made somw new friends. The hardest part of the job was when a proffesional would call and need help with a particular software issue or siteissue that unfortunantely we werent trained on, but what made this the hardest part was when you couldnt find a floor lead or manager to respond in the chat room, and they would be unavilable at their desk when help is needed. The most enjoyable part of this job, was that I got to speak with different people in another state, and while helping them on the call I was able to build some type of rapport with them. To me that is amazing, even though we arent face to face, makes it also worth while when I fix the problem they were having."
good,Would have loved to had this position train an employee of the standards and procedures of being the most effective asset possible.
good,"En un día típico, se seguía el planning estipulado para cada empleado ya que era un contact center, se realizaban las tareas de emisión de llamadas según las campañas vigentes."
good,HP provides a respectable work environment with some opportunities for growth. There are much politics involved behind the scenes but up front tends to remain friendly. Unfortunately the pay tends to be below industry average but as long as you show up for work you will have a job. The work is inside in a AC / Heat provided environment which is a quality benefit to most but overall working at HP is only what you make it out to be.   
good,HP was great. The management was awesome. The advancement wasnt really there and I would say the hardest part of the job was talking with NYC teachers and administrative staff
good,Salary is a issue with their vendors. Management is complicated to work with
good,"I would start my day by attending meetings; work with the project manager, vendors and client.  I would document what my projects involved, time frame requested, vendors that would be needed, contact info and what was requested from the customer, along with what was expected from me, from start to end of the project.  I learned that no two projects were the same.  Management had an open door policy, co-workers were always very helpful and available via instant messaging.  The difficult part of the job was when we would have a freeze in the work force with no advance notice delaying all the jobs, forcing a domino affect in rescheduling everything.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and seeing all the pieces fall into place."
good,"Learned strategic thinking and planning, working with cross functional teams."

Every day I lear new things for my experience and education, one of the important things that matter to me is to see our products at end customer side on time with quality and low cost."
good,"Little Opportunity for Advancement, not a learning environment."
good,"Aprendi muito com a empresa adquiri conhecimento na área da informática, porem como a empresa terceirizava serviço para a vale onde o fluxo de atendimento é alto onde a HP não possui funcionários para atender a demanda de serviço."
good,I was working on average 70 hours for not very good pay. Management was all over the place and getting a constructive reviews was difficult. I enjoyed learning all about e-commerece and different technologies. My coworkers were good at their job and hard workers. The hardest part of my job was getting sleep or getting reviewed on my work. My coworkers fear losing their job with layoffs.
good,HP is one of the best place to work. Amazing work environment.
good,"Worked there for 15-years. For the past 10+, it's been a culture of layoffs and doing more with less. Employees are expected to do more, and their work often suffers as a result."
good,"A Good company to start a career for fresher,"
good,"HP Hewlett-Packard is a very pleased work environement company, where the co-workers are very professional and helpful,"
good,Tudo o que aprendi da parte de métodos e processos foi graças a Hewlett Packard.
good,Working here you become the jack of all trades and you do not get compensated for it
good,In HP you have no limit for thinking and coming up with new ideas. A fun place to work with few good leaders.
good,"I was in the Pack Out Department .As soon i report to work i would do all my test through the test box..Then restocked on all the materials i needed for that day.. first i would load the unit if noone was able to do so. I would do the power testing on the unit before the final audit was done..also i would inspect the unit with their methods through the computer.. After that i would scan out the unit and give the materials the unit needed to get shipped out with..then came PV2 to scan the documents out for the unit to be complete..Management was respectful,caring and reasonable.My co-workers were good, helping team players and honest people.. There really wasn't no hard part in the work ethics.Everything in the job environment was pretty easy..The most joyable part of the job was learning the work place..meeting all the new people and also, the fact that i had the opportunity to learn all the work experience i was able to learn.."
good,"bunch of old guys from the 80s waiting for retirement. No career advancement, heavy glass ceiling. no new ideas are encouraged. If you are a young graduate look elsewhere."
good,I learned a lot during the last 7 years while working for the Microsoft account.
good,Grew complacent and impatient with lack of promotional opportunities. Work was monotonous.
good,"We at HP are going thru some extremely stressful times with losing resources, BAC Contract unknown, our jobs not secure. Everyday is a firedrill."

good,"Job was worth the investment, hours were decent and pay was excellent"
good,I believe that I have shown to be dependable to the company that I work for.  And the company intern has shown loyalty to me by entrusting me with important tasks In which I have been rewarded when successfully completed.
good,I had a company car that I used to drive to each location to assist with their hardware.  enjoyed working with my customers and seeing them happy. It was an honor to serve.
good,A diverse and efficient based company. A open and friendly work environment to employees as well as members of management. I would recommend this employer to future candidates.
good,"Overall not a bad experience."
good,"Used to be a great place to work but now company seems to care more about the bottom line than employees. in tech its just about the metrics, in sales its just about the numbers. There is not much balance"
good,Nice place to work. Enjoy working with my team. I have a great manager who supports me in my daily job and advises me to help me to continue to grow in my current role and as a person.
good,"Hi All,"
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo buen relación laboral con supervisores.
good,Decent place to work with fantastically talented people.  The HR and Management sides of things can be challenging at times. Workplace culture depends on what contracts you work and if you're at HP or embedded at a customer site.
good,"Professional support from all the different IT Towers. Outsourcing to DXC was difficult, salry dropped and working conditions dropped. I would not work for DXC anymore"
good,"orario flessibile, ma no straordinari se non precisamente stabiliti col manager."

good,"- Ability to switch departments and pursue different positions "
good,Most of the HR work was around monitoring attrition. The pay wasn't that great. Most of the work was virtual so there was a loss of human connection. I hope things have changed.
good,"Employee friendly company, right profile can give a good break. technical profiles are paid more compaRed to functional roles."
good,very professional place. good culture and knowledgable folks. good career growth. commute is difficult sometimes but overall excellent place to make a career start
good,"I enjoyed my time at HP and advanced quickly. Wish that there were more full time positions instead of temporary, this is the reason I ended up leaving."
good,Fun workplace with great campus. Some teams and projects are good to work on. You get enough time to explore technologies and also at the same time balance fun and fitness.
good,"Good place to workSecurity Subject Matter Expert -New Account startup"

good,It is a place full of people who are cooperative and willing to work with others in order to get the job done on time and efficiently . The management team were encouraging.
good,Hewlett Packard has a vast global reach. From the multiple government contracts to global security to internal audit. The possibilities for career growth are endless.
good,"HP was a good place to start (I was part of an acquisition) for the first year after the acquisition, then HP tends to get in its own way.  It buys good technology but doesn't invest in them after."
good,"My job was to manage the people who installed the HP Enterprise equipment throughout the Southeast US.  The equipment was servers, storage, networking...all the equipment that was installed into the customer's data centers.  The territory was NC, SC, GA, AL, FL, TN and small parts of MS, KY, AR and VA.  We were very busy.  HP was selling more equipment every year.  The best part of my job was experiencing the growth our my team in terms of wisdom, handling customers and gaining technical skills.  The second best part of the job was meeting with our customers and discussing what HP Services fit best with their goals.  The worst part was the amount of time that the job required.  My work/life balance was far too heavy on the work side of the equation.  As I matured in my role I was able to get the work/life scale closer to balancing.  But there were always times when the scale would lean heavily toward work.  Especially as HP kept having Work Force Reductions (layoffs) reducing not only my staff but staffing nationwide in the services sector of the business.  But as a manager you know that changes such as that are always possible and practically a certainty.  So you learn to adapt and teach your team how to adapt.  And how to become more efficient with your time and how you manage your time and your customers.  "
good,"The printing division is a shrinking business.  Frequent layoffs, very low if any raises, high pressure.  The company used to be much better.  It seems like management has a very short term focus."
good,"very loose work conditions. Dress inwhatever makes you comfortable, within reason. Grow hair/beard as you wish as long as it is kept neat."
good,"Realmente como empresa es buena, sin embargo la cultura con las consultorias es pesima. No hay crecimiento y poca motivacion."

good,"Cela fait suite à un rachat, une bande de pote reste toujours une bande de potes."
good,"Worked with a lot of good people there, most of whom have been since laid off. Company needs to decide what it can build to make a project. "
good,the company has made severe cuts to canadian workers over the last 20 years and intends to continue to best shore as much as possible.   dxc will likely not be an entity at some point in the near future as more staff are moved to other companies.
good,"HP is where my career journey began. I held a variety of roles there, beginning with finance and ending with technical training. I would not be where i am today without the experiences and life long friends I gained working at HP."
good,Productive place to work in... Lots of travel and lot of training available to train with. training depends on the particular contract and the requirements vary per contract. you will work alone and or with a team also depending on the contract that you are working with. Dynamic culture.
good,"fun to work every day"
good,"Shift timings didn't suit me. there was no scope of development . Learning scope was very minimal ."
good,"I don't have much to say about this contract position that I was on for a few months several years ago."
good,"Its a good place to start, if you do not have any IT knowledge, after the training that you will receive, you will be in a good shape."
good,"With all the changes, from leadership on down, very hard to stay focused at the company. It felt like each week entire groups of people would be let go as part of the restructuring."
good,"Worked here as a contractor due to higher than average pay. Training was fun and it reinforced my love of HP products.  There was no input on job performance from TL's and I never did find out why I was let go. Kindo of disturbed me.  Biggest goof they made while I was there was making it mandatory to work on Super Bowl Sunday, when they rolled out a new product at halftime.  They had over 600 agents signed on, and took maybe 7 calls."
good,This needs to be filled out in order to continue through the process.  HP seemed like a good place work.  they acquired personnel from EDS and retained our seniority time.
good,"I didn't work there for very long, so take this with a grain of salt, but the factory floor was definitely not an environment I enjoyed. It wasn't very colorful or friendly inside but I suppose that's to be expected for the kind of work. It felt a little rushed at times and sometimes I think that the speed at which they wanted units put out wasn't possible for good quality. But, as I was only a contract worker for a short period of time, I didn't really have a lot of time to take in many details."
good,"Constant layoff, people more focus on be let go than there jobs. No guidance or training. You lean on your own and as you go. workflow extremely busy."
good,"The people were OK for the most part, Seemed to constantly be promising advancement but never materialized. A bit underhanded employment strategies. Employ while they can and dump you when they no longer can."
good,"during my time, HP underwent three CEOs, and I myself had at least that many managers.  much upheaval did not translate into good working conditions.  Since then, the company has spun off divisions, and split into two companies."
good,"Retired from HP. A good company overall, but the company did not appreciate much of their work force and how dedicated the employee was to HP, especially the last 10 years of my employment. Would I recommend working for HP? Hmmmm. Not sure."
good,"More opportunities should be provided for the employees to dig  in new technologies and shift in to a new fields. "
good,"Lots of knowledgeable engineers worked for HP, it is a nice place to work there.  Strong technical support from the other groups are satisfied. If you can integrate yourself with people in power and show that you can be social during work and after hours, you can do well here."
good,Anche se non direttamente ho lavorato per loro tramite commessa...é stata un esperienza bellissima
good,it's a fast phase environment connected with multiple department which works in a organized and strictly follow service level environment. overall good experience.
good,"Great Working Environment."
good,I thought working for HP would be a dream but turns out its just a regular company that just happens to manufacture devices. A typical day has about 3-6 calls from sites within your assigned region. Troubleshooting calls are the worst because the printer could be obsolete models to unresolved issues that HP hasn't found solutions to. There isn't really a master handbook but you have to use your judgement using individual manuals downloaded to determine the best remedy. Supplies are kept in your company van but its definitely overkill as some parts aren't needed at all. It can get extremely stressful when you break down a printer and discover more hidden problems that causes longer time at a call. This isn't the job that you want to work overtime since the traffic in Atlanta is additional hour once you clock out for the day. The best part is when you go for some basic training at one of the headquarters in Boise. That place is like its own HP world! I would definitely work there rather than field support that's entirely mobile.
good,"I liked working on different accounts such as the auto company, banking, health care, and government."
good,"The team and technology was exceptional.  The challenges lies between conception and delivery.  Overall, it was an awesome opportunity.  The cultures drive the technology!"
good,"Otima empresa para se trabalhar, principalmente se souber aproveitar os beneficios de cursos e aprendizado para o desenvolvimento profissional. Porem a remuneração é muito baixa."
good,HP corporate provided operational and customer support opportunities.  working with VMware and simulating customer IT environments was valuable for my future suceess.
good,"Decisions still made by the old guard of Hardware people despite what they say about the importance of SW."
good,"Good working environment , great co workers. Benefits are good educational assistance is available. easy to advance in you job role.."
good,"The HP Culture could be different instead of the same, depending upon the account that you are on within HP Enterprise.  I was on a start-up account which was very challenging and exciting in the beginning.  I had about 4 different Managers during my 4 year tenure with the last one being a micro-manager on a small but popular account.  There was very high turnover among IT Engineers and mature workers were replaced with the younger workforce to increase P&L, unless your skill was in high demand.  It was a good life learning experience!"
good,The job wasn't exactly hard the only thing was i was laid off because i missed 3 days before my 90 days were up but i had a doctors note from where i took my child to the hospital and was still fired. No understanding and no compassion strict .
good,"I was a okay, wish they told me when I was can. It was not always easy to send the costumers to the right department. I also think that I was more educated on computers"
good,"A Empresa HP é muito boa para se trabalhar, mas tem seus pontos ruins assim como todo telemarketing"
good,HP is an ok company to work for. As usual it depends on the team and it's leadership you are working with. The pay and benefits are on par with the IT industry.
good,"It's a job not a career. You get to make your own hours (kinda), the hours are not there unless you want to travel a lot. Working with the store employees are weird since you are a part of their job but not a member of their team."
good,Gran interacción a nivel internacional y gran flexibilidad laboral
good,"good food and plenty of choices for a good price, but not nearly enough people or time to clean the place up. Containers often return moldy, and food is wasted."
good,"Very little room for progression"
good,decent place to work good job to help you get started.  only downside is you start out at minimum wage and you have to work there for a year before you get a raise.
good,"This is asking me to review Hewlett Packard.  That is not the company I worked for or am referencing in my resume.  My position was with HP Products, a janitorial supply distributor."
good,I basically performed administrative duties for a group of 10 ladies. The job was a no brainer and I didn't enjoy it. It was a job. I always longed to have a graphic design job and this just didn't cut it.
good,I was able to work from home.  The hours were very flexible.  My team was global and was able to handle all our issues over the phone.  Very collaborative environment.
good,Large global company with opportunity to grow career across multiple industries.  You must take ownership of your career and advocate for your next growth opportunity.
good,"Verifies accuracy of incoming shipments by comparing items and quantities against documents."
good,"It been a long time, since I worked there. I heard they have changed the company structure. It was a data entry operator job and you have to be able to sit for long periods of time."
good,"high turnover, lack of leadership, too much office politics. Things that would take a week to get done at a SU would probably take months or sometimes years here!"
good,I am not able to say much about HP. I was outsourced to HP from Citigroup and all my job responsibilities stayed the same. After 1 year with HP they laid off all of the Citigroup employees.
good,it was a fun place to work we had a good group of people but they went out of business we did wen hair products and proctive makeup we had to look at the dates to make sure they weren out data we had to wear hair nets and beard nets
good,They were laying off people 20 and 30 at one time as the layoffs continued I was doing the job of 5 people with no raise. I decided it was best for me to walk away.
good,"They can throw whenever they want and make employees suffer.No respect for experienced people, manager takes all decisions of even throwing people without any hr consultantation. Forget about growth and hikes it's worst."
good,It wasn't a bad company to work for; it's geared more for individuals straight out of college. I just felt like I was never going to go anywhere and decided I had to pursue other companies.
good,"Transformation overtime blurred company Vision. Multiple management changes and not so smart strategic decisions, transformed a great organization into an acquisition target."
good,the job was travled alot and seen many diffrent areas as well as met alot new faces if it wasnt for relocating i probably would have waited it out and seen what became of it
good,"Great place to work. Great company to work for. There should be more learning and development opportunities for fresher's, new joinees and middle management."
good,Les gestionnaires travaillaient en sortent que nous puissions être productif et on pouvait apprendre de nouvelles choses.
good,"HP was a good entry level position, but facilitated an environment that would put it's employees into mind-numbing routines. It also took a lot of time getting the newly hired resources placed into projects."
good,"I traveled every week, it was fun to travel to other countries, but the time away from home and family didn't balance out.  Being single and doing that job was ok, but not for someone who was married."
good,Working for HP had its benefits working for a large organisation with a  good reputation. I would certainly work for them again if I had the opportunity.
good,Your experience depends on the team and management you are under and work along.  The environment can be relaxed and fun but there are some that do not work well with others.  Some are more strict than others.
good,"There were times when I needed assistance in solving issues, the team i worked with will collaborate on how to resolve the issue. This was an everyday occurrence."
good,"There was a lack of information and process that I needed to get my job done. In hindsight though I learned how to be more vocal and clear about what I need."
good,"Happy about half the time, but not much opportunity to grow or be promoted within.  Excessive workload and lack of alternative opportunities, and coaching/mentoring by management."
good,"I have no input to give this company was not a good place to work for but management was good"
good,"Collaborative environment, with work life balance.  Growth potential, co workers focused and ready to help you navigate the upper management demands and culture."
good,Typical company but has lost much technical prowess in the last few years due to unstable leadership.  The executive team failed to propel the company as a technology leader.
good,"Overall, the company is pretty decent.  Some management is right there in the field with you, others you'll never see.  Job security is a real issue though.  You're always waiting to the axe to fall again.  I survived three mergers before being laid off the first time.  After completing a huge project where our team was constantly traveling, we had yet another layoff.  It seems the upper management doesn't look at the people they're letting go, you're just a number."
good,HP is great company for mid and senior management aspirants. Focused on processes and reduce manual tasks. Depend heavily on escalation metrics and support.
good,It is a good company.  There are a lot of interesting technologies.  Business process can be enhanced.  People is great.  Commute is bad from where I am driving from.
good,"Leider hat sich HP entschieden, sich vom Mainframe Business (und den Mitarbeitern) langsam aber sicher zu entledigen und sich auf die Drucker und Toner Produktion zurück zu besinnen. Wir wurden deshalb obsolet."
good,Various project work. Inclusive culture.  Mentoring COE.  Working with various cultures and colleagues. Good middle management. Innovative environment. Virtual team management
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, gran manejo de procedimientos."
good,While working from home was great.  There was absolutely no advancement within HP and not only did they not give a raise for years but they actually had everyone take a pay cut.  So I ended up making less when I left than when I started.  While the CEO took home millions.
good,"Contract work. I performed a data analysis project for HP's EG Pricing Team. This was a contract position that I convinced HP product manager in Poland and Houston, Tx to help them global analyze sales data"
good,Very clean and organized place of business. I learned how to operate the SAP system. Hardest part of my job was staying awake because it was an overnight shift
good,"It was a very nice place to work for. The Line coordinator at this location taught me a lot that I still use til this day. The staff, my co workers, were very helpful and easy to get along with."
good,"I spent 7 years at he HP offices in Bristol  and found it a good environment to work in."
good,"Organização"
good,"Good experience as a Technical support, enjoy your work together with your co-employee. This company gives you a lot of opportunities to gained knowledge about printing solutions."
good,"10 year HP veteran, part of EDS acquisition.  There were pros and cons to working at HP.  My boss was great.  I found however, that the company had gotten too large and had lost its competitive advantage.  I also felt that it was an overly insular company.  That all being said, I do not regret working there or my experiences and skills learned."
good,"Lot of job to do, have to be organized. Solve issue and find solution all the time. Need to be flexible. don't count your hours and you won't get any compensation"
good,"started work as a contractor with Digital Equipment Corporation and remained with company through transition to Compaq and HP.  "
good,I haven't worked at HP for over 15 years.  It would not be fair for me to give feedback regarding current cultures and work environment. I do not feel that my experiences from 15 + years ago would be helpful.
good,"Great place to work here as a fresher"
good,"Well organised work culture with constant agile teams that continuously provide efficient and timely services to customers. Healthy work ethics along with various fun activities and a very pleasant and valuable learning experience.respect for people."
good,Good place but not the great place to work. Mostly hardware oriented and they dont care much about software people. If you are a software guy please dont apply here.
good,"Gave me good experience.  Enjoyed working with the customers, but not all of my work associates.  HP continues to downsize and may shrink itself out of existence."
good,Many employees lost their jobs in the US only for the jobs to be sent off shore to other countries.   These employees were committed and dedicated employees who deserved more than this.
good,One of the HP departments created a group of contractors to migrate their databases. I was mainly doing SQL Server migrations but also got to do a couple of Oracle RAC migrations
good,"I worked remotely ... so missed the collaboration with employees, but the pros side it was no office politics. The other con - interaction with my Boss was only in meetings or performance reviews. Therefore, I felt i was not evaluated properly for my work and didn't receive the salary increases or bonuses."
good,"My time at HP was good. Very flexible work life balance. Had the opportunity to work from home when needed. "
good,hele goede ervaring gehad in de periode tijdens mijn weerkzaamheden
good,HP was in a time of transition.  Leadership did not understand the job we had been tasked to do.  None of our supervisors had security expertise; and were slow to learn.
good,"Good company, good people. Limited stability. Moved fast. Executive team was a rotating door.  Progress was measured using metrics but we did a lot of Power Point!"
good,"Cross Functional Communication needs Improvement.  Ability to telecommute a plus.   Good facilities to work at, employees always willing to help, overall an okay environment."
good,"HP is a very fast-paced environment, but the collaboration among peers and departments, is very refreshing.  The transformation is questionable in my opinion, but hoping for the best."
good,Stressful at times but OK. I believed sometimes it was rumors the supervisory feed into but if I would put this on a scale of one to ten it would be a five
good,"Overall this company is a good place to work for a short period of time, the on site training is very useful and will be used for future reference with life skills and other jobs. However as nice and laid the job is it requires a level of self discipline to continuously keep busy. Also the communication over all between other shifts and other coworkers can be considered shaky and not balanced."
good,I learnt how to speak to customers professionally as well as gain necessary computer literacy that I believe will help me in my future job opportunities.
good,"Dealing with merging with other companies and lots of employees."
good,A good place to start for a fresher.  Timely review of performance and progress communicated to employees but need improvement in terms of management.
good,Tranquilo per no muy stimulante. Yo trabajaba por la publica administracion lo cual hacia que las definicion de los proyectos y la entrega fuesen muy lentos y tediosos
good,"HP has a positive work environment, and for the most part, good people to work with. Very few opportunities for career growth and continuing reduced budgets due to poor senior management decisions."
good,"Work / Life Balance is the best incentive that the company has. "
good,Hewlett Packard is an excellent company to work for! The work is very challenging.  However the work life balance and workplace culture are great.  Too many layoff rounds motivated me to leave this organization.
good,Great experience with wonderful people.  The best times were those spend in highly collaborative teams supporting clients to delivery projects on-time and within budget.
good,Liked my job very much.  However a reduction in workforce ended my tenure.  People were great and got along with them all.  Managemnet was a little lost on priorities.
good,Not such a great manager. Daily workload was mainly client oriented.  Ensuring orders placed by employees were properly documented and considered needed for their work.
good,"High pressure environment.."
good,Working at HP was very enjoyable.  Worked with very intelligent people and learned many things helping other companies reduce workflows and increase their spend ability.
good,"poor 401k matching"
good,"HP was a good company to work for. however, due to the wrong management decisions, the company went south started around early 2000. it changed CEOs from time to time but it never get back to the days before that time. Hope it will turn around soon."
good,"Constant threat of layoffs, lack of funding, etc.  Stressful and dysfunctional employee rating system.  Forced distribution for ranking.  Upper management is disconnected from employees.  Direct management can be good or bad depending on personality and ability to handle stress.  Lots of Asia travel for some engineers."
good,"Excellent and gained much expeience in SAP FICO module while working with different team i.e technical as well as other functional team member, with offshore and on shore teams."
good,"Had great life balance, a great experience and learned a lot, was hard to move up in the department I was in. Management was ok as well. Overall great work environment if you fit the culture."
good,"HP products was a family owned company while I was there, and it was a great place to work. they cared about the employees and took care of them. they have since been sold."
good,It was a great job absolutely love working for the company of heward Packard. HP is one of the greatest companies I ever had work for I love working there I love the people that work there
good,"Did not like HP after they bought EDS, they reduced our pay and gave no raises. they should of stuck to making printers and computer system. It service was not there specialty."
good,"1 HP Site I worked at was outstanding in every way as an employer.  When they sent the work overseas and closed the factory, I transferred to another factory.  It was terrible.  Most of the managers did not have a Bachelors degree or people skills.  What a difference"
good,"As a contracted employee, I found the work atmosphere on campus to be very professional."
good,"Work was always fun. Even though the work would be more but it was always good as the supervisors were friendly and helpful. "
good,"Service Now tickets for break/fix faults. Repair internal staff pc's, printers, software, reports. Conduct meeting with clients, third party management."
good,It was not enough support of Management for employees while work on GM site.  I learned working Unix servers and application support on the workstation.
good,Lots of changes due to mergers and acquisitions. I don't feel anyone ever feels safe at their job due to all of the changes and seems to come regularly.
good,"Its a nice place to work, very nice people, but rarely had fulltime jobs with benefits, and rarely give jobs with benefits only temporary jobs without benefits,"
good,I was responsible for line of servers that were deployed worldwide.  I was notified of all quality and design issues that were discovered in the field and it was my responsibility to implement design changes to prevent issues from reoccurring.
good,"Good life and work balance"
good,"Can learn as a fresher can gain experience with good support from the senior staff. "
good,HP as a company was going through a lot of reorganization that made it difficult to understand your position within the firm. Headcount reduction was rampant. Jobs were being moved to low cots countries.
good,Company was always going through restructuring and downsizing meaning opportunities were limited as was job security.  Since leaving the company has split and I believe the culture at HP Inc has changed but not so much at HP E
good,"Ambiente tranquilo dependiendo del día, arto movimiento y arta sociabilidad con los clientes y demás."
good,"call center oriented. talk to 400-500 people daily. work place has low moral and high turn over rate. hardest part dealing with angry, upset customers."
good,Empresa agradável para trabalhar e muito dinâmica.
good,HP laid off all their good people and are left with people working hard trying to do the jobs of all the people they laid off. Nice offices and cafeteria etc but they spend money on sponsoring racing cars etc and not on their employees and customers--they have their priorities mixed up
good,Good place and ethics. Have worked here more than 2 years. Would still wanted to continue but left the job for career advancement. Nice people and standards.
good,"good for women , flexible , good team , transparent , management also good , less salary hike  and promotion , politics , stable , job security .............."
good,"Working in Singapore HP was a good experience. Ability to make decision , a great place to work and understanding team leader. A wonderful experience over there"
good,Muita cobrança e pouco suporte pessoal. Empresa fria.
good,"Empresa de servicios telefónicos, con una elevada rotación laboral de los empleados."
good,"I was hired to do contract work here, but the place is no longer in business. The management was okay and the work environment was fun, but that had more to do with the people than the management/environment."
good,"Being a contractor with companies in America today. Some of the companies treat you like a second class citizen and that's for most of the companies that I've worked for these past couple of years. Dell, Intel and so forth."
good,"HP has great people and good training opportunities, however, due to mergers and acquisitions the culture continues to evolve.  Ongoing workforce reductions results in poor morale."
good,I was working as a tech support engg. on a payroll basis. They promised to make me a permanent employee within 6month but it's been 1.9 yrs and I'm still a contingent employee.
good,"I did not stay there long enough to make it work. When I was working for HP the economy was really bad and there were lot of layoffs and cutbacks. Therefore, it was not a good place to be."
good,develop SOA stacks for Oracle EID global systems for VM systems and global customer access gateways. coordinated with numerous vendors and contractors.
good,"A place to learn a lot.  Every day busy, stress environment but the days went fast.  The culture was changing with each account manager.  Hardest part of job was the client consistently changing the scope of work.  I learned so much in terms of technical language I have a new comfort level."
good,"stock count and general merchandising for stocks "
good,"Excellent place to work while the business was still based in the United States. Now, unfortunately, most of the manufacturing and distribution and support service jobs are outside the continental United States."
good,I enjoyed working for the company and working with the people.  A lot of long hours spent with little job work/life balance.  Job was defined around schedules.
good,I no longer have a typical day of work. I liked my job and direct management. The company is now as it has been for the last many years in the throws of reinventing itself.
good,"HP was a good place to work to get general experience in an Enterprise environment. I felt like there wasn't enough support from the company, and had to befriend some of the full-time break/fix techs just to build a support structure that HP doesn't provide innately. I had few complaints in my position, but I heard the full-time employees complain about the lack of benefits and poor work/life balance."
good,"same just like ibm , company think only about its growth & never think about the staff or employees, this is not good for company nobody can stay with the company."
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar porem sem perspectiva de melhoria de cargo!"
good,HP has gone through many changes over the past five years and is finally making a return to what it once was years ago. Not a bad place to start your career.
good,"It was overall a good company. With many smart and hard-working engineers. Unluckily, I was just assigned to a project that's not interesting at all and I ended up moving to a different company with more exciting projects and growth. I don't blame HP on it though, with the size of the company, sometimes individual can feel like just a brick in the wall with the limited responsibilities they were assigned to do."
good,Typical day would be running around fixing computers or making sure the vendernet was up and running. Always making sure users had very little down time.
good,The culture was focused on people as company treated employee as valuable assets.  Manager was paying attention to work with employee to match each individual skills with the tasks need to be performed.  Company has a systematic way to train managers to help employee to be developed to achieve individual career goal and contribute to company.
good,"A empresa está passando por um momento de transição e por isso é difícil avaliar sua situação neste momento. Costumava ser uma boa empresa com uma boa perspectiva de carreira, porém com as inúmera demissões feitas praticamente a cada mês ao longo de 3 anos deixou um sentimento de insegurança e falta de perspectiva."
good,"Higher management is at least prone to consider employee feedback from a ""working conditions"" stand point. I would encourage people who have a base line education and mediocre life to join such a company, and to stick on. Growth is a well recognized trait in the company."
good,"There are no hard targets"
good,HP was a great company that had to change it's focus in order to be more nimble and agile in the ever changing IT world.  HP made great products and it was wonderful to have a full portfolio - however I understand the decision to split the company into two and I hope it will allow both HPE and HPI to be successful.
good,With continuous lay offs the culture has dramatically changed creating a lot of churn and fear in workforce. Great people doing great things but sometimes decisions are made based on short-sighted quick fixes.
good,HP is a nice place to work. The environment if very friendly which makes coming to work a pleasure. The only bad part would be the constant fear of job layoffs.
good,"stress, fast environment working place.  There is not a good place to work for long term . Good working in AC, clean inviroment. The job slowdown on the first month of every quarter but a lot of work on the end of quarter ."
good,"I enjoyed working here but did not enjoy the pay. I unfortunately did not make enough money to continue working here. I did enjoy all the people I worked with. It was a fun, fast paced environment."
good,Amazing place.I miss it a lot. The culture is good.. dream company and lots of holidays. I wish to go back but only during retirement. My job was very basic so did not get to learn much
good,"Great place to work when I stated with HP, however, do to internal and external pressure, things became challenging.  The people you wok with on a daily basis are world class."
good,"Interesting place to work, with gym and ping pong tables. Nice and hard working people. Located near the Tulsa airport on the American Airline compound,"
good,"HP offers many ways to build your skill set."
good,Es una empresa muy buena en cuanto ambiente y cultura laboral.
good,Large scale agile software environment. The best part of the job was the continual challenge to keep up with the latest technology. The most interesting part of the job was working with multiple international teams.
good,Great place to get your feet wet in the IT industry.  Great to get experience but limited career advancement and training.  Work long hours without real compensation.
good,A good place for freshers. A great place to learn and enrich self knowledge and good part is Flexible time. Lot of Learnings. Encouragement by Management to learn and be productive.
good,Good Company to work for i Learn a lot from the team leads and  have received a lot of friendship in the process love the job but find a better opportunity
good,Good Starter job and helped me stretch out my sales skills.  Would recommend for a new hire and anyone looking to gain more knowledge in Sales opportunity.
good,nice working environment . people are generally supportive of each other. there can be conflicts also but should be less serious comported to other company.
good,Unorganized  management. Long hours and very few breaks throughout the day of working. Management steals half your check and doesn't pay you for over time..
good,"adhere to login and log out timings. "
good,"There is an overall feeling of unimportance felt by coworkers who are not upper management. You have those who make it a habit to cause confusion in the workplace in an effort to advance themselves. A stressful environment at times; however, the benefits are good."
good,worked in the ink chemistry lab and i felt like a kid in a candy store.  all the machines were brand new and the group was a lot of fun to work with.  will miss that job.
good,HP was a good company whilst I worked there however after the split I was moved into the HPE organisation so can no longer comment on HP as this is solely the Hardware side of the business now.
good,HP is nice place to work but pay is bad compared to market standard & its good for ladies/grils as company take care of it semployees well with its facility
good,"A typical day is Peaceful."
good,"After acquisition by HP, situation rapidly deteriorated. Huge acquisition very poorly managed. Computer world changing too fast for a successful integration of two extremely large companies."
good,"Most of the time, my department was under the threat of outsourcing, which caused some coworkers stress/anxiety, as evidenced by being by HP, ACS, and GSK while working in the same space. Management was located in Pennsylvania, so daily contact was below average. Communication with management was sketchy."
good,"You work that you may keep pace with"
good,"constant change was a challenge and always lots of uncertainty in the future of the company.  Seemed like this was business as usual to the folks that were still there after many cost cutting initiatives."
good,"learn Troubleshooting hardware and software as front desktop support ( Level 1 )"
good,During my time HP and Compaq was merging and the results were difficult to work through. Had difficulty determining one product line from the other.  :)
good,"HP has a range of technical support teams based on individual client requirements.  The role was mainly a support based role, but with exposure to other areas of IT."
good,"Digital Equipment Corp has been absorbed over the years by other tech companies.  Like any large company, entry level positions are a good way to enter the computer technology field."
good,"I enjoyed those investigation tests that are main part of my job. These enhanced my analytical skills. It's fun working with people from different departments working altogether to address a particular line issue. The job is quite fulfilling in the end as you get to see how it benefited the people who relied on the results you have given and the whole company, indeed."
good,"Good company, Job security, but work culture differs for capitive and bpo process. Less percentage for appraisal and no work life balance."
good,With my time in HP I never learnt anything apart from transactional work and too routine kind of job in which I was not learning anything and it was quite dicy situation.
good,"-Considers the Employee opinions"
good,"Nice Place to work, which involves entertainment as well as work."
good,"Joined EDS initially but HP acquired EDS."
good,"Typically I am called upon to help customers with existing problems or design new solutions including the plan to migration from old to new networks."
good,"Frequently changing requirements"
good,"Automation and Component Testing"
good,"ros"
good,"Great place to work, I worked in HP only for 2 years, good place to work with. Salary benefits are quite low compared to present company, no flexible shifts."
good,"productive environment and good team spirit. However the upper management is disconnected with the workforce, somewhat chaotic. "
good,"HP is one of the few orgs out there that allows its staffs to work from home (flexible hours), which works well for those with families and is a pro. Con is the ever changing organization structure, which seemed to be never ending and giving the sense of instability."
good,"çd delivering quality service and support. Excellent communication skills, enjoys challenges and is able to prioritize a complex workload to meet deadlines. Able to work unsupervised under pressure and a good team player, with flexible approach to work and an eye for detail."
good,"Excelente empresa, o convivio era muito bom, oportunidades de carreira, beneficios eram otimos, programas de reconhecimento, ajuda de custo com curso de idiomas e pós graduação."
good,"A international company with challenging job and work-life balance work place. I work in R&D center, launching consumer notebook."
good,"This company has been split in two, and no longer exists in this state. I worked for the enterprise side, which is no longer part of the HP brand, and is now HPE."
good,"The job I do is entry level there is room for advancement with specialized knowledge, database management, project management,  Technical management,  but like i said you must come in with this education to make a career here and as we all know technology changes fast so it would seem to stay competitive you will need to stay in the know about enterprise technology, plus corporate policy and procedures.... sounds like more schooling to me."
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"I have learned also of technical  skills from HP you will get experience in different are like functional  , performance , automation and security ....."
good,"Big name with solid products, but be prepare to move around as many initiatives. Work culture is solid with many processes in place to follow, but many opportunity to be creative and make a name for yourself. Relocation and rotation is possible."
good,"Todo depende le la cuenta y del jefe para una estancia cómoda en una empresa, realidad no tengo de que quejarme, solo deje la empresa por un mejor salario y por mas estabilidad laboral"
good,"This company was great for many decades.  Now they are struggling to understand how to make money in the newest reality.  Their traditional markets are shrinking,  margins are dropping and competition is better than ever.  They are lay people off,  selling units off and outsourcing processes all in the name of the bottom line.  No question the bottom line is critical.  But they still advertise great service and support and it just isn't true.  Culture stopped meaning anything years and years ago.  Still lots of good people who work hard every day."
good,Less work pressure how ever learning was also very less. Mostly people enjoy working over here. Salary part is little below the belt but there are other benefits.
good,"During my typical workday, I am responsible for overseeing any server escalations and incident tickets with pending actions. I check in and help our team with any issues they may be having such as doing owning tickets that requires secondary escalation. I keep in touch with clients, update them on our progress towards providing solution on their issues and make sure they are satisfied with the solution we have provided."

good,"Learned a great deal. Had to self-teach, be assertive to obtain knowledge. "
good,good experience and new skills. The atmosphere was welcoming and appealing but sometime could be difficult dealing with some individual. Excellent work and management procedures
good,"-Busy work shift from beginning to end"
good,"learned to face new challenges,"
good,"HPE has grown into a company that is Management heavy, and not enough skilled people to get the job done.   The atmosphere  isn't one based on customer service or customer satisfaction, but one of bureaucracy.  They're an excellent manufacturing company, but have failed in their service oriented businesses."
good,I have achieved phenomenal results in workflow processes and provided excellent customer service support by gathering information and performing duties in a professional and precise manner. Quality assurance and providing top-notch technical support to firms and its clients is always my primary focus
good,It is awesome to work for HP.  And the environment is awesome.  The work was challenging and fun.  We had a release to complete for every 4 months to include Waterfall and Agile Environments
good,"I enjoy the time I spent at HP, INC gaining wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of different equipment. I met some life long friends too. I worked two specific accounts Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of America."
good,"Fast working environment, friendly and easy to catch on. Just like most warehouses. Its typical, the manager is nice, just got to get accustomed to standing up for a lot of hours. If you can get past that then you can work here."
good,5 days a week and 8 hrs a day. Learned about data processing and communicating with clients. Co-workers are helpful. The hardest part of the job is resolving clients issue and solving that and convincing them
good,"Lead team of developers in developing a cloud based IAM offering. A typical day at work includes , working with developers in troubleshooting sessions, developing roadmaps and other business and technical artifacts and in general accelerating the project forward."
good,"HP's culture and need to have a perfect plan before doing anything was so frustrating. So much effort and money could have been save in my time there if they could have adopted Gen Patton's philosophy in that ""a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow."" But then I am a dreamer."
good,"HP Over Hires and pits people against each other using a ranking system that eliminates the lower ranked people every year. Unfortunately, this does not promote collaboration, something that is sorely needed when developing complex systems. If you prefer round tables over square tables, this is not the place for you."

good,"Since the company split, management roller coaster has followed. Most of the team are hard working and honorable individuals, but the turnover is taking its toll. The corporate decision to hire college level individuals during 2012-2015 is really contributing to the dilution of knowledge and experience to complete any task efficiently or effectively.  Too many people have left the company for internal systems to falter and become unstable."

good,"I belong to a small insurance software company that was bought by EDS which in turn was bought by HP. My unit did not receive support from HP as it was not its mainstream business so it was left to crumble. In the end, the software that the unit developed and sold to quite a number of insurance companies were left with HP's India unit."
good,"Just so much work to do, work overloaded,  to go to work and do your job.  Management never talk to you, if you have a problem they weren't there for you.  Going to work and no one talking to each other.  I am sorry, there was nothing enjoyable about the job."
good,"Overall fair exp however, not fast-paced enough and sluggish in decision making process because of the size. Typical corp America struggles. +1 for being an industry leader in some sectors of the IT industry."
good,I am a full time contractor for Allstates Consulting Services at HP. Both the Roseville and Palo Alto locations have great attributes. There is an overall positive vibe which allows for a great work experience. HP was a great place to begin my journey in the IT field.
good,"In the last months that I was at HP saw many changes, and a lot of talent in my area dismissed or forced to find new positions."
good,"HP was a great place to work before 2000. Since then it's become your run of the mill large enterprise. HP Corvallis is unique in that it's the largest tech employer in a 40 mile radius so employees hold on to their jobs regardless of the situation. This combined with the fact that the site has been laying people off for the last 15+ years, means that there is very little turn over and there's not a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,I was temporary so I will say it was a good job while it lasted and they tried to help me get hired permanently but it didn't happen. So I had to find something else with benefits.
good,HP has good people and for the most part a good culture.The objective of upper management isn't always clear. It doesn't always feel like work life balance is a high priority.
good,was providing quotations to the hp customers about our own products.we process all the requests within the tat that shows our level of accuracy.
good,"Job was enjoyable."
good,HP bought EDS. There was not much change and then was transitioned to IBM when HP lost the contract with Ally Financial (Old GMAC Financial).
good,It is what you would expect. You are on the phone in a corporation. Just another cog in the wheel. Management was alright.
good,This is my first job. Here my growth and promotions are really going good. I have more time learn many things. It is a very nice place to work and I have learned many things. Now this movement is completely for my carrier growth.
good,Every day is a learning experience because each day there maybe a different problem that you will have to deal with. I have learn to stick with doing something physical that will not ship overseas.The management was easy to get along with and work with. My co-workers will a great group to work with even thou I train all of them.The hardest part of the job was getting stuff together for the drills. The enjoyable part of the job is not having anyone looking over your shoulder.
good,"The company afforded me many opportunities over the years.  However, recently there has been a lack of mobility and advancement."

good,Support numerous accounts on variety of scheduling applications.  Perform metrics and reports to management on findings
good,very fun and comfortable work environment. Co-workers are very easy to get along with and managers are cool and down to earth and easy going.
good,"It's a mixed bag, all the good things about the company have a bad counter part.  It is pretty obvious from the news that the senior executives don't really care about the employees or the long term of the company.  However most mid-level managers are actually pretty good (compared to other companies that I have worked for).  "
good,"The toughest part here was cleaning up legacy stuff. Lots of politics, stress and pressure. Any mistakes made were easily used against you to make you look down. Evnetually, things got sorted out after a new management took over. Currently, things are running quite smooth here."
good,"Good environment to work with friendly work culture, but the sad part is the remuneration earned which is not at acceptable to the amount of work delivered."
good,"aprendi informações na area de hotelaria de turismo a se comunicar com o alfabeto fonetico , aprendi muitas coisas interessantes , sempre me relacionei bem com as pessoas e não tenho do que reclamer ."

good,"Lots of layers of management, often not necessary; Good employee perks; onsite gym and health center at headquarters in Palo Alto;"
good,"Overall HP is an excellent company to work for.  Being a global entity, HP has one of the most diverse work force in the IT industry and it draws from an immense pool of talent to ensure its competitive edge.  Working at HP has been a great learning experience for me.... Management is very supportive and fosters a ""Can Do"" attitude.  HP  Is a very big company, so change comes very slowly and constant training is encouraged.  The job can be very stressful, but rewarding and there is never a dull moment.... Very fast paced environment."
good,Corporate ownership and state red tape caused unnessary claims processing delays. No room for advancement. Low wages for type of work performed.
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but our product growth became stagnant and we were not able to keep up with the competition. Those in management were good people, but could have done things more effectively."

good,this is a friendly place to work where everyone can work hand in hand to achieve common goal. The management very supportive about their team members achievement. you can grow and develop new sets of skill in this company.
good,"I joined HP to support a multi-year Network Outsourcing deal, first as a contractor, then a year later, worked for HP directly. When I joined HP, I took at 40% pay hit for the same work I'd been doing as a contractor, but as an employee I did receive benefits and paid vacation. I REALLY liked my HP direct Manager and my 2nd line Manager; had very little contact with those above that level. My peers were also seasoned professionals. Many had come from EDS and were verbal about how the company/their job experience had taken a dive after EDS was acquired by HP, but not having had the EDS experience, I was generally quite happy at HP. That said, I trained a LOT of overseas people to replace me, as HP tried to lower their resources costs (this was very expensive in the end!). My main complaint with HP was the feeling of being on a sinking ship, given the announcement of future job cuts in the US.  Also, the CEO seemed to be unnecessarily vocal in the political sphere - I received monthly email asking me to support a conservative cause or donate to a PAC fund, yet as an employee, I had signed a required doc saying I would not use my company PC, time or efforts to support political activity... Anyway, it was a good gig for several years, until the contract was lost to a lower-cost provider."
good,"About the numbers as is the case with all big businesses fighting to maintain market share, the little guy sometimes feels squeezed."

good,"Networking"
good,"Each day was busy with managing many projects at a time and making sure to meet the scheduled completion date."
good,A typical workday starts out with checking email received from the previous evening. The work day transitions to multiple customer conference calls and creating documentation.
good,"I like HP! Is one of the places where people are encouraged to give their best, are respected and encouraged to develop. I can say the company had a great influence on who I became in the past 10 years. And this is mentioned in the positive way. Here I learned to learn from mistakes, to develop myself and to elevate my skills, to create and appreciate value wherever I work. Also, HP has offered me the framework to learn management and quality and also to appreciate people around me more."
good,Management does not take action when risks are presented. On conference calls 70 - 75% of the day managing Teams across the globe.  Hardest part of the job is not being the Direct Manager of your Program Team members.  Have taken various conflict management/resolution classes which have helped motivate Core Team members.

good,"Was my first time working as a contract worker.  It was eye opening that contract workers are not treated like full time employees and I did find that a bit unfair.  I did have the opportunity to work with very friendly people.  Typical day consisted of examining mass storage units created for Microsoft, Cloud, Bing, Facebook and other companies to ensure they were shipped with no errors."
good,"Resolução de problemas que vão chegando com chamados."
good,"Trzeba uzyskac pozwolenie menadzera, aby moc zmienic dzial, ale trudno go dostac, gdyz zawsze jest niedobor zasobow ludzkich."
good,It was a temp agency. You had to come in to find out if you was working if you wasnt working you had to go home. It was a typical job. You stood over the product and package it if you met the quota or beat the record on it you get free stuff.
good,Management is good and supportive. But there is not much scope for growth. Salary is decent but can be better. Company has a history of mergers with lot of other companies which results in lot of organizational changes and job/pay cuts.
good,HP Enterprise Services ultimately emerged as an integrated business unit combination of the predecessor legacy organizations.
good,"It is a great company and place to work.  Laid back, flexible hours, salary is okay.  There is opportunity for growth and training to move up in the company or move into a different position."

good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, pero no actualizaba los solarios de acuerdo a la inflación que hay en Argentina."
good,"My current job role specializes in First Level IT support. I have been in my current job role 4 years and believe I have achieved many goals since working with HP. I deal with customers on a daily basis averaging 40 calls per day. When logging calls it is my duty to assigned SLA agreements depending on severity of incident and manage the incident until completion. Any incidents not being dealt with in a timely manner within agreed SLA’s I would escalate to my manager to follow up further. I also check other queues in addition to my own in case agents are absent and manage their incidents on their behalf. As our client was DWP and we manage over 140,000 staff members we are constantly busy and every day is a new challenge. I have had to learn to adapt to various different communication techniques for users who aren't technically minded and advise them just from verbal communication how to resolve their fault. I receive excellent quality, technical and soft skills feedback from all incidents logged by scoring above 96%. I am more than willing to provide assistance to colleagues should they require it with any technical queries they are unsure of. I am highly driven within the technical aspects of my current position, and I deem myself to hold a high level of technical knowledge.  I am always keen to learn new technologies. "

good,"	Work with Project Managers to complete resource plans, WBS, and financial plans"
good,Work-Life balance is good. Promotion  / Career progress is a bit slow
good,"With companies as large as HP you are just a number.  When an employee has questions regarding benefits you have no one in the building to speak with you are just given a phone number to call. It is very impersonal.  The work is all about meeting numbers and quotas, even though there is suppose to be customer service in the job skills.  The job I had ended and I received a severance package."

good,"- A day is just another normal day "

good,Success at HP depends on your location - go to Houston if you want a career path or job security.
good,A typical day at work involves troubleshooting issue over the phone or by email. I have learned a lot about administering a network. Management and co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy each customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that a customer is satisfied by the help that was provided.

Also, there is also alot of red tape to get things done or approved.  Also, one division, ES, is still treated not as well as that divisions that are HP employees.  The entire ES division has not received raises since 2012.  While HP, non ES, employees have gotten salary increases."

Everyone in the US simply cannot be lawyers, doctors, engineers and scientist. Whomever believes that needs to read the emperor's clothes. They simply cannot sell to people that do not have jobs.

good,"When I started at HP, I felt secure in my position and the possibility of advancement.  As the years move on, HP began a long-lived cycle of workforce reductions.  This cycle changed the atmosphere of everyone at HP and caused the morality and innovation to decline quickly and dangerously."
good,"Only worked for HP a couple years after they bought our company.  transition was smooth and culture aligned well. In the time I was there HP had not really ingrained themselves into our area.  "
good,"At the time, HP was undergoing massive changes including a merger with another corporation.  As a result the culture was in flux and the pressures for performance were changing, as well."
good,"I dnot want to feel nostalgic, HP was a nice place to work. Now we need the innovation that are going to secure the company future, let ''s get back to an innovative company."
good,The job at HP was very demanding there was very little down time. This was not a problem for me because I love to keep busy and thrive from a fast past environment. The hardest part of the job was attending all the meeting. Office space at HP was limited leaving people packed together in small areas. However I love the culture and and enjoyed my job.
good,"Typical day: Working through requests for special pricing."
good,"Working at HP is very nice, some of my best co workers are now from HP a very interesting work place to work, lack of opportunities to grow in Medellin."
good,Organization with lots of potential but has not meet employee or market expectations.  Lots of change over years and continues to struggle with market identify; punctuated by numerous acquisitions and spin offs.
good,Top management is popular.  Company needs to provide more collaborative work environment for location diverse teams.  Some people like working there and some don't at all.  Turnaround an issue with newer and younger employees.
good,HP provided a lot of opportunities to gain experiences in different industries and technologies. The benefits were good and HP stressed a well balanced work and life culture.
good,CEO and high level executives were struggling with sales and would cut employees to satisfy stock market.  The market was changing and the leadership was looking to split up company.
good,"Quality and customer satisfaction about products  is the main goal."
good,excelentes instalaciones con cafeterias areas de recreacion etc el comedor cuanta con comida muy deliciosa y el ambiente laboral es excelente
good,"The first step in my career was with HP, it has the amazing culture to embrace people and nurture them."
good,HP Inc is a huge company. There are a lot of teams working in many domains. Over all work life balance is good. Learning and growth really depends on the team you join.
good,"working your cases"
good,"Hewlett Packard has undergone a lot of changes in the last 10 years, or so.  Cost cutting and restructuring has pretty much made the company unrecognizable to HP veterans of old.  Since I wasn't required to move to one of the centralized offices before I volunteered for workforce reduction, at least my work/life balance was good there at the end."
good,"* O dia a dia de trabalho, corrido e com prazos como em qualquer empresa multinacional"
good,HP  is very structured.  They have good benefits and invest in their employees. There is room for advancement but constant layoff's and management changes.
good,"Store visits"
good,HP provides me many opportunities to advance in my career and grow professionally. Create benefits and a good environment. There is a collaboration spirit between teams.
good,"Good company to work from culture and people around. Compensation wise to its great with yearly hikes at good rate."
good,"Lot of changes which happen internally with HP.  Leadership firing/hiring happen.  Cost cutting, means you may lose your current job in the current business, however IJP could be of help.  However, in 2017 HP has gone through lot of changes, which I think will be beneficial to the Organization, Partners, and the Employees."
good,"Hp enterprises is a business driven company, where time means money for them. Every manager I worked with had some pressure from their seniors which directly was transferred to us."
good,"Not people friendly - company is less interested in keeping quality employees than saving a buck. Putting in almost 20 years, thinking you are improving your value to the company is ""rewarded"" by being placed higher on the chopping block."
good,I enjoyed working with external customers and selling as part of a collaborative team.  Learning about the IT industry and its ever increasing changes over time was quite invigorating.
good,"In a fast paced work place with constant changes made by the client it could be challenging at times.  Helping the insured and providers understand the insurance and claims process made my job worth doing.  Teaching new hires the job and see them succeed  was even better.  The hardest thing about the job was telling the insured or provider that their claim was not getting paid due to policy and procedures set forth by the client."
good,HP provided an opportunity to work across several different client accounts if you wanted. The people who work within HP are some of the most talented and positive contributors I have had the opportunity to work with.
good,"CEO of HP did not know how to effectively incorporate the acquistion of EDS, a software & consulation company into a culture where the main focus was product (hardware) sales."
good,"- Trabajar en incidencias de facturas de compra, siempre en el ordenador."
good,"Being Productive, learned to handle things in a team. Most enjoyable part in learning/training. Now I am supporting automation, it was a real great thing."
good,"Enjoyed conducting training and sales techniques, no opportunity for advancement.  Frequent turn over of employees including management, I decided to start my own small IT consulting company."
good,"Working at HPE has given me opportunities to work closely with the business . Although , the work got mundane and there were no opportunities to move to other teams/build new skill sets."
good,its a very good company for employers and familier enviroment there.company always helps if we need anything.time management was very good.company always care about there workers.
good,It has been many years since I worked for HP but what I read from recently laid off employees indicates that it isn't the same company it was when I was there.
good,"I worked for HP for about 3 years and left because leadership within my organization is dysfunctional, too many cooks are in the kitchen too many duplication."
good,Very little chance of advancement.  Their process for reviews is not conducive for advancement.  They say that they dont have a fixed rating but you can not get a rating that you deserve.
good,"pretty relaxed work environment with good work/life balance"
good,"I started my career in HP as promoter and worked various roles very attractive environment within the company ."
good,"Part of and acquisition, so never applied. Once Hewlett and Packard had left the company in the very late 80's, HP went through extreme changes and not all were positive. Great upward mobility and the pay was good too! But the new CEO hired after 2000 just was a disaster for the company, divisions and people."
good,"Had a nice experience working for Hewlett Packard, the overall atmosphere is nice , the management is good and you get work life balance. But financially not a great place but good place to learn lots of different things."
good,"HP Enterprise is a good company to settle down. It is an employee oriented company unlike others. I would not suggest a fresher to join this company. Once you are in, you would never want to come out of here."
good,"Flexiblabiltiy in the schedule. "
good,"Gathered good knowledge in customer service skills and management skills."
good,"Last years were tough in HP during the split of company and creation/merge of new ones. This brought a lot on uncertanty to employees and impacted pretty much the performance of a lot of people. I believe that after the end of this huge changes moments, maybe HP will offer real career plans to employees again.."
good,Expect long hours but also good returns. HP rating system depends on how well you step on your peers to get to the top of the pile. Good benefits and frequent layoffs.
good,"Foi um dos melhores empregos que tive."
good,when i joined in this company as a fresher i don't have that much confidence to continue the job . but later when i was working for one year i realized that there are so many challenging factors came while i'm working .so my teammates helped me a lot to gain the knowledge.
good,"typical contract breakfix position.  no room to advance as they don't want to pay benefits.  it's easy for them to let you burn miles on your personal vehicle.  lots of good exposure, though, as a new IT tech."
good,"More casual environment but they never stopped adding things to your duties that weren't part of the original contract. Never once do they offer to increase your pay for all the extra tasks expected regularly of you. They also tell you they will move you up when the position opens but never do. When you start to ask why, they fire you without warning."
good,"Great work/life balance. Excellent benefits. Limited opportunity for advancement. The employees are great to work with, and management is very accessible."
good,"Great place to start a career. Friendly and transparent working culture. Less pressure from the management, most enjoyable part of the job is less time constrain, as long we done our job everybody happy."
good,"Job Insecurity, to many changes in management. A typical day at work was very stressful. the management that was put in place had no knowledge what so every about technology and how it was being applied at the different sites assigned by Ford Motor Company."
good,HP is a good company which is facing a terrible time when it comes to its finances.It has a great culture but its people managers aren't very competent.
good,"HP is one of the best companies I have ever worked for, the management is supportive and creativatilve, they allow you to grow as an IT professional.  The company is going thru a split now just is unfortunate but great place."
good,"Very good work exposure, endless learning opportunities if you challenge yourself to take on new things. The management encourages job rotation as well. Ideal for entry level."
good,Great pay and benefits. Management team isn't necessarily local. In 3 years my management changed 3 times. My co-workers were from around the world which was really great.
good,"I liked to work. HP is all new but little confident as I had 1 year of experience in the same profile with ADP."
good,Good place to work at with great people!  Unfortunately jobs were off-shored and HP didn't have other local job facilities.
good,Hp is a great place to begin your career however most software development teams do not keep up to date with industry standard processes and technologies. Do not develop in an environment you cannot transition.
good,Every year for 15 years they would go through layoffs. Always reorganizing. To keep from getting sued some of the layoffs were complete random with top rated people getting fired.
good,They take care of the employees well and try their best to make the balance between professionalism and keeping it casual so well.
good,"As a Program manager/strategic planning with senior managers my key responsibility  was to  create business plan based on the team discussion and bring in technology to solve global distribution of product content."
good,"Flexible Arbeitszeiten sind positiv zu bewerten."
good,HP is a progressive company that has been in trouble for a while. It's got a great culture and decent products but now split in half. The work life balance can be good depending on the role you have.
good,"A wonderful place to work if work life balance is important, excellent technology company and wonderful products .. A good sales organisation to work with .."
good,"It is a good place to work with fun where you can have job security.salary is not that much high comparing the competitors."
good,"On-site consultant for the Navy, working with older technology. 10 hour days were depressing. Co-workers were not very friendly. If not familiar with internal procedures, management belittled you. Was glad to get laid off."
good,"Great environment,lovely people,multi-cultural.Great team of co-workers,angry and unprofessional customers make the job harder but the cheerful environment gets your day going."
good,"Great company to learn and grow initially.  Can become difficult to move around to various jobs.  Also, sales comp can be a pain and it takes awhile to process claims.  Process improvement is slow."
good,"Poor leadership, poor organization and project management.  Heavy reliance on contractors instead of full time employees."
good,"HRM   is a organizational function that deals with issues related to People such as compensation, performance, employee motivation,"
good,"I interned at HP at a weird point in time. They had recently experienced a number of reorganizations and layoffs, so the workplace culture was apprehensive and disimpassioned. Aside from that, were very fun people to be around. If inkjet printers were more of a growth industry, everything would have been great."
good,The co-workers are the best part of the day but the full time employees are worked very hard with very poor time lines.  The management is very laid back and doesn't express interest in helping you grow as an employee or person.  I was able to learn multiple systems while I was there but the operation system is very outdated.
good,Great people with some excellent technology. The work security and advancement is lacking. All in all they are a good company to work for.
good,Productive place to work that equips you with skills you can take anywhere.  I learned alot and met alot of great people in my tenure with this company.
good,"Running daily report ( pass-down)"

good,"Hewlett Packard is great for cross training you in other areas of the business.  They believe in keeping you informed with regards to the latest company updates."
good,"La formation débute dans un local. Le formateur nous montre beaucoup d'exemples, mais la matière reste fort théorique. Pas de cas particuliers en rapport avec le travail que nous serons amenés à faire."
good,This was a great opportunity that ended abruptly with a lay-off of 500 people. I wish I still worked there because the benefits were outstanding.
good,"great place to work, good benefits, however, too much of decision-by-consensus making it slow and stodgy..."
good,Expectations are demanding and workloads have increased due to staff cutbacks. Focus on offshore engagement for revenue savings.
good,"HP was my first Multi National US based company which was best place to work and enhance the knowledge.In my 4.9 years of experience @ HP I learnt many thing in terms of business knowledge, how to make customer delight, how being a good team player and also execution of task with in the timeline."
good,I enjoyed lots of my previous company HP.each and every people in my team all are help full any condition. I left that job because of my contract period completed .
good,Excellent colleagues to work with and great team work across various regions. Good clients to work with/for that understand some of the difficulties in providing services in the current environment.
good,"Un día típico consiste en aprender más sobre la atención a clientes y el seguimiento de trabajo en equipo. Esto es lo que aprendí. "
good,"Overall, the HP was a good place to work.  Unfortunately, the company was so large and bureaucratic that I believe the executives lost touch with the needs of our customers and our employees.  It seems that no one in the higher decision making positions sought to balance the needs of the share-holders with those of the customers and the employees.  It seemed as though the senior leaders thought of the employees as disposable tools based on the number of people that were released by workforce reductions (60,000 in two years is the estimate)."
good,"Well stabilized work, not much hassle for anyone to start up and Good place to enhance skills,but end of the day what you take matters which is not much appreciate."
good,HP is a great place to work for IT. Whether you are entry level or advanced there is a place for you. They look to hire within before reaching out to outside resources.

good,Multinacional que no se enfoca en el desarrollo de su personal o del país

I have been in Hp for nearly 5 years, it has been tremendous place to work, lot of things to learn and explore, I personally feel Work culture in HP is really amazing, working in morning shift, co-workers are really good and helpful. only drawback is pay package, as  history says, HP was never a good pay master. otherwise its a best place to be in."

good,"Good company and great co-workers.  Some managers would do well to have more training in managing people, but have good technical skills."
good,Got a very good learning platform for Packaging as I joined the company as a fresher. Was able to maintain work-life balance with the inital management but was difficult with the changed management. The co-workers and atmosphere were good.
good,"Es una empresa que permite el crecimiento profesional y el aprendizaje. "
good,"I joined HP in 2005, under the CEO leadership of Mark Hurd. The focus then was upon excellence, and exceeding customer expectations. While technology was changing daily, and HP had a few wins and a few losses, there was a constant drive internally to be more than our competitors. It was the greatest work stress anyone could hope for, as all departments were working equally hard to make things happen. "
good,"el ambiente laboral es muy competitivo, apesar de esto logre manejar el estres, obtuve excelentes bonificaciones, por mis ventas, aprendi bastantte de tecnologia, computadores programas impresoras. mis compañeros de trabajo son seres humanos magnificos,lo mas dificel  es manejar el estres, de no vender, lo que mas me gusto mis bonificaciones y todo lo que aprendi."

good,"Good Work/Life Balance, not very good Compensation/Benefits."
good,"After 15 years in this industry I don't think I could have chosen a better company to work with. However, not having worked in any other company I have no basis for comparison. Perhaps now I will have an opportunity to make one."

good,"En el departamento que he estado la mayor parte de mi estancia en HP se basaba en un trabajo muy dinámico, ya que al ser atención al cliente de una entidad bancaria, continuamente teníamos que estar al día de los nuevos procedimientos, campañas...y realizando una formación continua en cuanto a productos financieros para poder facilitar una información clara y completa al cliente. Era lo que más me gustaba de este trabajo, ya que este tipo de conocimientos son también muy valiosos para la vida personal. "
good,"Ok but pay very low. Nice co- workers, and we play ping pong game every break time"
good,"Malgré de bons produits et une nouvelle stratégie, le EMEA management et middle management sont bien incapables de redresser la barre, ce qui coûte des points marge  , des emplois et pas d'investissement."
good,HP has been very good to me but working for a large company means you will want to specialize in a role.  If you live close to an office you'll need to go into the office but if you're fortune to be remote you can easily telecommute.  I have been telecommuting for 8 years and it hasn't impacted my job growth.
good,"Company is great with a quite relaxed working environment. Only problem, the company is too relaxed. People are sitting at the same position for ages. No one thinks about changing, moving (Change is good). Decent Salary hikes are rare. Promotions are rare even. An amazing company if you plan to settle in and spend next 3-4 years doing same job. Not for you if you are the adventurous types."

good,"Was nice working with HP, was not super busy and was pleasure working with HP Clients"
good,"this is a good place to work, with good benefits. it's just hard to move out of my department to one that pays more., "
good,Iconic tech company.  Very ethical.  Creative employees but management is slow to react.  Definitely needs to figure out what their direction needs to be.  
good,I work remotely and on site supporting client's printer fleets of multi-function printers. I transferred from supporting clients on site in Waukegan to downtown Chicago which is more convenient for me. It is a good job for entry level technicians or support professionals.
good,"The job itself is easy and enjoyable. It's the paperwork, the emails and all the required after hours things that make this job a life hog. The benefits package is beyond great, but the pay is sub-par. I asked about promotions and was told of merit raises. Where you get more responsibilities but no real raise. That's counter productive to me."
good,"I come to work early in the morning and batch mail to be scanned. I pretty much know all of the basics. Management doesn't get in the way, sometimes that can be good and sometimes that can be bad. Don't have many problems with the co-workers, but when we do, we work them out.. There is no hard part, but the most enjoyable part is the interaction with co-workers."
good,"Company offered good job security, and it was a pleasure to work there, usually. However the room for advancement was small, and within the 2.5 years I was there, barely gave what could be considered a raise."
good,"A typical day at work was prospecting for new clients while working with my sales team on existing pursuits. I worked at home so many hours were spent on the phone and sometimes late in the evening, based on time zone differences."
good,make production share exprinces on being sucessfulness.
good,no day is typical
good,Some group at HP has flex hours and that helps a lot with kind of jobs we do. People are very nice to work with. Company is just too big for a change.
good,"Empresa com pouca possibilidade de crescimento. As vagas internas eram preenchidas e depois divulgadas para ""cumprir tabela""."
good,This is my First company to be worked off.

good,"Hi,"
good,"o ambiente era bem agradavel,colegas também, não havia problemas com a gerencia,haviam festas semanais para motivação dos funcionarios."
good,É um trabalho tranquilo.
good,Hewlett Packard es una empresa con muy buen clima laboral y con algunos procesos por optimizar.
good,"Not the HP it used to be, Layoffs were unheard of in the beginning. Best part of job was self supervising and aboilty to work from hom at the end of the day."
good,"Good, low salary, cab facility, good work enviraonment, fun at work, international standards, learning"
good,Happy working in HP and learned many things based on management.
good,"A typical day at work starts with catching up with emails, meeting with colleagues, working on projects. We follow the Agile development methodology so we populate our product backlog, pick user stories and tasks, play poker to estimate efforts for stories. Work on completing the tasks one owns, and there will be a daily standup meeting at the end of the day. I focus on product roadmap definition, generating new feature ideas, being a part of innovation focus group in our department to foster innovation. Mentor juniors, review code, documentation, etc."
good,"My duties were to customize workstations according to customer specifications. This included re-imaging, hardware upgrades, softwares upgrades and custom builds. The customer base was as broad as was the specifications for the work, therefore attention to detail was key, following directions was important and knowledge of the pc was paramount."
good,"Big organization with large goals to get to with many competitors in the field I was hired in for with superior products and more importantly presence and services. But I know, they are working towards those goals successfully."
good,"HP used to be one of the best companies in the world to work. However, since the passing of its founders, it has endured a succession of CEOs who focused on short-term financial success to the detriment of its employees and culture, and the long-term success of the company. It is not clear that this will improve under the latest CEO. The BOD is potentially still very dysfunctional."
good,Most of the Projects are good to work on.
good,Good products but too focused on internal competition versus the benefit that they could provide to client. Too many layers.
good,"The labs at HP are well staffed and clean. However, the workload can swing very quickly from casual to crunch time. The amount of work received is determined at the sole discretion of the Chemists, and sometimes a large workload can come with no warning at all."
good,"EDS/HP was a great position for quite a while- there was job security, good salary, and very good benefits.  Unfortunately, management did not do a very good job with contract negotiations and the company we were contracted with were given the option to terminate our helpdesk halfway through our contract, they selected that option and our entire helpdesk was terminated.  There wasn't much room for advancement at my current position, so in that sense it was a bit of a dead-end job, or- I just reached my fullest potential within that particular position."
good,I have been with  two teams in HP. The first team was very supportive and helpful but the second team is very difficult to work with. The team is not very welcoming to fresher's and conty workers.
good,"The work and life balance is the most valuable benefit HP gives its employees. Unfortunately, recent change of management has made it very difficult to stay focused on what's important."
good,Great teams and collaboration. Recently built office for Houston that is state of the art. HP definitely has a culture that encourages cross-collaboration teamwork and a 'get it done' attitude.
good,"Productive and Fun Place to work. Good management. No career growth."
good,"Payroll Life at HP is quite different than the overall company itself.  Finance can not speak for the entire company.  This is a great company to work for work life balance is wonderful if you do not work in Finance otherwise that is not the life in Finance.  We work long hours and one position is five peoples jobs.  Job security is always something to consider, because they have been laying off for years and continue to do so at Hewlett Packard and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  I do not work for HP, I work for HPE therefore I can not speak for HP any longer."
good,"if you need work life balance and are okay compromising the salary then this is the place for you. Though after a certain level you get better benefits, the rest levels get very bad salaries... Otherwise, this is a very good company to work for.. work culture is good , if you get the right mindset manager which i did its a very good place to be in. And if you are joining hp after certain experience then they pay you well."
good,"Boa aprendi muitas coisas nelas, como por exemplo, cada cartucho e ideal para cada máquina"
good,I was just a contract staff. So I was not sure of permanent staff benefits. Also I was there only for 3 months. Can't provide much review due to the short span.
good,"The salary is good, the benefits are varied and there really is work-life balance, sometmes even more life than work. But 90% of the people (colleagues and managers alike) make HP Inc a bad place to work, in the top 5 employers... to be avoided."
good,"Enjoy staying in the company but due to the reconstruction of the company, there were a lot of layoffs."
good,Pay here is poor but hours are good. I enjoyed working under my boss because there was no micro management. Culture will depend on the individual teams you end up being employed under.
good,"Stressful, Regular pay plus commissions. Commissions were good."
good,J’ai passé une très bonne année chez jtekt hpi je mi suis très bien intégré et adopté très rapidement leur méthode de travaille
good,"HP definitely pays on the low end compared to other companies . good work life balance, get home one time and get paid for all over time including for unused PTO at end of the year. mgmt changes constantly"
good,"It's a relaxed place to work, but lacks real career growth opportunities. Opportunities to learn and grow only happen if you are assigned to the right team."
good,Management is great and always provided opportunities for professional growth.  The downs side is the pay and working with Sales Managers.  Management does a great job in promoting team building.
good,Environnement de travail très agréable et professionnel
good,"Most jobs in mid to senior management is high volume, high caliber, high stress work.  Depending on the team one is with, this can be easy with a well oiled team. However some teams have much in-fighting that puts good work into a tail-spin."
good,"HP used to be a great place to work, not anymore."
good,"Overall a good company to work for, they definitely value keeping their employees and celebrate employee hire anniversaries. Benefits are excellent, 401k matching, good health insurance options and HSA. Management needs to communicate and set goals better and ensure good communication between groups and often time is wasted in meetings. Interesting C++ and Dotnet development occurring in Personal Computers areas."
good,"HP has been a very supportive company.  "
good,"Após a separação da HP em 2 empresas, fiquei na área de serviços que se deteriorou."
good,Espacio para competir a corto mediano y largo plazo

good,"Se podía laborar de manera cómoda dando soportes técnicos a las empresas contratadas."
good,"HP is a challenging place to work as there are tough demands on everyone to perform & excel.One has to continuously redefine his role to stay relevant. Upper Management needs to reward and redesignate more on the basis of ones education, skills and experience."
good,"the job was nice but sometimes I had enough for 30plus hours a week, then other times it was barely 15hours.  The best part was my manager who was fantastic.  I even liked the traveling part."
good,"Definite good at perks"
good,"Working at HP was a interesting experience as it was only a temporary contract position. HP was starting in 2014 to lay-off is starting to lay off contract workers even at this stage. You had to be a full-time worker if you wanted to stay there at that time."
good,HP is a typical American capitalist firm. It cares more about it's shareholders than it's workers. The disfunction can be seen at all levels. American workers are laid off only to be rehired as temporary employees without benefits and other jobs are sent overseas.
good,"HP is HP.  Huge company.  I worked at an acquisition of HP in Utah, and it was a wild ride.  Startup mode the whole time.  We accomplished a lot, but in the end, HP decided to pull the plug."
good,Coming from Dell to HP was difficult and the HP and Dell culture clashed to say the least. I was placed in a very small desk and never really felt at home.
good,"I was able to manage my time.  I was assigned opportunities that I worked.  I provided custom pricing and solutions for non-standard services, RFP and RFI request"
good,"Even though I call the culture average by the time I left, I still liked working there because the quality of the people that I worked with was still way above average and I'm sure it still is. "
good,"Very good place to work, Good R and D lab to work for."
good,"HP has a great culture and much of a slow pace job. However, the issue there is that upper management seems to keep changing direction on how the company will move forward. The salary there is low compare to what the market pays. Experience vise you get to be exposed to a lot of advance technology due to the demand and what HP's customers expect from HP."
good,"HP lost its way due to poor management in the past and are now trying to reinvent their business in order to stay alive. They are making progress, but time will tell whether they can truly turn around the company"
good,Laid off out of nowhere. Vacation and volunteer hours are the only good thing. Employees you work with are nice. Would never trust to work for company again.
good,"Good to work in HP,. But  Good work Culture, Job security, Very safety for Women employes, no appraisal has been provided due to financial crisis and partition of HP to inc and services."
good,"Working on national holidays"
good,Fantastico Team di lavoro e ambiente lavorativo. estremamente entusiasmante i primi anni ma nessuna possibilità di miglioramento negli anni successivi. Tutto diventava abbastanza sistematico senza possibilità di avanzamento di carriera
good,"HPI is the one company where i like to work in long term but unfortunately some management people will not leave us to grow in this company"
good,"good work calculate, but the internal and external (BPO and core HP)"
good,"Typical day:  meetings with suppliers and internal teams"
good,"Good Job environment, they make you feel good and help you to be secure, the only issue is that the salary was not competitive at that point in my career and I felt I needed more."
good,"Je m'explique."

good,"It is a interesting environment, filled with smart engineers. you have the ability to explore many areas in technology."
good,"HP is a great place to kick start a computing or managing career but not for people thinking that it will be a life time job. Budged cutting and layoffs happen on a yearly basis and is in need of some help in the industry of computing. Given these obstetrical, if they were to be fixed and job security felt more reliable, HP would be the idea workplace to have a job."
good,"When I worked there, it was a great place.  The best part was the work life balance.  I was able to work from home when my children were sick and still do my job and attend meetings via phone. The pay and benefits were very good."
good,"HP has great job culture, good work life balance, but disappointing in terms of recognition and salary.I would say HP is great company for experienced people but i wouldn't recommend fresher's joining HP because there isn't much to learn."
good,"The turn-over is so horrible."
good,This is a great place to work. Wonderful people on my team and everyone works hard and works together. My managers are the best!
good,"Go in with open eyes.  Job security based on contract success.  Otherwise, a good place to work.  Management cared about its people.  I mostly enjoyed my time with them."
good,For me (and this depends on a person's priorities) - very stressful workplace as management expects you to stretch yourself to your limit.  But if you are looking for a place to grow and at the same time give you job security - this is the place to be
good,"Good internal training programs."
good,"Working for HP puts you in a relatively calm daily environment compared to what I was used to, so the positive side is that it is relatively not stressed and polite behavior is the standard."
good,"Assisted Bank of America help desk and engineering team with backlog ticket and support issues."
good,"I had learnt more about excel and customer interaction."
good,"I see HP as a company that builds great products that are reliable.  However the company doesn't have senior leadership has limited sales and leadership skills. They are good ""managers"" but not leaders."
good,"I would prefer not to give any feedback at this stage as currently it is still my employer. There are many pros and cons of working for this company, however I am aware that it has been a great opportunity for me to join this company especially without any specific experience and lack of expertise in HR/payroll."
good,"never typical sometimes worked in different buildings same day"
good,"Long days of calls, paperwork, meetings, and check ups. If you love helping this is the job for you. I enjoyed working for this company. Traveling was great, pay was great, boss was great. It was a great experience. I loved the free gifts as well."
good,"It is a good company to work with and HP stands for its values with both moral and ethical."

good,El ambiente es el idea para el desarrollo de relaciones de trabajo
good,"Alto nivel de profesionales, con valores de trabajo en equipo y compañerismo."
good,Had an opportunity to gain knowledge and had fun working at the company. People at HP were very friendly and helpful. Training sessions on new technologies were an added advantage.
good,"Job security has been a constant battle for colleagues of mine during my 5 years at HP. Even high performers get terminated for seemingly arbitrary management directions, e.g. eliminating remote working consultants."
good,"Generally a good place to work, but very slow decision making. Too many overlapping products and too many approvals."
good,"•	Welcomes visitors and informs appropriate personnel of their arrivals."
good,HP compensation is above average.  Work environment is about average.  Work location is at the client site.  HP plans to offshore the support resources which could impact the quality of the work
good,"Productive and fun work place."
good,"Fun place to work with supportive management.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a large company."
good,Management of a number of PMO Functions with different Contracts. Fast changing environment and exposure to a wide range of Account activities & challenges.
good,"A typical day for me would be to arrive early, look at my pipeline to see what deals were coming up and the expected deadline to meet the goal of having the commercial business close on an expected sale regarding servers, storage and networking. There would be several team meetings regarding where each individual in the team were at and how to better accomplish the sale goal, and each team member would have to explain why they were at a certain teir, or level of accomplishment. There would also be over the phone conferences with individuals who are outside of the call center and higher up at Hewlett-Packard than the managers who work there. I would have to explain my top deals and where they were at on the pipeline of expectancy and why, and also explain the amount that was projected to close and how close I was to reaching my pipeline goal. I would also work with team leaders and simulations of closed deals."
good,"Good opportunities - but downside is that it depends on which organization, which country and which manager you work for. Advancement for career also exists if you are in the right place at the right time. Limited career coaching in certain countries. Some opportunities in certain countries are based on the number of years of experience rather than performance."
good,"Monday's Crazy, Fridays Pizza :-)"
good,"while working at Hewlett Packard learned a lot specially doing blades servers, worked with blades for 2 years and learned very much and after got moved to Repair something higher which I was very happy they did that because I deserved it."
good,"Compensation and Benefits were on par or better than industry standard. "
good,"Prepared customer events from managing calendars to invoices and evaluation reports. Learned to work with various people and businesses. Supporting few different sales team by hosting their pre-sales events, shared and built good friendship with my colleagues even most of them lives in different States. Multi-tasking and time management was especially important since I had to manage many different events at the same time and worked long and unpredictable hours due to characteristics of the job. Love learning different parts of the business and working with everyone, help me grow tremendously."
good,HP is a good place to work as it has proper work life balance and also various benefits for the employees like work from home etc.
good,"HP is a great company as we all know, but in my case as a representative of HP providing support for an external organization it was not the best experience for me."
good,"Manage the day to day customer support of internal customers."
good,"Utilize strong organizational, communication and interpersonal relation skills in a challenging, creative and stable environment."
good,The company is very disorganized. There systems are frequently breaking down. The pcs that they give to employees frequently break down. The let you work from home which is a big plus. But when working form home it is difficult to get in touch with co-workers. They put people in charge of IT with no software development experience which makes it hard for them to relate to the people they are in charge of.
good,"Typical busy workplace with reckless redundancies of staff. Comparitively low salary. No employee benfits like memberships, discounts or vouchers."
good,"Great place to Start, Learn and Develop yourself."
good,Good for freshers as it give more exposure to freshers on personal and professional front. Growth pace is slow as compared to other MNC's.
good,"1.It's just not 8-5 job."
good,"Like most employers HP is having to cut cost, cut people, demand more, and provide less to their employees.  Fresh out of college or changing career paths (I highly recommend them)  You will most likely find yourself on a team with great people, with mature processes and very good work life balance.  Once you have put in a couple of years, earned a promotion or two, but have not had much salary change.  I suggest you consider looking for another employer and anticipating a significant salary bump when you find one.  (This get out in a few years is good advice for all employers, gone are the days where you can work for one employer and do well financially up to retirement.  "
good,"Working as a sales rep for HP was great because I got to pick my hours and store locations. Pretty easy job, learn the material and teach it to the employees at  retail stores."

good,"I enjoyed my days in HP have nice time with my colleages along with work."
good,"Managed various initiatives ensuring project plans are accurately defined, resources are aligned and executive management is adequately informed of progress."
good,"It is a call center, you get calls from members who have forward health benefits or snap benefits and the reasons they call range from who the have for an HMO to ordering cards and so many other things. Co-workers are awesome the best part of the day is toward the end when there are not that many calls and you can chat with the awesome people that sit around you."
good,"very slow moving company, but good work life balance and job security"
good,"Honest open communication from management is key"
good,"não é uma empresa que de suporte aos front lane , que são a entrada para os suportes de cliente , é o salario não é compatível com a função, porém uma empresa que tem uma bela historia de construção e um otimo treinamento de profissional"

good,"Was the single point of contact for operational issues for 3 large global accounts."
good,"Mi experiencia en esta empresa fue satisfactoria, aunque buscaba un crecimiento más rápido y dinámico, debido a que en este empresa yo tenía un puesto administrativo me tomaba mucho más tiempo tener un crecimiento profesional, además de que los salarios eran más bajos."
good,This job was fast paced.  I had a lot of conference calls with my co-workers and clients.  I had to juggle multiple client implementations at one time.  My co-workers were very helpful. The management was knowledgeable and approachable.

good,"working with multi nationalities is fun and easygoing, workload is a bit much and career growth is slow..The most rewarding part is building relationship with vendors, retailers and suppliers."
good,"Self managed environment. Everyone comes to work as an individual contributor and ensures that their daily tasks, roles and responsibilities are completed. The management is very easy going and works as a individual contributor as well. No micro managing styles. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people and every one is very friendly."

good,"* On a average day i assisted in getting agents   up and running on the server. "
good,"Would take calls on issues with HP printers, and Cloud management with ePrint. Learned a good deal of team management and cooperation as well as working independently for each customer. I mostly enjoyed the ability to manage my own time while being able to relax with my co-workers as long as work was on/ahead of schedule."
good,"Trabalho com toda America Latina,USA,Chestes e UK."
good,"Pay was reliable, vacation & holiday policies good"
good,A typical day consist of time entry/keying - productive mode. I've increased keying timing. Management is just that. Co-workers are okay. The constant sitting is hard on the body. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a job.
good,Able to Learn and be productive. Done certifications. Management is so co-operative and good work place.
good,"Of the nine months I worked in HP, three months of training was loaded with fun and activities. The remaining six months were the toughest. Long support calls to long nights."
good,"Learned the good work Culture"
good,"friendly people"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers, I appreciate and respect the people I work with and learn from on a daily basis.  I have spent close to 15 years at this company and appreicate its values."
good,"HP has gone through many culture changes over the years.  Most recently, it has shed many very good people slowing the potential for growth.  Most changes have been in an effort to cut costs.  It is unknown whether the recent changes will be successful or if they will fail.  HP is really too big to fail."
good,"•	Sales & Revenue Growth"
good,"Quando entrei na empresa criei muita expectativa, pois é a primeira de grande porte que atuo,muito feliz pensando num futuro próspero, onde poderia aprender mais e voltar a estudar. Mais infelizmente eles tem alguns critérios que realmente não entendo, como pessoas que se adaptam fácil ao serviço tendo boas metas, ficam em segundo plano, causando um certo desconforto, tudo bem pois dias melhores virão. De qualquer forma não deixou de ser um aprendizado, continuo trabalhando,sendo profissional e almejando um futuro melhor, referente a gerencia , sempre foi muito clara conosco, fiz muitas amizades que com certeza permanecerão fora da empresa, a parte mais difícil do trabalho aturar clientes mal educados e a mais agradável atender pessoas  corteses e gentis"
good,"Uma empresa que não paga bem porém é referência em TI."
good,"HP was an OK place to work for most of my tenure.  Unfortunately, due to mistakes by former CEOs, HP was forced to trim 30,000 employees."
good,Great benefits with constant organization restructures.
good,I've learned a lot in the company and I've become an asset since I worked here. I received commendation from different customer/client and I enjoy it.

good,"The Supervisor Was Great, The People At The Job Were Great To Work With"
good,The pole one has to work with are very helpful and thrive in helping one learn. the product are ever changing and allow one for opportunity to learn new things. Management is very helpful at times of leading and follow threw.
good,HP is a good company except some complications with the management.
good,Coordinate confidential Executive meetings /Screen calls
good,"Het leukste aan mijn werk als managementassistent is de veelzijdigheid en het organiseren (zorgen dat alles op rolletjes verloopt). Er wordt veel van je verwacht maar je krijgt er ook waardering voor terug. Ik werkte in een sales omgeving dus altijd veel hectiek en vaak hoge druk om het werk op tijd af te krijgen maar daar raak je aan gewend. Ik heb altijd gezorgd voor een goede verstandhouding en een band van vertrouwen met de managers waarvoor ik werkte, dat vind ik heel belangrijk. Minstens zo belangrijk is de verstandhouding met mijn collega's en collega assistants zowel in- als extern. Netwerken is niet alleen leuk maar ook erg belangrijk als assistant om je werk gedaan te krijgen. Ik heb hier de kans gekregen om mij als een professionele managementassistant kunnen ontwikkelen."
good,nice place to work. good behavior of some your co workers.equal benefits. to all employee. good benefits.
good,I really enjoyed this type of work. There was a massive layoff of all HP employees as our work was being outsourced overseas to increase company profits. I lost my job after 5+ years through no fault of my own.
good,"Troubleshooting day to day backup failures, dealing with some tapes rotations and issue with libraries and vendor calls, learnt how to manage time and work pro actively. Management has a good support but not the best. Working in a team of 8 members handling 6 customers sometimes a hectic work but we do manage it."
good,I really enjoyed my 22 years with HP. I worked for several good managers. The ability to telecommute was an awesome benefit to me.
good,HP is a great company to begin a corporate career. Unless you are willing to relocate multiple times throughout your career experience with HP it is not a company that you should plan to stay with long term. Otherwise the pay was good although customer facing positions can be very taxing initially.
good,Overall I can not complain about the company as they have been really good to me. I am looking mainly cause there is no room for advancement in my current role.
good,Poor compensations and lack of leadership have drove down morale
good,"Het leuke aan deze baan is dat het plezier maakt om te gaan werken, de collega's, de omgeving, alles met andere woorden. Helaas zijn er weinig doorgroeimogelijkheden en de klant stopt bij de werkgever."
good,"When I started at HP, we were called 3Com. From the moment I walked in the door and saw the twenty foot painting of Jimi Hendrix, I knew this was a company of free thinkers, and wanted to retire there. My co workers were the greatest group of people I have worked with so far in my career and the company was fantastic to work for. HP bought 3Com and eliminated desktop support locally so can only really comment on the work I did for 3Com since I worked for HP only a short time."
good,The Challenges involved managing the increase in increasing of scope of work & stakeholder expecations with minimal availability of resources
good,"Most of the Enterprise Services projects are good ones. They have a lot of work, and good quality work."
good,Most of the projects are good.
good,"Working at Hewlett Packard was fun, My supervisor took care of her team. She made sure that we were knowledgeable of the information that we needed to know for the completion of the job at hand. She tried to implement fun and still education."
good,Great environment to grow and expand your skills. Very supportive team members and manager made my experience at HP memorable. Great team cohesion across consumer and enterprise teams before the split took place
good,"Is a dynamic and daily challenge, team work, very changing enviroment. Close contact with retails, end customers (consumer and corporate), partners and wholesalers. Sales strategies and plans that will outperform quota"
good,I learned that working from home for HP was a bit isolated but the team I worked with were always available to help out with questions when needed.  This was most helpful. I enjoyed very much working with this team.
good,"5 days in a week."
good,Overall my experience with HP was good.  I stayed with HP before becoming DXC Technology due to work flexibility.  The workplace culture had two sides to it: (1) it had a strong presence of long-standing employees that enjoyed work flexibility and (2) high turnover for newer employees that valued a higher compensation over workplace flexibility.
good,"Huge company but growth is minimal."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and being able to work remotely was definitely a plus for me. However, I mostly experience pay cuts (which was done across the board) and rarely received a raise. Benefits were decent."
good,"I was in an odd department that functioned solely as BofA's client so we were often treated more like BofA employees than HP employees so we were often outside of HP's core company benefits. This limited growth beyond the dept to other areas of HP as we didn't have full access (non-compete & other privacy limits with BofA) to other opportunities. The flexible hours, security and great management and a good team made it a good place to work."
good,"It has a good work-life balance culture."
good,"HP has a last of culture to the extent that this can be the same company as 100s of others.  When I was with EDS, the culture was part of the company's history."
good,"help customers, work with Others team, be positive, proactive, accept flexible hours, be patient, organize events with commercial/marketing office!!!1"
good,I loved the people. I thought I would mostly be doing tech support but it turned out to be more sales. Overall I just didn't like that different leads told you different thing to end a call while on a call.
good,"HP was a great company until the last decade.  Management started being hired from outside of HP and the culture was last as was a lot of the employee enthusiasm to make the company great."
good,"The division within HP was amazing. HP itself did little to support our division, but the group and managers I worked with were solid."
good,"Most days the environment is very relaxed with well defined objectives and tasks to accomplish on a daily basis, culture is fun and very diverse. Coworkers  are always there to help."
good,"I learnt lot of things in HP especially, I have to highlight certain things like fun at work, leading the team members in a proper way. The enjoyable moment, as a team we got outstanding performance award from center head and this has been suggested by client."
good,"Thank you for all the  support and learning for almost 3 years of working on this great company. "
good,"HP was an interesting time in my life. My entire family worked there all at once and It helped make the hard times much more bearable. A typical day was usually not typical. I was in charge of a lot of different project and had to manage which ones had a higher priority over the other daily. Some days I would be at my desk sending out emails and reminders of processes all day, others I would be down at the loading docks prepping shipments. This was at times a little stressful, but as I got into the swing of things this got much easier, and my co-workers were some of the most amazing people I had ever met, always willing to help out or give guidance. "
good,"would go into different stores such as office max and best buy to demo the newest HP products such as laptops, all in ones and printers. Management was very friendly and kind."
good,"Good place to work to learn new concepts, technologies and applications.  Depending on the role, a lot of firefighting can occur but they have gotten better at trying to provide a good work life balance.  Pay could be better, especially given we have rating systems to monitor performance yet those seem to mean nothing when it comes to yearly bonuses.  But that might be because our division keeps going through mergers and acquisitions as well as buyouts so management principles and practices are very chaotic and constantly shape shifting"
good,"Co-workers are great, they pull together as a team in a fire drill type situation. Great at working together with other teams. I also have had fabulous managers!"
good,the workplace was very social yet busy. every shift was available. they also give 3 breaks thru out the day that benifical to staying busy thru the work day.
good,"- great place to work and learn world class processes and business mgmt"
good,I was employed by manpower for 2yrs before becoming full time with Hewlett Packard. I would recommend this agency to anyone looking for a job. Whether your looking for full time or part time position.
good,"Extremely busy at all time, good manager interaction and support if needed."
good,"Flexible work timings. Learnt a lot in terms of client management and  latest technology in Analytics. A common corporate culture where one can participate in various social activities and sports. Knowledge management is poor, very difficult to get the right information easily. Gives an opportunity to try this yourself and learn in the process. No limit for creative thought process."
good,"A good place to work"
good,"HP has great people, culture and history.    I assume there has been a lot of change in the company since the HP/HPE split, so this feedback is dated."
good,"Working as a Transport Admin."
good,NGEN contract doesn't pay very well. Each year more and more jobs are being cut and as a result your work load increases while you compensation stays the same or decreases.
good,Good to work at HP and it was wonderful experience but i am not happy with management and looking for good growth to develop in my carrier in-order to enhance my skills.
good,"i really enjoy working here..but the only thing they should improve is the parking and the working hours. and management are really great and very nice ...especially in HR"
good,"- Its all about processes"
good,"Mijn werk was het maken van offertes van klantenverzoeken/aanvragen  en tenders en als bid manager hield ik mij bezig met de beantwoording van Europese aanbestedingen ten behoeve van onze partners.  Mijn aanpak is planmatig: de aanvraag voor een offerte lezen, analyseren en doorgronden om op tijd een kwalitatief goede en klantgerichte offerte te realiseren.  Het is boeiend zelfstandig werk om een offerte op maat te maken in overleg met de diverse disciplines in de organisatie. En nog leuker is het om deze offerte dan te winnen! "
good,"Very friendly colleagues, good benefit and working environment. But the company is moving very slow recently. Bless HP!"
good,"HP provide good work life balance."
good,HPE is a good company to work for but in the long run do not expect salary raises.  This is my only complaint since working with HPE for 8 years and every job promotion is a lateral move.
good,Very segmented company. You might work for a great team or maybe not. Its always a struggle to stay current and to react quickly to the marketplace.
good,Loved the location as well as work life balance. Employee evalutions are totally screwed up. Get measured on items that employees have no influence or control of.
good,Helps build a sales focused mind. Leadership keeps things silent until the last minute causing a lot of distress. Great people and great managers.
good,"I worked with a great group of people who were professional and respectful and yet also were make the work enjoyable. This was good, as HP had been drifting for the last decade, regularly laying off people as it struggled to re-invent itself. Most of those efforts failed. As the years went by, HP gradually changed from being a company that planned for the future and always sought to make shake up the market paradigm with innovative products, to a company that seemed concerned only with the quarter-to-quarter bottom line."
good,"I was with HP/EDS for nearly 15 years. "
good,"Racism plays a huge role at HP. If you don't fit in with the ""crowd"" you will never advance and will be treated with disrespect. Many, many employees have reported this problem but nothin has been done."
good,"Good things can happen, Bad things can ruin your life."
good,HP is a good company to take care of your personal life with with work. They allow work from home that contributes a lot to your overall day to day life

I supported several executives efficiently.  Some duties were travel arrangements, calendar management, presentation creation, meeting coordination, event coordination.  Co-workers were extremely helpful and were team players willing to assist at any time.  On my account, management knew the HP business, customer's business and how to be successful."
good,"The company best days are really behind them.  There are many great  people at HP, however, the constant change and frequent downsizing has eroded the company's culture and deteriorated the management.

good,My typical day of work usually started of by receving a phone call of someone needing help either with their own insurance or something for one of their kids.
good,"HP is een bedrijf wat altijd kwaliteit levert, een kenmerk dat ik kan onderschrijven. Dat betekent veel uitdagingen aangaan en grenzen verleggen. Er is veel kennis opgeslagen in het bedrijf, merkbaar in de vele diepgaande documentatie over producten en processen. "

good,"In HP the work starts with allocation of work, team huddle. And work on the task. Learned about procurement supply chain. Improved communication skill, handling of customers and to a can do attitude. The co workers were good and supportive. The hardest part to deal with regular change in management from top to direct one. The enjoyable part or I can say what I enjoyed is the feeling that I m doing something which I can and at same time enjoy. Always ready to learn new things and work in procurement and supply chain."
good,"Truly professional work place with good co-workers."
good,Typical day includes performance management and interacting with business partners for constant improvements. Cross- country/cultural interactions is one big thing i have learnt in this role. Co- workers are fun to be around with.

good,"The last two years of my life spent in Hewlett-Packard gave me the great training and working experience. In parallel to being trained for two months for SAP SD Consultancy when I was hired, my manager already allocated me to a role for two projects. Junior consultants at that time mentored and shadowed me for those projects. I was allocated to a total of eleven (11) projects. Three (3) of those were full implementations as OM and SHX IT role leads and two (2) of which gave me a project management role. Trainings to enhance our technical skills were held every month so we had an option to choose the timing when we are available. Aside from the consultancy work I did, I also led two (2) team-wide initiatives and one (1) company wide initiative. Those two team-wide initiatives include organizing fun activities within and outside the office to promote work-life balance among employees. The other one was for the Rewards and Recognition to give value to the above and beyond work done by the team. As for the company-wide initiative, I led the Linkages and Recruitment for my alma mater, De La Salle University. HP gives the employees not just to excel and showcase skills in technical work but in other fields as well. People in the office are very accommodating and will help each and everyone when mentoring is needed. HP has an open door policy so it makes us comfortable to work with our bosses even in the workplace. I honestly would have stayed in HP because of the kind of work, training and the people I were with but there is slow advancement in the job, currently there is freeze promotion,"
good,"Typical Day at work: I'm working as a Invoice Analyst in HP, creating invoices, booking order, credit notes, Status of progress awaiting user response. Its fully finance process.

good,fun place to work nice friendly management good environment positive people very results driven but also scary place to work lots of lay off very strict goals and performance metrics and not much room for advancement virtually NO raises even when deserved or promoted. Very difficult to get the true clear direction of the company from upper management and execs
good,Good Working Environment.
good,"Great company to work for, coworkers are very professional, the work is interesting, good benefits and most managers highly delegate (you are totally responsible for completing your job duties). HP management uses layoffs as a quick way to control costs if profits/revenue fall below predicted levels, or if a new manager wants to earn browne points for reducing costs in his new department."
good,"HP is a great innovation centric, customer focused company. Identity is through their printer/computer customer/business centric products. But great portfolio of IT solutions and services, mostly focused around IT operations."
good,"Empresa correta com os funcionários, planos de benefícios de acordo com mercado."
good,"in this job i learn very important things for my life.."
good,Typical no work here. if you want to do nothing and enjoy life then HP is best place. no new learning. Since work is missing so culture remains good. over all good company for those who dont want to work

good,"A fortune 500 company, but not the ideal company to root for, if you are in-experienced or at the beginning stages of your career."

good,"I worked as a contractor for HP assisting on the American Airlines help desk. Work was enjoyable and the challenge of working with the airports on a global scale was always nice, there were few days where there wasn't a new challenge to overcome and very rarely were things ever boring. Work life was great and balanced well with personal life, there were shift bids so it was fair as long as you showed up and did your job well you never had to fear about getting a shift you didn't want."
good,"Flexible work timings. Learnt a lot in terms of client management and latest technology in Analytics. A common corporate culture where one can participate in various social activities and sports. Knowledge management is poor, very difficult to get the right information easily. Gives an opportunity to try this yourself and learn in the process. No limit for creative thought process."
good,"Productive and fun loving desk. Great workplace and demonstrates great values. Customer oriented and largely believes in team work.Friendly go to approach management . Work life balance is near perfect and I have learned how to deal with difficult customers without compensating on company value and rules, however at times the job gets monotonous and has carry the disadvantage of working on back office model without any direct intervention/conversation with customers."

good,Fun place to work with well cultured and mannered co- workers who observe all necessary company policies and procedures. The most fun part of the day was working alongside friends
good,"I have no complaints. I make the most out of every opportunity that I start. Every position can have its downside and nothing is perfect but, if there is plenty opportunity available within a company I am an opportunist who is ambitious. This role was a great role."

good,A very  good company to have a work life balance. The management is the best part of the organization providing a way too good for the employees. Advancement should be a driving factor that has to be improved in the organization.
good,its good to work with in this company its feels like you are working in your own office work pressure and atmosphere is too good to work here
good,"HP has adopted a Fun at work attitude, under which it encourages employee at fun activities around themselves, so that pressure of work doesnt effect their performance. HP has continued to serve its clients without much visible issues. HP never misses out on recognising people for their good work and this helps in motivating people. "
good,"A good run of 4 1/2 years...! Always busy, always learning something new. Doing a lot of different jobs besides Quality Auditing, such as Computer Rack Assembly and Repair as needed. Before I knew, I 've become a very good Assembler...!"
good,good to work here and looking for career and personal growth.
good,Great place to work..lacks in compensation though. Management was always supportive
good,"I was working 12 hours shift pattern at clean room I joined there electroplating team, I gained knowledge of high speed industry, with chemicals and acids. Running robot and basic haousekeeping duties including passdown writting."
good,All in all I liked working at HP. It had it's challenges and seemed like there was always turmoil but my team and co-workers were awesome and I enjoyed the actual work I was doing while I was there it was a great challenge for me and I learned a lot and meet a lot of amazing people in my time at HP. I will say it is very hard to move around in the company if you do not network with the right people and networking there can be hard because it is so large. The pay could have been higher I don't know about all of the Inside Sales Team but my specific team had very high expectations and basically worked as outside sales reps without the compensation... and if you wanted to move to outside sales they have this silly rule that  you can only get a very low % of raise. Which did not always compensate for the job or location. and lets face it the discount they give on products for employees is very sub par. You could get a better deal shopping a sale at Wal-Mart or Best Buy.
good,"Team which am currently working is a very cooperative, i have joined as a fresher and learned many technical things related to the project"
good,"Work at HP is excellent, there is lot to learn and management , colleagues are outstanding and working during month/year end closing is challenging."

good,"O trabalho era sobre pressão,aprendi a trabalhar melhor com equipe"
good,"nice environment ,nice managers , we can gain knowledge"
good,"The day begins with a daily programed facility review or ""walk about"" through all different areas of the building. Normally a conversation topic or two with employees in general is held to take a grasp on the feeling of the facility users. I've learn that it is more effective to make this rounds than expecting for complaints to find out the level of people's comfort. My co-workers are always willing to give a helping hand when needed. The hardest part of the job is when a given situation can not be resolved as quickly as wish to. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you see the smiles of people concentrated at work or having a cup of joe at the cafeteria while watching tv. When an employee relaxes in a cool appropriate environment, you know you are doing your work right!"
good,each moment in HP enjoyable since it is my first job.
good,"Comfortable work place for beginners, however salary is less, work culture is really good"
good,I was a Maintenance Tech. It was a rewarding job and the workplace was employee friendly.

good,"HP was a great place to work for work life balance. They supported me and the culture - to this day was the best workplace culture I've experience to date. People were friendly, supportive and overall great human beings. HP may get a bad rap for not moving fast or being too big, but there is a reason that they are still a tech leader."
good,"HP is a large company with many opportunities and benefits."
good,"The company has a good work place."
good,"Limited staff and so bit heavy workload"
good,"Fun job with HP Marketsource only seems to hire outside management and leaves little to no ability for promotions. No matter how hard you work most field representatives that actually understand the changing marketplace is Trumped by Marketsource only hiring from Marietta, GA. Marketsource makes field work a dead end position good job. However if you want to be a DSM or above move to Marietta, GA they will make schedulers a District Managers (DSM) before premoniting any ASR  or DSM to upper management no reward for those that actually make the numbers that renews Marketsources contract with HP!"
good,"A empresa tem um excelente portifolio , bom posicionamento de mercado, porem trabalha sem processos bem elaborados o que dificulta o dia a dia e o foco em resultados e na excelência do atendimento ao cliente."

good,"Questa azienda é senz'altro tra quelle più al passo coi tempi e per me è stata fondamentale per la mia formazione culturale, lavorativa e sociale. Ho sempre apprezzato la sua filosofia che metteva al primo posto le persone e la sapeva valorizzare. Ho sempre lavorato con persone rispettose,capaci e generose.

good,"Job security is an issue with HP, but there are great opportunities for training and advancement."

good,The work at Hewlett-Packard India Software Operations at IPG R & D hub of Printer Division where I was involved in work related to firmware development for large scale enterprise laserjet printers. The team was very good and gave me interesting work in firmware development. The culture in our team was very cool. We followed Agile Development Software Method and deliver the projects on the time.The hardest part of the job was to experiment and present a proof of concept of something which was never done before.  It was time where I had to work day and night. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on weekends for free Pizza and drinks and enjoying talks with colleagues.
good,"Basically, morning conference call is at 8am.  Pick up needed parts by 9 am.  Call customer to setup appointments.  Go to each customer site and troubleshoot, diagnose, and resolve the customers issue.  I learned to how to replace system boards on several laptops, desktops and servers. The hardest part about the job was fighting traffic from site to site.  The most enjoyable of my job is seeing the customer happy, after I serviced them."
good,HP is a good company for IT infrastructure but needs to realign itself for getting desired success in IT consulting and systems integration

good,"Es una empresa lider mundial en la rama de Tecnologia de Informacion. Es una gran escuela que te permite desarrollarte y crecer tanto personal como profesionalmente. El mejor ambiente laboral, con filosia de comunicacion a puertas abiertas. La parte mas dificil que pudiera considerar es la posibilidad de abrir nuevos horizontes fuera de HP. HP es una de las mejores experiencias de mi vida profesional."

Other than that i have a great time getting work through the assembly line for completion. You know completion is the mission!!!!"
good,"During Compaq years it was the company to work for. However after the purchase of Digital Equipment Corporation (A down hill company). Most digital managers took power with their pay rates, stock options, and other perks rolling over into new company. It created two classes of employees. And digital employees had better benefits, power but lacked competence. Moral was low, and the pressure was high.  HP's purchase of Compaq created uncertainty, revolving door for CEOs."
good,"Great name, horrible leadership."
good,I think a large part of that is the fact that I’m a large believer in hiring the right people and giving them unbelievable amounts of power and autonomy.
good,The job was good. I was disappointed that I was laid off after 32yrs working for them. They hire kids right out of college but lay off folks who have lots of experience
good,"Hewlett Packard was a formidable company, but sadly is no more.  The succession of bad CEOs and decisions to put management ahead have decimated this once great company.  The split into HPE and HPI was the first blow; the final came when CSC took over most of HPE to create DXC technologies."
good,"My overall experience was good at HP, however we had a racist manager in leadership who was not qualified for her position, so it made it miserable to go into work each day. Also, the company was very cheap on their events.... there was great variance from each department"
good,"experience new way of assembly line work with blades and assembly,test,and shipping great environment learned alot about servers and internet"
good,"Sales oriented Environment with focus on customer satisfaction. Training various Retail Location Staff on HP products. Good Work environment, only co-workers are the Retail Associates of Locations you are training."
good,I quit from HP because the company promised me to hire after working full time for six months. But after working for more than eight months I found out that they never hire. and denies us of any benefits.
good,"The job was extremely varied with a mixture of Engineering, Sustaining and Maintenance activities."
good,No raises and unexpected lay-offs; too many management changes over short time frame.
good,Depende de los departamentos la valoracion puede variar mucho
good,"Working under M/s. Central Railway Information System (CRIS)."
good,"A typical day working at Hewlett Packard is like any other call center. The only difference is that they cared enough to train me on handle time. The management is okay and just like any management at any call center. As far as their client Guthy Renker, the communication is poor."
good,Great Company to work for but Manufacturing/Factory floor in Houston campus does not reflect that greatness
good,"Was a great company to intern for. I wish I would have been able to learn more, given that I had perhaps one day to mix it up, and add some new code to my academic understanding of HTML and C++, I would say that they're accustomed to bothering employees to death."
good,"I have learned that, HP GBS is a friendly place to work. Since this is my first job, i don'y find any difference between college and Office. People are very friendly , open environment and team work place a vital role."
good,"Its a typical product company wherein there are not many challenges and you are expected to perform regular tasks on daily basis. "
good,"Que el conocimiento en el mercado se podía acumular con un orden y ser aprovechado por todos, además que estaba más en contacto con el idioma inglés que es lo que me gustaba practicarlo."

good,"My stay with the company is pleasant. "
good,HP as in all companies has a great track record of developing talent and providing tons of opportunities to grow and extend skill sets.  Like other companies there have been great cycles and not so great cycles. HP finds itself in an overall great cycle with lots of swagger as it enters this year.
good,"Work environment is well and is good for career growth. But being a contract employee, i doesnt have much options. I want to work as a permanent employee as in that way i can dedicate myself completely knowing that i have job security and support from my company."
good,I have worked under contract for HP for almost 7 year.  Leaned a lot of new things.  Management at first was great then grew down hill.  The people  how ever are great to work with.  You work as a team and accomplish things.  Learning can be a learning curve depending on the department.  Overall HP was a great time and experience.
good,"The company allowed growth and learning. "
good,"Tons of turn over and new added responsibility. Walking through the door each day not knowing if you have a job or not. Will it be out sourced, will there be another merger. The job has plenty of potential and looks like a great opportunity, but with all of the upper management and poor decisions, made this a job that aged me."
good,"its an 3-11 pm job and its fast paced without stopping unless for break time or machine down,must hit target daily"
good,Loved working with executives within corporate environments. Proud to represent Hewlett Packard's products and services. Learned a lot in the sixteen years employed. Work was intense and work week could easily be in excess of fifty hours. Management could be difficult and changes a lot.
good,"HP wasn't a great place to work in my opinion, At the time they had one product ending and another beginning so it was a organized mess which made it a very difficult to keep up with any kind of inventory. It was bad,"
good,"Quando entrei na HP havia uma cultura corporativa muito forte e positiva, que se traduzia no dia-a-dia da empresa. Com o tempo, e com as infindáveis redefinições estratégicas e de gerência, do Manager I ao SVP e CEO, muito disso se perdeu, sendo que o pouco que resta, está lá por conta dos funcionários mais antigos."
good,A great place to build team work and to obtain skills for future employment
good,"Hewlett Packard"
good,• Review site surveys for Bank of America’s computing system
good,a typical work day pertained to building computers or laptops and packing them for shipment. I learned how to build laptops and towers. I learned how to pack and ship. the hardest part of the job was palletizing when the shipping belt was down. most enjoyable was the learning experience and meeting new friends.
good,Over all its a great place to work just needs a bit of employee & Contractors Feed Back on how to make it #1 place to work for &to stay with for a High Tech Company with many great products & people who make it that way :)

good,"Nice place to work at but since I working with them through a Agency I wasn't really working with them permanently. Worked with them on a contract basis and got laid off without notice and wasn't notified till 2 weeks later after I had gone to work. Didn't get paid for those 2 weeks of work, very sad.

good,good we learn more and we have chances to move from one project another project. we have safe work environment and employees and contact higher level in case of any issues. Friendly environment. we learn more technologies to use.
good,HP is a global brand and in general a good company to work for.and the offices are comfortable environments.There was an element of arrogance to some of the management team where they refuse to identify any competition against their own brand and when the numbers aren't looking good they are very quick to make big cuts without much thought process on the impact to clients.
good,"Opportunity to travel, good culture for the most part.  Company started going downhill the last few years.  Lots of layoffs, stopped caring about employees."

good,"process mail for medical records, checks, government. Learned how to operate heavy duty mail star machines and print. most co-worker and mangement were great. the hardest part of the job was 12 hr shifts for 6 days a week sometimes. Best part was work place people and environment."
good,The upper-middle management could stand to be in the trenches more and deal with the politics less. Employees with years of experience are being let go to hire someone at about the same salary. This is not a winning proposition long-term.
good,"I think HP is going through and split right now.  I was happy to be included in key meetings and my manager was relatively transparent in what was happening."
good,Simm's is an ok company to work for. I would recommend this employer to others as it a reputable place to work. I have worked for this employer for 5 years and I have no major complaints thus far. Simm is a leader in Collection.  Many people that work at Simm's stay there for a long while.
good,Everyday at this job was a positive adventure. I was able to establish my own process and that was key to getting product out of the door efficiently. I had the best co workers possible and was very sad to see this facility close.
good,hp is only a shadow of its former self.  it grew in numbers but shrank in innovation and go to market
good,I enjoyed working at this call center and it was very small and tight knit. We worked well as a team but it was a job that was contracted to work for Hewlett Packard so there was no room for career advancement. At times the staff was not professional and we had no medical benefits. It was a good job for temporary work.
good,"Good Company."
good,"I work from a 2:00 pm - 10:30 pm  everyday except, Tuesday's and Wednesdays.  Most months have been slow and on an average of about 25 phone calls per day.  The commission structure is rewarding but during busy months.  I have meet all sales goals according to their metric with the exception of one month.  But in order to make a bonus you have to have 140 sales.  When you only get a couple dozen phone calls you really don't have much of a chance, since most of the calls are hardware related or wrong department."
good,The work area can be a positive place if you decide to bring the best of you. Motivation incentive.
good,"I truly appreciate the technical know-how the business shares with us everyday however, the intensely technical department seems to have an effect on the employees thus making them less approachable than usual."
good,"•	Support onsite engineering from HP partners in Middle East.  "
good,"Coordinate workers on the manufacturing lines. Make sure each worker has work, if worker doesn't have work, migrate that worker to an area that has work. The hardest part of the job is when the workload is slow. When its slow it is hard to find something to do and you would have to go work in another area that your not really comfortable working at. The most enjoyable part of the job is when there is a heavy workload. Time goes by really fast when there are products to assemble and inspect to keep busy. Management is okay not the best, but not the worst. I would say its average. I noticed that there are a lot of workers that have degrees on the manufacturing floor that are not in their career field. They say this everywhere ""Its not what you know, its who you know"" best describes this company. Very difficult to move up if you don't know anyone. Performance doesn't mean anything if your not close to any ""Big"" people in the company."
good,Worked on DC auto provision product. Implementer it for a telecom company

good,"This is a good company.  I transitioned from EDS to HP I didn't see a lot of diversity when I was with the company, but I have learned that this is improving."
good, 
good,"Had busy and slow days. Learned to use the SAP program which was something new to me. Management was not great they don't seem to realize the hard workers. There where does hard working co-workers which I liked working with and than those who hardly do any work. Hardest part of the job was dealing with issues created by other co-workers on other shifts, by knowing how to do my job I would fix the issues of the others. The most enjoyable part was my area and shift, we made our days go by, by joking around but nothing serious."
good,"Nice place to work management is very friendly. The Palo Alto, CA campus is nice and has been remodeled. My job location was at the Palo Alto, CA campus."
good,"HP is good company to work with, only Salary and Management is becoming a constraint now a days (for the past 1 year)."
good,"I loved working with my teammates and supporting my guys in the field but too often the changing whims of upper management seriously screwed up the focus of our company. Not the best of relationships over the past 10 years between our C level executives and our Board of Directors caused one miss-step after another. However, there are tons of hard working and dedicated people there who shared the common goal of always striving to improve."
good,Very low pay if you work through Human Resource Staff. It was too much free time with less working on building PCs.
good,Very good place to work lots of benefits and the management was mostly good
good,"I got good training, overall good training to do the job, great people I got to work with"
good,"Teleworker,,,, not much to add, work from home and outside sales calls,,,technical support so so,  Life work balance not that great.  As working from home there's the expectation to finish work at night and on weekends."
good,Good products and reputation.  HPE still has a lot of great people that are a joy to work with.  It does suffer from being a huge company with a ton of products and directions.
good,Fun and productive work environment and provide safe workplace to its employees and perfect place for those who are looking for balanced work life . Great opportunities for those who are ready to take on work voluntarily and wanna have a career with lots of achievements .
good,"i've done this for work experience, As it was one of the most memorable work places I've been to. It was most certainly enjoyable for majority of the time as some parts are a bit lengthy, I was able to present my computing skills in the office dealing with computer software and exploring how to sell products to other big consumers."
good,I learned all about Corporate culture. I was able to work with a lot of new technology and how to work on large complex projects. working with different data center all over the world
good,"I started there in 1984, and it was a different place then. Employees were valued, benefits were good, and the work environment was good. Around 2000 that all changed: layoffs started. pay scales changed, and the work culture changed for the worse. Now it's just a giant corporate meat grinder, and most employees are contractors. If you're fortunate enough to be hired as a full-time HP employee, take the opportunity, learn what you can, and enjoy the paycheck and benefits as long as it lasts, or until you can't stand it any more."
good,"Aprendí lo que es el trabajo global, conocí muy buena gente, había descansos con café, se podría trabajar desde casa, tuve un buen gerente."

good,"The ususal, staff are underpaid and overworked with minimum development and reward schemes. "
good,"Philosophy of at home vs. in office work flip-flopped"
good,"When I first joined the company in 1999 this was an absolute great place to work and it went downhill from there each and every year. Each year they were looking for things to cut on top of cutting employees, offshoring heavily and working more hours with less. No pay raise in years, took away many benefits all the way to the bare bones. Managers need to be more accountable and supportive to their teams and have a real say so and stop kissing up to upper management instead they should do what is right and be transparent."
good,"nice work place"
good,A empresa paga o que a legislação brasileira prevê. Nada além disto.
good,I had a great experience with HP due to my manager but not everyone had the same experience. I was not micro managed and enjoyed my position. The corporate changes were hard to work thru. You never knew if you were going to be the next one laid off.
good,Worked for HP for many years until a workforce reduction.  Management and work environment changed drastically over the years.  Was for the worse.  Good people let go.  Bad people kept.
good,Listening to people talk about how the products are causing them harm or how they are no longer able to afford to keep getting the product. Trying to retain them as customers. Hearing how they are closing accounts due to the family member dying. Its is heart wrenching.

good,"HP went away from the ""HP WAY"" a long time ago. It is a shadow of it's former self. Despite that, HP is still better than most companies. Pay is way below the market. Work is rewarding."
good,"Used to be a great place to work...In the many days in the past, used to be a very nice place to work, folks mentored the new employees, and there was a spirit of hope..."
good,"I think management can do better to employees to better let them support and decide what is need to continue with production."

good,"The work place was clean,friendly and very spacious."
good,"Working as a field technician under contract for HP is stressful and costly. Pay is low as a contract employee and you are expected to provide your own transportation, including gas and maintenance. The area covered is both the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. The benefits are minimal with no holidays or vacation. The demands are excessive for both daily output and administrative functions. The customers are usually great, but can be demanding."
good,"A função designada para os funcionários da empresa era gerar Leads, oportunidades de vendas e outros. Porém a responsável pelo setor não sabia lidar com pessoas e infelizmente isso desgastava e desmotivava muito no trabalho."
good,Great company but can be difficult to advance if you are not in with the right group. There is no real set track for advancement other than brown nosing as best as you can.
good,"I enjoyed my time at HP and HPE and DXC.  Would have liked to stay for two more years.  The job market is shrinking and as the industry tries to move more jobs offshore, they are loosing valuable on-shore talent that have 30+ years of experience.  This experience cannot be replaced by offshore personal."
good,"Stressful environment, too much work and little appreciation, not enough support from co-workers, hard to find help or motivation."
good,"Various global teams"
good,"Los dias pueden variar depende la demanda de consumo o daños que se presenten en los equipo, se aprende mucho sobre las diferenes incidencias que surgen durante el dia, la direccion esta poco adminsitrada al igual que las prestaciones, la cultura laboral es de compromiso y responsabilidad, la parte mas dificil es obtener la satisfaccion del cliente, lo que mas me agrado del trabajo es el ambiente laboral."
good,"A empresa é boa para se trabalhar, porém o salario oferecido ao PCD não é compatível com o mercado."
good,The HP Way is still alive and well in certain sections of HP. There seems to be a renaissance going on in the company to support and further strong innovation. Recent successes with regard to the computers they produce would prove out the fostering of deeper roots into meaningful products.
good,"Great collaborative culture, opportunities to grow skills and learn.  Exec management very short-sighted and quarterly-focused very often laying off large organizations in a peanut-butter spread fashion to meet expectations on the Street.  Nice logo for the resume but get in and get out before the next CEO comes in and takes out the peanut butter knife."

good,"Uma boa empresa de se trabalhar, porém a supervisão local, é muito limitada e também o contrato por esta sendo diminuído fica um pouco mais complicado de se trabalhar."
good,"Benefits were good, but compensation needs improvement.  Management was, at times, in disarray.  We went through several CEO's while I was there and changes seem to occur each week.  Not a sable place to work."
good,"Great Place for new technology"
good,"You are pretty much expected to work on your off time. If you don't mind that, this is a good place to work. The CEO's are dividing HP into different company names."
good,Business change and not industry changes more than the computer business. HP went from being a family business environment to a corporate take over environment. Share holders demand profit... CEO`s provide it no mater what has to be done.
good,"A typical day for me in the Incident Managment Centre in Hewlett Packard, included communicating with internal users and IT Engineers on a daily basis. I learned to priortise IT issues, Time Management Skills, Problem Solving Skills, Communication Skills, Customer Service Skills, Troubleshooting Skills. Support from Co-workers was excellent and teamwork was fantastic. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some impatient users. The most enjoyable part was when IT issues got resolved within service level agreements."
good,"Worked from home as a contractor.  My work team was skilled and knowledgeable, and was led by good managers.  But their Vendor Management System was atrocious."
good,I am very disappointed in HP's approach to fix it's ailing problems. It is a once great company in search of an identity in the relentless changing computer industry.  It has over relied on work force reductions and offshoring to prop up its financials.

good,"worked in an branded co., with all my dedication and iam happy and forturned to have wipros experience "

The people are full of smiles and without having to re-negotiate a contract the pay rates are on par with the area's average rates.  Benefits for full time employees are great also."
good,Good Work life balance. But growth is minimal and not much learning.. Salary hike is minimum. overall a good company for those looking for Worklife balance.
good,Job security depends on services HP manage for clients.I was on a 5 year managed services account and when the account was lost my job was no longer secure.The company has lost of very good staff.struggling at the moment it seems.

good,"Hp Enterprise Service is a company that is innovative in system software.  There Medicaid contracts with state government can be interesting , and overall the company itself is a company worth working for."
good,"The work here is good.  The pay is great.  However, more often than not you are completely bogged down by administrative duties on top of sales, due to the fact that the admin guys were eliminated.   Very slow to adopt efficient tools and standards."
good,"In my daily job, i am responsible to create new opportunities and understand costumer needs. After analyzing and understanding costumer needs I am responsible to provide trainings and finalize the deal. Turkish Market is not much aware about the importance of the education in IT world. It makes my work quite hard but so far i can count myself successful in market conditions. Working in multi lengual office increases my knowledge and helps me to get new ideas to create bigger market. Idea exhange with other colleagues helps me to create new opportunities."

good,Good Place to work but too many politics. Sales teams were not communicating well and the customer was not put first.

good,"las tareas diasrias"
good,"A typical day at work was busy as I had deadlines to meet and meetings to attend to afterwards, reporting on the day's findings.I have learned to work better as a team; because you achieve more especially learning from others. Management was hard and didn't tolerate excuses, and co-workers were pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was top management changing their mind so often, and having to start all over. The most enjoyable part of the job was installing new equipment and seeing things from a different aspect."
good,"Fortune 500 company, horrible management very silo. Very friendly employees"

good,"Met veel plezier (samen)gewerkt in een uitdagende omgeving tijdens de periodes waarin onderwerpen als Innovatie/Digitalisering/Grootschalige omzetting naar Cloud oplossing een gegeven waren. De organisatie ondervond daar de nodige uitdagingen in om het beleid, de commercie en de operatie opnieuw op af te stemmen. Ik heb er veel interessante clienten en collegae ontmoet en soms sterk uitdagende opdrachten uitgevoerd in managementrollen danwel adviserende rollen in samenwerking met de clienten. Binnen IT blijft de uitdaging aan de supplierzijde altijd het spanningsveld tussen budget en leverdata, maar ik kan met plezier terugkijken op de wijze waarop het altijd weer mogelijk bleek om met elkaar de deadlines te halen."

good,Great place to learn new things and the management was encouraging you to do so.  Until new management came in.   Then things tended to be stay in your lane and don’t go out of what you do and know.   Companies were split off and new acquisitions happened and people were in a constant state of flux.  Not a great environment
good,"HP is a big enough company that is always lots of change, but with that comes opportunity.  However, it is almost too big to really make a difference at the individual contributor level."

good,"HP carried out many high-value projects for companies such as BP and for Government departments such as the Ministry of Justice. They carried through Data centre relocations, infrastructure, network management and IT support operations (for example, at Bank of America in London). The working environment was fairly relaxed and there was freedom to work as one wanted, commensurate with performing the role. It involved a fir amount of travel and out-of-hours working as on most occasions system migration work, for example, could only be performed at night or weekends."

good,Jag var min stora erfarenhet att arbeta både HP och Pfizer AB. Arbetsmiljö var utomordentligt bra. Både kontorskollegor och chefer är väldigt ödmjuka och stödjande. Jag har lärt mig mycket där och förbättrat mina tekniska färdigheter.

good,"Work environment and arrangement is very much ok compared to other companies i have worked with. Prior to merger, I would prefer this company to work for."
good,Supposedly most successful acquisition integration. Left as they closed many of the remote workforce and wanted employees to work at a main office building.  Product Marketing = Product Marketing + Product Management.
good,"HP blew it big time when they bought Compaq--both they and Dell were on their financial backs during the ""PC Wars"", which HP largely funded via ink and toner revenues--neither of which either Dell or CPQ had. The cultural change was horrific--the DNA was clearly incompatible. Thankfully, they split HP and most of the CPQ DNA went with HPE while the original remained with HPI. Which is why HPE is ailing and HPI is flourishing. Avoid the former and hire with the latter.  I never met an A-hole until HP bought CPQ...and it was the DEC contingent of survivors who were the worst. Burrrgh !  Ok, some were good folk--always the case--but not many."

Upper management is focused with common vision, lower level management has a lot of turnover although because of that, I've learned to work with mulitple managers and take key learnings away from them all. I absolutely love my co-workers and outside team members. The hardest part of the job is not having a defined job description which allows a lot of overflow activities to be put on your plate simply because you've learned how to get creative in finding answers. It takes away from productivity sometimes, yet it helps to build a better background of how the company works. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers, finding ways to save them money, creating new processes and working with my amazing team members."

good,"The work ambient with coworkers is great, some flaws here and there regarding management but no big deal, every job has their little issues, other than that I really liked working in HP."
good,"In IT I have gotten used to the high level of change and abrupt shifts in direction, but during my time there (just before the split) it was very chaotic, and the level of re-adjustments on projects required due to those shifts was definitely delaying project deliveries.  The people were smart, helpful, and were all working together to get things done, which is the best kind of environment I have found."

good,"Buen trabajo, hasta que se preocuparon mas por las numeros que por las personas."

good,While there were clear deadlines that needed to be met the atmosphere was not one of micro-management. You were given plenty of leeway to plan your day and complete your tasks  at your pace in your own way
good,Empresa muito boa para trabalhar com uma vasta plataforma com diversos cursos para o profissional se capacitar
good,"Good! Overall a good company and excellent work culture. Enjoyed working here first 4 years but later as Enterprise services merged with CSC, there is a lot of work culture change."
good,Fun place to work. Great atmosphere with people and management. Flexible time due family or college. Supportive while pursuing higher education. Low salary.
good,Great place but very fast paced.  Break rooms on every floor.  Always changing things but no one tells you.  You basically find out for yourself.  It is an older building and it floods in the garage so dont park in the lower level.

good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, pero dificil subir puestos"
good,"good company culture, lots of opportunity to learn, friendly coworkers, professional manager. ..........................................no job security,"
good,"HP provided a competitive salary and benefits however, you were always at risk of workforce reduction when your current assignment ended."
good,"HP, which bought Compaq, which bought Digital Equipment Corp - went through several cultural changes."
good,"I started out with Compaq in 1999 as a manufacturing/production manager in their Palo alto California location. Then there was HP/Compaq merger and i was requested to relocate. When relocating to houston,tx I was offered a global operations manager position where i was required to work from home. I was working over 40 Hrs. per week as during day time had to work with local customer contacts and in the late evenings was required to work with Overseas team to get the updates on orders, projects and upcoming changes.. So it was never a 40 Hrs. week. During my career at HP many CEO's changed and with that HP culture and work ethics changed. I loved my job as it was required to work across multi cultural environment and off course home office. but with home office it came with it issue as you locked up in the house all day long and don't get to see your co-workers, management or actual work environment..So you really lose touch with upper management then only see everything via papers and reports and based on that you get your reviews graded.but then you get used to it after few years.."
good,Hewlitt Packard is a strong company with global opportunities. Local management is very capable and compassionate. I would gladly work for them again.
good,"good commission offered to promoters, enjoyed the challenging and fast paced work style. developed my interpersonal skills and helped me to push beyond my limits to realise my worth ."
good,"Could use more collaboration across departments horizontally.  Overall a stable place to work, but not easy to change jobs or find new jobs in the company."
good,Excellent Opportunity to work. Worklife balance is very good. Management should review the team structure as there are often changes within the structure.
good,"Working as a call center representative had it's challenges, but they did try to make the work as fun as possible. We were rewarded for good calls, and they had fun on the holidays."
good,This is very best company as brand.but for salary issue so i am not intereseted this job.for i am interested in software programming company that causes.
good,"The company is growing and outsourcing.  The staffing model the company is going to is not going to be sustainable in the coming years.  The current CEO is a great leader, however."
good,"Fairly straight forward place to work, the people and nice and so were the benefits. While it did not work out for me, I wouldn't dissuade others from working there."
good,If you're a contractor expect low pay. Otherwise it is a very relaxed environment. HP employers have it much nicer with relatively good pay. If you're going into being a lab tech expect pay of 12/h. rip
good,When it was Compaq computer it was like a big family. I wasn't like going to work. When you woke up in the morning you did not dread going to work. I hope to find this true at Amazon.
good,Hewlett Packard has been and is good company. I worked there years before moving to Aerojet. One of the main employers in Roseville area. Nice campus as other companies have located in some of HP buildings now.

good,"HP Management over the last few years has not been the best, but the employees are best in class -- smart, innovative, honest, and responsible.  The employees made HP strong and a great place to work."
good,"Work life balance is very good.  Management is non-intrusive.  Very rigid when it comes to opportunities.  Always look at margins, rather than winning the deal at a fair price.  Decision making is hierarchical."
good,Working mostly in the nightshift. Learnt dealing with international customers in solving networking problems. Long travel to the workplace and handling many cases within a short time is always challenging. Good facilities and friendly environment have been enjoyable at the workplace. Good teamwork culture at the workplace.
good,Although my last 10 plus work years with HPE were very demanding and somewhat stressful ... I am very thankful for the opportunity I was give to both learn and develop many value skills in IT and Management.
good,Good company in which to build a career. Plenty of opportunity for career growth. Also there is the possibility to change careers as HP has many different roles and geographic locations

good,"You are expected to deliver to a result , but you have flexibility of doing stuff. Nobody questions the approach but the end result. great place to work."
good,"a day to day operations would be to review and update tickets , answer calls from Branch staff / Vendor and assist in any way possible to correct issue at hand. Management was available either on site or through  mobile , and online . Atmosphere at the work place was typical office environment. the best art of the job was daily interaction with staff."
good,A good place to work but the management does not care about the employees well being. They only want profit for the company and does not put themselves in the employees position
good,"Always looking of opportunities to do things in a simpler way , in a way pioneers in doing thing differently."
good,"Best company with awesome work life balance. Takes care of employee. Enough number of leaves and also year end shutdown, which allows 10 days of compulsory leave. Best place to start working."
good,"Great co-workers and most managers I worked for were terrific.  Had good training classes.  Hardest part of job was having to process off boarding of laid off employees when they were amazing, good employees.  Enjoyable part was the wonderful co-workers and I had mostly great managers."
good,"Overall a good place to work if you are o.k. with big companies."
good,"As this was my first job, every aspect that came in was providing new insights on the operations and procedures. The role helped me kick start my career by giving real-world scenarios and challenges."

good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar, ótimas oportunidades de aprendizado"
good,"HP is a great place to start your career with great people around you, great working environment and new learning. I started here in HP as a beginner straight from college and learned a lot of things. The company culture of the HP way is truly amazing as what our founders have demonstrated in years, though I hardly see that in the present management which is the sad thing for me. Management keeps you on the same role that you have even if it is not anymore what you want to do."
good,"Decent products, on the expensive side but it is arguably the best product but not very flexible across all segments.  Good people at a lower level but management doesn't convey a clear message as to what they are doing.  Most direction is given with a line straight out of a marketing handbook leaving most folks that don't hold an MBA wondering what the heck they're talking about."
good,"Good Company, Best part is Open door policy you see your VP;s next to you."
good,As a consultant the role is quite specific. Live in a hotel monday to friday and work in a close knit team. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it is fun.
good,"A good place to start your career for a fresher. The management is not up to date, however, the work culture Is nice. A typical day of work includes 4-5 hrs."
good,"I worked at HP for 10 years. I would say its the best company I have worked for and would love to rejoin if I got suitable position. the only down side was the benefits, I found it lower than market average"
good,"Good Work culture, but salary and other benefits are not good."
good,"Very good place to work, work culture and personal life balance is very good. looking forward to join once again. Management is employee friendly, which is very essential"
good,I enjoyed my time with HP and the world class education in business. They have challenges ahead but with great people they will work through them to obtain success.
good,poste agréable car sur une journée plusieurs chantier différent travail en équipe ou seule
good,"Using instructional designer and learning medias, my department was one of the first to create a PPS. It was an electronic system with online learning that connected all learning centers/systems in the organization. Our organization wrote a book on the elements of performance support for learning about large-scale system. "
good,I learned the role quickly but had to leave when funding wasn't forthcoming to keep me on. The hours were long but it was a fun environment and I worked as part of a fantastic team.
good,good company to work for..a lot od layoffs that create unneeded fear of loosing you job. Plenty of room to grow if you have a good manager. Work.life balance is ok as long as you work for a regional team.
good,I was an intern working at HP customer service centre. The perm staff were caring and nice to the interns and is willing to offer help when needed.
good,"You can find the right combination of work life balance, growth and stability at HP."
good,Perform IT support on federal financial Web applications that are critical to the Federal Reserve banks infrastructure . Provide IT –H P Enterprise support services by monitoring Infrastructure network systems and perform service desk tasks
good,Benefits arent bad and work/life balance was good. Easy to get lost in such a big company though. Same with any large company. Bonuses are not good though.
good,"HP is an amazing place to work. However because it is a global company, employees are expected to collaborate across time zones.  This could mean working at times you should be sleeping and still turning on to work in the morning."
good,"We were working with clients from around the world with alot of different technologies. I started off building Unix servers and then became a Global Team Lead working with employees from different countries. A lot of weekend work (Which is not bad, but not compensated properly) Most enjoyable part of the job working with different technologies and people."
good,Company has great perks and benefits but the constant reorganization and management policy changes are a bit much.  Management is non existent for the works and seem to promote themselves instead of their employees
good,"Dia típico: Manutenção preventiva das impressoras, reposição de papel e cartucho, criação de acesso as impressoras para os funcionários, abertura e fechamento de chamados, e controle de estoque."
good,I enjoyed working with them. I worked at a customer site and had minimal supervision in performing my work but had enough support when it was required.
good,"I learned a lot of new skills at HP around Release Management, and the onsite/offshore development model.  Good flexibility of onsite and remote working.  Change happens slowly due to the large corporate culture."
good,HPE is good place to work and specially for ladies due to flexible work time. Have a great team and that is one of the big reason for sticking to the job for quiet a few years.
good,HP is a great company to work for women because of the work culture. Their main focus is on Hardware industry and they don't give much importance to Technology and services area because of that reason it is running with very minimal projects.
good,I enjoyed working in the environment. The people were amazing and took pride in their work. It was a fast pace environment with never a dull moment.
good,"Overall Good place to work."
good,"Losing manufacturing to Asia for several years. Not growing development opportunities to compensate, despite intentions to do so. Also under pressure from US sites for development work."
good,"Durante mi experiencia como empleada de HP aprendí prácticamente todo lo que se sobre computadoras, impresoras y demás hardware, gracias a la solidaridad y buen compañerismo de mis compañeros que me enseñaron con gran predisposición y paciencia. "
good,"A lot has changed in the years I have worked at hp. In the beginning hp was known for the best work environment in the industry. They went out of their way to hire the best of the best. If you were lucky to get hired you joined a corporate family that looked out for their own.  It was like getting married. Great benefits, excellent resources and continuing education.  Unfortunately since Bill and Dave's passing the company has become an aggressive overseas employer leading to reduced benefits, compensation and an atmosphere that continually has the shadow of layoff's hovering over head.  Most of their workforce is now contractual with poor compensation, no benefits and frequent layoffs. A rather poor legacy to a once wonderful company."
good,"Open door policy, supportive management & co workers. "
good,"Generally, the people are very reasonable and nice to work with, except that sometimes it can be very stressful as you need to constantly create value for the company."
good,"Doordat HP zo groot geworden is en de belangen van het management zwaarder wegen dan dat van de klanten en de verantwoordelijkheden geheel in een administratief proces ondergebracht zijn is de uitdaging ten nadele veranderd. Deze verandering werkt erg door op het personeel en de sfeer van het bedrijf. Het contact met de klanten en het kunnen werken met de nieuwste technieken waren een pre, de uitdaging om de zaken ondanks de administratieve tegenwerking toch voor elkaar te krijgen gaven energie. Echter het constante afbreken van bevoegdheden en verantwoordelijkheden werkten negatief door."
good,"A day starts with a meeting from our manager, sharing updates, new changes, seating plan etc. This was indeed a great thing as we would be  ready for any new questions from our customers. Management was very friendly and helpful. End of the day it was always with the same energy as it was at the beginning of the day."
good,"Project aims - To provide data modelling and analysis to Sales Manager (Team) in advance of projected sales marketing campaign."
good,"A typical day at work consists of being very productive but the environment is laid back. Management is decent but could use some improvement. The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines, but I enjoy being busy at work."
good,"Got the opportunity to work with big brand like HP (Hewlett Packard)"
good,"Outstanding place to work. I currently work as the onsite specialist for RMA’s & Credit generation and follow through to book in for all EMEA region within Order operations department.

good,"It was nice to work."
good,"Otima empresa, estive alocado no cliente, por isso o reconhecimento foi um pouco mais dificil, entretanto foi muito bom trabalhar na empresa."
good,"Empresa com ambiente agradável, porém muito comum o acumulo de função com baixo reconhecimento e gestores não capacitados para motivar os funcionários."
good,"In general a pretty decent place to work, HPE is a very reasonable employer."
good,"You go into work, but because of it's diverse culture, you feel the time passing by fast. They offer incentives for good/hard work like free lunches, gift card, and HP points (which can be used to purchase every brand merchandise on HP's store website)."
good,"Productive and fun work place but should have little more importance "
good,"I really like my job.  I work with a number of talented individuals who share technical abilities when requested.  The company is very flexible with work hours as long as you put in the required 40 hours, you can do it as what meets your schedule."
good,"In both of my organisation i loved my job and the team i worked with. "
good,"I love working at HPE. Great co-workers, great management. Upper management is just like at any other large corporation though."
good,HP was a mature company in terms of PMO processes as well as customer facing skills.  HP management was average.My initial management was very good but as time went on the new management skills were a bit lacking.
good,"Flexible shift timings, had very good bounding with co workers."
good,"- Nice place to work."
good,"Excellent benefits"
good,"Very understanding and friendly managers. Very good work/ life balance. "
good,"The great part of working for HP Enterprise are the people, flexible work schedules, casual atmosphere.  The challenge is the ongoing workforce reductions which has reduced morale leaving employee's feeling discouraged.  There is no loyalty to employee's.  You can work hard, be a committed and valuable employee with year after year exceptional reviews and be gone with a blink of an eye....very sad."
good,"Where can you learn about sales. Easy answer. HP. With a worldwide well known business, you are in a position to learn about all products, sales strategies and so much more."
good,"aprendi muchas direcciones y ubicacion en la ciudad, los compañeros son agradables y colaboradores, aveces era complicado porque se tenian muchas diligencias y poco tiempo para ejecutarlas."
good,Worked from home. Good exposure to different technologies. People were fun and friendly. Work flow was evenly paced. Managers were very cool people.
good,"call customer, sechedule part delivery, maintence window, and discuss what and why...go do the job,, make sre ok, cleanup.."
good,Day starts early for me so that I can catch up with my colleagues located in the USA.  Working in the company has given me opportunities to work across cultures.  This company has open door policy and employees can just talk to their senior management if they have any issues.  My co-workers are great and we are always ready to help out each other regardless of the time difference.
good,"It was a great opportunity working for HP."

good,Good workplace with supporting team and management.Has a open door policy.The most enjoying part of job was learning and lots of Training from Company side.
good,"I spent several years working at Hewlett-Packard, and I enjoyed my time there.  It paid a competitive salary, gave good benefits, and gave some options for telecommuting and other benefits that were nice."
good,Poor management in the last 4 years. They say they promote from within and then almost all executives are hired externally. They sever long time employees to make room for the new ones they hand pick.
good,"Was able to resolve a ticket that had been under pending by another agent and the user had gained access to his computer and was able to continue his work with the PC."
good,"I've worked for HP Enterprise Services for 10+ years, having transitioned in from EDS.  I enjoy my job, my role and particularly the people I work with.

good,Overall a good company to work for. But very hard to find time for other activities as you will be involved with work activities.
good,i loved this job. unfortunately the campaign closed i learned how to fix issues people face every day while using the internet. had a great group i worked with. hardest part of my job was issues with computers that i never dealt with before. but the best part of my job was to make someone i never spoke to before happy cause i was able to solve there problems.
good,Co worker are very helpful. They understand individuals problem and do everything to resolve them. Learned various strategies to work in such pressurized environment.
good,"This was a great place to work. Upper Level Management support was above and beyound the call of duty."
good,Good place to work - given that you are lucky to have a supportive manager. They place a great deal of trust on an employee.
good,Great company to work and nice immediate manager. People are friendly. Always start the day with a smile. Flexibility to work from home whenever required.

good,"HP has been a great place to work. With any growing company, there have been moments of stress. But through strong leadership and a clear mission (I help people get jobs), HP has been an amazing place to work. The challenges are daily and varied and leave me satisfied. I have grown a lot working here and see a lot of potential for more in the future."
good,I enjoyed working with HP because it was a fun and productive learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge of computers with my love of working with people every day
good,A good place to work with having good security for women employees.. But not happy with the rewards and salary.Management decisions related to rating employees was not done correctly. Had learnt a lot from the company had fun also. Changes in management sometimes makes the team go in a wrong way. Benefits other than cab facility was not given.
good,"Hp provides me great environment, need new challenges, preferably in similar area (security). I'm multidisciplinary with strong technical background."
good,The company is in constant state of flux. No clear direction. Too many changes ALL the time. Very unstable environment.
good,"Dynamic team making up a dynamic company. Extensive Training and you dont seem to be doing the same thing day in day out."
good,"I only worked there for a couple of years, and the whole time it seemed like people kept talking about job security. Co-workers were concerned about losing their jobs constantly"
good,"HP is a great company if are lucky enough to have the appropriate manager. "
good,"Fast pace working environment, all work starts from install the operation system for your own new laptop yourselves. Strong communication with peers but less opportunities to discuss with managers."
good,"I have a lot of flexibility in my current job and this is great, whenever needed I can work at home or go to the office. "

good,"Level 1/2 support is typically handled by off-shore teams, while the on-shore teams concentrate on providing level 3/4 support to the off-shore teams and resolution of more complex technical issues, and managing and completing project level work."
good,"Muy buena empresa para iniciar a desarrollar las habilidades que te dejo la carrera, la mayor parte de mis conocimientos profesionales que tengo hoy en día son gracias a esta empresa, ya que cuando empiezas te capacitan muy bien, te dan las habilidades necesarias para tener una idea muy clara y transparente de como funciona una empresa y eso a largo plazo es invaluable."
good,HP was a nice place to work with good opportunities to improve your overall skills. Co-workers and management were on par with other companies of this size however you can get lost in day to day duties due to the amount of people that are involved on projects. There is a large separation between HP employees benefits and contractor benefits. Also contracted employees are left out of many activities but expected to perform at the same level and be held responsible at the same level.
good,Process  is followed  strictly and project management is very good. But  the salary benefits are very poor and you rarely  get appreciated for the hardwork you put in.
good,"Good communications for all HP activities .Open door policy , No internet restriction .More social responsibility and employee engagement activity ."
good,Enjoyed production putting together product for HP Invent people use in the everyday lives.Worked well with co-workers and managers.

I never had any issues with the HR department and they always treated me as an integral part of the company.
good,"en general el dia se va muy rapido"
good,"My day consists of working with my HP team as well as meeting with customers. Preparing and presenting presentations to customers, CEO's IT Managers, Procurement teams.

I am unable to leave the contract and stay with in HP due to the way HP hired people on in on this contract.  The problem many of the workers face is they have worked years with no wage adjustment and receive much of blame for any issue that arises regardless of who's fault it truly is.

The company has separated into two different business entities  (HPE and DXC) due to the merger."
good,"felt as though my ideas and goals were never addressed or taken seriously. I was laterally moved into different departments, but over 7 years, I never received a true promotion.

good,"My managers were amazing. They took the time to work with you on anything you didn't understand. I did not work at the office, i worked from home so im not sure how the workplace culture is. The most enjoyable part of my position was getting to deal with many clients and was able to prove that i was up for whatever project or task that was needed. The most difficult part was sometimes was dealing with clients that are very rude but you always need to bite your tough and be pleasant. Sometimes they just took out there frustrations of the day on you and you just learn that it is not personal."
good,Since the New CEO took over the company she split the company into two divisions This took away some of the benefits that we had and after awhile she sold the division that we were working in. Most employees were let go and had to find other work.
good,HP gives you all the tools you need to experiment and learn. A very flexible work schedule but also high on accountability. A lovely matrix organization that let's you collaborate across a wide diaspora of functions and skills. It is an organization that truly 'trusts' you.
good,this caused a huge hemorrhaging of experience and negative morale as the experience was replaced with postgraduates.HPE took on the mentality that the more project managers and meeting held would improve delivery even though they shed all the workforce.
good,I haven't worked for HP since Novemeber 2006.  My Managers have retired at this time and/or have moved onto other positions inside and out of the company.
good,It's been more than a decade since I worked there but it was a great company that just did too much outsourcing and off shoring. That greatly impacted the stability of the business

good,"Since I joined HPE, I am always ready and proactive for my start of the day as I am lucky to be part of this friendly team of 4. We have fun times and work times so that balances my work time. Management is very co-operative and they know how to treat their staff. No issues so far since 2013. Hardest part of the job is when 2 staff gets sick for a week and covering was hard esp. when you working 12hr shift per day."
good,"I like working at HP, it's a good company.   There's a lot of good people who work hard to make it all happen.   That said, I'd like to move to cloud sales and that's not an option for me there."
good,"Layed off do to lack of money."
good,"Uma multinacional, que me ajudou muito em relação a experiência profissional, porém ela não me dava oportunidades de crescer profissionalmente. E por isso, com passar do tempo, já não estava mais sendo agradável para mim."
good,Good employees and people to work with.  Management had a tendency to shift with the wind (budget cuts etc)  that made it hard to keep programs on track.
good,"Good work life balance"
good,The job was fun but very fast paced and somewhat stressful because you had to build a certain amount of computers during your shift.Also there are no benefits.
good,"Trust in the employee, many developmental opportunities and the people really matters. They allow flexibility regarding working hours. I love working at HP."

good,"Contract work is not a ""foot in the door"" for permanent job, rather it is a stop gap for cheap and easy labor without obligation for benefits.  Team and management culture are great but conversion to permanent employment isn't supported."
good,I was able to learn about newer technologies like data piping and alternate options for data storage and processing. Also learned a little bit about cloud development
good,Overall great company with lots of room for advancement.  Company values it's employees and their contributions to the company focus. Benefits and overall company culture are a key benefit.
good,Management played a vital part in day to day activities.  Everyone were team players and assisted where they could to complete tasks.  HP also had great benefits.

good,The company is no longer what it use to be.  It use to be fun but it is no longer challenging enough. If you want to be challenged then go to work for a startup company
good,"Loved working there in its heyday.  Looked forward to going to work every day."
good,"attend daily team meeting"
good,"HP was a great place to start after working on an engineering degree. I was often frustrated that I wasn't in a more influential position, but I was offered advancement shortly after leaving and am confident that things would've worked out. I often recommend both Hewlett-Packard as well as the limited capacity role of chemical technician in and R&D laboratory to engineering bachelor's graduates  because I got good exposure to the PhD scientists who I was serving and was innoculated with an efficient work place culture before my later positions would set similar responsibilities upon me. Some of my fellow 2013 graduates went straight into refinery process management in Texas and were subsequently fired for lack of experience and something like that can be traumatic to one's reputation as well as enthusiasm for this type of work. Thanks, HP!"
good,I joined HP straight out of college in their Global IT organization right before the split. There are a lot of bright minds at the company with exciting and challenging projects. It was a great platform to get some good experience out of school and brand my resume with a very reputable company.

good,"I was thrilled to be called back to work as a contractor for a great team at HP. We did everything right, including coming in under budget on a regular basis. Unfortunately, however, due to other departments poor financial management, HP chose to terminate the project early. After my initial shock, I was glad to have been laid off early, because the remaining few on my team were tasked with laying off all of the other affected employees and contractors and then themselves. Very sad."
good,"This company is good in all aspects especially the work environment. Work from home, flexible timing are provided to it's employees. But in my view they are under paying it's employees."

good,"HPE is a good company in terms of job stability, management framework and overall company process. You are in luck if you start your career here. Only concern is promotion and salary increase is very slow"
good,"Very good company but went through major over haul. 70,000 jobs were cut that did not have dedicated account support. No open requisitions to save employment."
good,"HP was a great place to work because of the coworkers. Services was a stressful field not because of the work, but daily not knowing if your job would be around. Working on the latest hardware was always one of the highlights of the job."
good,Morning status meetings set the priorities for daily events. Weekly project update meetings determined whether or not we needed additional manpower or man hours to keep project on schedule. Monthly project status meetings determined how well the life cycle progressed or digressed.
good,I enjoyed the team effort and the collaborative nature of this job. The supervisors are understanding and supportive. There is plenty of opportunity to learn.
good,"Contracted position that was supposed to go forward for many more months & suddenly the state of Arkansas demanded that the service be moved to HP's offices inside of Arkansas. We were not told of the move or offered a transfer, it just ended that ended abruptly. Entire team was laid off."
good,"HP is  great company and was a pleasure to work for. This was a while ago, so I cannot speak to the current environment. However, at the time, the culture and work was enjoyable though advancement potential was limited."
good,"I was a Deployment Supervisor so I traveled 100% of the time to different facilities. I learned to deal with all kind of customers, so me difficult and some friendly. My typical work day was on average between 10-14 hours. I was in a management position so I was required to complete all the end of shift paperwork as well as monthly training for myself and employees as required. The hardest part of the job was the long working hours sometimes and the most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to different locations and meeting interesting people."
good,"Management lacked direction from above."
good,"fun place, good hours, liked the work.Everyone was willing to help each other. Some great laughs, even when working 12 hr shifts."
good,HP is the one of the best company to work with. Flexible shift timing and good work and life balance company. I will prefer my friends to work with this company.

good,It is fast pace work environment. I loved doing my job and learning new things. To me it's all about team work. It was the Alabama medicaid call center. I looked up claims. Changed addresses. Updated names dates of birth. Sometimes i had to do intense research and made sure i always got back to my recipient on the progress. And always made sure it was resolved.

One of the more challenging part was to understand the complexity of IT and how business units are interwoven to provide a more complete solution to the customer. In break time I go out to lunch with my co workers and we catch up about the weekend or vacations, etc."
good,Excellent company and market leader. Good quality and professional co-workers. HP has almost all solutions for clients
good,"Work was very stressful.  I did love working with the HP customers one on one. Hardest part of the job was the fact that HP management changed so often.  This was difficult for everyone.     The HP culture was always intense because the company was not doing well and made a lot of bad business decisions that has literally broken the company in two.  HP did have a lot of wonderful employee benefits such as doctor, pharmacy, credit union, and workout facility on premises.  I am though very appreciative that I did get a chance to work at EDS especially and then HP."

good,Love running the production line and working with my co-worker that I've known for years. We are like a family and we all look after each other on the production floor. The job is not hard but you have to be careful and focus on safety. And we make sure we enforce safety. The hard part of the job is that we don't get no recognition for going above and beyond your job.
good,"Como gerente de projetos eu atuava fora do site da empresa, ou seja, na casa do Cliente. Isto me proporcionava a tomar decisões, saber entender e tratar o Cliente, com o objetivo de atingir as metas do projeto. Bem como fazer com que a empresa pudesse vender mais."
good,"Everyday I am getting new opportunity to learn and grow. Practicing what is in my knowledge and gaining new experience by handling day-to-day operational challenges, is making it more interesting and inspiring for me. My reporting team, peers and managers, all are very professionally aligned with the project goals and supporting each other to achieve success. I believe that attaining Customer delight and project success can happen only when we work as a team, contributing more than 100% and by being focus.  "
good,A typical big company with no opportunity to grow.  Top leadership team does not know how to grow the company.  Benefit keeps shrinking.

good,"This job at first exposed me to several different computer programs that I had to become familiar with and eventually led to me being able to assist in customizing a package tracking program when it was upgraded in 2008.  Because I worked as a third party contractor at a computer company we were given the latest versions of Microsoft Office, Outlook, and Internet Explorer.  I am a people person and was glad when I got the chance to provide customer service to them. I had a boss tell me once that I got a promotion and pay raise because he knew that I would always put the customer first.  Many applications I've recently filled out ask for a few recommendations, but I could provide at least 20, maybe more.  I was the go to person when anything urgent was happening.  Working within a team I processed purchase orders, shipments, delivered them where and when needed, and was a huge part in set up and tear down of several of the trade shows that happened.  I was also able to gain some experience in ocean freight and truck shipments."
good,"Se siente el apoyo en la organización,  existen herramientas de colaboración para el buen desempeño."
good,"The company on a whole is very helpful and friendly, its more like a family than a work place. The only issue i had found is promotion doesn't come a long very often. Most staff are above the age of 60 and have done the same thing for 20 years."

good,"HP is a good place to work. However, having over 300,000 workers world-wide can make a worker feel small. Nonetheless, HP does make it easy for anyone to contact anyone else in the company (really)."
good,With my time in HP in Singapore i was given the oppurtunity to work with teams consisting of multinational expatriats as well as locals. The culture we built on our account was unique in the way that we as a service provider faced a client that was constantly evolving and changing its needs.

We had multiple conference calls a week, team meetings and discussions about the direction of the company from a high level. I learned how to be a successful sales rep when given very little information about the customer, little to no direction and little experience. The hardest part about the job was learning from management who did not know much about the job themselves or what they were doing in their position. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself. The atmosphere was very nice, the people were young, aspiring and motivated to work everyday. It was a great place to build your net-work and your net-worth!"

good,"Even though the allocated cubical spaces are shrinking as HP tries to cram their workers into smaller and smaller spaces to save on electrical bills, the environment here is still friendly and inviting. Not one person was hard to deal with or had any kind of ""off-attitude."" It may be the town (Fort Collins is a very friendly, easy going place), the weather, the proximity to the mountains, and number of things.

I really enjoyed my co-workers and my management worked with me to complete tasks.  The most difficult part of my job was interfacing with a very demanding customer.  The most enjoyable part was the constant change and introduction to new technology."
good,Great benefits and pretty good pay for being a company of that size. Hard to move up. Slow to get raises. 
good,"Hard & satisfactory work"
good,"This is where I entered the IT profession as a network technician. So far the experience has been great. The larger corporation offers many ways to advance, but in the lower levels at a local level the advancement is hard to get. I do love my job though."
good,"There was a good variety in the work. Pay is just average. Good opportunities for learning and development. There is a strong culture of ethical behaviour. The organization is supportive, although this tends to drop away for field staff."
good,"In the midst of the many disgruntled employees and negativity you often find throughout the office, management rewards those that come to work everyday to make a difference.  There is a vacuum of young leadership, and I would certainly recommend HP as a place to work if you are looking for great experience, a company with diverse products and opportunities, good compensation, and opportunities for advancement... just don't expect the advancement opportunities to be handed to you, you must manage your own career."
good,"A typical day is answering quesstions and concerns on claims,changes in policy.  I have learned Part A and Part B of Medicare bene correspondence and helping on the Welcome letters of New Providers.  It is a very stressfull  call center but hen you have a great support system it works well."
good,ou were either on the road or on call manning the phones. I would travel to clients Training them or helping with workflow or color management. There were 5 other AE that we could refer to of bounce ideas off of if we had a problem that we could not figure out. The hardest time was when we got busy the constant traveling and away from family. But the pay was good and there were times you could spend at home on the answering the phones.
good,"I loved my job and enjoyed going to work."
good,Large company but looks after its employees well except financially.
good,"A lot of career opportunities if you work hard."
good,"As an Inside Sales Rep for HP my day consisted of making phone calls, sending emails into my assigned geographical sales area. I would speak with customers and resellers about the importance of utilizing all HP programs and maintaining/updating their current printing fleet. "
good,"The work day as well as work load is very unpredictable on a daily bassis and that all depends on call volume. I've learned a lot about the operation, failure and diagnostic procedures for the Meritor WABCO components on a wide variety of commercial vehicles in the industry. The co-workers are pretty cool and easy to get along with most of the time. The hardest part about the job is trying to get a million other things done while taking calls to assist customers with troubleshooting and warranty claims in addition to emails, case follow ups, voicemails, and training when call volume is extremely high. The most enjoyable part about the job is when you know that you've truly helped a customer to the best of your ability and they show their appreciation for it."
good,"Pela natureza da área de TI, um dia típico poderia ser calmo ou agitado, porém o ambiente e condições de trabalho eram favoráveis."
good,"Learning new technologies, getting to implemented H3C Switches and Routers in Dual Data Centers. Sharing knowledge with team members to learn from each other to carrry out the solution to problem as a Network Engineer(s) which were faced as a Network Deployment Engineer."
good,"My typical day at HP started with checking and returning emails from the night before, attending conference calls with team members at other HP locations or agency contacts to handle day-to-day business regarding all marketing production work, which included both digital and traditional print marketing activities. I worked with creative agencies, printers, and stakeholders from all major business units on marketing activities such as the Small & Medium Business catalog, direct mail, email, trade show collateral, magazine print ads, and FSI's. I also worked with the metrics team to report and analyze all data associated with the marketing activities I managed. I've been the creator of the marketing brief, the overseer of the creative agency, the payer of the invoices, and the reporter of the data which gives me an edge in managing multi-million dollar campaigns at every level."
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers because we all get along. The hardest part of my job would be when I would have to someone away because I cannot complete there order. My managers are great but I think there verification process needs improvement.
good,"Number 1 asset : HP people, focused and committed to results despite the noise in the industry about HP future."
good,I worked for HP for several years. I learned something new everyday and loved the challenge it provided me. My job was outsourced or I would not have left the company. I loved my job working as a Service Consultant Specialist.
good,Typical workday is very productive. New adventures all the time.
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável de se trabalhar, onde buscam extrair o máximo de você para melhorar a cada dia."
good,Hp is a employee friendly organization with good environment
good,Would have liked to get hired direct and spend the rest of career.
good,"I worked in the commercial printer specialty for HP following their acquisition of an off-shore company where I was previously employed. They handled a difficult merger of the two cultures with aplomb and treated us very well. I understand things have changed, but HP was a darn fine company when I was there."
good,"Work place is simply superb, good understanding between the team and management,"
good,"I have experience the best work life balance in this company. At the end of my work time I can enjoy my time with my family and enjoy my time to rest. I do not worry of anyone calling me to ask help to fix or build a server. The people are friendly especially my colleagues, they are willing to share their knowledge, giving out the right process and share their thoughts. In this company I was given an opportunity to attend a presentation workshop and present to L1 and L2 engineers about Windows 2008."
good,"HP is an extremely large company and as such it is organizationally bloated. That being said, considering the downsides that apply to most large companies, the company culture, albeit various, is pretty down to earth. Management would do well to learn how to motivate employees, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,Good environment to work.
good,"I want to tell that HP is good company culture wise, Where you have lot of things to learn here, Co-workers are very friendly."
good,upward mobility and core work values are paramount
good,A typical workday was busy from morning till night with very little down time. I started as a Customer Service Representative and fine tuned my customer relation skills as part of an Escalation Team. I moved on to spend some time as an Advocate for members on T-19 insurance. I later moved to a department which verified and updated insurance policies offered by member's employers.
good,Usually very structured days but very dependent on managers involved and re-organizations that complicate and slow down work processes. Here there is a lot of efficiency to gain. I m learning new things but wished to be in a position were my ideas and creative input showed up a little bit more instead of getting stuck in a lot of production work. However that evens up easily with very good co-workers that's being reflective and also using have good communication skills.
good,"Great Company to work for, but if you are not looking for growth then this is not for you"
good,Variety of IT support equipment with excellent co-worker and management communication.
good,Fun place to work with teams that are passionate about their work. Had a subsidized breakfast program which was really nice.
good,Very casual dressing. I learned a lot about dealing with different types of customers and business partners.
good,I was one of 6 testers hired to write and test manual test scripts for state project to overhaul and update support tracking for custodial parents. Worked closely with onsite developers to identify then successfully retest code defects prior to statewide implementation. Biggest challenge was to navigate constant changes and additions to project scope and to deal with shifting deadlines from our state line of business partners.
good,"Answered calls on a typical day. Calls averaged between 25-100 depending what is going on sales ect. The management moved around alot but stayed at the same level when the new manager took over. The hardest part of the job was have to take on new managers, you have to learn how they want to run the group, but overall it was a smooth transition. The most enjoyable part of the job was everyday, it was fun and enjoyable to work there."
good,"Six decades before high tech and dot coms existed, classmates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard built an audio oscillator in a garage and launched a technology revolution. That's it, it all starts in a garage again. Additionally today, it is more stable, having car policy, giving some training and leader in IT."
good,"Role involves business enablement of the strategic goals set by the management. Engagements are in the form of year long program driven to improve process efficiency and lean delivery model. Participation in planning activities requires scenario building, discussions and stakeholder reconciliation to come up with the business plan for the fiscal. This is indeed the most intriguing part of the job since it gives insight to the business drivers while designing the go forward strategy. And this requires structuring business programs and data analysis for recommendations to the business which undergo several iterations and sometimes becomes demanding."
good,"Multinacional de grande porte, com valores e culturas fortes, onde desenvolvi praticamente todo meu curriculum profissional. Excelente empresa, bom ambiente profissional, excelentes treinamentos. A desejar na remuneração."
good,You will get promotion without hike. No Presuure. You can manage your work and personal life. Its really good for people who already have enogh money.
good,"In a nutshell a balanced environment, better interaction with sales people over different nationalities,also developed better and healthy relation with co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work included the review and renewing of customer's maintenance contracts. Talking to customers, preparing quotes, problem resolutions, system updates, and quota forecasting, The days activity has taught me time patience, time management, and how to effectively work under pressure. The hardest part of the job was working through the internal processes. The most enjoyable part of the job was working directly with the customers providing solutions, up selling and closing business."
good,*Very fast paced
good,"Performing break/fix on laptops,desktops, and printers. Interacting with clients prior to going to site to repair products. Picking up parts at UPS hold for pick up location. I learned I love working with people in every aspect of life. Those Individuals in corporate, small business, and home sites. I loved working with my team and assiting them when needed. The most difficult part of my job was sometimes not satisfying my clients on the initial visit to site when it came to recommended parts for break/fix repairs. I love working with poeple every day."
good,"HP is a good company to work,internal politics is there,which is making me think to change this company."
good,"Current company is great place to work. I have learned how to handle technical issue's, developed the presentation skills also to communicate with the customers and the sales persons."

good,Meetings with HP Houston Progam Manager for whole project
good,"HP was a Great Company to work for !! A fun, exciting, and terrific"
good,"You put in long hours, but the rewards of helping clients is worth it. What I learned or relearned is that there is no punch in punch out time with HP and that's ok. they're outcome driven, have great technology."
good,Nice atmosphere to work around. People easy to get along with.
good,"Block schedule was very nice (12 hour shifts, 3 days a week, and every other weekend), which allowed for quite a bit of free time on days off. Free training was very nice however gave no certificates for completion. Starting pay was nice and one is not required to have any experience to start working there. Management needed some work. Over 2/3 of the factory did not speak english and QA were expected to watch over those people with no real way of communication. Miss-communication would mean the QA was held responsible for any fault of the non-English speaking factory workers regardless of excuse."
good,Outstanding environment
good,"Brand value is recognized , and Work and family life is able to balance."
good,Interesting and exciting technology company with great potential; I loved working there. The management teams run around with there heads cut off constantly changing company direction and confusing consultants and clients.
good,"HP is an evolving company. Products, service, positions and locations are all subject to change. If you can adapt to a changing business environment then HP is for you. If you are afraid of change then find something else."
good,"The biggest change at HP over the last 10 years was the pullback from making things to making ideas that never leave the ground. Unfortunately, the company's management believes they can create a great idea that will fuel the company along to new heights, but you learn by doing and I don't think they realize that."
good,"Working for West coast intake facilities. Was on call, 24/7 for intakes"
good,The day starts at 7am and moves very fast till 6pm. The requirements to succeed are focus and dedication to the task
good,Enjoyed working for HP. I think it has been the best compay I have ever worked for.
good,HP is one of the big company who has huge network enviroment ..lots to learn
good,The company has a very good work life balance. Work culture is very good.
good,HP respects their employees and supports continued education and work life balance. I left to start a Real Estate Business. I've wanted to go back since the RE crash.
good,"Strong team work environment, more emphasis on short term problem solution. Excellent work environment for new ideas and suggestion for improving current technologies"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning. I felt that the leadership team was great too. They knew all of their employees on a first-name basis and tried to make those personal connections."
good,"Wonderful work location at hp, Fun and training, which help us to grow Internally"
good,Here i worked as a field support engineer at client site Welspun Group also after working for three years I promoted as a team leader. Later i moved to work with IBM project with the same position
good,HP is a great company with lots of groups and jobs to try many things in your career. The challenge was after multiple splits and merges the management has become fairly flat so upward promotions are difficult to come by.
good,"Great culture and management. I had the opportunity to meet a few skillful people who were ever willing to assist fellow team members progress."
good,"The job grades and bonus structure can be difficult to navigate.  Merit bonuses are based on manager and coworker evaluations.  "
good,"As I mentioned above, it wasn't always stressful. Certain times of the month were stressful as I had big reports to generate and they needed to balance. At first it was very stressful as I didn't know the job and there was lots to learn."
good,"Pros: "
good,"Good and very employee friendly. good work life  balance. Company work culture is great and they take care of their employees. "
good,It was a great experience. Had gained good work. Able to learn New skills. Train the team. Had a chance to talk to the leadership team and to know the business process
good,"Typical day at work in spent on empowering and enabling my team, handling top priorities / escalations, enabling business teams, Meetings & email replies, "
good,Ho lavorato continuativamente come consulente di vendita per hp per 2 anni poi ho dovuto lasciare per motivi personali ma quando ho chiesto di rientrare sono stata di nuovo la benvenuta. Ovviamente come tutti i lavori di promoter non sono a tempo indeterminato ma molte persone (mamme o disoccupati) ne hanno fatto un vero e proprio lavoro nei ritagli di tempo (o per passione) e il rapporto é durato molto anni. La formazione è continua e ben impostata sia sui prodotti che sulle tecniche di vendita. Esperienza sicuramente stimolante e formativa.
good,"Great place to work.  "
good,"Relaxed Work Atmosphere, not much presssure to deliver things. Good Work from home options. Cordial Management. Flexible timings and lot of leaves and Furlough periods."
good,"Never a duplicate day at the office; always changing and evolving."
good,I have been working here for last 12+ years . During my long tenure I have thoroughly enjoyed my work here & got an opportunity to work @ Print /PC/Supplies /Display /Attach Divisions ( Consumer /Commercial & Enterprise GTMs ) along with Product Management .  Met 101% Sales Quota consistently for last 12 years & accomplished all my Goals on YoY basis .
good,"Ambiente donde las personas siempres están dispuestas a ayudarse, hay momentos y lugares divertidos-"
good,Great place to work. Great people. I worked in times where there was not a lot of downsizing though so not sure how it is today. I'd think it would depend on what area/business unit you work your experience would vary. I'd still recommend it.
good,HP has introduced me with information security. The culture was very effective in terms of team collaborations. The downside is their response to employee feedbacks about management.
good,"Having good experience working over there and learned automation tools of HP such HPSAS, HPOO etc. "
good,"I was able to work independently. Management trusted that I was doing my job and I was not micromanaged. The company had great employee benefits and was very understanding when there were family circumstances that called for missed work. There were other areas of the company that had the opportunity to work remotely but I was not able to do so. Had I had that opportunity, it may have played a factor in my decision to seek work elsewhere."
good,The company as a whole is not the worse thing. I genuinely did see a fair amount of impressive work within the facility. They coordinated management and work very well and goals were definitely achievable on a individual basis.
good,"As a Marketsource rep for HP, my main tasks were to push HP products at the stores I was placed in as well as to build relationships with sales associates, department managers, and store managers. While working for the best interests of both Marketsource and the store I was placed in, I learned the important ability to prioritize responsibilities. Marketsource management helped throughout my tenure by keeping the sales reps focused on short-term and long-term objectives."
good,"Since separation from the enterprise side of the biz in late 2015, HP Inc has been squeezing every last drop out of that turnip that is inkjet printing.  For the most part, HP owns the inkjet print market but beyond consumer print, nobody wants it and consumer print is a double digit % down-trending biz.  3D print, print as a service, and the continued partnership with Canon for laser printing contracts is where this company is focusing its efforts.   I did not see any real innovation coming out of the PC side of the biz since the separation.  If you are in R&D, you may find jobs in 3D but be warned that it’s basically a total liability for the company at this time (low sales with high investment $’s)."
good,"HP has a great corporate culture and the people and technology is great.  With that said, the continual restructuring made it difficult to trust the leadership."
good,"Its great Company to work. Work life balance, work flexibility, supporting management. Also great learning during my tenure. Got full support from colleague and managers."
good,"Took fourth level escalations for customers. Worked directly with each customer to come up with a resolution on how to fix or replace inoperative HP products. Extremely efficient at multitasking, including working 40 plus cases concurrently."
good,The only thing that I would change is the pay rate they start people out at. Really good people to work for.Great coworkers and nice management. Care about the employees
good,"I have nothing to say about working at HP. I worked remotely for most of the time I was there. Management was fine until the layoffs started, which we all know, sucks!!!"
good,HP was a great place to work.  There is an entrepreneur spirit.  The management team is very focused on driving objective through the organization.  HP emphasizes aligning individual goals and objectives with the overall company strategy.  Having employees both stateside and in Europe and Asia was very rewarding.
good,"I have worked at HP for 28 years.  During this time I was able to change job types 6 different times.  HP sent me to classes so that I could do the job better and it was exciting to learn the state of the art technical ways of accomplishing tasks, or streamlining the processes. Job security has changed during those years and so has all of industry.  If you are younger than 30 years old, this is a great place to look for a job. HP is a world class manufacturer and it was exciting and challenging but well worth the effort."
good,"Employee Oriented Company."
good,I really like the people I work with. I enjoy my job responsibilities. I would recommend Hewlett Packard to other individuals for full time employment.
good,"It was ok"
good,"Good company to build your career. Great culture, friendly people, opportunity for learning and advancement. Frequent change in management causes distraction. Open door policy."
good,"Working for HP was a very good experience. I had a very good team. We worked together on projects and shared the work loads with each other. We did cross training with each other to bring everyone up to speed as a team. Beside the good team, I had a most wonderful management team which includes the team-leads and a manager. They supported the whole team 110%. They followed up with every member of the team to see if anyone having any issue or complain about the assignment that needs assistance. Most of all, they never put any pressure on anyone about anything. I can come to them and express any issue or problem I have at work. "
good,Everyday is fulfilling and around supportive colleagues. Only that there is employment type of contract and permanent which places for permanent role is lessen.
good,We had a weekly forecast meeting and a one on one with management. The team environment was very positive and supportive and team members assisted each other often.
good,"We had a great team work and the atmosphere was superb because we face different cultures of customers and management Has given us proper training, monthly meeting for the growth of sale and person skill which is very important."
good,"Good place to work, Hub location strategies makes it difficult for employees in the Function areas to advance.People are amazing, and they have great learning programs for self improvement."
good,"I was not a direct employee but a contract consultant. HP uses many contract consultants during times of high work load. This allows them to maintain nearly full employment of direct employees during times of low work load."
good,I loved working for HP.  I only left because my division was bought out by a Canadian company.  I spent 23 years at HP with positions ranging from Order entry to Sales Operations and Variable Compensation.
good,"Working at HP was a thrill. A great company with great heritage and culture. The pace is fast and the opportunities are everywhere. Pick what you want to do and they will make it happen. Be ready for a lot of change, frequently. The company is always shifting gears as it expands or opens a new line of business. It's typical in the technology business. Great company."
good,"Not the best but still a tech company."
good,This was an exciting place to work that helped me to hone my organizational skills and helped me to learn about FDA guidelines and regulations. They worked well with me and my personal life needs. The salary was acceptable compared to the amount of work that was required.
good,"Although it's great place to work, I would recommend a higher salaried company as this one tends to give on one hand and take away with the other."
good,"I love that I have a great degree of control and freedom within my job"
good,Good place to work in. Full work life balance. Ample opportunity to grow in career.  Had ample work life balance. Manager took personal care for individual employees.
good,Large number of opportunities to grow within the company.  Very challenging and satisfying work.  Great people to work with.  Some of the most technically brilliant people I have worked with.
good,"Great company, just a really big company.  Allot of time in con calls, and meetings.  Always the threat of layoffs, makes a person numb to the fact.  Overall good company."
good,Fue una excelente escuela en momentos en que crecía exponencialmente. Muchas oportunidades para aprender .
good,"Was involved in development, had good team, moral was high all were team player."
good,"working with a good team with lot of support from each individual."
good,the managers i worked with the most were great teachers and motivators.  The manager i worked with the least amount of time was not a fair person and spent too much time on the internet.
good,Learned from employees and educated employees as well as possible buyers of HP. Monthly meetings kept us informed of the latest technology biweekly give aways helped keep us prominent.
good,"Spearhead projects fast pace data center to resolve time-sensitive issues and improve network, system, hardware and operational performance in data center environments. Analyze business/user needs, prepare service requests and manage all phases of technology projects utilizing waterfall and Agile methodologies. Document progress, changes and financial data. Establish open lines of communication with cross-functional teams and ensure seamless execution of all deliverables."
good,"HP, Inc refocused on hardware and service solutions.  Still seen as the premier printer provider in the industry. new markets in 3D, graphics, and online services proves to be a good position moving forward.  Management team is good, some transitioning has occurred. Corporate leadership changes indicates some uncertainty for the company moving forward."
good,Hewlett Packard has been in the innovation business for more than 75 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of an innovation roadmap designed to help organizations of all sizes – from global enterprises to local startups – transition from traditional technology platforms to the IT systems of the future.
good,"The focus on services over product development have meant that the complexion of the company has changed a great deal from the HP of old.   Since they have been challenged to find new ways to reinvigorate the company by a string of dissimilar CEO's, the sense of security and commitment that was once there is lacking.  However, HP remains a solid company in those areas where they are still competing, and should continue to be an effective player in the global information technology marketplace."
good,Excelente en el campo de tecnologia de servidores y sus aplicativos
good,È un'azienda che negli anni si è trasformata perdendo molto dei principi dei suoi fondatori. Nonostante tutto se tornassi indietro non cambierei la mia esperienza lavorativa.
good,Enjoyed my time there for the most part. Great leadership and work / life balance flexibility. Very competent management team and a lot of support among colleagues.
good,I had worked for Digital/Compaq/Hewlett Packard for 30 years.  The most enjoyable part of the job was doing my work on my own and had been taught what was expected with limited supervision.
good,"Good company to work with, but not as a contractual employee. If you want to join this company, better go via HirePro. This company has awesome work environment."
good,"Had the opportunity to telecommute for quite a few years but then was forced back into an office environment.  Telecommuting to me seemed more productive and not having a commute to work and back was great for work / life balance. "
good,"These guys are too good in working and teaching to others."
good,Cómo ando estuve con ellos fue muy grato  la salida de ahí no fue causa del equipo si no por la necesidad de ubicación por qué me iba a vivir a la región del biobio
good,"This is process driven organization. All I understand here is that processes are key factor and this is what even customers respects."
good,"The line of business is okay, but as a technical support representive, sales is not my forte. Technical Support and Customer Service has been my focus, and sales is hard to incorporate"
good,The work culture and values are imbibed within all the individuals and this serves as a strong cohesion within all teams and really helps build strong personalities
good,Nice work life balance. Allowed to work from home from time to time. Especially if you had doctor/dentist appointment like appointments. Their benefits are very good.
good,"Spent a long time working at Hewlett Packard and working with some of the most invigorating people within the IT world today.  However long-term progression in career movement was limited.  If you are really goo at your job, then do not expect to advance from it."
good,Great company with great history of innovation and leadership.  Fantastic company to work for and grow.  Great people culture and leaders walk the talk.
good,"HP is very laid back but at the same time the company expect for you to still mingle with your team, which isn't cool sometimes. I did like working at HP and i really like my manager because he has a heart. But the company tries to load you up with too much work for a small pay. I did feel like at times I was being used and not respected for the amount of work I put in. I also felt I wasn't appreciated enough for my brainpower and great skills. I couldn't grow at the company and there is no job security. If you like working 50 to 60 hours a week at a small pay, HP is for you..But I still learned a lot..."
good,"Es una gran empresa, una gran escuela, es una compañia que se encarga de siempre tener bien capacitados a sus asesores, mercaderistas, todo el personal."
good,H.P. was a great place to work for.  The job was highly detailed and specific.  The benefits were great and there was room for advancement and higher education.
good,My time at HP was memorable. I held several different positions so the opportunities were unlimited and very exciting. I increased my skillset tremendously.  I loved working for HP.
good,"Fun productive place to work. Fast Paced, learned a lot about the industry. Can be a bit volatile at times, we had 3 CEO's in two years. Management, isn't always as informed as I'd hoped."
good,"The work was varied and colleagues were fun to work with. There was always talk of redundancies, although to begin with these were voluntary there was always the underlying thought that they could give staff no choice and make compulsory redundancies."
good,Established Global company with cultural diversity; Data-driven organization is the current goal which provides for predictive modeling to drive the DaaS engagement.
good,"GREAT COMPANY!!! Would definitely work there again. Good progressive upward  mobility if you are in the right location (such as the East coast or California). There are many possibilities but like any large company, hiring and promotions depend on the economy."
good,"Nice work environment."
good,"During my time at HP, I held many positions each one building on the last.  WLB was great and I believe my job contributed to overall company performance"
good,"Oportunidade de crescimento profissional."
good,"Place to grow, Learn , Play environment if safe & secure. Just that after many acquisitions there has been instability in the job ; and has renamed itself many time now.."
good,"It’s a safe and quiet place to work which leads to more concentration. It’s a new experience to work at the Hewlett-Packard in Singapore. Colleagues are friendly, the event coordinator are helpful. Overall it’s a very pleasing experience for a first timer to work at an event job."
good,Como cualquier otra transnacional hay alguna inestabilidad
good,"Job pays well, co-workers are an added benefit. Management is easy to work with.The only downside is the amount of paper work required just to make a simple repair."
good,"Acho muito válida minha experiência com a HPE, tive oportunidade de crescimento e realização de objetivos, e também de muito aprendizado."
good,"É uma empresa que trabalha de uma forma muito correta e justa, sempre atendendo as solicitações de seus clientes com maestria e rapidez. O quadro de funcionários é bem qualificado, facilitando o trabalho em equipe. O único ""problema"" é a escalada profissional, é um tanto difícil mudar verticalmente de vaga. No mais, é uma empresa que preza muito pelos seus funcionários também."
good,"HP campus at Bangalore is one of the best with places to relax under the trees and green lawns all over. Recreation area were also included gym, TT, carrom"
good,"Most of my time was spent on project work for external clients. The nature of the work varied by client. However, the enterprise services that I supported no longer exist, so I do not know if my experience reflects the current reality."
good,"otima empresa, aprendi muito da dinamica multicultural, multicountry e gerenciamento de projetos"
good,"Good place to start in the corporate world. Would highly recommend for new graduates. It can be slow at times, but the people that work with you make it totally worth it. Also, there is plenty of room to grow."
good,Empresa com grandes incentivos aos funcionários e possibilidades de crescimento.
good,"I very much enjoyed the roles I held at HP.  For the vast majority of my tenure, the mantra was, ""Take care of the customer, and we'll figure out the internal process later.""  Toward the end of my time, things were much more process and metrics driven.  I understand that with 300,000 employees, there must be some controls in place, but I think that somewhere in there the customer dropped in priority - and to a certain extent, so did the employee."
good,"Young work staff"
good,Company recognized someone's contribution and effort. My former manager was very fair and provided ways to advance if I worked hard and achieved goals.
good,Good place to work.Enjoyed.Nice place to work. co workers where very nice. your work schedule could change very week. laid back environment. nice building for the work office. my supervisor was easy to work with.

good,"It was a good job, not a lot of headaches and easy going.  I was able to work with adequate time off available as well as paid for hotel rooms in case of weather emergency."
good,HP was a great place to work and I was managing L&D and Sales Enablement needs for APJ region.

The opportunity to define and build these same analytics to measure and provide metrics to our asset mgmt. staff of over 400 asset managers and analysts across over 700 accounts and 3 million assets globally.  To write leveragable processes that can be customized and used by the accounts such as stock mgmt., demand mgmt., procurement and re-use.  The staff and teams I have worked with have been amazing.  Each bring their own challenges, knowledge, and experience.  I learn something new every day and take that something new and see where I can insert that to increase profitability and quality to HP."
good,"The work environment is great -- a lot of interesting projects, supportive co-workers and sensible management team. The most enjoy part of the job is learning all aspects of supporting a large  data warehouse."

My co-workers were a diverse group of individuals that helped encouraged me through challenging times. The hardest part of my job was having to let go of my position. I was hired on through a third party entity and my time was contractual.

good,There is always some concern about workforce reductions but HP has been a good place to work.  I've always had good managers to work for and knowledgeable co workers.  Compensation is a little low.
good,"No hay tal cosa como ""un día típico en el trabajo"" cada día conllevaba sus propias sorpresas y retos, el puesto no era monótono y transaccional. Las interacciones por todos los medios (e-mail, teléfono o en persona) con diferentes entidades de la organización, clientes, proveedores, asesores, etc ocurren de manera constante y las directrices a ejecutar se derivan de estas interacciones."
good,"A typical day would entail answering calls regarding product usage, billing and payments, and account retention, and other customer service needs. I enjoyed this line of work because i was able to provide quality service and increase the sales and profitability of the company. I enjoyed my co-workers and management and liked coming into work every day. I didn't like the time restrictions we were allowed on calls. some calls were able to be settled within the 3 minute time frame, but the majority of calls required an extra step of service that often times took a minute more than allotted. I got a lot of customer compliments because of my service, but was unable to perform to their requirements and therefore never advance to a higher position."

good,"As a thermal engineer, there is rarely a shortage of work. The most enjoyable moments are when exploring new concepts and taking on unique challenges. Bulk of the work is fleshing out and validating the design. Some of the time is spent optimizing fan control algorithms. After a while though, it becomes more apparent that seniority greatly influences the kinds of projects worked--younger engineers typically get more of the same kinds of projects, while senior engineers get the new and more challenging projects."

good,I really enjoyed working at HP. The people were very nica and the management was great.
good,"HP Global Analytics is the place if one is looking for the perfect work-life balance. But in terms of the learning and the opportunities to grow, the organization is lacking because of the presence of multiple organizations/teams within HP working in same domain - Analytics. Approvals and processes are slightly cumbersome because of this. Improvements are to be seen, but it will take time to change the mindset of people. At times it feels like people are not willing to change status-quo & archaic processes as it may affect their job."

good,Learn a lot but the growth is slow. Though I could not stay for a long.
good,"I worked at HP for about eight years and help build an engineering team for an acquired product. The management was very cooperative and allowed line managers to take key decisions. Yes with a very matrix and hierarchical reporting structure, crucial decisions got delayed. It offered me a tremendous insight into how large American corporations function. Now i am very confident of getting stuff done in large corporations. HP helps you build excellent relationships both within and outside, this is probably the key takeaway working at HP. A stint at HP will surely help you do very well in senior management roles where ever you work later.

I feel like I got my graduate education at HP- working with incredibly smart and capable individuals who have been in the industry for a very long time. A typical day at work, depending on projects, can be between 8 and 12 hours. I have learned how to think and plan strategically, take creative risks and communicate at an executive level. The most enjoyable part of my job has been my co-workers. When we're able to collaborate together on the phone- it's a power house. In some ways, the hardest part of the job has been working with a WW team that is completely remote. It's been exactly what I have needed for the past 3 years, however, I'm ready to work in an office again. Sometimes it's hard to get answers, be as productive as I strive to be, etc. In my current role, there really isn't any movement for growth or promotional opportunities, so I'm currently looking to expand my scope of marketing skills."

My co-workers were like family, we worked very hard but also got to play together, thanks to the functions HP would create; symposiums for training and networking, sport events, authorized team building etc. The hardest part was seeing my job move to another state and hearing that the culture of the company changed drastically. The most enjoyable part was hearing from my customers that something I recommended based on their needs was an excellent fit, that my service exceeded their expecations and that even my managers appreciated me sticking around to train my replacements, out of loyalty to HP and the accounts I worked closely with. One of the best jobs I ever had!"

good,I enjoyed working in HP. It was during the transitions of HP purchasing Compaq. I worked in a group that was outsourced by Bellsouth to do technical support. HP was diligent in the service it provided to Bellsouth.
good,"Flexible hour, friendly environment, easy internal transfer.  "
good,A good place to work with professional and personal satisfaction. Gives good product and technical training required for daily tasks. A good balance can be achieved.
good,"Excellent work life balance, Good learning opportunities, Decent salary, Congenial working environments, Open door policy,  Flexibility to work from home"
good,"I will be recommended any one to join if it’s possible because a lot of knowledge you can gain that would be helpful for future carrier path."
good,I enjoyed working at HP as most of the folks loved technology.  There was a competitive culture that sometime got in the way of taking care of customers.
good,"I really like HP, Inc. Since the split there is a lot of drive to succeed and a lot of room to learn more. They pay well and have good benefits, but they require a lot of hours. There is a time in November where they require 19 days straight of 12-16 hours a day with no days off, little to no lunch, not Sunday not even Veteran's day off. That is a company policy in finance and top-down company enforced.  They aren't very good at respecting vacations or your other time either. But if you can handle that, the rest of it is good."
good,Loved the work culture and work ethics practiced at HP/HPE. Definitely a great place to work. Work-life balance is good. Employers trust the employee's with the work responsibility and do not micro-manage.
good,HP was going though changes when i worked for them. The company had opted to leave the market that i worked in and therefor my time there was short. Healthcare was spun off and formulated part of Agilent Technologies. I worked or the Ultrasound division and enjoyed it very much

good,"I worked in a global organization that had a small presence in Texas, so work culture wasn't great for me. However, when execs came in town from other countries, my view of culture peaked. Could not ask for better benefit options, PTO and holidays. The entire company shuts down for a couple weeks during the December holidays."
good,"The work is 5 working day a week and 8 hours per day. One only need to stay back when there is need during nor working day and required to come to work during weekend or holiday whenever required."
good,"Cumplir con las metas trazadas por la empresa generaba excelentes comisiones trabajo de calle nada facil pero el esfuerzo se veia reflejado en el bolsillo. Aprendi mucho de equipos de informatica."
good,Excelente empresa con valores bien definidos sobre la cultura laboral.
good,"Excelente empresa, el trabajador es tratado como humano, hay mucha flexibilidad y apoyo al trabajador."
good,Projects were not defined and lack proactive PMO for Enterprise Support. People pull together to get the job done and all have a family like friendship
good,"The company is a great organization.  However, not all of the employees are equal.  You could be made a lead which pays out more than the average employee, however, the other employees may or may not do anything at all.  This will leave you with the 3+ hours of paper work, phone calls, etc AND the 5+ hours of actual installing of hardware equipment.  Insight Global / HP look for able body employees without putting too much effort into checking past work experience for work ethics of their employees."
good,Enjoyed working there but IBM was giving me all my years of service back and had a number of years there and would get my years back which meant more vacation.

Changing direction often takes time, especially when a company effects millions of people across the globe. It may take more time than a sleek startup, but HP still runs with the best, and aims to top them all."
good,Management worked hard to develop a high-level of employee engagement and positive culture during much corporate realignment. I learned a lot about how to design and implement an effective & positive employee engagement community and atmosphere.

good,very energetic and hard woking person. who loves a challenge.The hardest part of my job was inding something else to do diue to completing my task and work early and i would find my self having too much time on my hands. What i enjoyed most was meeting and working with other peop;e that  had similar interest as my self and  interacting with them.When I started I was mainly tech support but moved to the HR department where I was able to show another side of my skills. I was very dissapointed when the facility closed and a good job was taken from me but when one goes down two opens up
good,"Good work life balance, varied work but requiring global acumen and negotiation skills to succeed."
good,Always hunting bugs and debugging code and trying to find out why this transmission didn't get to where it should have gone. Sometimes a nightmare. Very Stressful
good,Work environment is good. But management system is not good. Management does not related to out career or work. Full of inside partiality. Lot of difference between permanent and contract employees.

good,I have loved working for HP the last 7 years. They know that flexibility and a balanced work life makes for happy employees. The role as a self-contributor is challenging and rewarding. You have the ability to become a subject matter expert where people really rely on you to help them resolve their problems. You have to self-motivated since the training provided is pretty limited depending on your role.

It allowed unbelievable work life balance for its employees and always stressed and encouraged education, goal achievement and advancement.

The company doesn't pay very well compared to other companies, but you can get more out of working there. The work/life balance is great.  I have three kids and am often able to work from home if my kids are sick or the roads are bad.  Working from home permanently isn't allowed anymore, but management is still flexible and understands your family commitments."
good,"Daily schedule would fluctuate, and everyone needed to be prepared to work nights on occasion.  The management was great and the people are incredible.

The environment in the company, specifically in OTC, is generally professional, friendly and busy, definitely busy, but I always take time to connect with my people to understand gaps and to also get to know them even more. I report to both my first line manager and operations manager and they have always given me the chance to evolve on my own, with their guidance. The management is open to my ideas as Team Lead and Process lead and I have always felt valued. As we are in the revenue end, the management would always hammer for revenue but it is something that I am already aware of thus I stay on top of it."

My role requires me to communicate with all levels of the organization, from management to our clients, to the quality assurance and data analysts teams. The data analysts provide us the guidelines set by the client, these guidelines tell me what needs to be coded and in what manner. Coding for a particular project typically takes about a month. Once coding is complete I perform testing on what I've created and write test documents, design documents, and deployment guides. My work then gets passed onto the quality assurance team who performs more thorough testing. I assist them in testing by answering whatever questions they may have, whether it be how to set up the testing environment or clarifications of the rules set by the data analysts. If they find a mistake, then it is my job to have it corrected immediately and send back to them as soon as possible. After they complete their part of testing my code then gets sent over to the client."

good,"Empresa que te dá ownership dos trabalhos e cobra por metas e objetivos, dando oportunidade aos funcionários de gerenciar seu próprio tempo de trabalho e manter um equilíbrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal. O salário está na média do mercado, mas o pacote de benefícios é muito bom. Por ser uma empresa multinacional de grande porte, é um pouco complicado a promoção no trabalho, principalmente de se conseguir trabalho no exterior. A gerência pelo perfil da empresa possui alto padrão de liderança, o que gera uma oportunidade ímpar de aprendizado para ambos, lidenrança e liderados. O programa de sustentabilidade é sólido, onde aprendi bastante principalmente em sistemas de gestão baseados nas normativas ISO, OHSAS e SA, além do programa de SER. A crise americana e a alta competitividade no setor de tecnologia torna a empresa dinâmica e mudanças se tronam constantes, ou seja, não há estabilidade de emprego nesse setor."

Management and other co-workers were unpleasant to work with. The hardest part of my job was being around unpleasant people day in and day out. The most enjoyable part of working at HP was taking on challenges and over coming them. A full work load made the day go by fast, which is always good. I enjoy staying very busy and very productive."

good,This is the place to be in if you are looking for a work-life balance. The managers (most of them) are friendly and follow an open-door policy. Pay is not that great but then again you make up in terms of the work-life balance that you get.

good,"Please refer to resume attached."
good,"1. Everyday will have typical time while handling the customers with different mindset."
good,"Working for Hewlett Packard (HP) was a responsible position always ensuring on a day to day basis that customer needs were met and quality service was delivered. As part of a team dealing with complex issues it was vital to communicate effectively and to be able to rely on others for support, just as I would be relied on. Management was effective in that once given the skills to perform your job you were left to do so. The hardest part of the job could be forecasting a clients purchasing requirements for the next quarter, whilst an essential part of the business I found it a little hard to take gambles as this is not in my nature. Enjoyment was found on a daily basis as being part of a team where we all helped each other."
good,"HP is a great place to work, if you don't get caught in their ""Workforce Reduction Program"" like myself and 500 of my co-workers."
good,"As i have been with Hp since 2010,July i gained process knowledge and learnt how to be in corporate world. "
good,"Everyday I traveled to different locations to do installations within Chicago and surrounding suburban businesses.  I learn about software, applications and server configurations.  As a team of specialist we divided up the tasks which help us accomplished each office setup accurately and efficiently. The hardest part of this job was that accounts were very distant from my chicago residence. "
good,Good working enviornment.HP culture is good. We can learn more things from there.
good,"A HP é uma excelente empresa, a qual pude expandir e desenvolver meus conhecimentos."
good,"dynamic, exciting, demanding"
good,"I am currently working with HP Financial Services as a Financial Analyst. I am one among the senior members in the team. I enjoy my work at office. I love doing each work in my own style , since I am into IC (individual contributor) role , I have the flexibility to do so. As far as the work timings are concerned, it is extremely flexible as my only priority is to finish the work as per the deadline given."
good,"Too much to like! I assembled my team of employees along with my team in the retail stores. I set my own hours and I was 'The Man'. I greatly enjoy the creation of a solid team that works together for a common target. And the great part was that I got paid to do this, set my own hours/week, and enjoyed the comradeship of other near me on the team.  "
good,I had alot of experience in Hewlett Packard and got a chance to learn so many things. Overall amazing company to work with but salary is very less.
good,"It is just too bad that the corporation is moving the business out of country to support corporate accounts. The accounts I have supported for 7 years are Yahoo, Disney, Newscorp, GM, Bank of America, Bloomberg, Charles Shaw...just to name a few. I am energetic, fun, and always smile. The most important part of any business is the customer, and a typical day for me is to make sure they are satisfied.  "
good,The IF comes into play if you are not laid off like I was after two years. HP was laying field techs off and I was on the lower end. They gave me a car to do the work and a nice pay check. I wish they would hire me again.

Hardest part is coordination among several stakeholders and most enjoyable part is satisfaction of delivery to expectations."
good,"I was the queue monitor for a while. I should've been then most hated guy, but I used humor and gentle nudges to get people to jump in and clean out the work queue. The team used a model called the ""center of excellence"". Tough cases were collaborated on. If one was stronger at a process than another, the two would join forces and work it out. My co-workers are among the brightest in their field. I could just turn my head and I'd find someone that had a lifetime or a library's worth of noetic experience in diagnosis of technology. The most difficult part of the job is the hand off of work. A case, because of it needing a heavy touch or needing a complex resolution, could be passed between experts globally and then handed back to me at the start of my shift. When it works, it's awesome. When it doesn't, I have seen some angry customers as a result. Fortunately, with help from our managers, we are often able to enroll the customer back into gaining a resolution. Most of the time, the fix calms their nerves."
good,"Es bueno el ambiente laboral, dan mucho apoyo en cuanto a entrenamiento del proceso, la direccion esta enfocada totalmente a resultados, buenos compañeros de trabajo, la parte dificil en este momemento en la empresa es conseguir un contrato de planta.

good,"It isn't fun and sexy like Google or Microsoft, but you can learn valuable experience to help build a career. Recent turmoil at senior leadership has many questioning the company, but long-term, it is a great place to work and will remain a top company in IT as it reinvents itself."

La dirección y gerencia no han sabido establecer una estrategia a largo plazo porque los cambios organizacionales a nivel mundial han sido muchos y muy variables. La cultura laboral norteamericana facilita el desempeño y crecimiento profesional. Lo más difícil del trabajo es reportar desde Monterrey hasta la CDMX al gerente directo. Lo que más me gustó de mi trabajo fueron los resultados de venta logrados en los últimos años, y que se nos haya reconocido."

Did not realize how time flew - it was a paradise and I never thought about moving up. But then things changed, the company's thinking changed, new people were brought in and the only target was to lay off people - mostly talented people were targeted and laid off, or situations were created due to which such people quit. The remaining three and half years was exactly opposite and I did stay on enduring things expecting it would change - alas it did not for me. People who were brought in were a complete misfit to their roles and instead of helping the company come out of a situation pushed it into something more drastic and the result today - it is DXC TECHNOLOGY."

Ofrece gran diversidad de procesos y áreas de trabajo que a pesar de tener muchos años de operación, cuentan con oportunidades de mejora en donde los empleados pueden aportar ideas y soluciones valiosas para la compañía. El aspecto de promociones es un poco más complejo, ya que está muy competido el ámbito profesional para la aplicación a ofertas de trabajo, tanto interna como externamente existen candidatos muy capacitados o con mucha expieriencia en la empresa, por lo que el crecimiento, sobretodo para recién egresados, puede llegar a ser más lento o tardado de lo que la mayoría estarían dispuestos a esperar."
