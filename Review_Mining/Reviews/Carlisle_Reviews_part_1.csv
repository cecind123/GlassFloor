bad,The job was ok. i worked there for two years i work monday to friday 8-4. i learned accounts payable methods my co workers were ok and i only enjoyed the flexibility of the job.
bad,When I was there the HR Director left. What does that tell you? Poor management among other things noted by others. Some supervisors were running their departments based on fear. Good people who knew their jobs well even left.
bad,"Slavery environment, low pay, no chance of a raise whatsoever. The only good thing about this place is the compensation and benefits. But those are easily outweighed from the all the hard work."
bad,"terrible employer, you are just a body and when they don't need you, see you later.  this is a terrible builder that cuts corners everywhere.  stay away if you ask me"
bad,load/unload trucks using sit down forklift. entered data in the computer systems and made sure we maintained a safe working enviroment.
bad,"I worked for this company when they had a contract with Greater Anglia trains. Now im in no way a bitter person but i can honestly say, I have NEVER worked for a more shoddy company. We were treated like dirt. No chance of progression no matter how much experiance you have,  even our contract manager who had been with the company for years was treated like dirt. The job was easy enough mind & the pay was ok.  The only thing was that this company treated us like dirt, like we were dumb, telling us blatant lies & when we complained we were simply told,,,, well you can always find another job.. even conning us out of our bonus for London 2012. You have been warned AVOID AT ALL COST,,,, This company definatley a WOLF IN SHEEPS CLOTHING"
bad,"Very little advancement opportunities, they cap the commission at 500.00 and you only see this commission if the store reaches its personal goal dissipate meeting your quota, or whatever time and effort you put into them. Customers are very friendly, but management needs work. Very little acknowledgment for  going above and beyond"
bad,"Carlisle/Carlstar used to be the best place to work! Great pay, good benefits, awesome supervisors... but since they've been bought out by Carlstar [STAY AWAY]. Horrible management with extreme favoritism, HR is no help to floor employees, a lot of OT, no job security/looking for reasons to fire people, cutting pay, and putting a hiring freeze on all temps (some that have been a temp for a year already). People that have been there for 20 years have quit due to how bad this place has gotten."
good,It is an okay place to work. I enjoyed working there because everyday I go to work I fell more and more in love with the residents. Management needed improvement.
good,Supervisores con perfil de dictador y falta de conocimiento y nivel educativo y ética profecional

good,Learned to assemble cables and connectors schedule was good 6 to 2:30 the pay was to low after a year you would get laid off and would have to reapply
good,Carlisle employees displayed teamwork at its best every work day. The job is not hard if you get to know the machines. Management needs to get a little more involved with the operators on the floor a few improvements could make it a even better workplace.You learn essential skills it takes to make a excellent compression molding operator.
good,Operating machines daily and producing what is on the schedule for the week. Daily efficacies.  Depending on how the machines run the more product you and get out.

good,employees are treated fairly have oportunities for advancement. this is a clean and safe work enviroment. Although there are times that require extra hours of work the company does have many encentives for its employees and their families.
good,people are for the most part helpful. The hardest part is trying to find a safe place to park a 53' tractor trailer.  I enjoy the driving
good,"Carlisle is a very professional company. The management was very good. It is a great company to work for. They offer a lot of different jobs, in different locations."
good,This review is basically the same as the first review and thus there is not much to write here.  It would be overall redundancy to say anything more about it.
good,"I would have to say the most enjoyable part about working at The Carlisle, is interacting with the residents. Talking to them about their day, about their family. Just getting to know them as a individual, was very rewarding. "

good,working as a team to finish the job on time and co-workers were helpfull and kind

good,I like serving to the elderly s because they was fun and loving but this job was to crampy filled with a lot of us waiters and the management was very blunt and didn't work with your schedule as much as other jobs would. But overall I really enjoyed there because of the seniors after all that's why I was there.
good,Responsibilities included executing business guidelines and developing team.  Responsible for training/coaching mangers and crew to adhere to corporate guidelines.
good,"Enjoyed eighteen years with this company"
good,"I stared at Carlisle back in 8/16/2003 and started working in kitting area , pulling parts for orders.  And now I am at highest position as Inventory control specialist. The company has given me the opportunity to have experience in all aspects of warehouse responsibility and the knowledge that I can carry on to my new journey!  I would recommend Carlisle to anyone whom is getting started !"

good,Falta un equilibrio en la administración a nivel gerente de planta y gerentes de unidad falta de valoración por los empleados con mayor antigüedad
good,My review of the company is that they are always experiencing new ideas that will be pleasing as well as appealing to the customers; which is perfect. I love when a customer is satisfied with something new on the menu. I look forward to that everyday. I have also learned that customer love a deal with the coupons they have received in the mail and the seniors love ever discount they can get to help save them some money. The workers are persistent and the managers love to go out of their way to satisfy each and every customer. My job is not hard but I enjoy what I do and that is to satisfy my customers.

good,"Buen ambiente pero muy poco nivel de subir de puesto, es por eso mi inquietud de buscar un empleo mejor para el bien estar de mi familia, me considero trabajador y responsable"
good,A great company to work for at one time.  People were family to each other here and we were a growing company thriving to become the best in the industry.  We were number one in Florida and third in the United States.  Took only a couple of Senior Executives to destroy the company.
good,Very fast paced multiple learning opportunities provided. Great job environment. Lifting multiple rim bands off pallets daily making sure shipment quotas get met.
good,Usually it was really fun to work with stock counting company Orridge. The most enjoyable part of the work was working alongside with other colleagues to achieve the target. I have observed that there is no such target unreachable while working as a team. The best of the work was that if a team achieves his/her target before their time period they get awarded certain amount of bonus salary.
good,I learned a lot boss was great and so were my co-workers.  They encouraged me and coached me a lot.  Definitely recommend this job benefits score was low because I was part-time.
good,"Enjoyed working for them. Sometimes you went to work never knowing what to expect, which is a good thing for most people. It is never boring. It was not always like that, sometimes we did specific projects. Sometimes we responded to a house flood/fire. But they did not over work you."
good,"great company to work for, great benefits, more responsibility for those who want it. Great pay and benefits package. Great Company."
good,"great place to work for and nice atmosphere, very family oriented and great with their rules and policies. I would recommend anyone to work for them. they are awesome."
good,"The hardest part of the job was when we received mixed trucks. It was a long process because we had to resort the products. I really improved with numbers, which will help me in the long run. We worked together by helping each other; therefore, it made every day easier. It was only 15 workers which made it easier to get things done. The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized whenever we did good or bad, and safety was our first priority."
good,"My typical day would be assuring the fast and friendly service moto that the company upholds. I learned that even though the customers have different personalities and lead different lives, they all have the same level of good customer service expectancy. Our managing staff, from the frontend to the pharmacy are all wonderful. We are adults and expected everyone to handle themselves accordingly. The hardest part was maintaining my composure with irate customers. The most enjoyable was knowing that my customers knew me by name; also watching them walk out, satisfied, with a smile on their faces."
good,"I absolutely have nothing negative to say about the Carlisle its the best place I've ever worked at. Our supervisor was wonderful, he was always there to help us anytime of the day. Any questions we ever had he was always there to help answer. The company was a great company I received a end of the year bonus which was super nice since christmas was right around the corner and also a christmas present and card which was a coffee cup some coffee and a tee shirt. I could go on and on about how great it was unfortunately I had to quit because my commute was giving me health problems and I could not do it anymore."
good,I come in and cook burgers for customers at 5 p.m. to 7 p.m then take a break for 30 mins. Then come back and start pre-closing the building.
