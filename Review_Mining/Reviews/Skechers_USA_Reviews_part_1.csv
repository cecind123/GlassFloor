bad,"Sadly this was without doubt the least organised and most unprofessional environment I have ever worked in.Area management and senior management positions are held by extremely ineffective people who are simply not qualified for their roles.I would recommend to anybody applying, dont do it, move onto the next vacancy elsewhere and avoid Skechers completely."
bad,"Working 300+ in a row doesn't matter to these people. Upper management is abusive. Current new manager is a mess, Will never return to this company. No one listens to you when you report issues. No one cares when associates are being forced out."
bad,"When I got hired at skechers I was excited because it looked like a fun job.  Things very quickly told otherwise. The store manager would show up to open out of uniform, leave, and come back three hours later to actually do the job. Store manager also would call the other skechers in town to talk to that store manager about stuff unrelated to the company. Favoritism was real there."
bad,"I loved my job when I first began working there. As time seen the on I enjoyed it less and less and even dreaded coming to work on any given shift. This company, if some of its management staff is a representation of the company itself, then this is not an employee appreciative company. They look to please the customer and overlook the staff. Staff is not treated with respect. It’s a do as I say and not as I do typed atmosphere."
bad,Es una empresa que quiere que desde que empiece este es a la altura de los que más saben en durante años en la tienda si no te echan a la calle después un maltrato de compañero de insulto y valoraciones muy bajas qué psicológicamente afectan al día a día y un mal sueldo para un trabajo intensivo qué se hace con ganas corazón y esfuerzo valoran lo malo nunca lo bueno y las reuniones de tienda las hacen delante del público mientras que lo escuchan todo el mundo hasta un punto que te hacen aguantar una simple lágrima con eso lo digo todo
bad,"Horrible and toxic enviroment to work for. You are buillied everyday, no wonder they have one of the highest turnover of employees. They do not care about the health of there employees, and you are expected to work ridiculous hours."
bad,"Absolutely the worst place I ever decided to work at! VERY click orientated, upper management is very poor in communication and understanding, the pay was terrible was getting paid minimum wage for an assistant manager role. Never get recognised for any of the good things, no training was provided and they just assume you to know everything, and unreal expectations and no work life balance."
bad,"They are very unappreciative of the work that is done, they under pay for the work that is being done. They are absolutely unfair in every which way possible."
bad,"When I started at Skechers I worked under the best management possible, great head manager who cared about his staff and fantastic assistant managers. Recently there has been two different changes in management who both failed to live up to the level the previous management had been. They did not appreciate me or anyone who had been there for longer than they had. I had worked for Skechers for almost two years before resigning due to unfair treatment and unethical work strategies. I would receive 4 hours a week when others would receive 20+ hours a week. The manager would also not allow you to call in sick and would get mad if you didn’t find someone to cover your shift, even though it is their job to do so. They would tell you that even though you’re sick and on bed rest you still needed to come in."
bad,It was ridiculous!  The manager hired too many employees so he gave us all 4 hrs. per week for our scheduled hrs. Who can survive on 4 hrs a week? Then the manager kept going over budget on payroll so they had to reduce our hours even more!
bad,"Worst company to work for, poor management, the supervisor FR has all his family working there. also he is always harassing young guys. Dont work there."
bad,"No one at that store knows what they’re doing. It’s constant drama, and if you’re a person to not be involved in drama, don’t worry - it’ll get to you. Managers constantly talk about employees, fat shaming and pregnancy shaming. They do not care for mental health. Managers are fooling and sleeping around with each other, including with associates. Not a place to be."
bad,"i worked there 2 years and realized that i wasnt going to be given the  chance to be considered on a manager position so then my manager wants to act dumb like they didnt know i wanted to be considered, otherwise i found better and wish them the best."
bad,"I've worked at some messed up places but this is by far the worst!! No communication, unprofessional management. Its just horrible.. I would not reccomend this job to anyone.. even if it's to a high schooler.. but then again the company prefers not to hire anyone under the age of 18 due to laws and etc. They say theres room to grow in this company but their isnt. No incentive for employess.. no bonuses (except skechers bucks), no commission, no pay raises or nothing!!! Unless you get a promotion that's the only way you'll make more money. Managers at my location lack communication with their staff, they claim they have tons of paper work to do but actually dont. When their paper work for the week should actually be done every sunday.  Since it goes Sunday to Saturday. Management is lazy will make their sales associates do everything and will take credit for the things they dont do. They have ridiculous policies that none of the management team even follows. Management will tell their sales associates when they step out ""if anyone calls for me I'm in the bathroom"" and per company policy management is not allowed to leave a sales associate in the store alone!!"
bad,"This has to be the most hateful company I have ever worked for. Was interviewed with the impression that I would get 20-25 hrs per week when after 1 1/2 months I was cut down to 5 hrs per week due to ""budget cuts"". Then one of the managers claimed that the reason why I was getting 5 hrs per week is that they didn't want guys working there, that men are creeps and they just hate having men around."
bad,Opened the new store in Wauwatosa (no longer open).  Young staff.  Base pay was low.  Commission was also low.  Good for teenagers if there is a store in your area.
bad,"the boss was very rude condescending, she would take my sales i just didn't enjoy the vibe working there or the people it was not a great experience .."
bad,"District manager was a terrible person, would fatshame employees, caused our manager and half the staff to quit.. unless you were skinny and pretty, she didn't want you wearing the product"
bad,"They only care about the money and different ways to get it. Anyone who works under them means nothing. If a customer is bothered by anything about you. You WILL be replaced. Whether the customer is right ir wrong. It’s a slave job, all work no appreciation. And racial slurs against an employee doesn’t matter as long as the customer is okay."
bad,"Mangers were very rude , very unprofessional & unorganized , they treat you like you are slaves instead of emplyoees & a lot of the mangers had very bad attitudes"
bad,I would not work there I felt that the company doesn't really care about you as a person and were asking too much at times and the people there aren't as respectful
bad,"Salarios mínimos con condiciones vergonzosas. Cierto que pagan 60€ por cada domingo y festivo, pero te obligan a trabajarlos aunque no quieras/puedas. Conclusión: jornadas de 48 horas semanales en condiciones totalmente precarias. En el poco tiempo que estuve trabajando allí tuve el placer de contemplar todo tipo de atentados contra el trabajador, incluyendo descontar a los empleados descuadres de caja, robos o extravíos, por no hablar de la cantidad de gente a la que no le renuevan el contrato por no tener a nadie indefinido y ahorrarse unos tristes euros."
bad,"Fatal."
bad,When I worked for Skechers it was a fairly young company with not much technology under its belt. Management was not the best. Store Manager and myself were not treated well.
bad,"I was there for a week you can't miss any days, you work from 9 am to 9 pm. It seems a bit harsh to make people work all day why is it 2 shifts and not three you can hire more people and weed out the bad one. I did not like how I was let go I am bitter about this place."
bad,"I had a very horrible time, personally they dealt with customers with horrible customer care and also didn’t bother to have security cameras, so if something went missing employees were always to blame."
bad,i do not know if it was the management or what. but i ended up being homeless with a job that sometimes would only give me 6 to 8 hours a week. Had to go on welfare in order to buy food while homeless. welfare saw my check stubs for a whole month that was 50 bucks only. they told me to not worry about checking in anymore and to let them know when i find a new job.
bad,"Even though its a very busy environment, i was able to learn my job duties quick. I learned how to multitask several job duties at once and drive a forklift at the same time. This job helped me grow as a warehouse worker."
bad,Skechers is one of the worst jobs i have ever had. My manager at the time was very inappropriate and was never held responsible for his actions. I was forced to quit for no reason and Human Resources did nothing about it.
bad,Son 8 horas al día 6 días de la semana por 800 € me parece una vergüenza y una explotación cuándo skechers es súper conocido mundialmente es una vergüenza que pague tampoco a sus empleados
bad,"The Skechers inc. was a fun but fast passed place it was okay for a part time employee, over all I enjoyed my time at Skechers inc. I’m glad to have worked there"
bad,there is no communication between corporate to district manager to store managers to associates and so it totally feels like an inconsistent free for all.
bad,Absolutely terrible place to work they hiring part time management and only give them 12 hrs a week if that I was bully out of a job working for them!
bad,Poor management. Literally no training on anything. The company does not care about their workers at all. The systems are in the dark ages and ridiculous.
bad,"very rude, and they like to talk down on you. This is one place that you'll definitely feel very un-comfortable working at. They seem to be very impatient with the employees and the customers."
bad,"Not worth it . Pay is terrible . Barely any hours . Customers were nice though management could've been better . Wanted more hours , didn't seem to get them"
bad,"I was harassed by a coworker nonstop, was called on my days off without pause, was scheduled with no one else, had my schedule switched on me and more"
bad,"I Never received any training, just expected to know everything, they bully and manipulated every manager i have seen go through that buisness. Only good thing is the people you have working for you and the 40% discount."
bad,El sueldo no se compensa con todas las funciones que umo tieme que realizar para el puesto. Practicamente un jefe tiene quebhacer todo y estar disponible las 24 horas y el sueldo es misero para lo que uno hace.
bad,"its retail it sucks. don't even do it for the summer, cant really say anything else hate that i have to leave a review. get a better job and quick. anything retail sucks"
bad,"I look forward to going to work each and every day. I always feel valued and appreciated. The work is very fast paced, but always enjoyable fellow staff memebers!"
bad,"Skechers became a large footwear company. It has been in business for 25 years, but still hasn't figured out a lot of things. They still consider themselves as a company that is barely starting. They really don't care much about employees."
bad,They under under under under value every one. They steal so many designs. They make shoes for 5 dollars and sell them for 50. it was annoying listening to that everyday.
bad,"The regional manager of Texas has no regards for business and does nothing to support his districts. He constantly finds was to eliminate all of his store managers if he doesn't get along with them. The HR manager, which is stationed in Georgia but oversees Texas is the worst HR manager. She would rather protect associates that don't do anything then protect the management team. They don't give fair warning to eliminating employees and want all managers to just work in the back because they don't want them to get commission. The best part of working was my own staff, but if you plan on working in Texas, the regional manager is a joke, and the HR manager, is a bigger joke. If you want to do just operations, and have no say, then this job is for you!!!!"
bad,"Horrible employer.  Typical Retail.  Don't be fooled by everyone promoting the brand like it's all they wear.  Young people selling to old people. Young people don't live and breath the lifestyle they promote. "
bad,Working for this company was fun at first and very interactive. Over time it became extremely slow and managers would often take out their short comings on employees.
bad,cheap company doesn't invest in employees and didnt really give you a chance to grow district managers are rude and enjoyed my store but the company is still trying to come back from the shape up lawsuit.
bad,"This is undoubtedly the worst job I have had to date.  Corporate is fine, the actual corporation is a well run organization.  That being said this particular satellite is horrid."
bad,the dm is unorganized and do not know the answers..................
bad,lack of training and knowledge.  insurance is too high.  Will hirer and will just put them into a position.
bad,"It's a small shoe store doesn't take a brain scientist to run it. My District Manager is the problem hands down. I have seen some really qualified Managers come and go for interviews at my store but my ""DM"" doesn't want to hire someone better then her. The compensation is poor. I'm sure at DSW the Managers make more even the Asst. Managers. Overall rating let's just say I'm looking for another job will keep it at that.."
bad,"Upper mgmt does nothing for the employees that work hard unless they are somehow related to a DM or SM. Employees who try and make the systems better by speaking up are penalized for doing so. Each day is a challenge because one DM wants something done one way and then his RM wants the complete opposite leaving the employees taking on much more stress than most hourly jobs. The communication channels are very poor and when ever there's a problem, the human resource dept. typically does very little to resolve the issue. The pay is not the same across the board for each level of mgnt, promises are not kept and the company seems to discriminate against some of its employees"
bad,"Low chances for advancement. Payrate is minimum wage for a tasking job and sales position. Selling their products that are poorly put together and misleading is both tasking and frustrating when a customer returns products which they will because like i said their products are poorly put together. Management always have contradicting tasks that waste time and payroll. Hours are near highschool hours for employees with a meager 8 hours a week at a low. When interview i was promised a minimum of 16 hours and was shocked to find they get that slow. All in all if your in high school and need lunch money then work here, oh wait you cant work here unless you have a year retail experience and are at least 18."
bad,"You sell shoes, it's a terrible job. This is one of the worst places I've ever worked. People are constantly fired for no other reason than someone doesn't like them. You can be the best at your job and fired because you ""not the right fit"" or you can be terrible and get a promotion because you and the store manager are friends outside of work. Corporate management is clueless as to how to run their stores and they constantly provide the public and employees with false product information. There is nothing good about working here, but if you're desperate and need a job quite, they will hire just about anyone."
bad,"I’ve been working for Skechers for almost two years and I’ve never hated working for such a company. They aren’t really clear on raises, the pay rate literally changes what seems like every other month. The managers aren’t that great it was so bad that six months after being promoted to manager, I stepped down. My last day is in a few days and I personally would never come back even for seasonal."
bad,Bad place to work and bad pay aswell. They dont care about the employee. To them your just a body. They lie to you to get what they want. Overall the company is just not worth your time or sanity.
bad,"The management at the location I worked at was really poor. Both the district manager and the manager of the store knew each other personally and it affected the workplace very negatively. Coworkers were alright and had a great attitude about the work despite the poor management. However, once hours began getting cut and complaints were falling on deaf ears people began leaving in groups and the store was left with a skeletal crew that barely managed to keep up with the general every-day work. Quitting the location I worked at was probably my favorite part of the job."
bad,"Non è sicuramente un’azienda meritocratica, anche se quando entrate sembra la realtà migliore in assoluto da quello che l’azienda vorrebbe far vedere."
bad,"I started working in skechers around 6 months ago and it was alright in the beginning but soon after I found that they had unbelievably high standards. Management would set me targets that were simply unachievable for the hours I was doing and to make matters worse the manager was always rude and never had anything nice to say. Literally everyone would talk bad about him, even the supervisors. I wouldn’t advise working here, they treat you like slaves and their standards are way too high. There were numerous occasions where I’d hear managers badmouthing other employees and I was even told once that they did it about me. Absolutely horrible place to work.  No training given whatsoever and you are expected to know what to do."
bad,This was my first job i don’t really feel it helped or molded me for a better paying job because the skills you learn only would benefit you for a sales associate job
bad,"Working at Skechers was a learning  experience for me, it was first job I worked at. That job helped me grown into the woman I am today. It helped me learn how to interact with other people. But management in that place was horrible."
bad,"Management use to be good then there was a management change and the new manager is over bearing and rude, the work is unenjoyable and I would never work here again."
bad,"O ambiente entre colegas era bom, mas a nível de supervisão é péssimo."
bad,"It's your typical retail store job, but the amount of work load for the amount of pay is not worth it. Not to mention the management is based on preference."
bad,"expectations for a minimum wage job are way to high, wanting employees to work overnight even though they did not sign up for that. Horrible place to work at, work ethic of mangers is ridiculous."
bad,"Great Co-workers, bad work environment.  Health & Safety etc were not set up properly.  We did not have a H/S rep.  No one knew what WHMIS was. CPR training was not offered. "
bad,Very poor work life balance.  If you produce there is no recognition.  No loyalty to the employees which causes increased turnover.  Lack of adequate training.
bad,Terrible company to work for; the worst i've ever worked for. They do not take care of their employees. Unreasonable expectations for the staff at hand. Very unorthodox. Regional/Corporate are VERY judgmental in all the wrong areas.
bad,"This was by far the worst place i have ever worked.  Long hours, terrible customers and even worse upper management.  Stay away not worth the headache."
bad,"During my time at Skechers there was a lot of ups and down. This was due to management. Between new store managers every six months and the assistant manager, working here became unbearable. There is clear favouritism and any staff members that aren’t interested in gossiping with the assistant manager are shunned. The same staff are punished for not meeting targets, while a few staff members are let off with everything. DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS JOB!!"
bad,"* Like every other review, upper management is 100% the issue with the company. The area managers and state manager are all on power trips and see you all as replaceable. "
bad,"Es una empresa que abusa mucho , hacen del empleado los que ellos quieren , son pocos profesionales . "
bad,Skechers does not hire from within. Opportunities are passed up due to egocentric managers. Communication between managers is non existent. Policies and procedures are not followed. District manager asked me as a 2nd ASM what I needed to run the store better. I stated pay for associates and hours overall. He stated pay is non negotiable and they take what they’re given. The unfairness is eveident and this company is far from f
bad,The company doesn't care about their employees. I worked full time hours and only was paid for part time. I worked multiple 7 day in a row periods and many open to closes due to managements poor scheduling skills. The manager has no regard for their employees emotionally or physically. The manager would also perfer to act passive aggressively towards employees than to have adult conversations.
bad,"The management is a complete wreck, the managers rarely do any work all they do is sit and talk down to the other employees. Save yourself the headache and just don’t work here"
bad,"It's a company that seems promising but have no protection or interest on their workers. Especially if you are in a higher position. "
bad,"sketchers just flat-out sucked, show were not confterable, and we have to stand all day for about 8-9 hours not to mention the pay is also garbage, I HAVE A FRIEND THAT LITTERALLY MOVES BOXES AND GETS PAID 600 IN ONE WEEK!!! and im over here at sketchers geting paid $400 every two weeks. how am i going to survive off that type of pay?"
bad,"No raises based on performance just a yearly raise. Your expected to do everyone else's job. Dm adds more work to your plate, lies to you about promotions but then is the reason you wont get one. Policy is so grey what one person is fored for the next gets a promotion. And a new store"
bad,"You will jump through hoops, polices are different depending who you speak to. Unrealistic expectations, oftentimes you are working alone with a work that you can't complete. You are set up for failure. They only care how the store looks, not their customers or employees."
bad,"terrible place ⦁	Conduct extensive research on products and customer feedback while providing a personalized custoer expirence to meet each customers need. Generate sales activity to exceed established goals by cross-selling and upselling. Gave excellent public relation skills , matchless communication, etiquette, and professional customer service. Educate team about products and promotions through training and small meeting before we start our day , and open the store. Rearrange the entire sales floor to advertise new shoes and attract more customers. Maintain cash in registers , manage dily cash accounts for the store, and complete closing sales documentation."
bad,"Rude management, loose cannon type workplace, systems in place are old fashioned and cause problems for staff. learnt patience on how to deal with angry customers"
bad,"You learn quiet a few things here, operations. But not worth the pay. If your looking to grow within the company it’s also not worth it. Might be depending on the district manager. But you can find a better pay somewhere else as an associate then here as a manager. Don’t get me wrong I met some amazing people at Skechers that’s the only thing that kept me through it while working there"
bad,"This company is terrible, no support, no understanding, not enough hours given to staff a busy store... I just hate this company. If you are able to succeed in this type of environment, it can be very profitable, but I just do not care for how they run things."
bad,some assistant managers are not fair. they will back stub and make fun of you. lack of advancement. the work are easy so lots of workers are not doing anything. just pretending working most of the part and the management didn't do anything. a fault finder people. no advancement. they wont follow rules.
bad,on ne m'a même pas téléphoné pour me dire que j'étais sur la white liste (virée).
bad,"The company is completely biased and they do not promote within company. They are not good people to work for. I have been here for three years and I have been bullied, put down, and treated poorly. Do  not work for them"
bad,"As a seasoned manager with this company I can tell you that this is not the place you want to be. The do more with less mantra is repeated always. Even when your running a successful store with great comps in all metrics it is never enough. While HR preaches a ""culture"" management and corporate partners never follow its own guidelines. Even with multiple reports to HR on DM's abuse of authority, HR turns a blind eye and allows. The stores are run on bare bones salary and it takes a toll on staff and management."
bad,"The only constant in this company is change. While change is needed,  but must be methodically planned to ensure proper outcome. This company lacks any common sense and heart."
bad,"When I 1st started working for Skechers I had a great DM she was let go and things went down hill fast. "
bad,A typical day at work would be me coming in at 9:30am to accept the shipment. i receive about 90 boxes of shoes per week. those shoes are to be processed and priced. along with projects there are customers that need service.
bad,"Initially I was very optimistic about working here. Not long after did I realize that I had a job that I hated. Management and coworkers were extremely toxic. Only cared about advancing their own narratives and agendas. Management and staff would form ""cliques"". People in those groups would have preference over others in everything from shifts and hours, to tasks and duties and raises and promotions."
bad,"Nepotism throughout the company. Focused primarily and younger female demos although they attempt to build revenue in other men's product groups. Very unusual culture, more of a feel good company, not corporately run business"
bad,"All I can say is, they lied to me from the very beginning from what they were going to pay me, the hours I would be getting to the opportunity for advancement and raises. They don’t do raises anymore, the company stopped that. If you ask to learn something, forget about it. You will be forgotten and no one will care. Such a strange and hostile work environment. Managers were sleeping with my co-workers and the whole vibe was out of whack."
bad,"I worked in Skechers for about 3 months and I can only describe my experience here as miserable. A typical day consists of you running around the shop, climbing unstable ladders in stock rooms to get shoes and being belittled by management. "
bad,"Everyone was nice and welcoming and friendly, great place to make big sales and management was great, pretty cool perks as far as discounts and getting a free pair of shoes when you start, everyone was patient and friendly!"
bad,"Doesn't matter the quality of your work only if they like you .  VERY Unprofessional "
bad,"DM is very hostile and difficult to get along with. Just when you think you've gotten a handle on the store, corporate throws more at you with no resources to accomplish required tasks. The budget for labor is so low that the stores don't have enough coverage to prevent shoplifting or even assist customers. DM sets managers up to fail so they don't have to pay bonuses."
bad,managers lack of professionalism make skechers an unbearable place to work. Terrible scheduling and inconsistency in giving schedules on time make keeping a job work/life balance impossible.
bad,Management are really difficult to work with. They don't care about their staff and are very discriminatory when it comes to giving shifts out. The lack of communication is so hard to deal with. Rosters for one week would change at least three times a week. Management don't care about you family life and are only focused on money. If you call in sick one week the next week you won't get any shifts. Avoid working there at all costs. I got told I would get a promotion but instead they cut all my shifts altogether and when I sent emails or had any issues they would ignore it completely.
bad,"this place is simple and cal. However working only 3 days is not viable. The management in that location is friendly, but demanding. This is only good for high school kids who needs to make some money"
bad,"Severely understaffed, will be working on your own, made to feel like no one cares about you, and management are condescending and will lie to your face."
bad,"Rude, demeaning, lazy director who spent all day on facebook and instagram, and threw temper tantrums and threw things when something went wrong.  Horrible leadership from top to bottom.  No room for advancement because no one cared about their jobs."
bad,Worked as a sales assistant in skechers . Was nothin hard about seling shoes or trainers a kid could do it . They pay was horrible got under paid twice .. with commsion also i have nothin nice to say about the manager at the time her job was not done probley.  I advise you to stay away from the place . I was treated unfairly n have raised issues with many company's to the way I was treated
bad,I honestly hate this place and management had favorites which made it unfair for others to get promoted or get a raise. There is always work to do and it so hard and we get pay very unfairly unless you were a friend of the store manager basically my position as the floor supervisor i got paid the same as a sales associate that got hired cause the store manager decided to to hire only his friends.
bad,"No opportunity to learn. No voice in any ""team"" decisions. No guidance from management. "
bad,"Pros: good discount in store and across other brands e.g. dr martens, vans, converse"
bad,This was my first position in Management. With them a long time. Work was never really appreciated. Qas looked over numerous time for advancement. They don't do things according to policy.
bad,"The company requires it's employees to be accessible 24/7 , not allowing it's employees to have a semblance of a life outside of work. The new direction of the company calls for almost a robotic demeanor in the work environment."
bad,"I was hired with the promise of promotion within 4 months and then after a year of being there I left because I got tired of being told “just be patient”. "
bad,"The job itself is a lot to learn, but once you know the stuff it's very easy. Making commission was very helpful to paychecks but it's very easy for coworkers to steal your sales and the commission on it. There's a lot of room for advancement, however my location had terrible management and if they didn't like you then you had the worst hours and would never stand a chance of being promoted. I was also the lowest paid but most experienced out of all my coworkers, being there for almost two years. Working with such a terrible management put a bad taste in my mouth for Skechers overall, so I'd personally never work there again."
bad,I’m so glad I do not work there anymore! The manager is absolutely terrible and very unprofessional! More than half the original employees quit because of him! HR did a horrible job of getting rid of him despite the constant complaints from employees! I would highly NOT recommend working here between the wages and management!
bad,"I worked at Skechers for almost a year, a lot of broken promises to move up within the company. Unprofessional district manager . It was all about your appearance , never about your work ethic. They will send employees to corporate to help but never move them up."
bad,"Me personally, my experience at Skechers from the time I started until now is just unbelievable. Management is pretty consistent and are good communicating leaders but what’s being passed down to the associates from Corporate is ridiculous. They as in corporate don’t care about the employees or how the store is ran as long as what they ask for gets done. The place is just about always low staffed and the work load that is workers get is ridiculous. Would not recommend working here."
bad,Overall it depends who your manager is....most are snobby and horrible at running a retail store.they dont concider the emploees opinion. They runn the store like they are in high school.
bad,"Skechers is a great company ,Management is not so great.Long hours for the pay and not enough employees. Overall if you like shoes this is the best place to be."
bad,I would not recommend working at Skechers. They are very unorganized and lack communication skills. I almost got fired because they wrote the wrong name on the termination papers.
bad,"They only want to hire those with a year of work experience, despite paying their workers like they're entry level. Corporate is poorly run and has unrealistic expectations of its workers. Quick to fire hard workers for petty reasons. Too many internal conflicts, Horrible hiring decisions of store managers. Pay is not worth the expectations of corporate. Constant retractions of employee pay and discounts."
bad,When you are hired everyone is nice to your face the first day or so then it all goes down hill from there.  There is no communication between management and new hires.  I worked there for less than a month and it was like I never even existed or was even there it seemed.  The employees fear their manager and when the store manager isn't there it's like a playground or a free for all it felt like.  The job isn't what it's made out to be and you should definitely read between the lines before applying here. I wish I had.  The only positive or good thing I took from this place was the district manager was awesome and had an amazing chat with him he seems to be the only one that has any kind of genuine emotion and felt like he does care about who's hired and is the right fit for the company. His management team beneath him should be taking pointers on how to conduct themselves professionally and not just act like carbon copies of the store manager and have no thought process for themselves.  Glad I got out when I did and I'm somewhere so much more positive and better suited to my career goals.
bad,"this is the worse place i have ever worked at, let me start by saying the managers don't manage there people right they party with all there associates and they are not professional at all. everything is based in favoritism or who the manager likes better, so if you want to get hours then lets hope the manager likes you, the pay is really low and they are really inconsistence, they don't go by the book everybody just makes there own rules specially the managers. they just hire anybody like i mean anybody to be your manager not having any clue on what to do, so the associate ends up teaching the manager pathetic right? oh and they ask you to work off the clock as well."
bad,"Working for Skechers at this location and at the time WAS THE WORST! I was (at the time, so 2017-2018) getting paid 8.50 doing manual labor. I would work 25 to 35 hours per work while in high school, there is no work life balance!"
bad,Una empresa estable con un ambiente poco  agradable con crecimiento a corto plazo  esquema de comisiones el tipo de gente por las zonas que se encunetran las tiendas es ameno
bad,"I worked at the Orem location and the upper management in corporate drove everyone or with there insane standards. At some point there were only 4 of us working. Me with a disability, a highschooler, a collage student, and a very pregnant women left to run a huge warehouse store (twice the size of a normal store) I worked 27days straight working 12+ hrs trying to keep my job and when we get our review they not only wrote us all up because we couldn't do the work of 15 people but consistently threatened our jobs."
bad,"work on communication, no team leadership, backtrack on everything. need to better the organization from within the company. no type of recognition for the team"
bad,The management was awful. Human resources did not try and help with that either. The pay was bad and the hours were stressful. Short meal breaks if you got any.
bad,"Worked here for a little over a month and hated it. Extremely unrealistic high standards expected."
bad,"I was very young but management changed quite often, the pay was terrible and sometimes they would make you stay for overtime and not pay you for it. I would not recommend."
bad,Productive workplace. I've learned a lot that has help my mannager skills and I've also learn how to appreciate my work environment more
bad,"Before I had a applied the rumors through out the mall on skechers is they have a VERY HIGH turn over rate. After I looked past this I applied and slowly was hired. I quickly came to realize the rumors were TRUE!! There were only 9 people including managers working. In a mall like the woodbury commons customer service is priority, but corporate management did not see if that way. They would put stress on their Untrained managers which then came down on us all because of lack of employees. Nobody applies here and many people who work there will detour you from applying just as a saving grace. If this place was beefed up with staff and corporate would get their head out of there butts, it could actually be enjoyable to work. On the other hand they don't pay very well compared to the ever growing stores around it in woodbury. My tip is wait till they figure out what they are doing, but the turn over rate should stop you in your tracks apply else where you will make more and have less stress then what skechers corporate Managment will give you here!"
bad,Please do bot join Skechers South Asia Private Limited. It was very bad experience in this Company
bad,Would NOT recommend anyone to work for this company unless you are a young student looking for casual work. For anyone looking for full time work and job security this is not the company for you. You would get paid the same if not more being a check out chick at a large retailer than working yourself hard every day with no team recognition or appreciation. It also has the highest turn over of employees than any other small retailer. (Says it all) a very sink or swim business with tight knit selected groups.
bad,"en esta empresa comencé como Almacenero luego ascendí a ser encargado de tienda, Aprendí muchas cosas en esta empresa una de ellas la responsabilidad y el saber llevar un equipo de trabajo."
bad,Skechers is a great company. But. It is hard to move up in the company. They are always moving people around and people are leaving. Most stores are under staffed and overly worked including the store manager. Good starter job for high school and college students tho.
bad,"No hay compañerismo, tienes suerte si tienes apoyo de alguien más dentro de la tienda. Ya que como casi todo el salario depende de las comisiones todos actúan muy egoístas para ""ganarte"" las ventas."
bad,"I was usually the only one working and was always called in when  I did not have time. If I ever needed to take off because of school, or a family issue, I was not allowed."
bad,"There was a lot of bullying in the workplace which wasn't treated correctly. "
bad,"Overall, the store manager will push all the work onto the management and associates while informing the DM does not show results. Overall if they can work an employee Full-Time hours while only being a part timer, they will take full advantage of it."
bad,Worked part time as a sales associate. Sold shoes to different types of people. Located in downtown so it was close by to everything.
bad,I work for 2 different stores and 2 different managers one of which was a peer employee of mine. Hs management skills had ran everyone working for him off.
bad,I work at one in az.. the manager do not care about you if your a sales associates.  They will not listen to you or care about your issues. Managers sit on there butts all day and dont work. If something goes wrong they blame it on the sales associates
bad,Management is a joke. The company only moves up people that suck up instead of working hard. Company doesn't care about employees. False promises left and right.
bad,Not a good company. Boss is suck. No leave and no OT. Management suck. I won't want to work there anymore. My supervisor quit cause of it. Because of taking leave they can last min don't approve.
bad,"I've been an assistant manager, the pay increase is a joke. the management team is absurd and the Higher ups only care about themselves. run away from this place RUN!"
bad,"pay is absurdly low for job level"
bad,"Everyday i meet with management to see what sales goals we have to meet that day. I help make sure the flow of the store goes smooth. I do projects such as filling and shifting in new product, price changes, promotion marketing changes. Shipment days i work truck and make sure all cases have been received. Twice a week i help do inventory of the product in our store. The overall people in the store are hard to get a long with. There is always something negative going on. My most enjoyable part of my job is customer service and working in the stockroom. There is no hard part to me because i have learned a lot from my former management."
bad,"Honestly don’t bother working here. I was a 2IC that jumped up to manager in a few weeks- manager was fired due to inappropriate conduct (so that obviously shows they can’t hire well). Then instead of having an area manager that commended when you did well, she would criticise you. "
bad,If you want to listen to dull music and have managers tell you to be disrespected and just smile or you will get written up. Ive seen in a month 3 managers leave because the work was not whatbwas told to them. Associates are not taking serious if they say they can not come in on certain days even after they requested off in advanced. They won't honor it. But if you love wearing Skechers to and from work. Its the perfect job for you.
bad,Day in and day out every manager makes you do something different so no matter what your day brings in the manager that is there that morning or whenever your shift starts is going to change it so be ready as you clock in.
bad,"The job itself is very easy to learn, most days you're doing the same thing, so I had no problems there.... But you all know the saying ""people don't leave jobs, they leave bad managers""..... I felt like I was in high school all over again... Constant gossiping by shift managers about other employees, managers not willing to help others when it's busy. And my all time favorite....being left on the sales floor alone while it's busy, so I would be running the cash wrap & sales floor while the shift manager and her buddy hide out in the stock room and talk...And whenever I asked for help I got treated like I was an annoyance.  Employee turnover is high as well."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers and providing exceptional customer service. The management made the job very difficult, wasn't willing to work with employees and provided an unpleasant work environment."
bad,"Era buen lugar de trabajo, por los compañeros de trabajo, pero a la vez es mucho trabajo para el poco salario que ganas."
bad,upper management would give wrong answers to questions you had or never get back to you it was the most stressful job that I had and felt like there was no support
bad,Working for Skechers was more frustrating than rewarding. The turnover rate was extremely high. With constant changes in all levels of management and associates its hard to find solidarity within the store. Most new hires were always from outside the company so transition periods were long. Never give opportunities to people within the company because of constant change in management.
bad,"As a manager you are required to work a lot of over time which only you will be blamed for as poor time management, the turnover is extremely high because the expectations are unrealistic. "
bad,"Walking in and management isn't on top of everything like supposed to be. It's retail, it's meant to get busy out of nowhere. But the team isn't really a team. The hardest part of the job is it becoming too overwhelming and the team doesn't really act like a team in the sense that they do not take their time there serious enough."
bad,"Work days consist of Shoes."
bad,"As much as I wanted to enjoy going to work, when ever I got there my energy was immediately drained, it was good for a while but I always did more then they paid me to do, my coworkers were great but corporate was eating away at everyone’s sanity"
bad,"The district manager likes to micro manage he pretends to be a people person, but he is not. I do not recommend for you to work at this place especially the one on the sawgrass mall."
bad,"Working at Skechers was an exhausting and miserable task that hindered my ability to maintain focus outside of my workplace. I was uncomfortable, disrespected, and overlooked; on top of being treated unfairly when all I wanted was to do me job with the correct training. (I was not, and several others were not, provided with the correct training to maintain their job description."
bad,Management was absolutely horrible. Managers could do no wrong while district managers never blinked an eye at their favorites. Anyone who wasn't in their clique wasn't important.
bad,"I made it out for what it was worth. I came in looking to move up the ladder but was stuck at the lowest position possible, even when I showed potential and to be knowledgable enough to move up. Pyramid scheme feel between the concept stores, HR, and corporate."
bad,Don't come here unless you're ready to be miserable. Everyone hated it and quit including the managers.  Your work is not valued you will always be expected to do more than asked of you but e paid for less than what you are doing.
bad,"Very unprofessional and unorganized, would not recommend to anyone. they have commission, other then that nothing really good to say about them... sorry..."
bad,"No structure, no training manuals up to date, upper management constant changing, directives given with tight deadlines, working alone for hours"
bad,"This job's pay-to-work ratio is all off.  You'll be asked to work many hours a week for a paycheck that isn't worth it.  The management just fights with one another, the corporate office has ridiculous standards and expectations (expecting an outlet store to sell as well as a full location), and you will 100% not be considered for upward movement.  They'd rather hire someone outside of the company with relevant experience for the desirable positions.  I would avoid working here unless desperate, as I was."
bad,"Need to be able to work multiple places at once as manager may require you to help her with management, cashier duty and floor team all at once while also being friendly and helpful to customers"
bad,"Average pay but with the bonus of commission. It is great when there is overtime but sales contracts are based on 6hrs, and additional shifts are often taken away or changed at short notice."
bad,"I got hired on a whim here. It was slow going at first, but there was no manager when I was first hired and the manager they eventually hired was soon fired. The manager that took their place was a well enough fit, aside from the fact that no one knows how to communicate here and you're constantly being given conflicting information from the manager and assistant managers. The back is definitely a hazard, theres shoe boxes stacked everywhere and at one point in the bathroom too, as well as stacked haphazardly around the store."
bad,"There was a lot of favoritism at the workplace. Everyone was micromanaged, which made the work environment very tense. Workers worked together and management pitched in but there was a real disconnect between employee and managers."
bad,No opportunity to move up and dissatisfied with Regional and District management.  Good benefits but very stressful environment for the pay rate offered.
bad,"Does the bare minimum always. Does not provide a break room, a table or anywhere to really sit down and relax while on lunch or break. Management complains when you do take a break or lunch when you have to by law. Doesn't hire reliable people, and doesn't have good pay. perfect for kids looking for pocket money."
bad,"First store manager that worked there before leaving was rude, sat in the back room the whole shift or left to go out with a friend while on the clock. When that store manager left the new one was just as bad and had part time employees work full time hours while the store manager worked part time hours."
bad,"I work for three different managers, a lot of different Assistant managers . The last manager that was there played favoritism. I would come in work hard coming in early and staying late and never got a thank you."
bad,The day is a hit or miss depending on who is scheduled. The management can be weak and not know what they're doing. There is no organization and structure to the shipment and transfers; we get completely bombarded with hundreds of boxes with no room to put them. The days drag and aren't made any better with poor management that overworks the few with flexible availability and overlooks the harder workers.
bad,"For a company hiring college/uni students they don't offer much flexibility and the manager at my location did not care for his employees. He compared him to them and used the  ""back in my day"" excuses on them. It's a boring job but good if you want to get paid to do minimum work."
bad,"I'm only here until I graduate college and move forward with my career but, I like working here at times. My favorite part of it all is that we make the commission if we sell 2 or more shoes to a customer. Sooo I loooove the commission and it really makes us push our sales. Just the managers only think about each other and care about themselves, district manager as well. They don't really care about their employees that much. The store manager doesn't really listen if you request a day off they give you a lot of c r a p for it. I just want considering we deal with a lot of rude customers!!!"
bad,"When I first started, I enjoyed the work, company, and co-workers. Now that I have been there for close to 2 years, I don't feel as if I'm getting enough benefits to support both my family and I. I never have anyone to help cover my shifts but am expected to cover for others. I don't get paid sick-leave or vacation. I am trying to find a new job that will be more suiting for me, but I did enjoy most of my time with the company."
bad,I honestly didn't like how things were ran. There was so much favoritism in the workplace and even the customers could tell who was getting the better benefits.
bad,Executive leadership is not supportive of lower levels of management.  You never hear any appreciation for a job well done and the senior/executive leaders (VP and up) do not function well together....creating organizational dysfunction at lower levels of the company.
bad,"I worked at Skechers for 6 years and while I loved it as a sales associate, as I grew into my management role I realized how terrible upper managment really was. Working in New York City if you aren’t in a high profile store you are left at the bottom of the barrel so to speak, with managers making less than some sales associates in bigger stores. Starting there when minimum wage was so low, my raises were terrible each time I was promoted. By the time I left I was only making $3 more than some associates who had started a week ago. Upper management literally clinged to their favorites so you watched people get promotion and job opportunities 2/3/4 times before you even had a visit at your store. Overall I loved my store, but not the company and it’s politics."
bad,"Coworkers are low- Lifes. Management doesn't do any work but expects associates to do everything. For the amount of work that has to be done, the pay is terrible. Customers are messy and rude."
bad,"Typical day at work would consist of reaching sales targets and learning new product knowledge. I learned a lot about performance shoes and retail in general. Management is very unorganized, and are often very lazy and rude. Co workers were great, everyone gets a long, however there will be times where staff argue over sales/commission. The hardest part of the job was having to put up with management. Also you are only allowed to book off one saturday per month and you can only switch shifts once a month which is ridiculous. "
bad,A typical day at work is wake up at 1:00am. start working at 2:00am. Start bringing merchandise to the store. relocate all the merchandize. Work 5 hours continually. Take one hour lunch with co-workers.  Continue working on my project until the store is open. The store opens at 10 am. So a do customer service and cashier for one hour. Thats wen i work on shipment. when i work in a regular day. I only do 100% customer service and cashier.
bad,"Although the pay is OK, they are very disorganized and tend to cut many more hours than promised. On the contrary, I was able to work with other and understand the concept of keeping customers happy."
bad,"The only horrible company I have worked for, I wouldn't even suggest it to my enemies. Once a new manager arrived, the whole working environment became toxic. Store manager has temper issues and clearly cannot manage ethically. Due his behaviour, many people continued to quit. His expectations are too high for a minimum wage job where he verbally abuses you. Please think twice before you want to work for Skechers. Otherwise, other sales associates were fun to work with. Busy mall, not a lot of down time since it's a tourist mall in the middle of downtown. Most assistant managers were approachable. Again, think twice before you accept the job offer!!"
bad,"The company delivers a fantastic assortment of footwear to consumers.  It also possesses a variety of store types that provide a range of services for consumers. "
bad,awesome team to work with. great store the cleanness well organized withe the space of the store. friendly customers upper management needs to be better there not trust worthy nor do they communicate well.
bad,company has a great atmosphere but upper management do not care about the day to day of employees. more numbers driven then concern about the well being of staff
bad,"Everyone is underpaid until you get to full time. If you work hard and exceed what is asked of you, you will quickly climb to part-time ASM. In my personal experience, I trained 2 store managers as an assistant manager and they kept making promises to promote me and never did."
bad,"It was alright working there for a little while, got very upset when my family arrangement changed and when school started. Not really willing to work with you."
bad,I do not think Skechers is a good company . Management is very inconsiderate and disrespectful to their employees. I personally have been talked down on and disrespected multiple times . It is a very hostile and drama filled environment to be in .
bad,It was a retail job that was needed to pay the bills. Beyond that it allowed one to practice patience and understand and how to provide customer services.
bad,"They can never keep a solid staff for more than 6 months because this company is super backward in how things are run. Almost every single time the DM would come in they would as if I dropped out of school yet so I could come work full time. Not a very supportive workplace for a college student. When they asked for my availability around my classes, they almost exclusively scheduled me on the days I needed off. "
bad,Processing orders from bins no picking grave yard 10 hours drama....... Not fairly with all the employees they had there favorite ones................
bad,"The management is absolutely terrible. There's no clear instructions or any form of support coming from higher ups, you're just required to know and learn things on your own. Theres also alot of gossip that goes round this company."
bad,The management wasn’t so good they cared more about the money then the employees they were unfair and had favorites and those were the people that got hours.
bad,The managers are very lazy and pick they’re favorites to do certain task that other qualified people should be doing but they do not care. Working 12 plus hours a Day
bad,"Nice selling culture, very customer satisfaction  oriented. Limited room for growth. Poor communication amongst management and corporate. Working off commission can be very rewarding based off your work ethic and hustle."
bad,"This job was very Interesting, I did slot of packing shoes into boxes I also did lots of walking for 12 hour's a day 6 day's a week. My paychecks we're Great."
bad,I noticed that the staff is very under trained in customer service. The store during the day is very messy from employee's not picking up after themselves or customers
bad,"Skechers is okay for a kid to start out ."
bad,"I worked with this company a little over a year. While I did got 3 promotions in 4 months, my life work balance was rapidly deteriorating due to the irresponsible and disorganized upper management."
bad,"cashier ring up customer, do returns, stock, not enough pay, hours was ok, was not there long enough."
bad,"I enjoy working retail, I love Skechers product. The largest issues with Skechers is the lacking of corporate support."
bad,upper management was corrupt and unsupportive. not a company I was compelled to stay with.
bad,"Could be a good place to work but very disorganized and unstructured, especially with upper management. We had realigned our district several times over the past year and a half which is tough. We lost a very good district manager because he did not receive support."
bad,"I did get good hours at this store, and I also learned alot about retail. The co-workers were cool to work with, but I felt they did not treat all employees equally which was tough to deal with daily."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company for someone with long term career goals. This is more so for those fresh out of highschool that need experience. Employees aren't compensated for the all the work and effort they put in.
bad,"Wasn't the best experience. Did feel acknowledged, wasn't a good work place environment and the higher ups did not help at all. Very disappointed in my experience."
bad,"I loved working for this company in the beginning. The company changed and everything was about appearance. You had to look the right part to be hired, promoted or kept on the team. Qualifications came second to appearance, and that is not how it should be."
bad,"- Poor Management"
bad,Just make sure that you're a fast learner know how to talk to customers know how to talk to management and talk to corporate people overall know how to add more to sell
bad,Penoso poco compañerismo por no decir ninguno por parte del encargado
bad,Having to climb up and down the ladder was very dangerous and the pay wasn't equivalent to the work. Breaks were not long enough and the store either was extremely slow or too busy
bad,"- clean windows and shelves, serve customers "
bad,"I worked very consistently which was amazing. I loved knowing that on these days I would work around four to six hours. In my first week I met four girls who had all given notice, within two weeks we had a staff of five with another new hire the week after that. We all learned why the store lost so many people. Two of my three managers we absolutely awful. The store manager would belittle you if you forgot the one very obscure insole that is literally only in one shoe. I had been made to totally fix our Mark Masons in the stock room because someone else had put a shoe in the wrong place. But I had been back there and seen the one misplaced shoe. There were five more in the wrong space. So as punishment for focusing on my sales goal instead of fixing it I spent the last hour and a half of my shift fixing and moving and getting crushed by these many many many boxes of shoes. The other manager just left me. A number of times, she would say she was taking her lunch walk out the door and come back not a half hour later but forty five minutes or even an hour. She would later complain that she was hungry and I'd tell her to get something to eat, and she would take another full break. Plus one time she just up and left the store after she had purposely switched shifts with another manager. The assistant manager on the other hand was lovely. One time she bought a big box of Cinnabon and let me take a few home for my family. Within about a month I was thinking about quitting. I had it marked in my planner for the six month date, I couldn't make it. I quit before black friday. "
bad,"A typical day at work I would come in early and start off by helping customers if i see they are in need of assistance. After I've taken care of the customers I get chatted in and they explain the goal for the day and the goal I am supposed to hit. Mostly every time I hit my sales quota and more. I love to make my customers laugh and smile but most of all I like to make sure they are being taken care of as best as possible. If they are smiling and happy then that means they are enjoying their stay at the work place."
bad,usually a very fun and productive work place with good employees and a good work environment. All the employees are very supportive and welcoming to any new hires. Recently the management has become very poor with very little hours being given away.
bad,we stretched everyday before we got started on our assignments i learned how to operate a forklift management was not fair they had their favorites. my co-workers did what they had to to get the job done. The hardest part of my job was unloading containers by hand all day long. And the most enjoyable part of my day is when they would let me operate the forklift.
bad,"When I was at Skechers, it was a horribly disorganized company.  The communication was still done by Fax, stores did not have any internet at all.  The volume of product coming into the store was borderline overwhelming and was never ending."
bad,The people were friendly and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed but job security was horrible. store closed down.
bad,my summary about working at Skechers is it was at a fast paste I was k speaking so I had to move fast boxes were on organized orders for not right I mean the reason why I got laid off because of her moving and don't work and give me no more raise so they move to a farther City
bad,"My team is awesome, love the store manager. The company itself sucks. Pay rate is horrible, they will try to screw you over everytime min wage goes up. I've been a manager for 2 years now and a newly promoted manager is getting paid more than I am. I'm not the only that this has happened to. Corporate ALWAYS side with customers even when they're in the wrong. Work environment varies from store to store. If it's a high volume store, you're constantly busy, always on the go. If it's a low volume store, it's pretty chill"
bad,You’re expected to learn most things on your own & chastised when not done correctly. Not too much help from the store manager either. Their system is extremely out of date.
bad,Hours unpredictable didn't know what your schedule was or what area you were going to cover management gone all the time leaving early and making up time
bad,The job itself is good. Learning about the products and being in a fast past environment. My time at sketchers sadly came to an early end due to management and being given the wrong information about the pay. Being told that the pay was higher than it actually was after being there for a couple weeks is unfair to say the least. Overall it is a good work environment but unfortunately it is shadowed with many mistakes and plenty of miscommunication.
bad,"The pros for Skechers are big budget projects with a variety of work, good pay and good people. Cons are there is no work / life balance and management is very unprofessional."
bad,"Skechers had a fast paced and productive sales environment. The employees were highly diverse, and also the customers as well. Skechers was also number 2 in highest sneaker brand sales."
bad,"The turnover at our department is very high, the majority, if not all, of my co-workers feel mistreated.  The management is highly dysfunctional and creates a stress-full environment with abusive behavior.  Feedback is highly emotional and is dependent on moods.  Pay is all over the place, some are paid under-market, some over.  Good to put on your resume, but you have to be careful not to let your self-evaluation get skewed."
bad,Bad management for analyst team.  Very high turnover rate.  More than 10 people leave the team within a year and a half.  Benefit is okay. Low salary.
bad,When i first started working here it was cool. however it is the citadel and you get many foreigners that come and by shoes. the people are very rude and they smell.
bad,"Typical day would be"
bad,"Even though I was only there a short period of time, I adapted to the environment very easily. I realized that selling items and signing up customers for the rewards card came very easy. The reason I quit after about a month is because it became unsafe for me to work there. Customers were always out of line and management ignored it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the inappropriate customers. What I found enjoyable was actually selling the shoes because I was very good at it.  Management didn't seem to care that I am a student and was taking my finals at one point by keeping me there until past midnight on some days."
bad,"Over all good place to grow and gain customer & sales knowledge, however, Skechers management and corporate in general cares little to none about its employees regardless of position or years working there... You will receive Zero recognition and NO respect from anyone above you. Period."
bad,"I've worked at Skechers for about 2.5 years and have yet to receive a promotion or raise despite reaching my goals and being praised for maintaining the store. Most people quit soon after being hired, leaving us few who have stayed to feel overworked and stressed. The customers tend to be older with high expectations for customer service. The company itself has outdated ways of running the stores and it's clear those above the retail workers have never worked a day of retail in their lives. Generally speaking, retail is retail but after talking with previous coworkers who have left, it's become clear that Skechers isn't run nearly as well as most places. I've had some good times here but have decided to look elsewhere and would advise anyone else to do the same."
bad,I worked there as a after school job and I really enjoyed myself while I was there. Learned some new skills and things about shoes I didn’t know about
bad,Unfairly paid associates who work above and beyond for a company that has the worst turn over rate. The company is more preoccupied with cutting back wage percentage and promotions than keeping what good employees and management they do have.
bad,"Skechers is a great place for entry level retail management. It teaches you the fundamentals and skill sets to perform your role. Their downside is presented in the lack of job advancement and instability in their districts and regions, often times there is a large amount of disorganization among upper corporate and the goals they set to their field teams providing dissatisfaction and overshadowing of others looking to benefit themselves. I wouldn't recommend Skechers for any tenured managment or someone that has seen the faces of retail."
bad,I received few hours and the place  was very unorganized most of the time. The managers were somewhat disrespectful and chose favorites. Closing time was stressful and we would leave the store late.
bad,"I worked at a small sketchers shop for a show time and had to leave due to the lack of support I had from management and the stress of the job during busy days where, yet again, I did not receive and support for. I often felt that my concerns were not being looked at and often dreaded going into work."
bad,"This is a job for millennial's to get experience and run.There is too much favoritism and nepotism in the corporate office and some in the field. "
bad,The company has too many of the wrong people in strong positions which leads to failure and frustration. The management is very inexperienced and untrained which leads to much confusion with staff and customers.
bad,"1- Atendo os clientes dando o meu melhor, organizo o armazém e a loja."
bad,"Like the title says, Skechers is an easy place at which to work. The only problem with my particular location is the management. They have an extremely bizarre way of running things. My philosophy is and has always been customers first. They're are the lifeline of not only Skechers but every business. The philosophy at my particular store is: customers second, store maintenance first. "
bad,"it was a fun place to work, lots of good workers, but poor management, and low pay. generally, an ok place to work in.the biggest problem was their commission scheme, where you would have to sell more than one product in order to get any sort of commission, which could lead to workers lying about some products just to make commission that day"
bad,"Wheni first started with skechers, it was a fun place to work.  I got recruited by the best manager, had a wonderful experience with the staff and eveything went fine....until I got promoted.  I got promoted to Assistant Manger to work as the Shape-Up promoter for the Kiosk at Century City.  I had to work 12 hours with no break, If I left the kiosk to go to the bathroom, I got into trouble.  I had to work the kiosk while it rained.  Called the labor people of California and they said that Skechers had every right to treat their employees how they wanted.  I was so upset.  I did everything right and then still got the short end of the stick."
bad,"When the shop is full it's a good place to keep yourself fit and busy, however when the store is quiet/empty it isn't motivated and can become mind draining. Working as a sales assistant theres only so much you could ask to do when quiet. Supervisors and assistant manager were great help, understanding and inspirational. The store manager bought a big dark cloud over everyone and treated us like we were in school, telling us off like children and has a very dated way of managing a store and the staff. However the head office crew are all lovely. Great place to work when in Uni."
bad,The manager always works with you to create your own schedule. Hardest part of the job was climbing ladders in a small stock room. Manager would cut your hours throughout the week if business was too slow.
bad,"A typical day at skechers is customer service giving duties thru out the day to the crew...you always learn something new with workin with shoes....I enjoy working with my co-workers and as a team...the hardest part of the job is that sometimes we don't have leadership at my store since we don't have a store manager....the most enjoyable part of my job is loving what i do, no matter what job im at i put my all in everything I do to get the job dont to mu best ability."
bad,"Management at the Spalding store was beyond poor. When the store manager was away or had a day off, the assistant manager and supervisors would mess around in the stock room and would hardly been seen on the shop floor, especially at weekends when it can be a busy period."
bad,"Skechers is very mismanaged, at the St. Augustine location as well as the higher corporate levels. It’s a simple job but the poor management makes it difficult. By that I mean the poor communication. Managers as well as corporate bosses are unclear of their expectations"
bad,"Working at Skechers taught me a lot, but everything was a big jumble. Management was too strict. We weren't allowed to talk to another employee to just ask a question. Management was very hypocritical to other employees. We were constantly working like dogs. We didn't have a second to breathe. They made sure that we worked more than our pay 11.50 (they paid at the time )."
bad,Great place but has issues as well as other business. Would recommend for a starting job but not longterm. The free space was the stocking area with a refriderator and a chair.
bad,"The location I worked at was honestly a disaster. I worked there for six months and loved the place at first. It was fun, low stress, and everyone seemed to get along. As time went on, things changed. Our store manager didn't adhere to company policies, and a lot of things took place that shouldn't have. It was a lot of teens running a store and fending for themselves. The district manager would pop up but usually just to critique everything we'd worked on. I know of several things that occurred in that location that were probably illegal. There was a lot of harassment within the store between employees, and what really stood out to me was when a coworker of mine committed internal theft and nothing was done about it. Said coworker blamed myself and others, and our district manager didn't address it. When I left, I included many photos and mentioned the internal theft incident, and none of it was addressed. My overall impression is honestly pretty poor."
bad,After over a year of working with the company I’ve seen people come and go. I’ve seen reasons why people stay and reasons why people leave. It feels like a big family working at Skechers. But after losing our last general manager and hiring a new one. It’s been all down hill from there. Management went against availability even denying availability when people just were not able to work the hours. The Skechers management in Ontario Mills is honestly a joke. But you’ll love the people you work with and see on. A daily basis. Thats a fact.
bad,The new managers don't care for the employees. And they only care about promoting there friends from previous jobs but not anyone from within. The district manager is also a terrible person. The associates however are very nice people.
bad,"Its ok working here. Its a lot of work, and as a manager working hours not suitable for moms and dads who have kids. Even though you work for the company very hard, and do your best, if you cannot be at store on shipment days at 3:30 am, because you are a single parent wit small children, they will force you to quit. This company have several managers for a single store, its easy for them to work with you, But they choose not working with you. Its ok for college students, or someone who does not have family life, or have support system. Do not bother to apply to this company if you are not falling one of these categories."
bad,"This job is one that you have to maintain a positive energy, you must work fast paste with a smile on your face. You will make sure the store looks up to company standards."
bad,I would never recommend this company to anyone looking for a job. You are given no direction and are highly under appreciated. Their technology is extremely outdated.
bad,Poor communication between manager and staff. Competitive sales techniques did not allow for trust among employees. Managers did not adhere to uniform guidelines and values.
bad,"The people are amazing, the job is tough and the pay is low for the tasks that are expected. A large company should invest in good workers and treat everyone fairly."
bad,"I believe the company can do so much more than what it is doing now, and to do so they need to start with how they operate and move forward as a whole"
bad,"Fashion Company, which is very fast paced. Great location in Manhattan Beach, CA., and good salary and benefits. Stressful work environment very young and hip!"
bad,"Je n’ai pas aimée, car trop stressant. Je n’aimais pas le secteur où j’étais car cela était remplie d’hommes et trop dur physiquement pour moi , les chefs étaient super désagréable avec moi alors que je ne fessais rien de mal j’avais juste dur à suivre , une fois on m’a isolée car apparement je perturbais les hommes de l’entreprise vraiment hallucinant alors que je venais toute couverte et je ne parlais jamais à personnes , bref expérience horrible."
bad,"busy times square location. selling sneakers and casual shoes to new yorkers and tourist. Men, women and kids all shop at this fun location. selling was aggressive."
good,"Mandatory overtime 12 hours daily "
good,"The staff that I worked with were always close in one way or another, which made the shifts go by quickly. I enjoyed the friendships that I made through working here, but sometimes the job was too stressful."
good,low pay for alot of work
good,"Boring job, not my style, just need money for the time being or the time of me being alive. Not much to learn from there and it’s just to pass by time."
good,"When I first began I was excited,liked the coworkers I was with , fast paced , energetic but with time you realize how much the job is actually bad I personally don’t blame anyone else but I first liked all my coworkers now I can’t stand them , they are allowed to steal a sale and once called out won’t change anything , they put all the work on who ever is willing to while they just relax , overall it’s a horrible job I wouldn’t recommend to anyone"
good,"Very disorganized with the promise of hours, but with the result of none. No personal days given, with lots of disrespect coming from your fellow co workers."
good,If you upset the wrong person you'll loose your job. Management is very corrupt and its hard to get promoted within. However it is a fun environment when things are going well. They aren't very strict as long as you do your job properly.
good,I loved my co-workers which made me look forward to work. but the pay was awful for the amount of work I had to do. not only did I have to be in sales but I had to do stock a lot as well but didn't get paid more than $8.50 an hour. I was also promised numerous times that I would get a promotion but never got one.
good,"This job is a joke. Theres no chance of getting a raise UNLESS you get promoted to a floor supervisor and even then the pay is a joke. When I got hired, I was told that there was a lot of opportunity to grow and that was complete BS. I've seen rarely anyone get promoted in the time I've been there. Management is also a joke. They'll hire any baboon to be in a higher position. Most managers are cool, but the GM and store manager have absolutely no clue how to handle a store that big and with that many employees. The GM (Amber?) lacks common knowledge and would not let us leave the store when there was a ""shooting"" at the mall. thankfully, it was a false alarm, but had it been real, we would've been in real danger. Way to care about the people who keep YOUR store clean."
good,the job was okay at first until the lack of communication came into play. and how they play favorites with employees depending on how well they like them.
good,"I don't like how skechers runs things bc it's based on looks. I've been told by my dm that I don't have ""the look "" because I'm bigger, which is not on the application when applying. They also expect to much to get done in a short time frame and while being under staffed and dealing with customers"
good,"Absolutely loved working as a Skechers Sales Rep/Key Holder. I loved working with the public and furthering my knowledge with athleticware (I'm a runner). However, Skechers was awful with keeping a General Manager - I saw 5 different General Managers within the 4 years of working for this company and there was absolutely no job security and no benefits for working for this company. It's a great place for a high school student to get his/her first job, but nothing more."
good,good job to start off after high school i worked in the warehouse to stock and to stock the shelf with shoes and put them where they need to go
good,it was in the mall very fun place to work and fun people to work with.
good,Great place to learn for future endeavors but not for a life time career. The company work ls off of politics and you won’t make it far within the company.
good,Tons of fraternization and it was ridiculous. The mangers are all friends and try to pick favorites over productivity. They lie about giving hours and act friendly only when they need you. Some managers come in stoned and drunk and act ridiculous. I was sexually harassed by a manager also.
good,"It all comes down to management. "
good,"A good place for beginners, management isn’t the greatest.. The company is great don’t get me wrong, but they definitely pressure you a TON and not always in the best way."
good,High volume fast paced job. Inconsistent hours. Nice associates. I enjoy helping  customers get what they need. I like interactions  with the customer.
good,"I've worked for Skechers as a Sales Associate for almost 2 years and I never had any problems with the management or the team. I really enjoyed my time working at my first Skechers location but that has changed as I transferred to a different store due to my location. The transfer process went on smoothly due to my old store manager, but the new store I am currently working at lacks acknowledgement on basic company policies and professionalism. I was really looking forward to growing with Skechers but the amount of rotation of store managers during my time working here has made it difficult to arise and I find it even more difficult to do so when the team has no clue on how to do things the right way."
good,Productive daily but lack of hours and pay. Great environment to work in. Customer service provided with positive attitudes. Crowded warehouse made job efficency complicated.
good,"I did this as a part-time job. I didn't really enjoy it, some of my coworkers were nice, but the vibe was kind of off and the shoes were uncomfortable, despite the advertisements."
good,"Working at Skechers was an up and down nightmare. There were days where i loved the job, the selling and customer service side of it was fantastic. However the management there are despicable. The store is run by huge personal issues and larger egos and needs a complete staff switch over."
good,"this job is ok, not an amazing place to work at, rigid management, and very little flexibility for schedules, so that is that"
good,"It's a great place to work for a part time sales associate. But for an assistant manager or especially a store manager- forget it. The pay is terrible but they compensate for it at the beginning by promising monthly/ quarterly bonuses. After a year of working as a store manager, I have yet to see either one. Corporate gives you minimal hours to work with and has very high expectations for customer service, daily paperwork, transfers, ect.. They promise their best employees promotions but always end up hiring outside of the company when a position is open."
good,"I enjoyed working at Skechers there is a variety of people which makes it  fun and enjoyable. A day at work consists of greeting"
good,"It is very fast paced, but the day goes by fast."
good,"- strong selling culture"
good,Alright place to work.  Hands tied hiring staff.  Had to allow for the store profile to drop below the approved number.  By that time it was too late to resolve a foreseen issue and one was then placed in the front of a sinking ship.  Really bad upper management
good,"I loved work at first, it got difficult with my store manager and the work environment was stressful and no longer something i enjoyed. I decided to leave the job after a few years of on and off working. I had a family loss and had to take a leave but came back and realized that it was something i no longer was interested in lots of our workers went home crying."
good,"Assistant managers, floor associates, and product specialists are awesome. The store managers that we've gone through, horrible. Some of them expect so much from us with the little hours they give. Our main priority, or I thought, was customer service. But I guess we were wrong. With this new manager, replenishing the store is #1 priority. They don't want us to clean the store when it's messy. The store is now so messy we can't find certain styles of shoes. Sales are also down. If we can't find shoes for customers, how are we going to make sales? If we don't help customers, how are we going to make sales? This current manager has a lot of hours to give us and our availability isn't to their liking but they have to understand that when the previous manager cut our hours, we were forced to find a second and for some, a third job. They also want us to do so many things at one time. For example, they would want us to do one thing and a few minutes later they want us to work on another project. They would then get mad that we didn't finish on the first project because we were working on the second project. Someone from corporate needs to talk to the manager because at this rate the store will close down soon."
good,"Skechers is a cool place to work except for the fact that it is so hot during the summer and there aren’t enough fans , also the staff are a bit racist none of them speak English and they treat the Hispanic workers better than any other race"
good,"Was with the company for four years straight and promoted inside the company but only paid $14 per hour to work full-time As a assistant manager. Overnights were twice or more a week and only standard pay. Regional management was disappointing. Overworked. Understaffed because of corporate cuts to the store even though our location was one of the top stores in region. This is all my own experience with the company, after a while I couldn't handle the work load with the low pay any longer. Store I worked in was an outlet, not a concept, so it was a lot of customer service along with keeping the store clean and organized."
good,"Management runs around with its head cut off, hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers most enjoyable part of job is leaving after closing time"
good,"Working at the warehouse building where everything was BOGO, it was important to be patient with customers attempting to walk out with unpaid goods as well as constantly fixing box arrangements on a normal basis due to kids."
good,"I cleaned bathrooms and assisted customers."
good,lack of communication.most enjoyable part was hourly and comission.management took all the hours and they wouldnt give any to the associates
good,"Management is good, half hour lunch break, co workers are friendly. However I am always stuck with night shifts and working on weekends always."
good,"Great job for seasonal not for permanent. The company has poor policies and don't realky care about their employees. No real reason to move up becase you do not receive a raise, just a title."
good,"Management is very poorly put together, don’t listen or help you train and they get upset when you mess up a tiny mistake. Don’t buy us food for lunch breaks, I recently left because they did not want to work with my school schedule, when in the job description it literally says “can be flexible with hours”. 50% off discount for shoes, customers are very messy and ignorant. $7.25 for a sales associatestarting out, I was told I would be paid $9.00 hr/ for past experience but turned out to be $7.25 because i’m a a”minor”."
good,Es un buen trabajo pero aveces no te hablan con la verdad en cuestiones de pago
good,"I was assigned a section to work in during my shift, the majority of the work was providing customer service. The hardest part of working in the outlet store was keeping the store clean and giving the customers popcorn when it was available."
good,"Teams working in their stores are always awesome, the down fall is mostly with the communication and lack of support from some DMs and cooperate. Customers are like any customers anywhere."
good,job was easy and we got a 30 min lunch break after every 5 hours but there was no real way to advance to hire positons and the pay was awful and there was no commission for selling shoes
good,"Working as a material handler at a Skechers distribution center is a relatively easy job. Most of your job responsibility is just opening boxes and applying pricing labels to individual boxes of shoes. Though the job is easy, and the pay is decent, the hours are crazy. Most days, you're garuanteed to work at least eight hours, and told to work twelve hours about five minutes before you're supposed to clock out, every day. Overtime is offered every weekend and you are expected to show up. If you live even remotely far away, you will end up living in your car between work and driving there."
good,Management that didnt do much managing. I being apart of that also didnt help the problem. Seems to me that the problem is within the district team. hopefully it gets better
good,"Skechers it's a store that sells shoes our focus is the comfort of the shoes.Skechers has three style of shoes which are lifestyle,sports and walking."
good,"Travail de deux heures puis une pause de 15, 30, 15 minutes. Aucune évolution, environnement agréable, management rarement sur le terrain, travail parfois répétitif, travail ludique."
good,"First week working there was good, afterwards one manager started abusing her power. Writing people up for no reason always wanted to outsell her colleagues."
good,"Pays pretty decent, with the district I worked with I was shown there's a lot of favoritism and clique behavior.  It's shoes so for the most part it's a simple job"
good,"Low stress, clean work environment aside from putting on customers shoes, use plenty of sanitizer. Small commission pay decent hours. Customers tend to be easy to deal with."
good,Poor management. The job itself was easy but there was no room to move up or get a raise. There was a lot of favoritism with the managers and some of the coworkers. Many who didn't excel in their duties were given generous hours(because of the favoritism).
good,A typical day at work consisted of putting away stock and helping the customers.  I had a lot of issues with employees starting problems or trying to sabotage my work.  Overall was not impressed with management and employee work ethic.
good,"Promotions from within are few and far between. Company provides tools to be successful, but upper management always has a different idea or method of execution, so it's difficult to know which one is the right one. DM will say one thing, then RSM will come in and say it's incorrect, tell you to do it another way, then HIS/HER boss will come in and say something completely different. There is no middle ground. Upper management does not communicate effectively with each other."
good,"Estabilidad,crecimiento, excelente comisiones, creas un ambiente bueno de trabajo donde no te es pesado elaborar."
good,"It can be a good job for school, but upper management will consider the business needs before they consider yours. Favoritism is not allowed, but they do it anyway and it is the only you can move up. They do not give enough hours to support their needs, so they expect so much effort and sales from you. If you wish to keep this job, do not expect your sales to matter in this company, but your physical ability to getting things done. Consider this company as a last resort. I've seen so many managers, associates, district managers, and even regional managers come and go."
good,You're only has good as your manager! Management sucks and they expect you to have the store in museum like standards at all times. Which is as impossible at a retail store
good,"Load trucks and keep track of inventory. Quotas for amount of containers loaded per day. Great employees and direct, clear instruction."
good,"runnig the shop floor managing staff ensuring tasks were done and objevtives met on a daily basis."
good,"As a Store Manager it is a constant busy day. Which is good, because not one day is ever the same."
good,I'd say that it's a good job for when you don't have much work experience. Something that can make or break the experience is management. Customers are usually great and really kind.
good,Was let down by management. I reported harassment and bullying and was told that basically my feelings were invalid and that I was making up these reports in my head.
good,The store tends to be understaffed so when we would get a bunch of customers we had to scramble to get things done smoothly. A typical day at work is mostly the fluctuation of customers at certain hours of the day. The workers there were very helpful with showing me what to do. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers.
good,Started of well but during the year management chose their favourites and started mistreating others making people feel uncomfortable so people started leaving. Happy I left now.
good,Negozi in avviamento e poco ancora organizzati parte amministrativa da definire
good,"I would be asked multiple times to come in early, work late, and work overtime. I would be left on the floor alone for a few hours at a time, sometimes during really busy times, and sometimes during slow times. I was constantly being asked to re-organize and move things around on the floor and in the back room."
good,i feel like i do not get paid enough to work in a stressful environment like that. its an easy job but theres a l lot of stealing. And i didnt get a pay raise when i got moved up to floor associate.
good,"It was great working there, I was given the opportunity to move up fairly quick. There I got to learn the management side of the job, which gave me new skills. Upper management is not the greatest, company wise Skechers is not the best to work. They overwork and stress employees with little pay and benefits. Its always who you know and not how productive you are that gets you the recognition that's deserved. I did value what I learned, it helped me grow as a person and as a professional."
good,"Everyone got along great. The managers however, sat in their office all day doing the schedule. I peeped in to ask if I could take a break and was granted but noticed the schedule was filled for the next month and that got me curious. The garbage bag I changed when we opened was full with snacks too, so that's another thing. And she was always on her cell phone. I got back from my break and she was on some shopping websitr, none of which haf anything tobdonwith skechers or affiliates or stores that carried skechers. The shopping cart icon had stuff in it! Onto the backstory. The most unorganized mess ever. They did their best, the warehouse just sent way too much stuff. So much in fact, backstory was on the sales floor. 2 managers would call off all the time. Then they had more than a handful of people I had never even seen or heard of on the schedule as on call just to keep their discounts.."
good,"Working at Skechers you meet some really great people! At the Mcaurther glenn location schedules are very flexible!!"
good,"Locul de munca nu iti permite sa oferi suficient timp activitatiilor personale. "
good,Poor management. Literally no training on anything. The company does not care about their workers at all. The systems are in the dark ages and ridiculous.
good,"There are always projects to work on and customers to help, which made the day go by quickly. The Skechers team was hard working and a pleasure to work with. Management, however, lacked consistency and leadership."
good,"una buena empresa para trabajar, buen clima laboral , con rentas acorde al mercado."
good,"Lavorando qui da ormai 5 anni abbondanti vorrei cambiare lavoro per avere nuovi stimoli e per appagarmi personalmente magari cambiando proprio tipologia di lavoro, oppure entrando a far parte di un  brand più affini a me dove posso esprimere tutte le mie capacità e la mia voglia di fare, come lavorare nel campo della moda o per un brand importante. "
good,"This company can be better if they had the right management staff take into consideration of the staff. As well, ending the micromanagement method. The store management is the asset of the store productivity. If the Store management cannot work with the associates and provide the tools that are needed, productivity and likeliness of the work productivity drops. As well, when the District Manager and the Regional Manager lack the respect and understanding of the demographics of the store, then there is a breakdown of knowledge to the store dynamics."
good,Working at skechers helped me develop my communication skills as I dealt with a variety of customers of different personalities. The workplace culture is very fast paced and competitive.
good,Its a fairly easy environment to manage though but the pay is not worth how much you have to work. You can tell which people are passionate/care about their job and those that are not.
good,"Skechers asks a lot of its employees and it comes as no surprise that this company has a high attrition rate. They simply overwork employees and severely underpay them for what are asked to do, and with ever increasing KPIs they are always asked to do more."
good,"pretty easy going work environment "
good,"I enjoyed my one year there, but it was at the start of the recession,and employees were being cut, myself included. But. the one year that I was there was very interesting. Good staff that I had, all hard workers. We worked in both the stockroom, and on sales floor during peak hours."
good,a typical day at work would be to attend customers with certain needs and accompany them with perfect shoes for there requirements. I've learn the different styles and technology placed in every shoe and how the structure of the shoe helps shape up an individuals spine and support.
good,"Very labor intensive, requires a lot of back and forth."
good,"A typical day in work involved; Selling shoes to customers, covering sickness in staff, sorting staff issues and problems, swapping shifts that they didn't like or couldn't do.  Compiling reports, sorting stock or customer issues, planning for the week ahead etc."
good,"Productive and very task orientated work place. Great benefits but not very adequate salary compensation. A typical work day consist of assisting customers with any inquiries and dissatifictions, shipping and recieving inventory much by bulk. Officing: supply ordering, scheduling and budgeting monthly matrix. Maintaining visual aspects both on front end and stockroom."
good,I was excited at first but I’ve grown out of the job and need something better and more challenging. I encourage entry level teens to apply to this job.
good,Manager is flexible for students and will work with your schedule. But if you are seeking for a job that will give you good hours this is not the place. Otherwise easy work place.
good,It’s all about the company your needs are second. 5 am shifts until 10 turn into 5 am shifts until 2:30. If they begin to put you on weekends good luck that’s the only time they’re going to put you to work.
good,"El sueldo no era tan malo, yo trabaje ahi de medio tiempo, la ventaja era que pagan semanal, conocí a muchos compañeros con los que trabaje de manera excelente en equipo, pero influyen más las pésimas decisiones y tratos de los sub gerentes y gerentes que tienen su ego por las nubes, nunca están en el suelo y tratan super mal, además de mis dos años en la empresa, 1 año fui tiempo completo y jamas tuve oportunidad de crecimiento, tasa de comisiones muy mala, tan sólo el 0.75% de Lo que la tienda vende, cuando en otros lados tienen el 2% de comisiónes."
good,"I’ve Learned a lot from working at Skechers, I’ve learned how to have patience with the not so nice customers. I’ve learned how to work as a group. My store manager is great! She’s great at communicating with all the employees! The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customers get new clean shoes on their feet!"
good,"Easy work."
good,"If you want my honest opinion, it’s a great way to start learning the reigns but it’s also depending on who you’re lead by. There’s just too much they want you to remember for the little time you actually spend on doing those things."
good,"This job would be a good seasonal job, it is always busy in the summer and around the holidays thats when they use you and need you the most and you have a lot of hours, then it gets slow after the new year and they give you only two days a week then to one day a week then to none and have all the managers working until they are able to give us hours, in 2018 this happened and we went three months jan-march with no hours and we had to go and look for other jobs.. Terrible!! And its the same way this year, during the summer and holidays a lot of customers come and shop, mostly families. We get commission if you sell two or more shoes by 2% I believe and you get more money in commission when you sell apparel. The job is easy, the managers are cool, expect one which is the store manager, she doesnt train properly and ignores us, we really learn on our own or by the assistant managers."
good,"Worked there for a fair length of time. The first few months, were pretty good - with the exception of a few members of staff. Selling and learning about the shoes is easy to remember and can be picked up quickly. However, then the management completely changed and the entire moral of the shop went downhill. Store manager cares more about the business, than the health and well being of the staff. It's a shame that the place is going down hill, as the job itself isn't too bad, just ran very poorly by management and made to feel like a number and not human being."
good,It was alright to work there. the concepts of retailing are pretty simple to grasp especially to people who are new to the retail world. It was hard however to negotiate availabilities and to find people who can cover your shift
good,Stock is easy enough once you learn techniques but you still need strong leadership with a plan when dealing with so much inventory. If management ALL worked together the teams would be able to all work smarter instead of harder.
good,A typical day at work consists of talking to and assisting customers who come into store whilst carrying out other jobs that are essential for a smooth running and tidy store. I learned how to communicate effectively with customers and think in my feet to provide on the spot solutions to problems. The workplace was friendly and very welcoming. The hardest part of the job was trying to work stock into the shop floor whilst trying to serve customers and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday.
good,"I currently work here. I like my supervisors and managers. We all get along and had developed this sort of ""family"" at the workplace. All co workers get along and cooperate together. Management is okay, but communication is not their best attribute. Some shifts are better than others and busier than others. The shoes sell themselves basically, so all you have to try to sell is the stores accessories (socks, hats, shoe cleaners, candy). The hours are not great because all sales associates don't even get 20 hours per week and it's bi weekly pay. It's a good job to keep you busy and to earn a little extra money on the side."
good,Very fast pace. Not for everyone. Those who do make it are well taken care of. Tons of projects to work on.  Great support and inspirations from the team.
good,"Great position an work environment compared to most retail positions and companies. "
good,"The first manager I worked for would work around my school schedule, give free lunch, and do whatever he could to help out his employees. The second manager I worked for would not work around my school schedule and often tried to schedule me when I needed to be at school. She also wouldn't really do anything to help out her employees."
good,I learned a lot with my previous manager about managing and running a store. But the job turned into more of a chore with the new management. It used to be team orientated but now everything falls on a few workers.
good,"The administration is very Bad, Management could not try to improve this.brand marketing, New comers did not clear about company joining policy and their documents."
good,"Job was okay, mostly didn't like it because of the culture; promotions were based on popularity, not by merit. One of the coo things about the job was that we got to look at all the shoes and go work at different stores sometimes"
good,"Everyone who works for the company is very passionate about the brand. In management they have a high expectation of your performance, and your ideas are taken into consideration."
good,"I left because they cut all of my hours, one paycheck would only cover my gas money. Good for learning basic retail sales skills, if you are looking for a place to start you should start here."
good,"Communication within the company was quite poor and it made it difficult to understand what was required and what I could do for the company..."
good,Not much support from Upper Management to succeed in your role. Very high staff turnover. Felt very intimidated by certain people in the company.
good,"good company to work for not alot of room for advancement, sometimes unorganized but great job for someone looking for good part time work or a second job"
good,"Fun retail environment. Good commission structure."
good,"customer service "
good,"The day starts like any other day, you walk in and punch in and start business as usual. I really learned how to deal with customers in a friendly respectful manner, no matter how they treat me. I could get along with all of my co workers. The job was not hard in any sense of the word. I enjoyed coming to work and feeling like i was with my family."
good,"Bom ambiente de equipa "
good,"Since I've work for Skechers in August of 2013, I'm not pleased with how the Part-Time Employers are not able to receive full benefits or is not allowed more hours to work. I get along well with my co-workers but I think the Corporation should be more considerate towards its' employers."
good,"processing shipment during the week ."
good,"work is overall an enjoyable experience at skechers. the staff is very kind. do not expect full time work as a sales associate, however they welcome individuals moving up in the company."
good,"There was no guarantee of a raise and they had to cut hours so they had enough to pay every one. The coworkers were great, the manager was okay and seemed a little irritated when us newbies didn't get how to do some things."
good,"It's a constant on the go situation with little reward. Some of the ideas the company implements are not to the most effective standards. Upper management is not always helpful. The customer is always right and you are always wrong. But if you have a good team, it is worth it."
good,"Would be a great first job  out of high school will learn a lot of customer service skills. Pay is not as good, job is pretty chill not much to worry about."
good,"Only needed in the busiest days . Manager didn't communicate as much. fun to work at sometimes depending how many customers come in. GOOD pay .Learn how to deal with customers. Learn the importance of greeting a customer , work as a team."
good,"The job in itself is very satisfying, fun and relatively easy.  The only downfall is the corporate's lack of support or communication with the stores."
good,"service customers. product knowledge. cashier. Shipment control."
good,"Great opportunity for a self motivated, fast paced, quick thinker.   If you can work with a sense of urgency and enjoy working as part of a team AND individually you will do great.  However depending how your coworkers are towards each other can really set the environment.  When you have a good crew the store can run like a machine."
good,"When I started at skechers i was excited and it was a great job with great co workers, as time wore on and company policies changed or got lost in translation as there is a never ending level of micro managers (District Manager, Regional Manager, State Manager, Coast Manager, etc) it became less so. The compensation and hours were alright to start but the company instituted a policy putting all part time employees at no more than twenty hours per week and you would be written up for going even a minute over. We also constantly had staffing problems as the brand is not the most popular, causing the part time policy to create even more stress within the store."
good,"I enjoyed working here over the last couple years. If you’re someone that’s a bit shy and reserved this place will get you out of your shell in no time. Management is hit or miss but it’s still a fun work environment to be a part of. If you’re looking for something extremely part time to work around your life then this is the place to go. Corporate is unorganized and often clueless, hard working people are always forgotten of. Don’t expect many promotions to be handed out or any sort of crazy raises if you’re lucky enough."
good,"it can be fun and easy when everyone is able to do their job. there have been many occasions when managers have left the floor and left employees by themselves even when it is busy. the communication between management and employees is not very good. employees dont get enough credit. we almost never have christmas parties, there are favourites and it is clear to see."
good,A typical day at work would be greeting customers and providing them with the type of shoe they are looking for. Also restocking the shelves and making sure the store is neat.
good,Workplace culture is very dynamic. Very fun environment and allows employees to gain a lot of knowledge with products and consumer behaviour in general. Hardest part of the job would be changes in management with new rules.
good,"A pretty basic retail store. "
good,"Working in retail is never easy. I learned how to detail with difficult customers and I learned how not to take bad days home with me (face it, you can't help everyone).  The company is growing and constantly advancing employees."
good,"A typical day at school could be either slow or fast paced depending on whether it is a weekday or on a weekend. Management is outgoing, and is fairly nice towards employees."
good,"Manager was not giving workers enough hours to work, im a hard working man i would like to have more hours for example 40 hours a week. not enough communication"
good,"Getting and overview from a manager(shift change), bringing out product, filling out paperwork, cleaning. Management was easy,,, i listen to every associate and make sure they understand what i expect. Hardest part was keeping up with all the visual changes without the right number of employees to help and the most enjoyable part was being and team and putting a smile on customers faces ."
good,poder saber como ingresar la mercaderia a diferentes retail hacer las coordinacion era algo dificil porque no saber la hora en que llegaria el caminon
good,This company was a great job for a college student or recent grad. They were flexible and I was able to learn a lot about business and management skills.
good,"Skechers teaches me many things and gives me confidentiality to work in any place, I have learned how to deal with different situations and using all my skills to provide the best service developing my attention proactively."
good,"Decent atmosphere with peers and certain supervisors, but like any company there is always change, although some of the changes seemed unwarranted. Work life balance was something that certain supervisors had no understanding of. Overall compensation wasn't great and workload was more than most companies expect. Overall decent nothing stellar."
good,"- lo que mas me agrado fue que el pago es semanal, por tal motivo no me afecto en mi economía rápidamente"
good,"count safe and registers and make records of money. open the doors to the customers, greet and customer service. this includes helping customers fins their size, or simply asking how there dat is going. our coworkers are making sure everything runs smooth and that customers are being taken care of in a timely matter. the hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer if we do not ave what they are looking for simply because it is our job to satisfy them. what i enjoy most is being able to sell a product that i a, proud to work for and am able to sell to people all over the world."
good,"organized the shoes and sells"
good,"Shoes. Feet. Kids. Kid's feet. Decent company to work for. Otherwise, see beginning of comment."
good,A very fast-paced environment with many things changing by the second. I have learnt to adapt to my surroundings quickly and managed my workload smoothly. The hardest part is to obtain approvals but the most enjoyable part is accomplishing the completion of all projects on time.
good,This company is very different its a cut throat kind of company. I've learned a lot from how to handle customers also.how to multi-task
good,a good experience for a first time job. was very beneficial to a person with no experience.also very good opportunity to grown within the big business world. i had amazing employees i worked with everyday.
good,"The new manager over this store during that time, was very rude and hard to work with. Job hours were good, just the work environment was toxic. I liked the employees, just the manager was not friendly."
good,"helping customers find the right shoe for their needs, fast paced work days. Building sales by adding on apparel, accessories, to help make business goals."
good,"Vendas"
good,Skechers was my beginning job to help me find my career job or better driven job. I was promoted twice. I am a assistant store manager and have done my time with this company. I need structure and valence in my life and I do not have this with this job. I am looking for a wonderful job and a life balance. This was a good start off job to knowing what I am capable of but now I am looking for better to better myself.
good,We always had fun but there was always stuff to do and product to get out or to straighten the boxes. we always had good reviews and repeated customers.
good,"The people were your family and the Store Manager was the most accommodating and thoughtful human I have ever met. The company itself isnt the bet I have worked for, but overall they are okay"
good,"good environment to work but it can get crazy over the busy periods,typical retail store.everything work manually and old.not a bad place to work....."
good,"I am giving Skechers a 3 star review due to the fact that, although it is a wonderful place to learn skills and job experience for those seeking their first job, it is however, strongly lacking in fair opportunities to build a career. The management picks favorites instead of those qualified. It was mostly the reason I ended up quitting, alongside the fact that I had just had a baby and was treated quite terribly and wanted to stay home with my child. If you are a teenager or young adult looking for a job to gain experience and extra cash, this place is perfect, but, if you are like me in your mid to late twenties and want to move up in a career, find somewhere else."
good,When I was working there the management was ok. But I hear that the managment has improved alot. Went and shopped there recently and there is fret customer service
good,"Music is always too loud, you turn it down when a costumer asks and the manager turns it back up. Too loud to think. Its not super busy. Keep shoes organized"
good,The job I had here was very easy to do. The hardest problem I had was not being able to fully understand customers that only spoke Spanish but even then was still able to get by with them. You're either helping people find shoes or cashing them out. The rest of the job is just walking around fixing the shoes and displays.
good,"Skechers had its ups and downs, It wasnt the best job especially when the GM we had was very inconsistent. Most of the people i worked with were very nice and i can easily say they belonged there. Others were very lazy and not in the right spirit."
good,"I started working here as a part to improve my customer service skills. Turned out, it was helpful. Learn how to deal with all kinds of customers, and to improve my working skills"
good,"Working at skechers it was new experience everyday with the customers being from different parts of the world. I've met people from France, China, Dominican republic and more."
good,"The managers at Skechers were really nice, and easy to talk to. The work was mostly easy. Though around Christmas they cut everyones hours so when I did work the work load was heavy because did not have enough staff on the schedule."
good,"This job is a good place to start if you are a student. Allows them to grow into a mature adolescent, learning new traits and how to interact with customers. There are great benefits for the employees and room for growth. Flexible hours."
good,"Skechers is a fast paced, competitive work place. Everyday is what you make it and the money also. Their management is good overall, but could be more professional at times. The workplace culture changes constantly depending on the employees and how well they work together. The hardest part of the job was working during busy hours. The most enjoyable parts of the job were the customers, exceeding sale goals, and how much commission I made everyday."
good,"My store manager was one of the best, if not the best. Some managers were lazy, but overall the store manager at the place I worked made it a comfy and cozy family environment"
good,"Skechers is never going to be a company that you are going to be proud to say you work at. It will never be Nike or Adidas no matter how hard they try. Every single product is super gimmicky and to have to pitch it to the customers is like literally lying through your teeth. The pay is subpar and the advancement is very difficult to achieve due to favoritism and unfair judgement. The sales calls every week are a nightmare and upper management is EXTREMELY difficult to work with, hardly any support on their half.  The only thing nice was the one free pair of shoes a year that you could just give away and the commission BEFORE they completely downgraded it, you could have made some decent money."
good,"Loved the employees , good enviroment , great discount.  Everyone helped eachother and were always in a good spirits which brought out the positibivity"
good,"Fue agradable trabajar en skechers, lo único que me desagrado fue la regla de no sentarse que empezaron a usar ese año, estar todo el día de pie sin derecho a sentarse era completamente ridículo. Por lo demás, estuvo bien, la mayoría de los clientes que se recibían estaban bien. El jefe era como todos los jefes estricto, pero eso es de esperar."
good,"A great place to work, but no career advancements. Salary is ok, but more is to be desired. A work day normally is spent by myself handling all duties and responsibilities."
good,a lot of people were coming in and out of the store at the time so there were difficulties establishing the schedule with so many changes. would have liked an opportunity to go deeper in the field but the positions were usually filled by people who were already qualified for the position.
good,i worked there when i was in high school so i wasn't there that long but i enjoyed it while i was there managers were cool taught me alot bout the store and customer service
good,"With this company I learned that if you worked hard, it''ll eventually pay off. I learned all of my basic retail skills here, such as customer service, floor moves and inventory control."
good,"A typical day at work, was productive. It was entertaining. Learning new strategies. Management was changing but overall not so stressful. Hardest part was all the work and no progress. Most enjoyable was the amazing co workers i had. The support the love and the ambition to get through the day."
good,"Overall the company is decent to work for. Hours are ok, management is ok depending on the managers, hours are extremely limited. The hard part is when some managers dont feel like working and you and associates have to pick up their slack."
good,"Working at Skechers was fun, I had cool managers and the staff all got along. Since it was less than ten workers we all got to work good hours, and we all looked at each other as a work family."
good,Skecters was a good company to work for. They work with you of time off. They are flexible of work schedules. Everyone works together. This company is a excellent job
good,It was good working with peopl from your own neighborhood. Everybody help one another and are really friendly. It's a fast pace  environment. And the work hours are good.
good,learned about the different technologies in the merchandise. was able to wear the store apparel . got charged out for a selected few employees. good people to work with as well.
good,An overall good company with fantastic managers. Always listen to ideas etc.  Have an excellent relationship with costumers and staff. Fabulous work ethic.
good,"This is just like any other retail job. You show up, you do the work, you go home with not enough money. The employees are cool and the environment is friendly, it's just the customers that are jerks."
good,"Sou uma pessoa comprometida naquilo que me proponho a fazer, visto a camisa, principalmente quando a empresa valoriza seus funcionários."
good,Part-time need more hours. Needs to be more organized . I only like 2 to 3 days out of a week or 1 day.I only get  4 to 5 hours sometimes 10 or get called in.
good,I was there before most trainees and learned how to use cash on my own time as opposed to everyone else(this was common amongst black males). Was not enjoyable.
good,I have enjoyed working at skechers the past year and a half but I am looking for new opportunities to grow within myself an looking for something a bit more challenging.
good,"Overall Sketchers is a great company to work for, but at the end of the day I couldn't bring myself to sell a product that I deemed inferior. The shoes are really bad!"
good,"They train you very well and teach you a lot about sales and merchandising. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hourly pay was not very good, but the commission was fairly good,"
good,It was the average retail job. Mostly customer service and stocking of items. We had training every so often and halfway through my time there they started selling apparel in addition to shoes.
good,"Would over work you illegally when you are under age "
good,"Would over work you illegally when you are under age "
good,Overall Skechers is an ok place to work. There is always something to do so you don't get bored. But there is nothing too complicated or hard to figure out.
good,"I learned how to deal with customer service, and it showed me how to handle situations when there is mistakes. As this being my first job, it was a great way to work and converse with people, and fulfilling their needs."
good,Typical work day consists of sales associates and managers working together to meet store standards and expectations. While also educating customers on shoe product and shoes care.
good,I do not wish to answer these questions at this time. Thank you so much for your time.eljwejfnwofjnwoefinewofneoifnweofnoewifofewin
good,"Open and close store, handle cash register, inventory, customer solutions, help coworkers meet quota. Working in skechers everyone was a team player it was a great job."
good,"I worked there for almost a year. I loved working with the store manager. However once he started working at two locations, we were left with our two assistant managers who were rude to both employees and customers.Everyone else was nice though but they eventually started to leave to avoid dealing with the assistant managers. I would have stayed if there were nicer people in charge. Also for some reason there were no security cameras in our location which was odd because it is such a huge store. We found empty boxes at least twice a week."
good,"The Skechers warehouse store is a great place for the customer seeking a deal, so I was able to utilize the company's, BOGO 50% and convince the customer to always shop with regard to this feature. The best part of the job was working with all the different types of shoes and trying them on."
good,"fun fast paced environment with friendly employees, their were no difficulties and the best part was interacting with customers"
good,Fun place to work in terms of work-life balance but corporate initiatives require a lot of work and take away time from actually selling and spending time with customers on the sales floor.
good,"in a typical day at work. it's fine. but if it's a sale day. it very tiring."
good,"Over all a good company to work for. Always room for growth.Skechers is expanding and new openings to come.  Co-workers are always friendly leaving social life separated from work,"
good,"The people I worked with were very nice, but there has been a view times that theft has accured. My manager was very flexible with time off and schedules."
good,"on a typical day I Answered multiline phone system, instant chat mail, and email correspondence with customers"
good,a typical day is light cleaning and organization. you learn to be patience  and work fast.management is well organized and always on top of their staff making sure they provide great customer service.the co-workers are friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the fast pace. the most enjoyable part is the people you meet.
good,"I learned that sometimes no matter how hard you work, and how much time and dedication you present, you can still be passed over for advancement opportunities by others who sometimes don't even work for the company currently."
good,"Great Place to work"
good,A typical day was helping people with shoes . Co workers were well spoken and jobs went by fast . hardest part was pleasing little kids.
good,"part time hours are pretty low, never over 25 and as low as 4. doesn't pay well"
good,"Skechers was a fun place to work.  I learned a lot about the sales department.  The management definitely knew how to do their job well.  My co-workers were fun and upbeat to work with.  The hardest part of my job was having to keep the shelves stocked at all times.  To me, the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to interact with the customers."
good,"•	Greet and ascertain the needs of customers "
good,"Working in Skechers was busy on the holidays and selling Skechers, ShapeUps was the stores number 1 priority. I've also learned to be patient in this job as well not because of the customers but also the employees because we all had different tasks throughout our shift and it was difficult to ask for help during busy hours. I did enjoy it's fast pace enviroment because it kept me busy, but it only last around the holidays."
good,Simple job that could be easily maintained during school. Great part time job and a learning step for many.
good,"The company has financial difficulties.."
good,I was promoted from Coordinator to Director. I learned a lot about marketing and advertising. My co-workers were great people.
good,"Responsible for maintaining break schedule for all sales associates, checking in new inventory for store and maintaining stock rotation of new merchandise and old on the floor and in the back room."
good,A typical day at work would be getting what needed to be done finished quickly while enjoying myself at the same time with my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people; coworkers and customers. The hardest part of the job would be when you can not make a customer as happy as you would like them to be.
good,• Assist customers in selecting preferred shoe choices
good,"Honestly, it was the blandest job I've ever worked. The employees and managers were totally awesome, but boy howdy was it incredibly boring. Working there was a constant, dull ache of nothingness. Clock in, organize shoes, take money, move shoe 2 inches to the left, stare out the windows, wipe off counter, organize shoes, clock out. That was it. That was a 5 hour shift."
good,"I love working there, and absolutely love my managers. Unfortanately, the hourly wage is low, and no pay raises until you've been there for 1 year. Not very many incentives, and no benefits for part time."
good,"The environment was positive, only negative part about the job was the manager. The job was temporary but I had enough fun to say it was a good experience."
good,"me agrado trabajar para esta empresa, se hace el trabajo bien, buenos supervisores en el departamento de Vas, hacen lo posible por que los empleados trabajen en forma comoda correcta, y plasentera, lo unico malo son las 12 horas de lunes a domingo aveces cuando hay mucho trabajo y de pronto baja mucho el trabajo pero por lo demas exelente si fueran 8 o 10 horas diarias seria maravilloso pero 12 horas 6 dias o 7 a la semana es muy forzado"
good,It’s more like a military base. It’s a good place to work and gives good discount but it was not as enjoyable as other places that I have been but not a bad place
good,"Really good work environment, but at times there can be a lack of communication with managers. Manager should more clear and organized as well in my opinion."
good,"Best part of the job is helping (nice) customers and it can be a really fun, relaxed place to work when you're working with the right people. The worst part is for sure the amount of abuse we get from customers who, for some reason, feel it's okay to talk to us like rubbish. No back up at all from Skechers head office when refusing a return/exchange for valid reasons. And the amount of times someone has clicked their fingers at me to call me over rather than ask me for help is disgusting. The systems in place are very old fashioned, way too much paperwork that, I feel, is detrimental to the job at times. For a part time role, it's a decent job, good wage, etc. But for the full time staff, I feel the pay doesn't really cover all that we do."
good,"the days were consistent with customer attention which kept the employees busy. I spent most my time there either attending to customer service and restocking, as well as handling the stores banking. The most enjoyable part of the job was the all over active environment, the pace of the workplace was quick and everything was handled with ease. a pro and con to the job was that it was always busy which although was tiring, it kept me busy throughout the day."
good,"It was a great opportunity to try something new. However the location I was at, management sucked and employees treated me differently due to being a minority. Other than that, they were very flexible with my schedule and very understanding due to being a full time student."
good,"Skechers provides all its employees with their products and gives excellent discounts throughout the year. Your first pair of shoes is free and on the anniversary of your hire date you get another free pair. They also allow the chance of getting 4-10 pairs of shoes at half price every month. The number of pairs you can get is determined by the position you hold. "
good,"I love working with my team, friendly work environment. Business can be slow but we utilize resources and convert as many customers as possible under the circumstances."
good,"Like any retail company, it can be stressful at times. No overtime but workload is higher than the time given. Fun coworkers and positive most of the time, but you must be willing to give a little if you want to be successful here. Busy during holidays, back to school and summer time. Company gives confusing direction on things like payroll and monthly budgets. Must be adaptable as things change on a daily basis. Not a lot of focus on training-must be able to learn quickly and go with the flow. Cooperate partners not aligned with DM expectations which makes it hard when you have visits."
good,I really liked working here. Great discount. Great group of people just not enough hours to keep you going from January to May. Dont make you be overly pushy with customers with crazy sales goals. Trained you well. Casual dress code.
good,The job is very physical and interactive. there is poor support in regards to human resources guidelines. I learned a lot about the business and the growth opportunities came fairly quick.
good,It is a flagship store so a lot is expected. But it is an interesting place to work. You do get a lot of connections with coportate so it is easy to transition from retail to the offices.
good,"Il s’agit dun travail calme et facile l’o L’ont a les qualifications nécessaires, belle structure d’entre Au quebec dumoins, franchise ici alors oui il y a des différences avec les usa et autres."
good,"This location had most of its availability for the weekend. One of those jobs that you would rather just keep to themselves and get the task done. Connected to the warehouse, one can work for the store or the warehouse depending on the availability."
good,I enjoyed my time at Skechers. There was great leadership and management. Everyone worked together well. I would definitely work there again. Favorite part while working there was the rewards we would receive for competing against other stores in our district.
good,"I quit my job in food service because I thought this job would be easier. Boy, was I wrong. It can get quite stressful at times because the customers won't stop coming, and they are really good at messing up stuff. My store manager is really nice and works with my school schedule (I am in college and my schedule is all over the place), and that is basically the only reason I have stayed. Do not come to Skechers expecting it to be a chill, relaxed job. The work is demanding, and the customers can get down right mean with you. The good thing is that you get 50% off shoes, and a free pair with every year you've been with the company, so I now own lots of comfortable shoes :)"
good,"This job can be a great on to make you money and both advance you in the company, but it all has to do with your management and what you put into the job."
good,"Great environment to work within, hours are great, however they cut corners with pay as I began on less than minimum wage and was told after a year I would be on minimum wage but that time kept being extended i.e when I complete a year I was then told it was 2 years"
good,"Skeckers is a great place to work just to start off at and then you can find different options , the work place has great managers and a high spirit environment"
good,Working here at first you are overwhelmed by the amount of shoes in the store! but as time goes you start to figure everything out and singles become simpler. But once you have been there for a month it gets really competitive!
good,For stock the work environment is easy going as long as you maintain your sections & prep. Which I like to do that way you don't become overwhelmed when you get a lot of cases delivered. Maintaining & communication is key.
good,"• Maintains store staff by recruiting, selecting, orienting, training, coaching and consulting employees."
good,"Make sure the floor is stock, make sure it is clean, deal with the schedule, keep up with the numbers and money and provide customer service."
good,"I have worked at Skechers since 2014 when I started college, since then, I have gone through a lot of stress partially brought on by working for a severely understaffed Skechers location that, at its lowest, had 5 employees. The turnover has gotten worse lately as we are currently down to 7 members of staff with applicants that the district manager just isn't willing to hire due to them ""not being qualified properly"" because they are still in high school. Skechers does pay fairly well considering I work at an outlet store, I started out at $8 and am now up to a much healthier $9.50 two years later. Management in our store has been tough since spring of 2016 when the manager that hired me transferred and one of our assistant managers left for Ecco. Since they left, we have gone through 2 store managers and our full-time assistant manager being in charge with the store hitting a slump standard-wise. The customers in our store are either older, or tourists. "
good,"a lot of shady people in the beginning,but then came in more stupid management and decided to be pretty hateful towards some of their employees"
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers find a shoe and their size and ringing people up at the register. The environment can get hectic, yet remain friendly. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the store during rush hour, as it can get crowded and messy very fast. The most enjoyable part of the job is, well, closing."
good,"It's an OK company to work for, but not a career. It is fast paced and interesting. I Would Recommend only working here if you're a student and not get stuck here as there is no room for progression."
good,es buena la empresa siempre en cuando estes trabajando directamente con la planta
good,"Selling shoes to customers every day. I learned what a retail environment is like. The management treats us terribly, except the store manager. My coworkers are great. Dealing with the managers is the hardest part of the job, but getting to work with my coworkers and helping people are my favorite parts of the job."
good,"Worked part time as a cashier and customer service representative. assisted looking for the ideal style shoes for the customer. inventory and daily store clean up. cash handling, refunds and exchanges, shipped orders to customers out of state."
good,A day at Skechers is very to the book. You are there to sell Skechers products and to know the products information. Cleaning is important to make sure store looks good at all times. Its a very fast past work place but very simple once you know the product. Management handles flexible hours and co-workers are very welcoming.
good,Great company. Good pay. Management is poor and upper management does not take action when supervisors are not treating team fairly. Hard to move around depending on who your supervisor is.
good,From the short time there the management was really nice and cared about everyone's well- being.
good,this company does not really offer benefits to their sales associates and it does celebrate the best sellers of the month or week.
good,"Working the stockroom making sure area is clean recieving shipments daily for restock and to be placed on sales floor. Making sure stockroom was well organized product easily accessible, and numerically organized by style product. Management was very proficient Manager awarded best warehousemanager of the year. Coworkers very friendly easy to get along with hardworkers. Hardest part of the day would be a day where sales where slow and not much work to be done. Most enjoyable would be working with people that have good fun attitude worked well for team morale."
good,"A typical day at work includes opening the store and receiving shipments.  We process in the shipments and evaluate the products to go on to the sales floor.  I would spend other times during the day training a newly hired employee on basic aspects of a sales person's job, to include register training, loss prevention training, and marketing the product.  I would maintain the store when the manager was not able to be in the store, and complete transactions the cashiers did not have access to.  Management was a joy to work with on a day-to-day basis.  The management was approachable and very knowledgeable.  My co-workers were very diligent in their duties and maintained  positive attitude.  The hardest part of any given day were handling the shipments.  We would receive up to 2,000 units on any given shipment and were responsible for having accountability for those items.  The hardest part was the most enjoyable part of that job."
good,Skechers is a wonderful company and I truly believe in the product. However I feel as if they expect more out of you than what their willing to pay you for. Working there I never had a problem with the customers if anything it was with not being heard in corporate when there were things the store needed for example several stores including my own went with out bags to give the customers for months because they weren't getting shipped out and we had to hand customers shoe boxes with nothing to carry them in.
good,"The level of excitement fluctuated throughout my time with the company. It's a fun, fast paced environment with customers who are very enthusiastic. "
good,"Job is great if ur needing flexible hours or a part time job but horrible if u need full-time & benefits. Very task oriented, so tasks are easy but there's alot of them. Biggest complaint about company is district mgmt. Desions are made that make work in store harder 4 employees & shopping harder 4 customers. Company doesn't care about employees/customers at the end of day."
good,The job is not to difficult and the employees there were very nice and kind however the management people can be a little rude especially with the new hires.
good,Working at Skechers was definitely one of the most challenging jobs I have ever had. Expectations are VERY high to maintain company standards despite company changes that might effect delivery of those expectations. The company is undergoing rapid growth and need a lot of man power to produce the results of their ambitious goals.
good,"Day to Day operations were clear and expectations were high for the amount of hours given and employees working throughout the day. At any point in time they could change their mind on set flows, constant corporate visits with different expectations.... localization was the idea but most times it was to the discretion of the corporate visitor, not necessarily the SM.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the peers I worked with, because they understood the demands and stress of the job."
good,"Didn't pay enough though, there was not a lot of room for advancement, Was made to think I would be made a manager which never happened. Culture was okay, friendly co workers."
good,"Decent job for the most part but lost interest the more i worked there, but overall its not a bad job if you want to be a sales associate. I just wouldn’t recommend it to everyone"
good,"Unless you're a store manager, the pay isn't amazing. There's a lot of things to do in such a short amount of time, and the company expects you to get them done right away."
good,i learned a lot from working here. it was a good second job for me. the down side about it was that they had really high expectations for the workers but there wasn't really any leadership coming from the management.
good,"hardest part was trying t find customers to come in and shop depending of time of year (seasons) and what store you were located. each store was a hit or miss on customer traffic. when people would come in and shop they would, but smites people would just come in Rome around and we needed to sell shoes but they obviously didn't want any."
good,"Work life/balance is based on company needs, not your availability so don't expect more than 15 hours a week...  Salary is entry level so just above minimum wage.  No security or advancement, they don't promote within they hire outside people to take on management positions so don't look forward to being promoted.  Ever...  Managers were fine, just sometimes they can be a little two faced, so just focus on your job and carry on with your day.  Job Culture was easy, you spend most of your day sequencing boxes into shelves and making them look pretty.  It's not a very hard job, just price change things, and make displays and try to sell people shoes.  If you work there long enough, there's always something to do.  I was so bored one day I ended up dusting and wiping down shelves, so you won't be bored here."
good,"Retail is a tough job during holidays and back to school. Although meeting new people on a daily basics can always make the day better. "
good,"A competitive job where we are challenged on a daily basis to do whats necessary and a bit more. high expectations from everyone, they push you to be the best."
good,"My team were great, we were like a small family. I learned a lot about sales tactics, kpis, fitness. There is a high focus on sales day to day, but in general the atmosphere was quite relaxed, and the in store management were very understanding. Because we had a lot of staff members time off was rarely an issue. "
good,"I really did like working at skechers, and I would have definitely stayed on, considering that i was very diligent in my work with helping to replenish the sales floor with quickness and and efficiency. But there was a lot of personal issues going on that made the work place stressful."
good,"typical day at work is stocking, organizing, driving unit sales. sometimes things get repetitive at work which is sometimes a negative, but my co workers are great people and the job isn't to difficult."
good,"Greeting customers and answering any questions they had."
good,"Helping costumer, helping with their needs and always learning new things."
good,Typical day consists of checking daily tasks list and viewing expected sales goals for self. Assisting customers from time of entry til departure. Learned much about what is to work in an  casual business setting. Management was helpful with answering any questions I had and reaching out if there were signs I was having trouble with a particular task. No real hardship. Person to person interaction was the most satisfying aspect of the job.
good,"Great Co-workers and management. However, not enough hours available to support an individual. Customer interaction is always an enjoyable experience and opportunity for growth in interpersonal communication and conflict resolution. "
good,"Great management to work for, hardest part of job was shipment outside"
good,"Skechers is a Company that caters to the whole family, its a fun, fast pace and trendy environment. In addition you have the opportunity to interact with customers and turn them into clients."
good,It’s quite easy working for this company isn’t that much of an hassle but the pay could be more and the break time could be longer but overall it’s not a bad place to work at just wanna start a new job
good,At Sketchers it was calm and pretty easily to comprehend. Very calm self explanatory and easily to do. Customers are tough but manager help out great.
good,"Ive loved working there for far for this long. Many improvement could be done with management and the district manager. Customers are nice, the store is clean."
good,"Great people, management more than willing to work with you. as long as you come in with a good attitude you'll be fine and just take care of your area you'll be fine. the culture is fun and laid back and willing to joke around as long as you do your job."
good,"Skechers was a very fun work enviorment. I loved my co workers. I would sell shoes, help customers find there right size and then check them out. I just hated the drive everyday."
good,"aprendi a tratar con clientes "
good,"It was a great experience meeting new, active and loving people as in the co-workers.  Some managers were great but there was one completely against me and judging my every move.  (I have kids, she doesn't) and not understanding where I was standing or where I came from to the point she would asume unrealistic ideas of my persona to the point of fabricating notices.  But as of the rest, great job atmosphere."
good,On a typical day at skechers i worked as a cashier handling money between customers and between managers. I learned to memorize products to add on with shoe purchases along with becoming a sales associate. The management was good along with a cooperative amount of coworkers that were very wiling to help me grow. the hardest part of the job was memorizing certain styles. The most enjoyable part was learning new was to sell by my coworkers.
good,"-Either shifting making space for shipment or conversing with customers, sharing ideas and informing them on the newest sales"
good,"Nice management, everyone seems to be really kind. Most enjoyable part about working there was that I had the chance to work with a lot of my colleagues."
good,Very poor communication between corporate and stores. We never get sizes we need. Advertisements lack appeal.
good,the company treats its employees pretty well although it is very behind with technology the systems are old and mess up quite a bit. hours are capped.
good,"A reliable, trustworthy and conscientious Sales Executive who is able to multi-task, handle pressure, work as part of a team and most importantly inspire customers to make a purchase. Highly presentable, outgoing and sociable, thrive in a fast paced environment, able to understand a customer’s needs, ability to use own initiative, taking responsibility for personal development and actively seek opportunities for improvement. Strong language abilities together with the customer oriented background"
good,"Good management, goal setting and benefits to the job. Managers always have your interests in mind and help you further your career/training. They also discuss your targets and help keep you track or praise your successes"
good,I feel like Skechers is a great First Time Job but for career job no. If you are a student it will be easy to balance school and this job because hours are only Part Time and the store is never busy.
good,fast work pace in the heart of time square require alot of effort because there were many tourist and the work hours werent too long but it was nice working there
good,I learned a lot from Skechers. It was worth it. Now I know what my priorities are and what to value. It's made me more career minded and professional.
good,"I didn't really don't like working for the company that much, I've been there for the last 4 months now and im not a big fan of how they run things. I've learned so much working there and its such a high volume store so i got to experience so much but that company just isn't for me."
good,Great group of employees and managers. Mangers are happy and want to be at work there are were few flaws about working there. Work and you'll get more hours.
good,I learn how to stock up shoes in a neatly order. Management is very helpful. co-workers are also very helpful and easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was trying to keep all the shoe display neat. the most part that I enjoy is helping the customer find the perfect shoe.
good,"sales associate, being able to be really talkative with customers and co-workers. did fundraisers, the only hardest part of the job would not being able to speak another language"
good,"we had a switch of management and the store began to go down hill , so overtime work became stressful there , so I resigned . The staff and company was great but the store manager was terrible ."
good,Great experience working here! Staff was great as well as co workers. Time was flexible and management actually cared. The only con to working here is when you don't score 100% on a secret shopper you as well as the store manager and assistant manager on duty get written up. The secret shopper task list in no way shape or form lets the customer know that I know how to do my job. You miss one small detail (like forgetting to UPSALE SOCKS!) you get written up! One thing I learned is to be honest and actually care about each customers individual needs and they will respect that you are actually trying to help them not feed them a  generic script written by a person who's never worked retail.
good,At Sketchers I learned how to work at a faster pace. It was a good warehouse job for those who don't mind working a full 12 hours each day .Everyone there is very helpful.
good,samething everyday and management has favoritism and even if you get an assistant manager position they will only schedule you only 14 hours per week.
good,"The location I was at was so horrible, all employees were so dramatic, it felt like high school. They were more worried about their phones rather than assisting a customer or organizing the store. I, a part time associate, had to practically beg my co-workers to do their jobs. The management had almost no interaction with us and it just felt odd. I enjoyed the actual work, such as stocking the shelves, assisting customers in finding the perfect shoe for what they needed."
good,Its an okay place to work but the pay stinks. I'm still waiting to get a raise. Some of the employees there are awesome but then some are just slackers. Management is okay I guess.
good,"I learned a lot from working at Skechers. By being a manager there I was able to learn payroll, HR, selling techniques, training methods, etc. I enjoyed working there and working with the staff. The upper management was the only issue."
good,Appreciated the approach of learning the sales goals were at the start of the day.Told what was expected of you at the beginning of the day. Required you to think on your toes aswell.overall really liked working here.
good,"I enjoy working at Skechers, but the amount of employees we have is ridiculous. Tons of employees and no hours. I learned a lot about shoes and what certain shoes can do for your feet. Management could do better when it comes to giving their employees more shifts."
good,"Managing payroll of associates "
good,It was a great place to work at until you were stuck doing all the work. Not a serious job to other employees. Hence why I was stuck doing shipment or helping out customers
good,"The  management  wasn’t that great. Only a few good respectful managers. The job was cool, the associates was nice . Everybody got along. Just no hours."
good,"This job is good if your in high school and need some extra cash. Its just like any other retail job in the mall and you get to meet some great people from other stores or customers that need help shopping for shoes. Growth in the company is hard, they always hire outside the company for management positions."
good,"The one thing that you cannot get frustrated about is an angry foreign customer yelling at you. Because our location is such a tourist attraction we have a lot of foreigners who come in. A lot of them get frustrated when you aren't able to understand them; however, you simply have to just work with them"
good,This was a part time job for me while in college. They paid well for the position and it was a fairly relaxed place to work. You are on your feet most of your shift moving around.
good,When first starting it's a blast and people are great. Though as time continues there's a lot of continual backstabbing. If u can deal with drama then u'll be fine. The job itself is fairly relaxed and simple. I mean who r we kidding.. it's retail.. as long as u out ur best foot forward u'll do ok. the management is poor. There's so many lies floating around and stress coming from the 'higher ranking'
good,Good as a part time although can do more or less hours depending on the week. It's a busy job as constantly up and down ladders getting boxes down for customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the nice customers which are about 80% of them. Hardest part is how long you're on your feet for and about 3 chairs in the back. The shift lengths aren't too bad. Management is awful and confusing so left feeling not good enough a lot of the time and are misleading. Other colleagues were funny and nice.
good,Management were not as involved in the workplace as they should. Trainees or new hires were not trained properly. Taking of the entire store with no breaks was not considered fair.
good,"Working at Skechers is super easy. As long as you have a good work ethic I don't see why someone wouldn't want to work here. The job is fun, easy and I've enjoyed it while I was there."
good,"good benefits, lots of work always busy everyday. family owned business, nice lunch room and cafeteria. friendly environment. always clean and friendly co workers."
good,Sketchers was a great place to work. I enjoyed the people that I worked with. They hours were great. For the most part it was a fast paced store and I enjoyed that because I liked to stay busy. Everyone was very flexible and reliable.
good,"Its an ok job to get you through school. Learned team building skills."
good,Awesome place to work at. Well trained managers and training is avaible for all departments. Long working busy hours but worth it because of good commission. I would recomend you to join the team
good,"Overall a good experience, my first job but I loved it. Would recommend as a great 1st job for people with no experience. Coworkers are awesome. I've learned so much about sales products and how to be a better employee. Most enjoyable part of my job are meeting people everyday and seeing them happy when they walk out of the store."
good,"Typical day consisted of opening store, walking floor for product that needed filling, ordering low inventory product, assisting customers & maintaining clean sales floor, planning associates duties for the day."
good,"A typical day at work is greet customers, telling them about the sale and informing them about the shoes. We will clean when we have time. most time are slow. I learned a lot about the shoe product.My assistant manger is a really nice person. My co- workers are really outgoing. the hardest part of the job is getting the customer to buy shoes. The most enjoyable part is having fun"
good,"The job was fun, getting paid hourly and commission was awesome, but it gets rather aggressive on the floor, employees tend to step on each others toes."
good,"It was a good job at first, but then we hired a bunch of kids who brought their high school drama with them and slowly the store became nothing but drama filled."
good,I enjoyed working here very much. I had a great manager at the time with a great staff. It is a very fast pace job and a lot of work. I enjoyed every minute.
good,"overall skechers was a good job to work at. The environment is good  the staff is always friendly, the management needs more work and can be a little more nice, but overall it was a great working experience."
good,"I would have to organize boxes, handle transactions on a daily basis, show a positive attitude throughout the day, constantly organize the bins and walls as the day went on, and assist in counting the cash registers by verifying the amount of money that was in the drawers at the end of the day."
good,busy ...greeting..and stocking ....Eveyone is up beat and supportive of each other . work environment is great ..lots of customers and great smiling faces
good,"There's plenty of work to do here. On any given day expect a lot of customer servicing and recovery, plus a handful of tasks. Learned a lot about knowing and controlling the business, what sells and what doesn't sell, and how to break down LY numbers and sell through of product."
good,"Very slow paced, gets busy at times. You are requires to be a cashier, clean and aid customers. Do what you have to do and you'll be fine. Managers sometimes take advantage of you."
good,"OverAll it wasnt a bad company but some managers are horrible to work with, if they decide they dont like you based off what others say they wont want you at their store. Keep in mind these are grown women/men store managers acting like high schoolers based of rumors. Besides the immaturity that some store managers displayed it wasn't a bad company. Not too much room for advancement even if you are looking for that next step"
good,"helping out customers boosted your chance of them telling your name at the register and getting commission "
good,"Definitely a starter job with great hands on training. Only three locations in the area, and very flexible with your lifestyle. One of my very first retail jobs and I love it !"
good,"Weekends are very busy, customers can be very rude if you do not help immediately, on shipment day it can be very hectic because you must have the floor clean by the time the store opens. The hardest part of the job would be explaining and try to communicate with the customers in a respectful manner about the store policies."
good,"Working in the company for the time that I have has been great but the management could use some work. That being said, things aren't getting done and not much communication is being spread throughout the team. It is an easy job for those looking for a first place to work. Definitely a safety net."
good,A typical day at working at skechers is when you working in the morning everyone worked as team and got along well. if you you would work night that when it was the most stressful and drama place to work.
good,"Great Company with a heavy work load. At Skechers the most enjoyable thing is the people. If you can hack it at skechers, their employees last a long time in the company."
good,"Très professionnelle , sécurité importante,  ouvrier et employés de qualité"
good,Sometimes they lose sight of the fact that it is a company that is run and made successful by its employees. I felt as though I was under appreciated during the last year of my time at the company and I wasn't advancing anymore in my career.
good,When I got hired the supervisor who hired me originally moved away for a better job opportunity and Not stolong after i moved to try to find one because the store wasn't the same.
good,"Skechers had a fun atmosphere and every weekend, there was a customer appreciation event with free snack distribution for customers. There was room for career advancement, to a certain limit. Compensation is something that should improve, since it was based on hourly, but you were expected to reach a quota everyday."
good,Working here might have been one of the hardest things in my life. you work insane hours for little pay. they dont offer full time for sales and your forced to do the job of stock as well. although the management is amazing at the location i was at i wouldn't do it again.
good,"Decent job overall. Good camaraderie between colleagues. Good advancing business. Easy job tasks. (Know the product, Get the product for the customer as fast as possibly, Maintain the stockroom, Maintain store cleanliness)"
good,"You learn to communicate with new people daily from a variety of backgrounds. Management is fun, understanding and willing to teach to areas of responsibilities to those willing to learn."
good,communication was always key. towards customers and other employees. they were fair with most of what went on and respectful with each other. it could be hard at times but everyone helped each other out in most of the time.
good,"I enjoy helping customers and putting smiles on their faces. Co-workers are friendly and cooperative. Management is okay, but could be more respectful to both employees and customers. The hardest part of the job is shifting the entire wall for new products. The most enjoyable part of working at Skechers is the customer base."
good,"Pude poner en practica mi experiencia, y mi jefe inmediato fue muy didáctico, mucho volumen de trabajo pero se realizaba en un excelente ambiente laboral"
good,"This company is great. great management. I am learning a lot. makes me a good sales person. it helps me to be a good leader and a follower. and through the help of this company, i learned to be more goal oriented person and into details. makes me a people person and we respect and enjoy each other's company. we basically sell shoes. we are accountable for the company's integrity. i enjoyed working for this company because it contributes not only on my professional growth but with my personal growth as well. and everyday i am still learning a lot. customers are greatly satisfied with our customer service."
good,"Writting a daily - activity - report is an art. I learned to be ""stright - forward"" with my reports involveing other security personell. Thks is a must in any OBSERVING AND REPORTING situation. The hardest port of this job can actually be your co=workers but the most enjoyable part of this job can be the feeling of accomplishment, at the end of each day."
good,I enjoyed working there because you have something to do all the time. There's not one day your bored. People from the company are really nice. You learn a lot about shoes and warehouse procedures.
good,"I learned much here about how important it is to have comfortable shoes and what is needed to properly support them. Somewhat casual work day, helping customers with their sizes or style shoe. Change in management, usually fine but was not so much when someone who doesn't respect associates and is stressful to being around made me leave, otherwise I would probably still be there."
good,"It's a great place to work and you are able to learn many things about warehouse working. They have many things to choose from. There is many different forklifts such as the sit down, the reach, clamp, cherry picker and electric pallet jacks."
good,"The job was good. Wasn't the most strained warehouse job, hours were graveyard shift, fast paced, always busy, not for everyone but if you're comfortable in these kinda jobs like I was, shouldn't be too bad. They do have alot of overtime though so if that's what you're looking for, they got it!"
good,Super easy job! Majority of the time you just help customers with shoes & deciding which shoes to get & also persuading them to grab a pair of socks as well.
good,"El trato con el cliente tenía que ser especial en cada caso ya que cada cliente necesitaba un producto diferente, eso hacía especial el puesto de trabajo. Los compañeros genial."
good,Very easy job everyone is very nice and helpful you must be able to communicate properly with customers and be able to handle customers who are being difficult.
good,"The place is good and good customers  and the people who work with you are friendly and good "
good,customer is the number one priority. hitting our daily goals were a requirement. they gave us good benefits and the start off pay was higher than expected.
good,"Great corporate culture, good structure. The company has all the procedures appropriately set up. The working environment will depend on the store you work in."
good,Was a very fun place to work at evry KSU was friendly and I  felt very comfortable working with everybody there made me feel welcomed when I first started
good,"Skechers is a pretty productive environment, staff is friendly and always eager to help out. Everyone worked as a team including management and always was supportive on helping you reach your goals."
good,Great work life balance. You really felt like it was your store and your own business to run.  I throughly enjoyed my time there.  It was stressful on occasion but nothing you couldn't get through.
good,I was with Skechers for a very short period of time. The only complaint I had was on piercing and hair color policy. Management was a little rocky due to managers personal problems
good,"Team is lovely, management is okay. The hours are pretty long so you must bare that in mind and be able to cope. 6 hour shifts with no breaks and 8 hour shift with only one break."
good,"This position is a retail position nothing more nothing less, you are told to constantly do work that is made to purely keep you busy and has no actual application to how the store operates. The entire culture I got from this position was that it operates very similarly to a cult, most everyone I talked too in my role or lower thinks the company has the best interests in their mind but really all you are is a number. If you do not do tasks like ""wallpapering"" boxes well enough and stay late to ensure that the store is left spotless for the next day you will be deemed as a subordinate employee."
good,"This was by far my favourite job! The vibe of the store and the people I worked with were fantastic. The incentives were great and it was overall a fun environment."
good,"Skechers is a highly organized company with strong goals. The management was flexible with my needs, I learned a lot about how to be there for my customer"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Skechers and learned a lot about the shoe industry.  The office culture was friendly and fun, which made the fast paced work and learning all the more worth it.  Management was approachable and encouraged professional development.  I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,Free sneakers for staff and gear with room to elevate yourself and your opportunity to grow in the company fun fast and friendly environment with stock options
good,"Normal. Tienda de zapatos, trabajo por temporada navideña."
good,I left sketches because of the hours which some time it was less then 20 but I still worked it. I enjoyed assisting the customers with making purchase.
good,"For retail, I really enjoyed this job. It was area management that were  unprofessional. They thought they could say and do anything to anyone. Beside that i really loved this job fun times."
good,I enjoyed working at skechers. I was trusted to do my job instead of being micromanaged. My biggest problem was with the manager at the time but she's no longer employed there.
good,In the area i work everyone knows everyone. It is a good place to work the individuals i work with were very open. Make a great connection with customers and employees
good,"I love the company, but the work load was heavy. There was no work life balance. I loved the people I worked with and the support from my DM's I encountered there. I loved the product."
good,"Working at Skechers was good, the  work was never hard and there was never too much work that had to be done.  The people who worked there are fairly young.  Worked well with your schedule if you are going to school."
good,"sometimes it could get stressful to work when the store gets busy and there not much people working on the floor, the hours on the schedule sometimes aren't good"
good,"Everything I had hoped for in my first job out of college. I worked on the international side of things and learned not just the finance component but also worked with developers on systems enhancements,"
good,"Enjoyed working with the team that I had."
good,"good place to work with because you will working with different people and assisting different customers."
good,Travail à la chaîne dans une usine de chaussures très agréable
good,"the job is fairly simple, you just have to be willing and strong minded on achieving your goals. The tasks at hand are not impossible. It works best with being a peoples person."
good,"Skechers USA, is a good company to start as sales associate. you get the learning experience and customer service. the management environment was decent. there was a lot of confusion with our district manager and his store at the time."
good,"- You basically just clock in, check your role for the day, assist customers that need help, and get your task done by the end of your shift."
good,"This was a really fun place to work. Pretty fast paced, especially on holidays when they had specials going on. Overall, a great place to work of your schedule is flexible."
good,"Day to day operations are pretty simple. Shipment takes about 3 days to put out. The other 4 days of the week are spent straightening/cleaning the store and selling the products. The management at my particular store is average. Some of the workers are childish, but that is circumstantial. It has a lot of college students right now which makes it stressful on management because back to college is soon. Its an average retail store."
good,I worked here for 3 years during high school. It was a great place to work for what I needed. I got compensated fairly for my job. I moved up from sales associate to assistant manager fairly quickly.
good,I have learned how to multitask and assist many different customers. A typical day at work usually goes by independently working on straightening your assigned section.
good,we had only one manager and short on staff we always had call in and I was always on my feet work hard I was always there for them.on tusedays we had t
good,"this was my first and last job. I really enjoed it just because it was a good and easy work environment. It was an easy job, not hard at all.. the only problem was the inappropriate harrassment by the managers."
good,"A great entry level retail job"
good,"I worked as a retail sale selling various shoes. including shoes for jogging, special for long road, running and so on. I loved this job because dealing with the customer and we are pleased to offer and explain our product."
good,"The Job at Skechers was always a very high paced set job. Being very attentive and detail-oriented, I learned new ways to conduct my working habits more productively. My managers could have used more training, but overall I felt very welcomed in the workplace. The employees were very helpful and supportive towards one another during shifts. The hardest part about my job would have had to have been the timing. For a while, I had trouble managing my time efficiently. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help and meet different people from all over the world."
good,The Irvine Spectrum location is a high paced and very visually orientated store. Workers always have a task and have a customer service priority. Knowledge of product and company policy is engrained so that each employee can stand alone.
good,It was a great first job. I loved my co-workers and everyone got along really well. It was fairly easy and fun to organize all the shoes. Everything was great until there was new management.
good,"Gostei de trabalhar na empresa, pelo facto, de que, existia um bom ambiente de trabalho, porque a nível de empresa e benefícios que tem para com os seus colaboradores deixa muito a desejar"
good,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to work at Skechers for a long period of time because I was hired for a seasonal position. At this particular location, business wasn't doing too well, so there weren't very many opportunities for me to pick up extra hours, but management was kind and friendly regardless!"
good,"fun times selling shoes and chatting with co-workers while getting the job done."
good,"Incredible brand, achieving all targets and trebling business within my area in the less than 12 months with some fantastic success stories."
good,its a easy fun job. it balance. not stressful and you always get the job done. flexible schedule but very short hours. good part time job.
good,"Maintenance work everday. we did window framing door replacment, painting, sandblasting windows, working on air conditioners."
good,I really enjoy the customer service portion of working. The best part of my job is meeting new people and striking up conversations and getting to know one another. The hardest part is keeping things in line with as many people that come in a day. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful and the help me learn something new everyday.
good,"Skechers is a great place to work and is becoming a leader in the footwear industry. Although the company has been around for 24+ years it is growing extremely fast and is an exciting environment to work in and to further your career. The most enjoyable part of the job is expanding departments and learning/ taking on additional tasks to keep up with demand. "
good,"At Skechers, I managed the staff and helped hire/train new employees.  I was responsible for making sure we met our sales goal on a daily basis.  And ensured visual/marketing updates were done on time.  This was a fun place to work for and the commission was an added bonus but it was only 25 hours a week."
good,Upbeat workplace with flexible scheduling and an understanding management. Commission helps push me harder in meeting my sales goals.
good,"les journées sont longues et ennuyeuse, pas beaucoup de travail et très peut de clients."
good,I enjoyed working at this job the only thing I had a problem was with my managers they had there favorites and would give them hours over somebody who came to work and actual did there job. I bent over backwards for this job to make sure every customer I dealt with was satisfied before they left the store even if that meant bringing my own phone out to look for a shoes online or to call another store because somebody in the store was on the phone.
good,"I love working at Skechers, our management is hard working, however we are able to maintain a fun demeanor at work."
good,normal day with people and shoes fun but can get boring bank runs organizing just gets too slow and the managers were cool
good,would work for them again well organized. really enjoyed my time with them
good,"a pleasant and laid back, productive atmosphere. friendly environment"
good,"Good Company to work for. "

good,Sketchers was a very organized store . They practice strict guidelines
good,Skechers is a fun company to work for. The employees are friendly people. I have learned how to manage multiple tasks at a time.
good,This was my first job and I really enjoyed it other then the pay being so low and never getting as many hours as I wanted. Everyone there was willing to help take shifts and help each other succeed.
good,"Good Work culture Great colleagues, good product to sell, established brand, wide customer base, comfortable uniform provided. Penalty rates awarded to salary employees"
good,"Typical day at work teaches workers how to manage their time wisely in order to finish the projects on time and also keep section organized at the same time. Hardest part is dealing with customers, keeping the flood stocked and helping customers all together on a busy day."
good,I had a good experience working at Sketchers because that was my first paid job and it was new to me but I caught in quickly. My friend recommended me here and I had a fun time the people were nice and wonderful to work with.
good,I spent almost 5 years here. I have I was happy for 4 of them. I have met and worked with a lot of great ppl and served some if the best customers both old and new ones.  Some of them followed me from previous jobs. I don't regret my time here. Thankful for everything I've learned since being hired here back in 2015.
good,"Worked at the one in Concord NC at Concord Mills! My manager was very unprofessional and rude, he yelled at me because I wanted to stay hydrated. Would not recommend working at this one"
good,we earned commission for the sales we made which was earned every month. the hours were slightly long as the branch was located in an outlet. on a typical day you sell shoes and replenish stock
good,"Es una buena empresa para obtener un primer empleo, con capacitaciones constantes, motivación con bonos y horarios especiales."
good,"minimal raise "
good,they have less hours sometimes and management behave weird. out of 200 hours for week 160 are for managers only. coworkers were nice but they force you to sell stuff.
good,"Associates do not get benefits as this, only full time workers. I think everyone should have benefits so we do not have to be paying to the hospitals with the money we work for since we do not get a lot of hours"
good,Awesome company to work for. Learned a lot while I was with Skechers. Awesome people to work with and great company culture. Great location if you live near by.
good,Just make sure you pay close attention and just basically do what you have to do to make everything easier for you and at all times help with customer service.
good,"This was my first part time job as a college student. I worked for the company for 2 years. Overall, I had bittersweet moments  working here. This is a decent job for students or anyone looking for a part time job. I got along with my managers and most coworkers, which made my shift run faster."
good,"Need to be able to sell product while completing other operational tasks. Strong focus on customer experience, which is good but there are no excuses for not accomplishing all ""talking points"" with a customer."
good,"Kinda boring, i just wish i could have worked here a little longer before i decide that I don't really like it. The managers were alright but one of them didn't really know anything lol."
good,"It is nice to work in Skechers, but it is very tiring to work at Skechers outlet. 90% of time is busy; LOTS of customers, often overwhelming. Also, get ready to be patient."
good,No hay muchas prestaciones y no hay oportunidad de entrar directo con la compañía y tienen reglas tontas tocante a los empleados de agencia como que no pueden usar zapatos de ni ningún producto de la compañía skechers porque skechers considera que los trabajadores de la agencia no merecen usar sus productos por el simple hecho de que no trabajan para skechers.
good,Customer service is a big part of my job always had to smile be helpful .I had to learn the code and the computer from different stores and how to ship shoes out to people houses.
good,"The pay could be better for the experience that I have but overall I love my team, this staff makes the not so good work life balance worth it. It can get really busy and the BBO are very task orientated so you must come to work to work."
good,Fun place to work highly recommend as a starting point although the district manager is a very mean lady who decides to show up whenever and ruin everyone’s day
good,"The atmosphere can be good or bad. Great and friendly staff but sometimes too sales focuses which is a detriment to the atmosphere of the shop. This makes the sales dive which is pretty much counterproductive. No-one wants to buy in a stressful environment,"
good,The store is fast paced. Because of that teamwork was required and patience. Customers from all over the world shop there and that provided a learning experience because it showed how different customers can be.
good,I really liked working at sketchers it was fast past and a great work environment . All of the management was amazing and i got along great with my co-workers .
good,My experience at Skechers was a genuinely unique one with a very loyal company. They provided flexible scheduled and equality in pay. There was never discrimination and always to move up. The employees were very friendly and great team workers. The communication could improve but still excellent in standard circumstances. Overall the company was a great experience and I enjoyed my time there.
good,this job is very boring but stressful becasue once you fix something then you have to go back and do it again becasue someone would go mess it up mainly kids.
good,Really chill environment and shoe boxes are way better than trying to fold a ton of shirts or something.   Great team and fun times makes the days go by super fast.
good,"Overall, it is a great place to learn customer service skills and how to talk to people. Management was strict but often lenient. The most difficult part was learning how to talk to people but I was successful in the end."
good,As a sales associate I got to interact with customers.  I quickly learned that providing a person with great customer service can be rewarding for both parties the customer and the sales associate.
good,Working at Sketchers in sales and with people like any other has it's ups and downs but what I can say is that every day was a challenge to exceed my own expectations of being a better staff member of this company.
good,Started each day with an overview of what needs to be done. Management were cool and fun. I liked my co-workers as well. The job wasn't that hard.
good,need to show willingness and having a sense of urgency that you truly do work hard. satisfaction is key in having people return to our store
good,"I started working for Skechers about 2-3 months ago. I like working there. The days we are busy, it is very demanding and fast paced. On the days it's slow, its slow, but it gives you a chance to recover the store and get the final details finished. Day to day, being a Floor, I do:"
good,This job is okay but it also has it's bad days when I do not get enough work hours. My co-workers are great and the work is not that hard to do.
good,"I couldn't be more happier with my job. My pay is great and my job environment is wonderful. I love working with people. There are always opportunities to move up in the company. It really is a great company they do a lot of partnerships with other organizations like, Sunrise Day Camp Association, for children with cancer and Best Friends Associations, for Animal Shelters. A very generous company."
good,"The only reason I gave management a 2 because the Store Manager was lazy but the Assistant Manager was great."
good,"Easy first job for teenagers, flexible management, and a place to learn skills like sales, customer service, responsibility."
good,"A typical day would be completing a list of task that needed to be completed before the close of business that would have been left by the store manager. Once a task is completed the task would be crossed off the list, for any task that is not completed one must make sure that the list if left in a visible place for the next manager coming in. Co-workers were encouraged by management to ask questions on anything they are unsure about. Although the new store manager of the store has made thing very uncomfortable in the store and the work environment is not the same fun, motivating, exciting work force that it use to be. Although things have changed most of us use each other to boast/prop each other up."
good,"Work was typically busy on an usual day that consisted of getting shoes for customers and making them comfortable while they found their right shoe pair. Management always works with us as employees to understand our tasks especially as new hires.Co-workers were always friendly and willing to lend a helping hand when needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to do what all managers wanted us to complete even when they contradicted each other, yet being to handle each task with ease.  "
good,I really enjoyed my time here at Skechers and definitely got way too many shoes but for a young student it was a perfect place to work at. My main complaint was we would always seem short staff but with the strict qualifications we could never hire anyone decent and those that did qualify wanted a high hourly rate.
good,"great company to work for treats all managers very well , learned plenty from working with my initial district manager he taught me allot about day to day job responsibilities and how to master them."
good,"Working in sales, you never quite know what sore of customers you will encounter and that is somewhat of the beauty of working for Skechers.  On a daily basis, as a Manager it is your responsibility to ensure that the store is 100%.  This consists of making sure the store is clean, visuals are up to date, and any and all operations are taken care of. In addition, I have had the opportunity of working with some amazing people as well."
good,"Cuenta con un muy buen ambiente laboral, el personal te apoya en caso de cualquier percance, el gerente muy accesible."
good,"I've learned tremendously throughout the four years with the Skechers company. I moved up to management where I learned more in depth about the business, operations, merchandising, and training. What I enjoy most about my job is being able to see someone I trained grow into a versatile employee and become a well rounded worker. The hardest part of the job is learning how to communicate and deal with various personalities without getting emotionally involved."
good,"I enjoyed the positive energy that came with working here. I met some great people. I learned a new skill sales, which wasn't too bad. I enjoyed having set everyday goals to achieve. My store manager kept the energy level up throughout the day."
good,"Staff are extremely nice! Managers are also friendly and approachable. Job requires you to sell shoes while maintaining a clean workplace. Personally, I found the job asked too much of its employees as we were asked to double our sales goals but we did not make commission (no real incentive to sell). Job also required us to climb a big warehouse type ladder and take down shoes that were stacked up a bit too high. Overall it is a nice place to work and I had the opportunity to meet a ton of new people, which i enjoyed!"
good,Customer service is a very important part of the job when working with the public.
good,Love the products the company makes and and everything i have been able to do with the company.
good,"great company"
good,"Its a fast pace job, steady working on a variety of projects in different departments and communicating with other stores to varify every promotions, every charge sends, everything. "
good,Secured a number of licensees for the Skechers brand and mapped a strategy for global brand extension and licensing revenue.
good,As of now I am currently playing store manager. I do everything from scheduling other management all the way to the associates. I also handle any if not all customers complains along with trying to provide the upmost customer service to each and every customer that walks through our doors
good,I learned how to meet customers expectations in products and service. I enjoyed seeing the customers faces with a smile when I was done with the sell. Very motivate place to work.
good,It is more on implementation of retail promotions and activities which involves sourcing out for tie-ups or partnerships for brand awareness and increase sales revenue.
good,"Fun place to work, good and friendly staff. Management understanding. Pushed to meet targets but commission as incentive. Overall nice place to work but poor wage and benefits."
good,"This company is a good place to go for those who are just starting out and need a job, need a little more experience before getting a new job, or as a secondary job to make extra cash on the side. Don't expect much from the company unless you are a full timer. Yes part timers can get 401K benefits but this company does not think about long term growth. You only receive three yearly raises in each position with the company. Which would be fine if you could move up into another position, however the company does not like to do internal promotions especially from part time to full time."
good,"Typical day at work consists of greeting and helping customers find what they are looking for. I learned how to be patient with customers. The hardest part was handling a bunch of customers with very low staff."
good,"The job was decent at the time I was working there. Personally I learned a lot customer service skills, patience, time management etc. I had the chance to meet and work with some really good people."
good,"The workplace culture at Skechers is good vibes all around. I would highly recommend getting to know your co-workers, I believe it’s  essential to have a good time at the job."
good,Fiziek zwaar werk. De hele dag moet staan en stijle trapen rennen. Want een magazijn is boven en andere beneden. Personeel verandert heel snel. Meestal is het leuke team. Winkel momemteel heeft leuke manager.
good,Weekday consists of assigned projects in each section with some customer service. Weekends are more fast paced with customer service being the highest priority.
good,"Great place to learn the fast paced environment of retail and as a manger have some independence in a corporate setting.  Job is very physical and budgeted hours for operations are on the low end.  Management embraces diversity and looks to promote internally.  There is a laid back feel, and seem to have a family feel considering how big the company is."
good,"Worked for sketchers for 4 years, was a pleasure but better job opportunities came my way. This company definitely has a great discount, workable hours, great team, great leadership. Overall easy going."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, profesionalismo, buena comisión"
good,"I had an opportunity to work with the leading talent in the footwear space and witness first hand the development of a multi-billion dollar footwear conglomerate.  "
good,"The main purpose of this position is to replenish the sales floor with shoes from the stock room, organize misplaced shoe boxes and assist costumers finding shoes to try or buy."
good,"Mucha competitividad y disciplina, aprecio a esta empresa por el buen trato hacia los trabajadores"
good,Very diverse. A lot of teamwork and communication. Really have to be willing to reach out to customers to listen and meet their needs. I really enjoy working with my team every chance i get. we all try our best to make the most with the time that is given to us and to recover the store as best as possible before/after closing and before we leave for the night
good,"Nice environment "
good,"The store I worked at was a good environment, the pay for entry level is minimum wage, which seems fair as the job is usually very relaxed. Pay raises are annual. Much better than most other retail jobs"
good,It was a different kind of retail experience from anywhere else I’ve been. There’s always something to do to keep the staff busy. It’s a great place to stay preoccupied and provide great customer service.
good,"Fue una experiencia divertida."
good,"Was a great job many learning experiences. There were many customer interactions that were made on a daily basis. Coworkers were great to work with, managers were very understanding."
good,"Main job is to sell shoes and other accessories to customers. It's not commission based so the pressure isn't there to earn extra money. Other tasks include bringing stock from the backroom and pricing the boxes. It's a nice job to have while you're in school or looking to for a first job. The other staff members are really friendly and they make you feel welcome. But there are inconsistent hours and you never get two days off in a row unless you request days off, but that has to be 2 weeks in advance. This job requires a lot of patience as some customers can really be a pain or dealing with children."
good,Coworkers are a lot of fun and we always had a good time. There are slow and busy times but you are expected to get things done quickly and be willing to change things all the time. Sometimes stressful but that's any job. Lots of room for growth within the company.
good,"Fast pace environment, especially on the weekends. Schedule is totally fair and hours are decent. Great place to gain retail experience. You might have to learn as you go when you get hired due to lack of training."
good,I enjoyed my time there. I had to learn how to have good relationships with customers. Make sales to every customers. Also everyone is energetic and much more.
good,"Skechers helped advance me to become a worker that's always doing something. It taught me that even when you think you're done, there's always something to do."
good,"Ambiente relajado y con oportunidad de crecer dentro de la empresa, lamentablemente no se gana suficiente o demasiado dinero."

good,I loved working there.  I went from part-time to full-time to store manager within a year.  It gets pretty busy at times but the compensation is great.
good,"Skechers is a fun and great place to work. I had a great time working there, I've learned so much and grown more as a manager. the environment at the Toronto Eaton Centre location is a fast paces environment so you  learn how to be a quick."
good,a lot of socializing with co-workers and customers. sure of the product you selling is satisfying to there needs. out managers are very helpful to us and there work the field to keep business growing faster. when inventory arrives is when we really need the help. closing the store is easy because there is no one in the ails.

good,Skechers is a wonderful company and I truly believe in the product.
good,"buena estabilidad laboral, bien remunerado, buenas bonificaciones de productividad "
good,awesome co-workers and management. the thing that i loved was my customers.
good,"Very goal oriented. Once an employee clocks in they are assigned to their designated stations and read their daily targets. Skechers also has a high paced sales floor especially during holidays and tourist seasons. More international customers than locals. Friendly but competitive work environment. For those who aren't afraid of a challenge, Skechers rewards sales with commission."
good,"The store manager was strict but in a nice way so we would do our job right, my coworkers were incredibly funny and we got a long swell. The pay was alright and so were the hours, and it suited my school life."
good,Nothing to special just shoe store with good people to work with 50% off shoes. The employees do good about helping one another. The pay could be better it's good for someone looking for additional income or part time employment but dont expect the income to be enough to pay Bill's unless store is short staffed which most are due lack of advancement.
good,"Good company to work at. You learn a lot about their merchandise and how certain things benefit your customers. They have a very nice selection of shoes you can choose from when you start working, your fist pair is free."
good,"Overall pretty good work environment. Great company to work for, the pay is not all there though. It is pretty stressful at times but once you get the hang of things it becomes really easy. 7/10"

good,This job was one of the most difficult jobs that i ever had! Physically demanding but every day i wish i could go back. I had the best leadership when i started out and had a wonderful team to work beside
good,This job pushed me to be better as a sales associate and as a Sales Lead Manager. I developed better communication skills and managment skills through the year and a half I was there.
good,Everyone working there was very friendly and we all got along. The managers are hardworking and knowledgeable about the products and how things work in the company. Problems are easily resolved due to the General Manager's conflict resolution skills and ability to stay unbiased in the work setting.
good,"The customer service department was very fast paced with not much time to collaborate with the team. "
good,"Great  environment, always things to do new  sales to learn about. Always goals to meet, enjoyably competitive.  Constant new merchandise that’s advanced and met more of the customers needs.  Sketchers always gave great discounts to and towards companies that involved Specific footwear."

good,Highly Competitive Environment - however followed by a culture of supervisors imparting skills of body language reading to teach us how to promote sales better.
good,I work in Birch Run Skechers. Im seasonal part time I enjoy working for this company. Managers are Awesome. They are more than understanding and are willing to work with your everyday schedule. Also its a 30 minute drive 1 way and its worth it. Drama free..
good,"My 2nd opportunity as a manager here, absolutely love it. Very supportive staff and team members. Would recommend to anyone. Works with all schedules and pays well."
good,A great environment to grow and develop interpersonal skills with workers and customers. Working with others and having the manage coworkers gave a lot to the growth to my experience.
good,I would recommend Skechers to anyone looking to start a career in the retail world. This is not for someone who is looking to make lots of money but instead a learning and growing experience.
good,"Skechers has a lot of high standards when it comes to operations, sales, management, and pretty much everything else. It can be a lot, but you learn a lot working for this company. Working here will definitely put you in a good place of growth even if you don't stay with the company."
good,"A typical day at work is first shifting the shoes on display , making them neat and presentable for the customers . approaching customers and starting a conversation then ultimately bringing them to the cashier and ringing them up . after we do that for about 4 hours we then fix the display boxes before the closing shift and finally leave ."
good,"Everyone is freindly and managemnt is great, but there are not enought hours given to employes and sometimes an abundance of then go without any hours every week."
good,I enjoyed my time at Skechers and will definitely recommend it to someone to it. I enjoyed the management and loved how understanding and easy to talk to they were.
good,"-In-charge has good communication and relation with staffs."
good,"job is great if you are a true salesperson.  you get hourly plus whatever you make during your shift.  certain areas you will get tips, especially if you have repeat customers"
good,"The supervisors were very respectful, bubbly and kept all lines of communication open. If one would want to work extra hours it was approved with no problem. The Supervisors and Managers were very knowledgeable when training staff on how sales are made items are returned and labeled. This business is very kid friendly and especially the fact they gave free popcorn to all guest coming into the store during christmas."
good,"Working at Skechers for a year , was a very enduring , hands on , multi tasking , challenging , learning experience.You grow with your co workers, and managers as a family. While still maintaning a professional , hard working environment."
good,It is a lot of work. Most of your days are spent with manual labor from checking shipment to shifts walls. Very little time with customers. Lots of room to grow though.
good,"Typical day at work would be creating and following flow charts for products that were appealing and brought in foot traffic, adjust an allocate the right hours to stay within payroll for the week staff entire stores"
good,"Skechers is a demanding work environment.  Salaried employees were expected to work approximately 60 hours a week, which was not hard to do with all the changes in direction from the department president.   The top Management would demand changes and then  when executed would blame the lower management for making changes.  The hardest part of the job was being able to do the right thing while the Department President would yell in meetings.  I know when leaving an employee was asked to over ship by the president which they did because they didn't know how to tell the President no.  They were later documented for following the presidents direction and over shipping and the department president denied telling them to do so.  The best part of working here was the higher pay and the staff normally working together to get things done correctly."
good,"No such thing as a regular day. As a manager, you can expect a variety of tasks from operations to sales generation, HR, and more.  Overall, it is a fun place and you can learn a lot from all the areas of responsibility."
good,"Great co workers, friendly staff, helpful and insightful staff. Great place for advancement in company. Would recommend to others. Good hours and good pay"
good,"great product, flexible shifts, low pay, limited training. i like my job the cons are as you would find in other retail jobs but its fun to be part of a young energetic team."
good,"Skechers Usa is a fast-paced environment but yet easy-going at the same time. Especially if you're already in ""the zone"", everything just starts moving smoothly. Clean up and stock are a breeze with the help of your team - and so is clearing out the store when you get the afternoon rush of shoe sales."
good,"I worked at multiple locations and the staff was diligent and a great team environment.  There were always opportunities for advancements in title, responsibilities, and pay rate.  The downside was a low starting wage, retail hours, and on-call shifts."
good,"Management was interested in providing the best working environment for their sales team to thrive in. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of keeping your department neat and tidy, assisting customers with their needs, and restocking your department as needed. All this is done in a professional and enthusiastic mood with a sense of urgency."
good,"A typical day at work involved me setting up the floor properly, and putting up any new displays. Also making sure all styles were on the floor and that the panels were correctly organized. I help customers and persuaded them to get elite cards, which is a points reward card. I learned about inventory and how to persuade customers to leave the store with various items not just one. The management was pretty decent but a little disorganized because the store was under staff. My co- workers were very nice individuals who helped one another out. We would put each others drags away and guide each other in the correct path, without it interfering with our job. The hardest part of my job was taking care of 6 customers. It took patience and organization to make sure all 6 customers were satisfied and comfortable. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers from different places around the world. it taught m what styles certain people from other countries  preferred. I also enjoyed learning about the different functions of every shoe, because it gave me some credibility when i would explain it to the customers."
good,"a typical work day is you trying to sell shoes, and push Skechers memberships. the hardest part of the Skechers job is cleaning up at the end of the day."
good,"Fun workplace that allows one to hone their sales skill set and interpersonal communication skills while getting experience in operations, HR, etc. Those who want commission will work hard for it. You put in what you get."
good,Grate place to work. Increasing efficiency and new products development. Nice team work. Cutomers are lke family with a great service for them.
good,"I worked in the shoe stores, it was a good part time job while in school.  I cant complain about anything. As a sales person you wont be breaking the bank, but its a retail store what do you expect. I enjoy most people I work with, but I get along with pretty much everyone."
good,"Skechers is a great company to work for. I enjoy working in a fast paced environment and multi-tasking. Helping customers, driving results, and employee development are my favorite things about this job. I absolutely love my co-workers, we work hard and have fun while doing it. The biggest challenge I face in my job, is working with a sometimes extremely limited amount of payroll hours."
good,"Greet customers, ensure great rapport and thank customers to ensure return with a smile "
good,"Typical days are very busy. I've learned better communication skills, I moved up to a floor manager. Co workers are very helpful with anything. I enjoy the job in general. Nothing was to hard."
good,Working for Sketchers Footware was a very educational experience.  I was always eager to promote the new products; there was a product for the whole family.
good,Start work at 6 when early shipments come in. Scan items and put products in shelves in order. Label items that had to go back and put in the storefront. Always communicate with other workers. Pulling items up and down the stairs is hard. A steady paycheck makes it easy when it is over.
good,"días con mucho movimiento; se aprende a trabajar rápido y eficaz; colegas agradables, dificultad: mantener el orden; lo que más me agradó fue el ambiente"
good,under different district management it would be a great investment for a career.
good,great place its big warehouse good breaks they feed u GREAT COWORKERS
good,"Daily responsible for store scheduling"
good,"great working for the company, however, the lack of hours was the downside. great managent, was able to learn a lot from them."
good,A typical day consists of selling and stocking. You have to great the customer within a couple of minutes after they walk through the door even in a high volume store. It was a good job but needed to move on because my expenses (rent) was about to increase.
good,"Ensuring our customers were tended to and aware of any all promotions. Maintaining a clean and mess free sales floor to have a safe shopping experience as well as working environment for customers and employees alike. The Sketchers workplace culture was a relaxed one, management and staff had a decent friendly relationship. The most taxing of duties while working for Sketchers would be inventory nights. However, with a great team and manager it was accomplished in an effortless and timely manner."
good,"A very high traffic store, full of tourist usually. Also keeps you on your feet and doing something, wether its helping customers or even translating for other employees. It was very busy and also very interesting to meet new people. I learned about the hands on work of retail sales & stock."
good,"It's a fun place to work for, with great staff and good commission on sales, however, recently it has become a zombie-like zone which has ruined the fun and enjoyment of the workplace. The supervisors are great, however, due to lots of management changes under a short period of time, things got a bit too messy and the store got desperate in hiring its most recent manager. "
good,"I think working in skechers in fine but need to replace the big bosses and whole team of stereotypes and money driven ego people running skechers with open minded and light hearted people with at the same time, have a mind of diversity and business driven.. "
good,Typically only five hour shifts where you can either be helping to stock the sales floor or you can be part of the closing team for the night which makes sure the store is clean and ready for the next day.
good,I enjoyed being taught about the specific background knowledge on certain Skechers products including their shoes and apparel. The environment in which the team created made me feel included into the work environment and contributed to my activity on the shop floor.
good,A typical day at work would be to stand in a way to greet the guests that come in. I learned about the product knowledge to better serve customers. Superiors would help where the could and answer all questions if asked. Hardest part of the job was meeting sales goals during dead hours. Most enjoyable part was to go out and eat with the team.
good,"At skechers, no two days are the same. One day you could have a bunch of kids coming in for new school shoes, or you could be doing price changes all day. I really liked that."
good,İş temposu yüksek iyi maaş + prim + ticket veren bir şirket
good,The staff at skechers were young and vibrant and we all went to school together so it was easy to work with eachother. A typical work day at skechers consist of making sure the store is neat and put together and helping costumers find wat are looking for
good,"I loved working with my coworkers the most. It was easy to advance from Sales Associate to Assistant Manager since I had open availability. My manager was wonderful, the district manager and above were hard to talk to."
good,There are many people that have worked with this company for over 10 years. That says a lot when you have hundreds of employees. This is a great place to start and live out a career in the footwear industry.
good,Skechers has a very fun work environment. Even when the district manager comes for a visit we still have fun while getting our jobs done. The management team at Skechers is fantastic and very easy to work with.
good,"As admin, the pressure of the store was completely on me, while still having to uphold responsibility of my own duties. It was challenging and i learned a great deal. Although the incentive was not as I had hoped, I do not resent the outcome and will take this as a learning stride."
good,"the work place is pretty cool,kind of crazy but overall its alright. management and associates help you train and you get the hang of things pretty easily"
good,"A good work place and environment, everyone was very helpful and friendly. Mostly international customers would come in and locals, regular customers. The hours were good."
good,Skechers was one of the best jobs i have ever had. They gave me the opportunity to grow as a Manager and District Manager. I was really impressed with the communication with the owners of the company.
good,I learned a lot at this company. Gained a lot of experience at sales and talking to customers. Management was fantastic and so was commission. You got recognized for the hard work you did.
good,Must be able to learn fast and work fast. Must be able to multi tasking. Must be able to give the right change and money to the customer. Must be able to read a shoe size scale.
good,"Overall, Skechers has been a great company to work for.  The staff have always been kind and fun to work with.  During school breaks they always take me back and give me hours that I request.  The manager is flexible about working with other commitments such as a second job or sports if notified in advance.  The staff were all funny but knew how to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job is juggling all of the customers while trying to keep the store clean on a busy day such as Memorial Day Weekend.  I learned how to be more outgoing with customers and a lot of patience while working in retail."
good,"en general es una experiencia positiva, donde todos los compañeros trabajan a la par"
good,Hope there was better management and the coworkers were very friendly They work with you of time off. They are flexible of work schedules. Everyone works together. This company is a excellent job
good,"It was okay, but no room for advancement. Task were easy and fun. Compensated good enough. Management was good when I started, but switched, and decline in overall quality."
good,"I've been working at this job for about a year and a half, many different things have happened during my employment here. We went through three store managers, many team members left, as well as weak members that forced my workers and I to re group and grow from it. It can have very slow days where it's hard to stay busy, and other times it's steady for hours; it can be very unstable."
good,"Working at Skechers is great. Mostly because of coworkers, and the fact that its not only salary/hourly pay  based, but you also get commssion. Which means you literally can control your paycheck. The more you sell the more you make. Management is a bit unstable, in some stores you have great leaders and in others you'll find people who  are incompetent but honestly it's still a great company to work for."
good,"Have to give the customers excellent customer service."
good,"Skechers was, in my opinion, a great starter job if youre looking to get into retail sales. You can sharpen your social interactive skills while having fun selling great quality shoes. They present a challenge for multi-tasking and providing great customer service."
good,"I learned retail skills here that helped me to excel at other retail stores. the job was very exciting at first, but got fairly tedious after a year. having commission on top of the hourly wage was great, but there was often simply too much to do, making the pay not exactly enough."
good,"Empresa comprometida con sus empleados, ya que reconocen tu dedicación para generar el resultado en equipo.Con un ambiente laboral juvenil y agradable ya que todo el personal teníamos el mismo objetivo en común"
good,"A typical day at work contains daily store operations such as inventory control, shipment, cleaning, visual merchandising, training and coaching associates. Upper management sort of not on the same page but it's not bad overall. Hardest part of the job are the hours. Definitely no weekends off and late hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.The Skechers team feels like one big family."
good,"Although I loved working for Skechers, there were times it was too stressful due to the lack of consideration from fellow team members. I think when you're working in a team you have to have the ability to be able to meet your own goals with out having to put other in jeopardy of meeting there goals."
good,It was a great experience and you gain great knowledge out of it. You get to meet amazing people and the vibes they have are just great.
good,"Started as a simple stock associate within 2 years i was an assistant manager, one year later i ran the store. Easy KPI,Sales Goals and floor movements for small box stores. My district manager was awesome and heloed out with everything i needed. Never felt like i was alone, i felt like i was part of a team and a unit in my District. Also the benfits were awesome  pay was great too."
good,"Do you your job and you'll be fine, it was not hard. All of the other workers there was friendly and helpful. Management was very nice also. Typical day is clean a little in the morning, get everything set up, then when people come just help them and keep your section clean, not much to it."
good,Fun environment but slow with customer traffic. Worked off of hourly and commission which was nice but not also not enough hours.
good,"Arrive on site and set-up retail floor for customers and upper level corporate management. Established better customer service and communication levels as well as increase organizational patterns that allowed for me to achieve the most results. Most difficult part were the rushes in the mid-afternoon and evening, however that was the most enjoyable too because of being able to meet so many new people."
good,"Skechers has been my first retail job in which after a year of hard work i have learned a lot; working here has helped me grow as a sales representative and thought me how to be more patient with myself and others. I became very close to my co workers since they are all very easy to get along with and also my managers. I really enjoy working here because as soon as i walk through the doors i feel welcomed, wanted and appreciated and i believe that every job should not only make customer feel that way but also the employees."
good,"At first I was just an associate, with the passion and drive to move forward. Sales were fun, you could play of your coworkers with some friendly competition. Advanced quickly. Management always there. Shipment might have been the hardest but I enjoyed it. What I liked the most was helping the customer find what is was that she wanted. Or close to what she needed."
good,"-Cashier"
good,I have delivered measurable results contributing profitable gains and driving company sales. Recruiting talented candidates to fill store staffing needs. Developing product specialist to beyond company expectations. Maintaining consistent tact and composure while being adaptable to unexpected situations and or environments to strategic plaining and ensuring open lines of communication.
good,"* learned many things about operation work"
good,Cette année en tant que vendeuse à temps partiel m'int beaucoup appris. Particulièrement la responsabilité de mes erreurs mais aussi le fait d'être méticuleux.
good,I look forward to going to work each day because of the welcoming co-workers and management. It is very enjoyable to work with people who have fun and laugh with you.
good,"travail assez simple et bonne ambiance dans l usine                             "
good,"I started out as a Part-time sales associate, plenty of room for growth within the company. Loved the interacting with the customers. Hardest part of the job was always shifting the product."
good,"SKECHERS è davvero una bella realtà , fantastico il modo in cui non t facciano sentire solo un numero visto il  grande numero d employees che v ci sono all inerno , ma basano tutto su un lavoro costatne e quoitidiano di fiducia reciproca e meritocrazia."
good,Great work place wish pay was higher or maybe more hours but over all it was a great work experience. Great meeting new people getting people into what they need . Always work with you no matter what the situation may be
good,"Great place to work, but you have to put in the time.  Wish there was more product knowledge given to the warehouse stores."
good,Always a fun environment. Sometimes may get a customer or two that are hard to please but other than that definitely enjoy the people I work with and the whole atmosphere. You have to be able to work at a fast pace. Only thing I dont like is at the store I work in the only person who qualifies to work full-time is the Store manager.
good,"There is always a lot to do and it gets overwhelming sometimes but the management is great at making sure you get help when needed. They are very clear about what their expectations are for the day. All the other employees are very nice and helpful. I love working with customers and helping them find a product that they love. It is hard to get all of my tasks done when the store gets busy, but everyone is really great about helping each other out."
good,"Greeted customers"
good,"Advice to Senior Management – We are in the 21st century, let's roll our sleeves and put the company at par in systematics"
good,"Being an American company Skechers has a vibrant bubbly vibe to it, with a wide range of customers that come from all age groups from all cultures."
good,A typical day at work was just stocking and aisles that needed to be filled and making sure customers needs were met. Management was great and the hours were very flexible. I learned more techniques on how to up-sell.
good,"Upon first arriving everyday the first thing I would do was check to see what my sales target was for the day. Basically in short what I did was help my customers find the right shoe for them.  There was not a whole lot of down time between customers but when there was I would do some cleaning in the store. "
good,I liked working at Skechers mainly because the people I worked with helped me in many ways and they are probably some of the best coworkers I have ever had
good,"I’ve worked for this company for over a year and it has been the best job I’ve ever had. Some management does need work, but with being new comes more to learn. If you have a problem they do usually try and get it resolved quickly. The job is very repetitive so it’s easy to pick things up but it can get tiresome as you’re constantly doing the same thing. I would say overall it is a great job with great money."
good,Skechers is a my first choice and highly recommend it. They're a good choice for people who are more casual and can engage well with customers and co-workers.
good,"cuando yo etuve en esa tienda tenia un buen equipo de trabajo todos cooperabamos, para que las cosas no fueran tan estresantes, era un trabajo en equipo, nos apoyabamos."
good,My time with Skechers was spectacular. I don't regret my time at Skechers whatsoever but do wish to return. I ended my job there on a bad note due to lack of business professionalism.
good,I mean Skechers is a fun place to work but I think our specific store just changed the hours after closing. So on Sundays the outlets close at 8 but today they close at 7 but I get off at 9 and it is Bc we have to do recovery. It shouldn’t take 2 hours to do recovery. The stores not THAT big.
good,For retail management Skechers provides a great work/life balance.  Compensation is pretty close to the industry average.  The company is still growing and has plenty of opportunity for advancement.  The only major downside is the company has a habit of acting like a mom and pop start up company even though the company has been around for over 30 years.
good,great job was a very layed back job that was very cofortable which is why i stayed there for 7 years and had a lot of events with this company and donations.
good,"The Skechers I worked at was a high pace job but can also be slow paced depending on the day however I think for getting into sales and customer service this was a good starter job. There is a lot of customers constantly coming in so you'll always have something to do. Its a good intro to selling products making the products look in tip top shape and problem solving. It also had quite a few options of rising up the totem pole, however with that being said the hours weren't too good for any employee that isn't a manager. No one but managers can get overtime, a lof of the uppers speak english and spanish so sometimes you wont get the same treatment but thats about it."
good,"Most of your day consists of repetitive organizing shoes, searching for shoes as well as extreme customer service. The same 15 songs are on repeat while you work."
good,"Had a great experience at the location, yet there were the common ups and downs with the managers. But, I'd recommend the job to anyone interested in a great first job or who likes shoes."
good,You just have to be fast on your feet and they are very flexible when it comes to hours. You also get a discount on Skechers since you work their. And it’s like a family
good,"Work is enjoyable, considering who you are working with.  A typical retail job.  Sometimes it's slow, and sometimes it's fast-paced.  Do expect to help out customers."
good,"I worked in a mall location so it wasn't ever too busy. The other employees were nice, and the manager was very relaxed. A good place to work while you're in school, I also made commission"
good,A typical day at work may be restocking merchandise and handling customer service. I learned to truly multitask. Management at Skechers is pretty good. The workplace is very relaxed very organized. The hardest part of the Job is just having a really busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it is not busy.
good,"One day at work we had so many customers at same time than we usually do. Those were my first week at the job and i was an amateur at the job so i was all nervous about the sales, so at that time our supervisor came and helped me and he gave me full support and said that its okay u will learn , you got it . at that time i was so motivated and i found it was so great full to have supporting team mates around you."
good,Skechers keeps you engaged with various projects and customer service. Ive been able to gain management training in a friendly and supportive culture. While it can be frustrating when I cant help a customer to their fullest expectation I love helping every person that walks through my doors.
good,Skechers is a great company to work for with friendly staff and organized management. Their only downfall is their shortage of hours in the winter due to the lack of business.
good,this company is thriving everyday its a fun place to be and there is lots of room to grow in management and the shoes are so cute for adults and children
good,I have held a position with this company for a little over 2 years and am sill currently employed as a seasonal employee. There is flexible scheduling and fair pay.
good,"Lavoro per loro da pochi mesi e complessivamente sono soddisfatto."
good,Everytime i get an opportunity to help someone i'm thrilled. and at this job it allowed me to help people get the right shoes fit for them. I enjoyed working there people the environment was very positive.
good,"Typical day is to provide customers with the best experience when buying comfortable shoes."
good,Let me balance school n work also allowing me to still maintain decent hours and a fair amount of pay. Giving me great job giving good benefits n good people that I worked with

good,*in-charge of daily inventory and availability & Taking T.R number. *Update the sales for the day & promotional and seasonal sales. *Attend to needs and requirements of the customers. *Attend products orientation to improve knowledge and increase sales.
good,"managing day to day paper work, opening and closing the store, training new hires and coaching employees to handle customer services. keeping the store clean and safe for everyone."
good,"Nice  place to work. Great management, great location.  Not a hard job, great pay, customer's are not hard to deal with. Recommend as a place to work."
good,"I started working for Skechers at seventeen and was promoted at nineteen. As a sales associate I made myself availvible for any position or task they needed, as a manager I was put in every area of responsibility and excelled in each. I was able to learn and mature in many ways thanks to Skechers."
good,It's a good environment to grow and move up and get experience. I started at $8.50 as a sales associate and then 6 months later I became a team lead and then 3 months after that I became an assistant manager. Now I get paid 11.50. Each year you get a raise.
good,Great product and great company values. Fun environment. Lots of room for growth. Great prices for all types of customers and age ranges. Big focus and selling and customer service
good,A typical day at work consist of me going straight into work and beginning on boxes. Everyone there is extremely nice and friendly. Learned a lot on trying to be patient but overall its a fun environment to be around.
good,"The work environment is positive and almost all of the employees reflect this. The management are the perfect mix of authoritative, flexible, encouraging, empathetic, motivating and many more wonderful things. The managers do a wonderful job of establishing goals and developing creative ways of maintaining motivation of accomplishing these goals. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who do not speak the same language, however, it helped that I spoke Arabic which most of our international customers spoke a variation of. The most enjoyable part of this job is the workplace relationships that are developed and the various team building activities the managers create in order to improve performance, as well as the feedback received by the managers and fellow employees about job performance. There is a lot of transparency in this organization."
good,"Steady / Calm place to work at. A lot of customer service. Money handling, Inventory , and stocking. Managed the store made sure everything was flowing well."
good,"helping customers "
good,Upbeat work place with a modern look to the store with great customer service  clean work place also has sales for everything at her store great organization within the stockroom bi-weekly pay with commission weekly sales goals
good,"Working at Skechers consisted of greeting costumers telling them about our deals and making sure that they find that perfect fit. We also find the time on shifting, cleaning, and doing back stock."
good,The best part of this job was the team; they were really co-operative and hard-working. I learned more about the sales environment and how to manage a retail store. The hardest part of the job was busy weekend shifts when there was a lot of customers in the store because you had to be good at multi-tasking and be comfortable in a fast paced environment.
good,"Sketcher's is a great place to gain experience in retail. It is a solid choice, when choosing your first retail job. The management system and the training fosters an environment of learning and a drive for success."
good,A typical day at Skechers you never have a down minute. You constantly learn new things everyday are able to better your self in the world of retail. The best part of the job is being able to talk to the customers and hear their stories from around the world; even though it seems like it may look like just a shoe store you will gain more life experience than imaginable by working there.
good,"aprendí a trabajar bajo presión, a un ritmo mas acelerado , manejo de personal en apertura de tiendas de la misma empresa, realizar inventarios"
good,"Not much was required at this location. The Beverly Center sees many foreign tourists that love the brand. Most of the time they come in, ask for a few pairs in a size and are on their merry way."
good,"llego al trabajo abro la tienda, saludo a mis compañeros, reviso las actividades del día, comenzamos con la limpieza luego designo tareas, lo que me gusto es la tecnología que tenia el calzado a modo  de satisfacer las necesidades de cada cliente, así mismo fue una de las partes mas difícil ya que tienes que aprender bien los beneficios para poder brindarle el servicio que requiere el cliente."
good,A really good company to work with. Fun place to work at. Provide good benefits. Recommend applying there for others. gives you good teaching method on how to talk to costumers and build trust with them
good,Skechers ist eine Junger sehr innovativer Brand aus den USA. Auch das Management versuchte sich immer auf damneuesten Stand zu halten und ist sehr offen und kreativ.
good,You can walk in as a Sales Associate in January and become a SM by October. When you work here you are constantly being challenged and everyday is different.
good,A typical day consisted of customer service in sales at a specialty store. It was usually very busy and the staff was always enthusiastic and up-beat. hardest part of the day was trying to stock merchandise while store was open for business.
good,"its a challenge every day but i am always ready for it. Usually i start by organizing the store checking everything its in its proper place and it looks 100%. I learned how to multitask on a busy day and to deal with customers. Management is great so as my co-workers, everybody gets along so its easy to do my job. The hardest part of my job is probably shipment day because everything is very unorganize because we get so many boxes and we dont have a wide enough stockroom so we have to endure. The most enjoyable part of my job is cashiering because i like to deal with money."
good,"Skechers is absolutely one of the best most profitable companies  to work for. I have personally gained a vast knowledge of how a corporate structure expands. With my experience I have built Team Leaders, Strong Managers, Recruiting the most impeccable employees! Always meeting deadlines .Allways providing an exceptional exciting experience for entire families!"
good,"I learned a lot about customer service working at Skechers. Everyone was great, my co-workers made it worth it coming to work."
good,fun and exciting place to work. i learned alot from working here
good,"A typical day was busy."
good,Skechers has to be one of my best jobs. I worked there for almost a year and was my first permanet job after christmas temping. It was a small work enviroment and the people were lovely. The pay was good and we got commission. We got more of a one to one experience with customers and staff because it was a small store in Oxford Street London. If the store did not close down I probably would have stayed there for a little while longer.
good,Working at Skechers has always been a fun and enjoyable atmosphere.
good,"Working in Skechers was busy on the holidays and selling Skechers,  ShapeUps was the stores number 1 priority. I've also learned to be patient in this job as well not because of the customers but also the employees because we all had different tasks throughout our shift and it was difficult to ask for help during busy hours. I did enjoy it's fast pace enviroment because it kept me busy, but it only last around the holidays."
good,Just have to handle with a lot of rude costumers and keep and eye out for people that like to steal sneakers and lie about other things.
good,"Great management with great co-workers, with a very fast pace environment."
good,"A lot of good people, having fun at work. Retail structure is still lacking, and training is laughable. However, this lack of organization gave me managerial freedom to staff and train as I saw fit for each store I had to manage. Employment is great if you can handle sudden changes, and creative freedom. If you require structure, and a hand to guide you, look elsewhere."
good,This store was in the Mall of America and extremely busy but was always a fun work environment
good,Upon arriving at work I would immediately begin my sales tasks. I loved helping the customers and explaining the products. I would always strive to better my sales and go for the biggest sale I could.
good,"Skechers is a busy place to work in, specially during the weekend and holidays. They assured us with benefits after our first year. Within a year we would also receive a new pair of shoes and our raise. The only thing I disliked about Skechers was the manager was to strict. We were not aloud to interact with out co-workers during business hours."
good,"I am involved in many other activities outside of working at skechers. I am a college student athlete, if you could only imagine how busy I could get. They allow me to still live my college life, family life, and they even made it easy for me to pick up side jobs when it was needed. They are very flexible and make it easy to juggle my work and outside of work activities well."
good,"This place has great management and social interactions, never a boring moment when I worked there. Old systems for point of sales but easy to use if ur good with numbers"
good,This place was a very productive workplace and it helped me gain so many skills. The people working around me were great to be around and made the workplace better.
good,typical day was slow paced and organized busy days were very hectic and felt like you couldn't keep up with the mess customers left behind for you to clean up
good,This place has a great atmosphere with even better management. They would always work around your schedule provided they have enough notice to make any adjustments they needed to make
good,"My district and regional managers were amazing at Skechers. My only complaints would be that the Southern California stores are completely disconnected from the rest of the retail stores and treated differently (unlimited payroll), and that the son of the CEO (who will be the CEO one day) is a less than savory person to say the least."
good,I have loved working for Skechers. The company really cares for there employees. Typical day at work. Open the store turn the alarm off. Count all the money in the store. Help customers with what they need. Do paperwork through out the day. Mange my team that i have that day. Help my employees stock the store. I have learned how to lead. The culture is a high beat family place. The hardest part is to please every customer. Sometimes we wont have a certain shoe or size in store or online. Helping the costumers find the right shoe that fits and is comfortable for there feet. Making sure that I went above and beyond to make there experience at Skechers enjoyable.
good,"El hambiemte laboral es bueno, sin embargo no se tiene bien establecido el trabajo de cada departamento dentro de la empresa. Fuera de eso es buena empresa y te permite crecimiento."
good,"Trabajé en Skechers por recomendación de un amigo. "
good,A typical day of work was scheduled by management professionally in order to maintain and achieve store goals and objectives. Management ran the store professionally with the help of Supervisors and Sales Associates.
good,Aprendí muchas cosas que me enseňaron rotulado paletisadora.ect..grato ambiente. Consientes con sus trabajadores.
good,"Outlet Centrum Roermond is altijd druk ."
good,Welcoming environment with colleagues who are easy to work with and management who genuinely care about their staff. Great for university students wanting to earn a bit of money part time or for people wanting to progress in retail as they offer supervisor training too.
good,this is one of the easiest jobs i have ever had. if anything its too easy. got very boring at times. if your looking for a relaxed job this would be the way to go
good,"Azienda  capillare che permette una crescita professionale reale ."
good,"im overall satisfied the work isn't stressful or demanding i would recommend this job to a friend "
good,"Great place to work. You have to be very quick though, as there is no time to rest. Good people and friendly upper management. Decent opportunity for advancement."
good,Skechers is a employee focused company that has a fun but challenging environment. It has a great culture focused on developing leadership and Teamwork. And also it has an incredible customer/fan base.
good,A lot of growth with the company is possible. Good company to work for. Need to fit in and you can have growth with the company. Shoes are actually comfortable. Is a fun company to work for.
good,"A typical day is taking advantage of customer service and also exploiting sales to our customers. I learned how to operate their registers, therefore I can constantly keep selling our products. Our management are hard-working and trustworthy, as well with the rest of the staff who opens their-selves with potential and kindness. The hardest part of the job is getting customers to become elites, but I enjoy greeting people and service their interest."
good,At Toronto outlets ( Halton Hills) location the manger is one of the best i have ever worked with hands down the best. They keep a good mix of work and play would highly recommend.
good,Aprendes a relacionarte con los clientes para una buena venta.
good,servir les client gérait le stock une grade entreprise ou on peux avancé
good,Job was very focused on sales. Learned some marketing skills.
good,"My day would consist of providing a high standard of customer service such as selling specific fitness runners to athletes as every day wear shoes, answering and making phone calls to other skechers stores in Ireland and customers, fulfilling tasks delegated from managers and supervisors and ensuring store target is reached. I have learned that I enjoy a busy, fast pace workplace, working as a part of a team and learning new information such as new products. I have a very good working relationship with my two managers that advocating an issue or asking a question is easy and encouraged. The hardest part of my job would be achieving an high UPT- the number of double sales achieved in a week. It is something I constantly work at but can be difficult to maintain when individual sales are higher than expected individual target. I most enjoy work when it is very busy, I am constantly meeting new people and listening to them therefore finding a shoe that suits their needs. I also enjoy work when I have a number of jobs to complete, I get a sense of achievement and love working on my own initiative when completing these tasks."
good,"A typical day would include straightening the store, helping customers, filling in any empty spaces, and creating a positive environment. I learned new customer service things and that retail is not an easy environment like originally thought. Management was not my favorite the top 2 managers hardly did any work they were always on the phone in the back or just sitting in the back taking care of personal business and not doing work leaving us to do stuff on our own. It was very frustrating which is why most the store preferred working with each other and the other managers in the store then the GM and the 1st Assistant. My co-workers are great! I loved working with all of them! We all got along well and did our work. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling. I hardly knew when I worked and when i talked to my manager about maybe putting out the schedule a week in advanced he ended up just scheduling me less and only putting it out a few days in advanced. I loved helping customers, meeting new people, having new experiences, and of course making money"
good,"My typical day starts with a general cleaning of the store, preparing the staff for the busy day ahead with their targets, doing End of day reports for the office, taking in deliveries, merchandising the floor and dealing with customers of all ages."
good,"If you thrive in a busy fast paced enviornment then Skechers is the job for you. Fantastic career progression available for those who are willing to put the work in. "
good,"Skechers is an amazing environment to work, Your co-workers are super friendly and helpful when you are stuck or need help. The management team keeps things fun and interesting with different competitions and prizes for those who come out on top."
good,I loved working at Skechers for  the most part it was very enjoyable and management is amazing. Also times can get busy but also very very slow and cleaning can be tiring.
good,Skechers es una buena empresa para laborar tenemos muchos benefecios como trabajadores de la misma un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno y el suelo no es como para quejarse
good,"Customers are typically very nice."
good,"Great benefits. They offer health, dental, and vision care. Only problem I can think of is that they did not match 401k contributions. Got all major holidays off as well."
good,"The ideas of the company is amazing, however, the locations within Canada tend to have a mind of their own. The company provides a lot of support and growth for their team but communication is lacking between stores and their direct superiors. There is also lack of knowledge and communication between customer relations and the stores which makes the jobs at the store more difficult. "
good,"Working at Skechers is great. Mostly because of coworkers.Which means you literally can control your paycheck.  Management is a bit unstable, in some stores you have great leaders and in others you'll find people who are incompetent but honestly it's still a great company to work for."
good,"Not a bad company but stressful at times. Like a normal corporate company sometimes cares more about what they make than their employees. All aside they do let you have a life, and does approve vacations."
good,It's a great place and environment to be in. Since being with the company for a little over four months I can say it's something that I look forward to coming into everyday.
good,"I worked at skechers with nice people but the only reason for I must leave that job, is because they are pay not much and also given fewer hours a week."
good,"Room for advancement, friendly environment, and structural. You need patients to work with the types of customers you get. You need to be ready to help every customer that walks through the doors. You're constantly cleaning the sales floor and rearranging product for shipment. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,"la ventaja de hay era que las comisiones eran repartidas no se paliaba por eso, entonces debido a eso era un buen ambiente laboral, aprendí a perfeccionar mi manera de vender. "
good,A typical day would be approaching customers 20 seconds after they enter the store to check if they are okay for shoes and sizes. This was very important as I worked on a target based system for sales. I learned on the importance of good listening skills when dealing with customers in retail it is the best way to make a sale. The co-workers were polite and extremely helpful and took me in under their wing when I was first starting off. The only difficulties faced was dealing aggressive customers closer to the Christmas period. I mostly enjoyed the co-workers I worked with they were always there when you needed them even if it was to get a shift covered or ask a bit of advice on shoes. I felt part of family in Skechers as each store has its own separate sales team.
good,Realizar la junta del minuto con los compañeros y primero que nada dar las buenas noticias para que se sientan optimista y luego decirles a cada uno de ellos las metas que se deben de alcanzar tanto en tienda como individual para cada compañero; asignar tareas para cada uno y supervisar que las realicen de acuerdo al procedimiento de la tienda; mientras realizo lo administrativo como dar reportes o seguimiento de alguna situación; mientras que se realizas las tareas asignadas tratar de que haya un buen ambiente laboral con los compañeros y que ellos no sientan la presión del trabajo
good,"My typical day at work be selling product and making sure we are hitting on daily goals, encourage other employees to increase sells and be devoted to our product. Since I was in management, I got to learn a lot of new skills that I can carry into other companies. Working with customers and finding them the perfect shoe was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Definitely the most well structured company I have worked for. I basically have to go in every day and sell shoes. I have to promote the product and up-sell as much as possible. When I am not doing that, I am cleaning and stocking. I have had some of my best experiences with management. My boss at my old Skechers in California was very professional. He taught me a lot about being a good sales person and it has really reflected upon my performances, as I have been among the best Associates since I have been with the company. The toughest part of the job is sometimes it's really slow, as I like to be productive. I really enjoy the atmosphere there. They encourage you to have fun and to showcase your interpersonal skills, which are some of my best assets."
good,"Always ensure that you are shifting for the new product coming in, making sure that everything is followed closely with policy and procedure, strong customer service. "
good,Every one was really friendly including management. Work environment is fun.
good,"Was promoted from Assistant Manager to Store Manager in December 2010. Responsible for HR paperwork, payroll, generating sales/customer service, opening & closing duties, training, recruiting, and motivating staff while ensuring store policies. I also maintain visuals and create / promote a friendly work environment."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Skechers. I became an Assistant Manager 6 months after being hired and held that position for 2.5 years. The people that I came across were an honor to work with. I learned a lot about my leadership and would love another opportunity to show what I can do and how I can improve in a company. Again I had so much fun, with this company."
good,easiest job if you want to make money Fast. you get a lot of hours for overtime especially if it is a graveyard shift. the workplace is pretty chill. over all its a decent job if you want to make a quick buck and not stress to much.
good,"It was a really good, fun job where I met great people that I still talk to today. I learned a lot about management because they allowed me to show my true potential."
good,I was an assistant manager. Regardless of experience pay is set. 1 year a raise is given. Company has changing policies that are confusing and not always customer friendly
good,"If you're you looking for a company to quickly advance, Skechers may be the right place for you. The organization hires mostly, internally which makes internal candidates more attractive for promotions. Great work-life balance as well. As with any retail General Manager position, hours are not set and most schedules are flexible."
good,"En general es buena empresa, hay algunas diferencias con los trabajadores, pero manejables. Jefes exigentes pero se valora mucho el compromiso hacia la empresa."
good,lots of customers come from alll parts of the world so most of the time you cannot communicate with words but with gestures. i learned a lot from this job
good,Great company to work for lots of room for growth. Very interactive DM's and RM's. Lots of training if you're wanting to learn more in the company.
good,"They take care of their employees but it comes with a high workload. "
good,"Sales, opening/closing operating procedures of store"
good,"A normal day:  depending if you were the opening or closing manager."
good,"A typical day would include opening the store at scheduled time, doing and assigning tasks, engaging with customers, achieving sales goals and key product initiatives.  I have learned that teamwork is important in that we are all working as a team to meet the needs of the company.  Management oversees store to ensure best business practices.  My co-workers are my team members.  We all contribute to achieve success.  The hardest part of my job not being able to control ordering certain products or materials.  The most enjoyable part of the job is matching people to a comfortable shoe that will work for them."
good,"Fue emocionante trabajar durante la ""época fuerte"" del año en Venezuela, que es diciembre, ya que todos hacen muchas compras y la tienda siempre estaba llena de gente, lo que me daba la oportunidad de tener más y mejores ventas, a pesar de lo difícil que era buscar cada calzado en el depósito por el exceso de producto y el pequeño espacio para ello. Aprendí mucho sobre el trabajo en equipo, sobre la marca. Conocí nuevos compañeros, unos se volvieron amigos. Lo más difícil fue que el pago o el sueldo no me alcanzaba para mucho de lo que necesitaba, pero ese problema sucede en Venezuela en todas las empresas, por problemas político-económicos. Me gustó muchísimo haber entrado a trabajar allí, que siendo mi primer empleo y siendo algo fuerte, me gustó, me lo disfruté siempre con responsabilidad de mi tarea, tomando muy en serio a la hora de hacer mi trabajo."
good,"Working at Skechers has been a great experience for myself, I've learned how to become more of a people person engaging with customers & meeting with corporate heads almost every month. I've worked hard & they have shown their appreciation even if it's with simple recognition. It can be hectic at times running the business while assisting customers but it'll only make you more experienced asset and member to the team. They invest their time to make sure you are knowledgeable about the product. Overall, I love working for Skechers, I know they will be a beneficial partner to my successes in the future."
good,I deeply enjoy working under the Skechers branch. The managers are very competent and guide me and other employees to complete certain tasks and projects.
good,"I only worked at Skechers for a few months, however, during my time there, I always felt well supported and always encouraged to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone."
good,A typical day at Skechers is going in and startin off by helping any customer looks for a specific shoe they ar elooking for. Provide for them the right shoes size. Also if there are no customers it is very helpful to have a very clean and nice looking store.
good,Support help desk and install IT equipment at various skechers locations throughout  the nation. Helped educate sales associates on new point of sales system after they were installed
good,Employees at the Scarborough town center location are great. A few flaws in management but other than that its an amazing place to shop and work at.
good,Una empresa que ofrece oportunidad de crecimiento y capacita constantemente a su personal
good,Great and friendly workplace  and sales floor for very competitive but its a great thing it really shows your strength on skills when it comes to networking and marketing
good,"Very fun loving company who makes sure you get the best out of your experience "
good,"This job was super fun. You get commission so the more you sell, the bigger your paycheck is. They usually start you at part time which is cool because again the commission makes up for it. Would highly recommend :)"
good,"I learned how to engage and put in all effort, stay positive. and how to charm customers and convince them to join the sketchers membership, and maintain the organization."
good,"My work experience with Skechers was an unpleasant surprise for me because my manager at the time was not a friendly person. I was not happy to be walked all over and yelled at in front of my coworkers at a constant day to day basis. It was just not fun at all. When my coworkers figured I was leaving, they even told me that the manager had been bad-mouthing me. What kind of manager is that? When I finally left the store for my own good, other coworkers followed. I was not surprised."
good,"I worked for them for 1 year and a few months and I got promoted to supervisor by the time I was maybe 5-6 months in. I was working at one location and they asked me if I could help out other stores and I said yes. I was helping 2 other stores and before I knew it they had transferred me to a way further location from where I lived and from the store I had originally gotten hired at, they didnt even talk to me about it or anything. So at the new location I'm already Supervisor and I was only getting paid as a regular cashier. When I got pregnant they cut my hours like crazy I swear to you I was doing 3.5 - 4 hours a day for only 2 days a week. And when i told them that I got a second job they were upset and when I told them I had a third job they were so upset that they made me choose between them (Skechers) as my priority or my other jobs and I choose the other jobs because I was basically getting paid $3 more at both for a regular position that didnt require much work compared to being a supervisor and working for a horrible pay. Also before making my decision I told them that it's very difficult for me to stay at Skechers and do they work that I do for minimum wage and they said we know, were not gonna change it tho. And so that made it a lot easier for me to make my decision.  Beside all that I swear to y'all that a position as a regular sales Associate is a lot easier and you just go in and sell your shoes and make your money. It's based off of commissions. So if you sell more than 2 pairs of shoes within one transaction you make money for yourself. Also KEEP IN MIND THAT"
good,A typical day at Skechers consist of 3-4 customers coming up to you asking for a shoe (depending on the stores location). Always had to keep a upbeat and friendly attitude and perform excellent customer service. Multitasking is a huge skill you must have as well as a open availability. Management was always changing and so were the rules of how to maintain the sales floor. It was very hard to grasp the visual standards because it was always changing as well as operational and stock guidelines. The most enjoyable part were some of the customers and the people I have met as I grew in the company.
good,"Normally at sketchers we have small town customers that come in frequently,  we all have a close bond with our customers, we take our customers seriously and try in every way possible to make sure they walk out of the store with what they came for. I learned to take things In steps, to stay at a steady pace. So your able to do things right the first time without having to repeat the process. While that takes longer to accomplish you task. I respect all of my fellow managers while they take there jobs seriously as i do.  While i do love my job i still need a more advanced pay to live off of and a more steady and promising work schedule. I would like to be employeed at a stable company where i can advance in the future."
good,I was the assistant store manager at Skechers. I loved the shoes & the work but sadly the store closed.
good,it is great company to join for getting sales experience and learn about retail business and there is competitive atmosphere to make a person better day by day
good,Good it was a great work place and they made sure that your were trained 8j everything that you needed to be successful in the job and 5he work place.

good,good workplace and helps you learn in different ways. It is also good that managers on every department helps you gain experience on site and in office and develop skills that you already have.

good,Duties consist in offering a good costumer service. Helping the client in the shoe selecting process and promoting the company products. Keeping the store clean and organize. Maintaining a variety of shoes accessible in displays for the public. I learned to create good rapport with people. I also developed better sales skills. The management keep realistic goals for the employees and good standards. The culture at the store fun. The hardest part of the job I would say it's the extended hours during the holidays season. The most enjoyable part it's the fun environment and to be able to talk and assist a lot of different people from everywhere.
good,Skechers is pretty awesome to work for. They have great managers and great high management teams. It is a very cool and easy going place to work for. Plus the discount is really good!
good,"Everyday is a fun new day working at Skechers. The team I work along side is great to be around and enjoyable to work with, We get the job done no matter what, and we are very focused and alert. My manager is excellent and is overall a phenomenal person to work for. He tells us what mistakes we have made and how to fix them, shows us how to properly do shipment and place and move boxes around. The overall company is an amazing and great company to work with."
good,Working here was a very life changing event for me. I was able to be genuine to customers and the management I had was very effective and genuine as well. Would definitely work for them again.

Management was topnotch and professional. The job was easy because I personally did enjoy what I did and had a great relationship with my co-workers."
good,A fun exciting competitive environment where hard work is rewarded with you making your own salary by what you choose to sell to your customers.
good,"Personally, I love working at Skechers, it is probably my favorite of all the jobs I've had. I love my coworkers and my manager is great, also possibly the best manager I've ever worked for, or at the very least a close second. We have a great team and I truly like and enjoy working with all of my coworkers as well - it is a great job college job, or even a potential career with opportunities to move up."

good,"I enjoy working at Skecher's because its like a family. You show up and everyone always has a smile on their face. You do your job, while having fun. I started working here in May and have been promoted already. My manager is talking about promoting me to part time assistant manager, and I would love that. I love everything about this job."
good,great customer service. great vibe in workplace. great coworkers
good,"all employees are friendly and going out of their way to make the customers feel they are getting the attention they need in customer service.

good,"Beaucoup trop d‘injustice"
good,skechers management wasn't running to its full potential i feel the leader needed to take better control to have a smoother running store
good,"Skechers is a very well established company, working in one of the busiest locations was fun and also challenging. I learned great leadership skills as the store manager trusted me to be one of the youngest member of the manegement  team"
good,Management was great! The sales could be different. Same sale was there for over two years BOGO 1/2 off sale. Overall great environment and flexible company to work for.
good,5 Estrellas excelente ambiente de trabajo. Recomendado
good,I enjoy skechers but they need more training with their associates and the management team...it's a great store but they need to work on helping their customers a little more
good,Great management great staff loved working and recognizing my return customers that came back just for me and my knowledge. Great info on all products and accessories.
good,It was very funny to work there but the salary was not good enough.
good,the manager was fun and we had a lot of work to do there every single day and every Tuesdays we used to get shipments at 6:30 in the mornings so I had to go handle the shipments
good,"The store I worked at was amazing, I did love my boss and being a manager. The biggest problem is higher up: they hate promoting from within. It took 4 months for my promotion to go through, but they hired someone from the outside to be a manager and had her background check done in less than a week. The pay is okay, but hours are based on sales which isn't fun if you're in a low traffic area. Company's kinda cheap, too."
good,"expect too much in a short timely manner"
good,Skechers cares about its people and has a strong commitment to its company culture that is more than just a few bullets put on a wall or buried in a hiring booklet. I've enjoyed the achievement oriented environment that cares about its people. I have not worked in a better retail position than the one I had Skechers.
good,"always busy "
good,Great place to work except they had no Store Manager and that made it hard with a lot of different aspects. The schedule was not really consistent.
good,I had a great experience working for Skechers enjoyed all my bosses very friendly and kind enjoyed employees have worked with great teamwork definitely recommend Skechers
good,"Working at a warehouse store, there is always something to do from  refilling hash to changing window displays or hanging the newest line of work out clothes that just came out. The best part is the helping customers find the shoes that they desire or the shoe that will best help them with whatever work out or outfit they need. The selection in shoes is massive and even though a certain store may not have the shoe you want, they can always find a way to order them."
good,"Skechers is a great first job even if you want to stay there and move up in the company, or in high school and just need a part-time job. I have been working at Skechers for 2 years and I love whenever I go in. The most enjoyable part of my day is making peoples day."
good,I loved working for Skechers it was my favorite job I have ever had unfortunately for me the store I was working at was unable to give me the hours I needed I really tried to stick out as long as I could but being a parent I could no longer work just 10 hours a week this is a great company to work for a great job for students or if your just looking for a second job.
good,Had a GREAT Store Manager at Skechers. Most of the staff was self motivated and hard working. SM did not put up with gossip and drama which lead to easy work environment. Hands on training and trying on the merchandise is suggested.
good,This was a great job for me. It was all about product knowledge and how much you really learned about the brand and the type of shoes you were selling to a customer. I enjoyed walking a customer through every type of shoe that we carried and explaining the benefits the customer would receive for the shoe that they chose to wear. Selling shoes for Skecher's requires a lot of product knowledge and customer service.
good,easy to sell and be passionate about. Truly amazing customer service module - it does consist of long hours but you stay busy always something to do. Fantastic discount.
good,"It was just to get me started back in the swing of things once I moved back to town. Love working there, and left on really good terms. If I ever need a part time job again I will go back."
good,great place to be at as the team is always in sync and like any team there will be ups and downs aswe  welcome new people young and old. i love setting up other store locations as it gives me a great opportunity to learn new skills but also to help newer employees understand standards and why the company culture is important to learn and amazing to be a part of
good,It was Overall a great if job it opened up many opportunities for me in the work community. and for anyone looking to get a first job i would recommend working for this company
good,"Skechers USA is an amazing place to work. The atmosphere was always positive and filled with energy. "
good,gained my management experience from working here. maintaining the store for hours at a time. Making sure customers were being attended and staff were on their toes when we had visits. Enjoyed the conversations I have with the customers. Shipment was stressful especially during the winter.
good,"not a bad place to work."
good,"Fast paced environment "
good,Skechers is a great place to start off a career in retail. I've grown and learned to be a leader while gaining friendships in the process. Skechers wants to create a great atmosphere for its customers and also its employees. The hardest part of the job as a manager would be wondering if I did everything I could do to please my customers and knowing that the customer experience is a refection of my training and how I train employees. Of course any job would have its ups and downs but working at Skechers is definitely uplifting to say the least.
good,"I worked for a couple months but enjoyed every minute of it. I learned how to find certain shoes that customers need or wanted. I learned lost of things in the short amount of time i was employed. Since it was my first job i learned how to communicate better with customers. I learned how to provide great customer service. My co-worker were great people they would help in any questions or concerns i had. There was really nothing hard about that job at all. If i had to choose a hardest part of the job i would say my first couple of days i had trouble approaching customers, because like i said it was my first job and this was actually the job that should me how to provide great customer service i now use at my current job. Everyday i went to work was well enjoyed. It was a great work environment overall."
good,"It's a great place to work if you are wanting to start out. Not many chances for advancement, but when it does come up they hire within."
good,"Excellent place to work part time and if your willing to work hard and open up you availability,  there is a realistic opportunity for advancement & discounts."
good,Really enjoyable place to work overall. Targets and sale driven so not for a weak! If you're energetic and up for a challenge you will fit well. Amazing team and spirit. Unfortunately had to leave due to personal circumstances but I hope to be back for summer!
good,"Absolutely loved the company. They are fantasitic. Problem with management led to resignation. I would like to work for company again, but I am unabe to work there."
good,"On a a regular day of work I would be scheduled from am-pm. I usually worked on the weekends because I had school during the week which would be difficult to do both. I usually would work on the floor and help customers find the best fit shoe. Then I would have a short lunch break to and then get back to work. It was a very good job to work at, and everyone was very nice and fun to be around to make the job much better."
good,"Good team work and communication skills built whilst working to serve customers"
good,You help out customers by finding shoes or apparel. You stock shelves and clean the store. It very fun work place and I love working wth the people I work with.
good,"Very productive and fast paced work environment, constant business growth. Very goal oriented staff and management team. Consistently busy and properly staffed."
good,I learned  a lot from management training and overall its a very good work place i would recommend to anybody to work here a good starter job for minors.
good,Talking with customers about the product we provide. I have gained a lot of confidence. Management is well organized with a safety and cultural environment.
good,"I just started but I really like it so far. Great atmosphere, management is good, and the hours are alright. The hours can be long though and breaks are short."
good,I enjoyed going to work everyday and trying to sell customers shoes. I would help them pick out the shoes they wanted and if we didn't have their size on the floor i did everything i could to try and find the size they needed.
good,"Great place to start your experience in retail."
good,"Skechers has been a great place to work. With any growing company, there have been moments of stress. But through strong leadership and a clear mission Skechers has been an amazing place to work. The challenges are daily and varied and leave me satisfied. I have grown a lot working here and see a lot of potential for more in the future."
good,a typical day included dealing with customers on a personal basis having a great management team. backing you up and always teaching you new ways to approach a sale.
good,"A typical day starts for me at 6am..I head into the store with a crew and we clean the store, tag boxes, displays, stocking, but basically just get the store ready for opening time."
good,"I enjoyed working with the fellow employees. We worked well together and were like a family."
good,"Friendly environment"
good,Working at Skechers was another job experience that allowed myself to develop good customer services skill and help me come out of my comfort zone when engaging with others. It also was the first job that allowed me to advance into a management position within the company.
good,"Skechers is a one of a great sports brand. I really liked to work here . Here I learned allot . Like how can I convert customer , how can I make them come again , I always give importance to customers. Always ready to fullfil there needs . "
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y muy buenas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,"Would recommend as a part time job. Started off as floor associate then went to sales floor supervisor and was offered to interview for assistant manager all within a year. So great growth within the company. It was pretty laid back work, receiving, shifting shoes and clothes etc. Plus enjoyed the huge discounts on shoes. Only down side of Skechers was at times the lack of hours. Because hours are dependent on sales and if the store isn’t selling then we have no hours."
good,"Working with Skechers I definitely learned how to calculate daily, monthly and yearly sales. The in's and out's of how to sale and what to say to make sure you did sale. This also taught me how to be a great manager and get tasks done."
good,"tiene un grato ambiente laboral, la cual intensiva al empleado a poder desvolverse mejor"
good,"So far the biggest thing I've learned from working at Skechers is how to work on a team with everyone's cooperation to deliver results. A typical day includes assisting the all different customers that walk through the door with finding the perfect shoe that fits all their needs, It also includes maintaining a clean store and organized store along the way. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with situations that may come your way such as angry/rude customers but the most enjoyable part is a customer letting you know how much your help meant to them! A satisfied customer will keep coming back and will tell all their friends too."
good,"It was a great company to work for. I wish I never would have moved to Indiana. Every time I had a problem, they didn't hesitate to help me in any way they could."
good,Skechers was a very big store with many goals. It was very fast paced and you never had nothing to do. One of the reasons I left this job was the location.
good,"stock/refill shoes"
good,It was very nice to work there. Its atmosphere was good. There Management was friendly. Target Oriented atmosphere. Staff was friendly. Overall Experience was nice
good,"Company environment is good,management also good,working hours are same as everywhere,overtime policy also, "
good,"I love my time at Skechers. I've been able to grow into a different kind of manager, to make me more productive and proficient during my tenure. There were some great employees that I was able to train and develop."
good,All the employees got along. At Skechers i was able to develop my skills on selling.
good,"I learned a lot I started as a sale associate and worked my way up to an assistant manager. Learned how to to treat customers, how to work with others, how to deal  with money, how push product out the door(selling), how to deal with associates if they are not doing whats needed. Management was great learned a lot from my manager If I had a question she was there to answer it."
good,es muy divertido y facil de aprender
good,"Training and communication from upper management could use a little work. Work place can be stressful but manageable, very flexible when life gets in the way however upper management are very fair understanding when it comes to this. Plenty of benefits and praise when you do a good job. Little to no help when you are struggling."
good,"Skechers is a great company to work for. They are very understanding when it comes to personal problems and are willing to work with you to the best of their ability. The job itself can be very demanding when it comes to labor work. There's a lot of change, which keeps you busy and on your toes waiting for the next big thing. They expect a clean, upbeat, and friendly environment."
good,Everyone is so nice and helpful! The task are fairly simple and the team is overall great! And sometimes when we had large buyers they would buy us pizza or give us free gifts from good brands
good,Lucky to have a great team to work with! I have been able to make friendships that will last a life time. it is a fast pace environment especially on the weekends but overall a great place to work

good,"Working for the company and the location I was in, it allowed myself and other staff to interact with customers whom traveled across the world for conferences, vacation, etc. Understanding the features and benefits that shoes have also play a large role with our customers. In order for us to be successful in maximizing sales, we always received product information on new styles and shoes that were released so we can assist customers in picking shoes that best fit their needs. Also,being in a management position further allowed myself to understand how businesses can be successful and continue to strive each day. Since this location was in downtown, the workplace culture was always vibrant and positive. Interacting with people from around the world made the job fun and intriguing and also exciting to come into work each day because we never know whom we will interact with that day. This is a great company to work for who constantly allows us to learn new things each day and provide us with great resources and training tools to ensure we are successful in our role."

good,Skechers is a great company to build career skills. Skechers recognizes & rewards talent. Skechers constantly builds my work ethic.
good,Working in retail I learned that a happy Customer is a returning customer. Helping people everyday makes me feel like a better person. Seeing the smile on someone's face because excellent customer service was provided is what gets me through the day. No customer should leave anywhere unsatisfied and that is why I make sure that every customer I come in contact with as soon as they come through the door feels welcomed and happy to be in the environment. That is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Working at Skechers Shoe Company was easy and laid back. The environment made it very easy to become successful, and it was nice to work somewhere you actually enjoyed what you were doing.

good,it was a fun experience ot the greatest paying job good management great people great structure
good,I would usually sell sneakers and help customers with the choice of shoe they needed or wanted. I learned how to use the cash register and how to promote reward cards and credit cards. I think the hardest part was juggling 8-10 customers at once during black friday. I enjoyed everything there.
good,The company and management was great but there was no room for advancement and not enough hours to live off of.
good,You sell loads of shoes and the day flies by. The late hours are something to consider if you live far away. The organisation of the stockroom is very easy to learn and once you know it your job becomes simple.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Skechers. I have worn their shoes for decades. It's easy to sell their products when you believe in it! I could only work part-time, they were great with working with my disability. The management are great to work with, and do a wonderful job of working around you needing time off. Skechers has a wonderful employee discount as well."

good,"Skechers has been one of the companies that I can honestly say I was happy to work for.  They encouraged their employees and they promoted from within.  I honestly felt that if I performed well and let our mission guide us that I would be able to move up in the company quickly.  I also had an awesome manager, and was very lucky in that aspect."
good,"A typical day as a sales associate would be welcoming customers, and asking to see if they were looking for anything particular or just browsing. If they need help with any of the shoes we give them some knowledge on the shoes that they are interested in as well as give them some extra options. We offer to measure feet and run to the back to grab their sizes. I have grown as a person working for this company and learned a lot of knowledge on all types of skechers shoes that I did not have prior to working there. All of the staff there are so friendly and awesome to work with and the managers are so approachable."

good,I enjoy working for this company because it is a well known shoe brand that isn't sold in many shoe shops but is very very popular so we get very happy customers in the store which makes me happy.
good,"Absolutely, one of my favorite jobs ever. To excel in Skechers, you learn to be apart of a team because everyone needs help at some point, no matter how talented you are. While being a part of a fast paced sales floor, you also learn to take pride in your paycheck after each pay cycle due to the sales commission. Through each customer experience, you get to learn what features for each product benefits particular problem areas each customer might have like bunions, slip resistant, light weight for exercises, etc. Management gives the highest performers recognition which pushes everyone to continue progressing as sales people and team players. The hardest part of the job was language barriers, which was a minor hurdle. The most enjoyable part is getting to see your units per transactions, average dollar sale, and daily revenue for the store after each shift. The ability to see the numbers up close, allows you to figure out what you need to work on within yourself."
good,"I love working at Skechers for the simple reason that I learned more about running and managing a retail store. I learned my about payroll, scheduling, employee management, and how to operate more then one store at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to go back and forth between stores and getting to travel to management skill meetings and meeting with different managers and executives from the company."

good,"I really enjoy working at Skechers. We have a great team, the management are brilliant with keeping our spirits up - giving recognition when it's deserved and if you need to swap a shirt for any reason, they will work around you as much as possible. Sometimes the shop can be busy so you multi serve 4-6people at anytime but when you know what you're doing it becomes 2nd nature. It's not a job for the faint hearted, products change constantly so keeping up to date is a must."

The customers were very nice and the employees really cared about going the extra mile for the person they were helping.
good,"A typical day at work was floating around in between morning shipment, wallpapering the sales floor, straightening displays and apparel, exchanges, customer service, register and some mod duties. "
good,"Grato ambiente."
good,One of the most well managed companies I've seen and worked for. Staff is very friendly and strong believers in what they market and sell. Easy to move up in the company if mind is put to the goal  that is set.

The Hardest Part of the job is getting multiple shoes for customers.The most enjoyable would be seeing the customer buy the shoe. I've learned in retail you gotta be very nice, helpful, and have patient with them."
good,"Overall even though I was there for just a little over a year, it wasn't a hostile and distressing workplace. Managers were always maintaining the floor while keeping good positive relations with employees to create positive atmosphere. As of what i know i didn't have any enemies since i always was always ready to help and listen to simple request from co-workers. Within a year i was highly requested by the managers to potentially be a floor lead if i chose to head towards that route. Myself and only another co-worker were both offered the position amongst all the other sales associates. Our work productivity, ethics and readiness to assist co-workers and maintain the store was noticed. The only challenge of the job that caused me to leave was the need for higher pay to maintain house bills and school payment was a challenge on a minimum wage part-time job. Furthermore, as business excessively slowed down in the mall, taking the floor supervisor job still wouldn't be sufficient to maintain my expenses. If the mall traffic had not slowed down I would have stayed. I'm a kinesthetic person and not so much the type of person who can sit still in one area, like a cubicle, for hours. I need to use my hands and be active. The other job I enjoyed for the quality of work is my 3 year server job; which was active, hands on, customer service interactive, busy work, and quick thinking."
good,Skechers is a very good company and always makes you feel comfortable in your work environment. I have been in the company for 2 years now and am looking to explore my strengths to other companies I can possibly benefit from.
good,"A typical day would include, opening, briefing the team, setting daily budgets and incentives then focusing on customer service,"
good,"i learned a lot here in my previous company bescause im happy to communicate,to promote my product to the costumer i have no regret to this company"
good,"Working for Skechers USA has taught me valuable life long customer service skills that can be utilized for future job positions. This Skechers location was constantly busy due to being located in a popular shopping mall, so we were trained to work in a fast paced environment and making sure every customer leaves satisfied. Managers showed professional work ethics, fairness, and other employees were there to assist in any difficult situations. Every employee under management had specific job responsibilities, but store goals were met by every employee working together as a team."
good,"I learned everything on my own, I didn't have anyone sit down and train me, I got skipped a position and moved up in a year. Then got promoted to full time in another year.I start off my day if I open, by making sure we have all goals set for the day, individual and store wide. Focus the rest on my day on dealing with customer complaints and increasing sales."
good,De todos los trabajos que he tenido en este se me dio la oportunidad de crecer con un puesto gerencial en el cual aprendí mucho el ambiente era muy agradable
good,"Skechers is a very hands on job! You are there to make customers happy and to do that you must know your product. So keeping up with the new shoes and there performance is apart of our day.

good,The most friendly staff that encourage each other to succeed. Management is positive clean work environment fun place to work mainly because the staff make it fun. Easy to switch shifts every one covers for each other most of the time.
good,I loved this job! I loved absolutely everything about it. The people were friendly and it was easy to help them out. Shipments were a little insane but could be put away within 2-3 days. Finding shoes for someone was also surprisingly easy. Corporate wasn't to bad and my managers were simply awesome! I wish I had stayed there.
good,"I absolutely LOVED my job at Skechers! Only reason I had to quit is because I moved. But other than that, I'm sure I'd still be there! The workers are great! The store is always clean. And management is the BEST!! It's an overall really good environment to work in!"
good,"I would have to  clear all shoes off of sales floor and place them in the correct spot.

good,"Skechers is a the one stop shop for the entire family , growing at a alarming rate. Skechers hires only the best talent. They belive in developing within . Iv always took all opportunities in all aspects in training, weather it was Sales training or an HR class I would enroll."

good,Una empresa con un excelente ambiente de trabajo y oportunidades de crecimiento.
good,"A typical day at work consists of excellent customer service, cleaning up around the store, restocking shelves and repricing shoes. I have learned many things at Skechers such as, better communication, customer satisfaction, and product memorization. The management staff is very cooperative and understanding. They make you laugh at the most unexpected times. My co-workers are the same way, but everyone is a very hard worker at skechers and understands that we need to meet our stores goals as best as possible. I'd say the hardest part of my job would have to the physical aspect. Standing and working on concrete floors for the duration of my shift, as well as lifting heavy merchandise around the store. The Skechers shoes we are required to wear when we work though are amazing and help take a lot of stress off of our feet and backs while doing the job requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job would either have to be getting the customers a pair of shoes that is going to fit what they need, and seeing the happiness on their face when they feel how comfortable Skechers shoes are, or working with the amazing and crazy crew that is a part of my team."
